"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada1","Canada advanced climate action and remains committed to ambitious global action as United Nations Climate Change Conference concludes","December 16, 2019 Monday 11:14 AM Eastern Time","Canada NewsWire","MADRID, Dec.\~16, 2019 /CNW/ -\~Climate change is the defining issue of our time, and the Government of Canada is taking leadership to tackle it. That means doing the important work at home to cut pollution and create good jobs for Canadians. It also means working with international partners to ensure a sustainable future for the next generation. Over the past two weeks, Canada's strong team of negotiators and the Minister of Environment and Climate Change, the Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, showed leadership on climate action at COP25 and played an active role in negotiations, including on the international rules on carbon markets, under the Paris Agreement (also known as Article\~6). While Canada is pleased to see increased ambition and the launch of a new dialogue on oceans and climate in the decision, the negotiations on international markets will continue next year, in the hopes of reaching an ambitious resolution at COP26 in Glasgow. Indigenous Peoples particularly those in isolated or northern communities are disproportionately impacted by climate change. Canada called for rules to promote and protect human rights and the rights of Indigenous Peoples in activities that would occur under Article 6. We also actively promoted rules for the long-term environmental integrity of carbon markets. While a consensus was not reached on Article 6 in Madrid, discussions will continue into next year's negotiations. Canada remains determined to push\~for ambitious climate action and will participate in further negotiations to define the rules that will mobilize private-sector investment toward the global transition to a low-carbon economy. While at COP25 The Minister met with international counterparts, Indigenous leaders, young people, environmental organizations, and industry leaders. At a meeting with European Union Commissioner Frans Timmermans, he discussed the strong environmental partnership between Canada and the EU and their commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Minister Wilkinson met with fellow Canadian Mark Carney and congratulated him on his new position as UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance. He also\~met with German Minister Svenja Schulze, UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres,\~and other international counterparts and climate leaders, including Small Island Developing States, to continue to strengthen Canada's relationships on climate action. Canadian-led initiatives grew at COP25 , as Minister Wilkinson welcomed new endorsees of the Ocean Plastics Charter and new members of the Powering Past Coal Alliance. The Minister also announced investments through the World Bank to help developing countries design and implement carbon pricing in ways that will work for them. In Canada and across the world, work to phase out coal-power generation goes hand in hand with work to ensure the transition is a fair one for affected communities and people. While at COP25 , Minister Wilkinson participated in a Just Transition event including New Zealand, Germany, Spain, and Scotland led by the International Trade Union Confederation and the Canadian Labour Congress. Global momentum toward climate action continues to accelerate as more citizens advocate for bold climate solutions. Canada is working to ensure that the implementation of the Paris Agreement will cut emissions and create a clean and prosperous future for everyone. Canada was proud to be among the leaders who were advocating for important climate commitments that will reduce pollution, implement nature-based solutions, and create more jobs by accelerating clean growth. Quotes ""Science tells us and our citizens have told us that we need to not only meet our Paris target but exceed it. Canada came to COP25 in the spirit of compromise and commitment to action. While there were some successes, we are disappointed that the world was not able to agree on the rules for the international carbon markets that would help us all raise our ambition in Madrid. Canada will keep working with our global partners to land on effective rules for international markets at next year's COP. I am proud of Canada's contribution to the work at COP25 , including our commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Canada will\~continue to work towards meeting our Paris Agreement commitments at home and providing support to developing countries as they reduce emissions and adapt to the consequences of climate change."" \~The Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Quick facts While at COP25 COP25 , Canada and other countries also revised the UNFCCC Gender Action Plan to further advance women-led and gender-responsive climate action at national and multilateral levels\~and agreed to a work plan for the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada2","GOLDSTEIN: Taxpayers footing bill for farcical climate gabfests","May 28, 2020 Thursday","Toronto Sun","If insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results, we can accurately classify the Trudeau government's latest attendance at the annual United Nations Climate Change Conference , held in Madrid last December, as insane. Thanks to Blacklock's Reporter, we now know it cost Canadian taxpayers at least $683,278, or $4,745 per person, (the bills are still coming in) for air fare, food, lodging, hospitality and ground transportation (there's no detail on liquor expenses). This to send 144 Canadian delegates to what's formally known as the 25th annual UN Conference of the Parties on climate change, or COP 25 , which ran from Dec. 2-15 (the longest one, ever) in 2019. Blacklock's Reporter noted that while the federal environment department wouldn't release a final list of Canadian delegates, a preliminary one included ""13 federal policy analysts, four deputy and assistant deputy ministers, for spokespeople, two chauffeurs and two (lawyers)."" What Canadian taxpayers got for their money was abject failure, which has been the history of these annual UN climate gabfests back to the first one in Berlin, Germany in 1995. They've since been held annually in pretty much every vacation hotspot on the planet - Geneva, Buenos Aires, Bali, Cancun, Copenhagen, Lima, Paris and Marrakech to name just a few. Every year thousands of politicians, bureaucrats, lobby groups, environmental protesters and hangers-on do the same thing at these UN-orchestrated festivals of hot air, generating enough greenhouse gases to make a farce of their never-ending, never-fulfilled pledges for a cleaner planet. EDITORIAL: No, we don't need climate lockdowns( HYPERLINK https://torontosun.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-no-we-dont-need-climate-lockdowns https://torontosun.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-no-we-dont-need-climate-lockdowns ) GOLDSTEIN: We gambled on the wrong threat - climate change( HYPERLINK https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/goldstein-we-gambled-on-the-wrong-threat-climate-change https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/goldstein-we-gambled-on-the-wrong-threat-climate-change ) So how did the Madrid conference - which featured Greta Thunberg - end? Federal Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson, who headed Canada's delegation, said he was ""disappointed the world was not able to agree on the rules for international carbon markets that would help us all raise our ambition in Madrid."" He was being too kind. Reporting on the annual UN conference, the New Scientist said, "" COP25 climate summit ends in 'staggering failure of leadership.'"" The Economist said, "" COP25 , the UN climate talks in Madrid, ends in a sad splutter: No agreement on international carbon markets; only weak commitments to more drastic cuts in emissions."" Forbes called it a ""Failure in Madrid as COP 25 Climate Summit ends in Disarray."" UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was ""disappointed ... the international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis."" COP 25 President Carolina Schmidt, Chile's environment minister, concluded ""the consensus is still not there to increase ambition to the levels that we need."" The reality is that year after year - there will be a brief pause this year because of the worldwide economic crash caused by the COVID-19 pandemic - global industrial greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, despite the UN's never-ending warnings they have to decrease by 7.6% annually every year for the next 10 to avert catastrophic human-induced climate change. The problem is that the people in charge of these annual climate farces - high-flying UN bureaucrats, politicians and their courtiers - aren't the solution to the problem. They're the problem because of their hypocrisy in demanding everyone else must lower their standard of living to save the planet, while adamantly refusing to do so themselves. Indeed, if they actually believed humanity faces an existential threat from climate change, they would have abandoned these annual UN meetings, which are themselves obscene monuments to excessive consumption, decades ago.

But what a few months it has been. The teens recently returned from Cop25 \'e2\€  a United Nations climate change conference held in Madrid \'e2\€  having screened their documentary to attendees from around the world. The film shows the impact climate change is having on the teens' hometown, where issues like coastal erosion are so dramatic the hamlet is preparing for relocation. ""They really showed concern,"" said Tuk TV's Carmen Kuptana. ""Their eyes opened up when they saw what was happening to our land, and how young kids were really concerned about what was happening."" Four teen filmmakers from Tuktoyaktuk attended the conference. Next to 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg, they were the youngest delegates in attendance \'e2\€  something Kuptana thought was ""really cool."" Kuptana said she really liked showing their culture, and what is at stake for them with climate change. ""The elders noticed changes ... but they didn't know it was climate change,"" she said. ""It's about our future as well."" The experience was also empowering for Kuptana, who said it helped her ""grow as a person and a leader."" ""I'm not afraid to say what I want to say anymore."" Longer doc in the works She applied for a grant that covered the cost of filming equipment and allowed her to hire producer Jaro Malanowski to lead a film workshop and guide the students through making a documentary. About 10 teens are part of the group, along with a Tuk TV junior group made up of younger students. Malanowski attended COP25 with the students, and said it was amazing to see the impact they had. ""I think at the end of the day, story is most important,"" he said. ""We want to make sure that the youth's stories, and their voices, are represented."" The 22-minute film proved to be a hit. The group was originally asked to screen the film twice, but it ended up being shown a total of seven times. But the film isn't a finished project just yet. With COP25 behind them, Tuk TV is planning on expanding the documentary into a full-length picture. Malanowski said the second half of the film will focus on solutions. ""What can be done at a community level and Arctic level, but also to explore what is happening to other countries and other places."" The teens are also hoping to travel to another Indigenous community to show the impacts climate change is having there. Malanowski said the group made connections with people from around the world at the conference and interviewed several of them for the documentary, including Catherine Stewart, Canada's chief negotiator for climate change. The experience was transformative for 19-year-old Nathan Kuptana, the oldest member of the group, who's hoping to produce a documentary on microplastics. ""I'd like to do more of this kind of stuff,"" he said. "" Filming, screening and teaching younger kids, seeing if they have an interest in the film industry like I did."" More than anything, Kuptana is hoping Happening to Us makes an impact. ""Hopefully the leaders can take action now on climate change. That's my hope, [that] that will happen really quickly and not later, because if we don't act now, it will be too late."" \"

Von der Leyen has set high targets in the European Union's policy to combat climate change, pledging to reduce the bloc's carbon emissions by at least 50% by 2030. On Sunday, her first day at the helm, she repeated to journalists her objective to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050, meaning carbon emissions should be fully offset by measures that cut CO2, like planting trees. Emphasizing the importance of the ""Green Deal,"" she will be in Madrid on Monday for the opening of the United Nations climate change conference , known formally as COP25 . That will be followed by legislative proposals from the Commission, expected on Dec. 11, aimed at turning her targets into legal texts that will need to be approved by EU states and lawmakers . Her foreign policy priorities have so far been less clear. ""On Friday, I am going to do my first trip outside the EU. That will be to Africa,"" von der Leyen told reporters, in another symbolic move meant to show Europe's increased focus on the continent. The EU is a major trading partner with, and aid donor to, African countries. It has promised more investment to the continent to better tap its economic potential and stem the flow of African economic migrants who attempt perilous crossings of the Mediterranean to reach Europe. Von der Leyen said she would go to Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, to meet Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in October, and President Sahle-Work Zewde, the only woman to hold such a position in Africa. She will also meet Moussa Faki, the chairman of the African Union Commission, which has its headquarters in Addis Ababa.

Among the focus areas up for discussion are Indigenous peoples and gender. ""NWAC's presence at COP25 is crucial. We have been, and continue to be, very engaged in climate action at both the domestic and international levels, as well as advancing gender balance and ensuring the voices of Indigenous women are heard in international discussions on climate change,"" says President Lorraine Whitman. On the domestic front, NWAC conducts research and provides policy papers to the federal government on matters related to renewable energies and the need for increased representation of Indigenous women in low-carbon economic sectors. ""We have been advocating for a number of environment-related issues, including the need to regulate toxic substances, which have cumulative effects on Indigenous women and children,"" says Lynne Groulx, NWAC CEO. To enhance its input on environmental files, NWAC is developing a low-carbon toolkit for Indigenous women who want to start or grow businesses that contribute to climate change mitigation and/or adaptation. NWAC is also making a strong, visible presence internationally - participating in meetings held under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Through these international forums, NWAC advocates for the rights and interests of Indigenous women as they relate to the environment in general and climate change in particular. As an example, by contributing to the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform, NWAC is able to advance gender balance and ensure the voices of Indigenous women are heard in international discussions on climate change. ""Climate change affects all humankind. When taking action to address this important issue, the respective obligations on the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities must be respected, promoted and considered. After all, Indigenous people are stewards of the land, and Indigenous women are the life-givers and caretakers of all life,"" says President Whitman.

This update follows the filing, on November 29, of its financial statements (""3Q Statements"") and Management Discussion and Analysis (the ""3Q MD&A"") of its financial and operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019. OPERATING AND CORPORATE HIGHLIGHTS: SUBSEQUENT EVENTS TO 3Q 19 Sigma's Chief Strategy Officer Speaks at World Climate Summit during the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP 25 in Madrid about ""Leadership in Responsible Mining"".  Sigma Lithium is pleased to announce today that Ana Cabral-Gardner, Chief Strategy Officer presented at the World Climate Summit during the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP 25 on the panel covering the theme of ""Leadership in responsible mining - mitigating the impacts of resource extraction"" on November 8, in Madrid.  She discussed the case study of Sigma as an ESG ""green lithium"" company and the role played by Sigma's investors in providing the capital and the leadership to drive implementation of environmental and social best practices. Ms Cabral-Gardner highlighted how these key issues are part of a broader movement spearheaded by ethical and ESG-focused investors driving sweeping changes in practices across the mining industry as a whole.  Excerpts from Ms Cabral-Gardner's speech include:  ""In this [EV] industry a paradigm is being broken [from the ICE days], whereby now 'upstream matters' and therefore, upstream practices matter too. So ultimately, in the very last step of the value chain...the OEM hears this [message from the consumer], because they are tuned into what their customer wants. So there is a ""push for provenance"" in battery materials, and at Sigma we sense that in the contracts [for lithium offtakes]. Sigma is in binding offtake discussions with some of the EV industry leading participants in great part because of the [differentiation] of the ""green lithium' Sigma is 100% hydro, it is 100% environmentally conformed to dry stacking and other best practices. So even though the green price differentiation hasn't yet happened in metals and it isn't expected, it has been translated into displacement value: you get the best contracts, you get to sell the big volumes...""  ""Sigma produces environmentally sustainable high-quality high-grade lithium concentrate from its pilot plant on site in Brazil... and the Company has some of the world's largest and richest deposits of spodumene ore... and we set out to develop it since the very beginning six years ago as an ESG green mining case study, pioneering amongst lithium companies ... and we did that by focusing 15% of the capex towards always keeping up with best environmental practices [management and rehabilitation] and obviously focusing on the way [electric] power was sourced to beneficiate the material [lithium].""  ""Four examples of actions include dry-stacking tailings management from inception at the pilot plant to investing in water recirculation equipment that would lead the company to recycle 90% of the water...so there is an enormous focus on water efficiency. And then there is energy efficiency, 100% of the energy is green, power is sourced from hydro.""  ""More importantly there is the ""S"" in ESG, the Company works in a region with the second-lowest IDH [index of human development] in Brazil and one of the lowest in the world... So [Sigma] is transformational as we become the largest investor by a factor of 20x in the region with massive social impact. This has been our mission and just demonstrates that with the right purpose and the right will we can become a great example even though we are a relatively small mining company on a small budget.  But why? Because being in battery materials... the purpose of that value chain is to decarbonize at the ""mobility-end"" of the value chain. So if we do not behave accordingly by being 100% green and by powering the energy with 100% green energy and enforcing those practices all along, we would not be a sustainable member of that [EV] value chain. Signs a CAD6.6 million Revolving Credit Facility with A10 Investimentos to Meet ESG Goals and Further Advance Second Deposit into Pre-Feasibility.  A10 Investimentos and its affiliates (""A10 Group"") continues to support Sigma in meeting its development and construction timetable as well as strategic environmental and social ESG goals. On November 29, A10 Group provided Sigma with a CAD6.6 million (USD5 million) senior unsecured revolving credit facility to complete the pre-feasibility study for the Barreiro deposit, to meet the current social-economic obligations under the environmental licensing as well as for general corporate purposes. The facility bears interest at 11% per annum (calculated in US Dollars from the day funds are drawn) and it has a one-year term, which is the maturity day for all funds drawn, if any. Each disbursement under the facility is subject to A10 Group's approval.  This credit facility is a related party transaction for Sigma for purposes of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 (""MI 61-101"") and Policy 5.9 of the TSX Venture Exchange (which incorporates by reference MI 61-101) because Ana Cabral-Gardner, Marcelo Paiva and Anna Hartley are officers and/or directors of Sigma as well as principals of the A10 Group. In accordance with applicable law, the credit facility agreement was reviewed and unanimously approved by the directors of Sigma other than those related to the A10 Group. The credit facility, which is not convertible into securities of Sigma, is exempt from the formal valuation and minority approval requirements under MI 61-101 because the fair market value of the transaction is below 25% of Sigma's market capitalization. It is also exempt from the minority approval requirements under MI 61-101 because the facility is on reasonable commercial terms and is not convertible into securities of Sigma  Selection of Global Engineering Contractor for Construction of Plant on a 'Lump Sum Turnkey Basis' Capped by a Gross Maximum Price  Sigma invited global engineering firms to conduct due diligence and submit proposals for engineering and procurement services for the construction of the commercial production plant (the ""Plant"") and the production complex. The Plant will be based on the design prepared by Primero Group Ltd for the FS Technical Report (as defined below) for the Xuxa Deposit, supporting a 1.5 Mtpa lithium concentrate processing operation with an output capacity of approximately 220,000 tonnes per year.  Sigma requested that the construction costs described in the proposals be fixed price lump sum turnkey not exceeding a gross maximum price to be determined following due diligence. By securing the EPC contacts as gross maximum price, Sigma is seeking to manage the capex budget during construction, and thus, avoid the risk of cost overruns.  Due to Primero Group's previous experience in building similar lithium processing plants in Western Australia, as well as the depth of analysis conducted to prepare the Plant design in the FS Technical Report, Sigma believes the gross maximum price proposals will be in line with the capital expenditures outlined in the FS Technical Report. Barreiro Pre-Feasibility Study, Project Financing and Capital Structure  Pre-Feasibility Barreiro: Sigma continues its pre-feasibility study for the Barreiro deposit. Subject to completion of all related feasibility studies and assessments, Sigma aims to increase Project production capacity of high-quality battery-grade 6% lithium concentrate to 440,000 tonnes per year from an initial 220,000 tonnes.  Project Financing and Capital Structure: Sigma expanded the group of financial institutions involved in the discussions of project financing to five commercial banks, one Brazilian development bank and one international development bank. The Company is actively engaged in structuring the debt and equity financing package for the construction of the Plant targeting a cost-effective and optimized capital structure that matches the risk and ESG profile of the Project.  Feasibility Study of Xuxa Deposit and Plant: On November 7th, 2019 Sigma filed its National Instrument 43-101 technical report on the feasibility study on the Xuxa deposit (the ""FS Technical Report""), which is dated October 18 2019 and has an effective date of September 16 2019, on SEDAR. The FS Technical Report (titled ""Grota do Cirilo Lithium Project, Aracuai and Itinga Regions, Minas Gerais, Brazil, National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report on Feasibility Study Final Report"") supports an average annual production for 9.2 years of 220,000 tonnes of coarse green and high-quality battery grade 6% lithium concentrate (""Lithium Concentrate"") at the Xuxa deposit and Plant with projected cash operating costs of US$ 238 per tonne of Lithium Concentrate (cash cost CIF China of US$ 342 per tonne of Lithium Concentrate), among the lowest costs globally. The FS Technical Report positive results projected for the Xuxa deposit an after tax NPV of US$ 249 million, an IRR of 43%, payback period of 3.1 years and a Capex of US$ 98.4 million. The positive economics of the FS Technical Report provides a strong platform for Sigma to continue to develop its extensive mineral properties, which include nine past-producing lithium mines. THIRD-QUARTER FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS This section should be read in conjunction with the Q3 Statements and the Q3 MD&A, which are available on the Company's website and SEDAR. Selected consolidated financial information is presented as follows: //st (In CAD million, 3Q 2019 3Q 2018 9M 2019 9M 2018 except per share information) Total assets 20.24 18.02 20.24 18.02 Exploration and 17.44 7.77 17.44 7.77 evaluation assets Cash and cash 1.50 9.44 1.50 9.44 equivalents Working capital (4.21 ) 5.66 (4.21 ) 5.66 Total liabilities 11.55 6.41 11.55 6.41 Shareholders' 8.69 11.62 8.69 11.62 equity General and 1.01 2.33 3.71 6.06 administrative expenses Net income/(loss) (1.99 ) (3.16 ) (4.86 ) (11.33 ) for the period Basic and fully (0.02 ) (0.04 ) (0.07 ) (0.27 ) diluted income/(loss) per share  Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2019 was a loss of CAD1.99 million, which declined from a loss of CAD3.16 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018. The improvement was mainly due to a 57% year-on-year fall in general and administrative expenses driven by a reduction in corporate support costs and personnel in Brazil following the FS completion. The Company continues to assess these costs to ensure that cost-effective choices are being made.  Exploration and evaluation assets were up by 124% on a year-on-year basis to CAD 17.44 million as of September 30 2019. The increase reflects mostly the completion of a substantial drilling programme undertaken at Sigma's Grota do Cirilo property, which more than tripled the amount of measured and indicated mineral resources to 45.7 million tonnes as discussed in the Company's press release dated January 10th, 2019.  The Company does not generate cash from mining operations. During the nine months ended September 30th, 2019, the Company received a Pre-Payment from Mitsui &Co. Ltd. (""Mitsui"") in the amount of CAD 4,007,100 (US$3,000,000). In addition, broker warrants were exercised providing cash proceeds of CAD 137,695. The Company's aggregate operating, investing and financing activities during the nine months ended September 30th, 2019 resulted in a net cash and cash equivalents position of CAD 1,503,303 and a negative working capital of CAD 4,214,713.  The rise in total liabilities from CAD6.41 million as of September 30th, 2018 to CAD 11.55 million as of September 30th, 2019 was mostly due to the addition of CAD4.01 million (USD 3.00 million) in deferred revenue, which corresponds to an initial tranche of a Pre-Payment made by Mitsui &Co. Ltd. of Japan, which is part of a USD 30 million Pre-Payment facility agreed in exchange for production offtake rights, as outlined in Sigma's press release dated April 5 2019.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada11","Kathryn Harrison: Why all the fuss about Article 6 at COP-25?","December 4, 2019 Wednesday","Postmedia Breaking News","With more than 10,000 delegates from almost 200 countries, dozens of panels daily, and countless government, NGO, and business pavilions, there's a lot to do at the international climate conference currently underway in Madrid. With so many options, one might wonder why Tuesday afternoon saw several hundred people jammed into a hot room for a three-hour meeting of the ""Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technical Advice Contact Group on Article 6."" Although the Paris Agreement established goals and broad strategies to meet them, further guidance is necessary to determine how it all will work in practice. Most elements of the so-called Paris ""rulebook"" were completed at the international climate negotiations, COP-24, last year. However, in light of remaining disagreement, the rules for Article 6 alone were deferred to COP-25 in Madrid this year. Article 6 is the section of the Paris Agreement that authorizes international emissions trading. Section 6.2 envisions government-to-government trades, by which one country could meet its reduction target in part by paying another country to make extra reductions beyond its own target. Section 6.4 offers a mechanism for the private sector to go ""above and beyond"" to earn emissions reduction credits that can then be sold to other private actors or governments. Article 6 holds the potential to make or break the Paris Agreement. At best, by providing a mechanism to meet targets at a much lower cost, Article 6 could inspire countries to increase the ambition of their national targets. At worst, weak rules for Article 6 will encourage violation of human rights and authorize illegitimate reductions that merely give the illusion of progress. Which vision will prevail turns on how several key issues are resolved in the days to come. Additionality The most fundamental issue in certifying reduction credits is to demonstrate that the activities in question would not have happened anyway, a standard referred to as ""additionality."" While that sounds obvious, it's tough in practice. For instance, as the price of renewable energy falls, projects that once seemed cutting edge can suddenly pay for themselves. Credit for extra action is no longer warranted. The challenge is to devise rules that allow outsiders to assess what is truly additional. Carry-forward of Kyoto Protocol credits The additionality question is closely related to a debate over carry-forward of unused Kyoto Protocol credits. The predecessor to the Paris Agreement first established emissions trading both between countries and through investment in private projects. There are, however, serious concerns about the legitimacy of many of the resulting credits. In some cases, countries such as Australia accumulated surplus credits simply by setting unambitious targets up front. Similarly, some projects are believed to have gamed the system, for instance by temporarily increasing production to justify credits when emissions were later reduced simply by cutting production. Some analysts estimate that there are upwards of 20 billion tonnes of unused Kyoto credits. Given their questionable legitimacy, allowing signatories to the Paris Agreement to meet their obligations with ""hot air"" Kyoto credits could greatly undermine already halting progress toward global climate goals. Double counting Article 6 specifies that in emissions trading there should be a ""corresponding adjustment"" so that the same emissions reduction cannot be counted simultaneously toward two countries' compliance. Again, that sounds obvious. It's not a trade if the same reduction appears on both countries' ledgers. Yet there is continuing disagreement over which reductions require such an accounting, and whether adjustments should be mandatory or voluntary. ""Overall Mitigation in Global Emissions"" The Paris Agreement states that trading in carbon markets should ensure ""overall mitigation in global emissions."" That suggests going beyond merely offsetting one party's reduction with an equal, if less costly, reduction by another party. However, some argue that realization of cost savings itself will promote increasing ambition. Others are proposing that a fraction of credits be cancelled with each trade. Human rights Kyoto Protocol experience also has revealed potential negative impacts of emissions trading on Indigenous and other local communities, for instance when forests where they live or on which they rely for their livelihoods are designated ""off limits"" as part of an emissions credit swap. NGOs, Indigenous peoples, and some countries are pushing for explicit recognition of human rights in the Article 6 rulebook, but they face strong resistance from other countries. The stakes could not be higher, yet with 10 days to go in COP-25 , negotiators remain a long way from agreement. The countries most vulnerable to climate change, including low-lying island states and least developed countries, are pressing for strong rules to ensure environmental integrity, no carry-forward of Kyoto credits, and retirement of a fraction of credits with each trade. However, countries that surpassed their Kyoto targets or hold unclaimed project-specific credits hope to retain those potentially valuable credits, while Brazil is leading a group arguing for a voluntary approach to fight double counting. What are the implications for Canada? Stay tuned for my next instalment from # COP25 in Madrid!

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada12","Countries at COP25 fail to reach deal on carbon market rules","December 23, 2019","SNL Canada Energy Week","After more than two weeks of negotiations, delegates from more than 190 countries went home Dec. 15 without reaching an agreement on how to account for carbon reductions and markets under the Paris Agreement on climate change. Expressing disappointment with the lack of concrete progress at COP25 , U.N. Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres said in a statement, ""The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis."" Experts tracking the climate talks heading into the event indicated that properly designed carbon market mechanisms would be critical to ensuring that countries collectively reduce total global greenhouse gas emissions and avoid double-counting reductions. Parties to the Paris accord, which aims to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius relative to preindustrial levels, have collectively listed carbon markets as one means of achieving 51% of their combined pledges, according to the World Resources Institute. Andres Landerretche, COP25 coordinator for the presidency overseeing the negotiations, indicated at a Dec. 13 news briefing that the talks were falling apart. ""These negotiations have always been very, very difficult. ... At the end of the day, there are some groups that are asking for more financing, which is fair in order for them to move forward with their adaptation plans."" The formal name of COP25 is the 25th annual session of the Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. The next session, COP26, is scheduled for November 2020 in the U.K. In addition to once again attempting to resolve carbon market issues, a number of countries have a deadline under their pledge in the Paris accord to release plans by the end of 2020 for raising their carbon-cutting ambitions. Scientists have indicated that the world will need to act quickly to curb annual emissions levels by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 to achieve the goals of the accord, but global emissions thus far have continued to climb and reports have indicated that current ambitions of countries fall far short of the goal. The EU separately fell short of getting get all EU members, Poland specifically, to agree to be carbon neutral by 2050. Poland gets the vast majority of its power from coal-fired generation. But the EU leaders expressed hope of convincing Poland to agree to the target. President Donald Trump recently started the process of pulling the U.S. from the Paris accord. \"
"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada13","First Nations youth protest proposed massive oilsands mine at UN climate conference","December 10, 2019 Tuesday 2:04 PM GMT","CBC News","First Nations youth from Canada are at a United Nations climate change conference The provincial government of Alberta and the federal government are considering approval for what would be one of the largest oilsands open pits ever built. ""This is taking us in the wrong direction,"" said Eriel Deranger, executive director of Indigenous Climate Action (ICA) and a member of the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation in Alberta. ICA is an Indigenous-led organization that doesn't accept funding from corporate or government sources. It runs based on individual donations. Since 1995, world leaders have come together annually at the Convention of the Parties (COP) to negotiate how to address the global crisis of climate change. The Paris Agreement, signed in 2016, aims to keep global temperature increases within two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels to reduce the risk and impacts of climate change. This year the focus is finalizing the agreements around Article 6 of the Paris Agreement that would allow countries to work together in lowering greenhouse gas emissions through carbon-friendly technology and carbon markets, which allow for emissions trading between countries to meet climate targets. The goals of ICA's demonstrations at COP25 are to bring attention to the extraction industry in Canada and lobby for recognition of Indigenous rights in climate change negotiations while bringing Indigenous-led solutions to climate change forward. Proposed mine located near national park Teck Resources' proposed Frontier project would be 292 square kilometres, one of the largest oilsands mines to date. At full capacity, the Frontier project would extract 260,000 barrels of bitumen a day. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, clay, water and bitumen, which has to be extracted before it is refined into synthetic crude oil. In open mines, such as Frontier, large shovels scoop oil sands into trucks which then is dumped into crushers to process large chunks of earth. Once the sand is crushed, hot water is added to the sand then the mixture is pumped to an extraction plant through pipelines for further refining. The operation would be located 100 km north of Fort McMurray \'e2\€  17 km from Poplar Point First Nation and 30 km from the boundary of Wood Buffalo National Park, a UNESCO world heritage site. It's estimated the project will employ up to 7,000 people during peak construction and 2,500 people throughout operations. It's estimated that the mine will contribute $55 billion in provincial royalties and taxes and $12 billion in federal income and capital taxes. Emissions a concern According to the Pembina Institute, the Frontier project would contribute six megatonnes of carbon emissions annually. ""The biggest thing why this is so relevant in the climate negotiations is this project will create six megatonnes of emissions annually and has a life cycle of over 40 years,"" Deranger said. ""We're talking about setting emissions caps, and in our country we're talking about truth and reconciliation with Indigenous communities. We're talking about conservation and protecting the last remaining biodiverse regions of the world. And this project violates every single commitment Canada has made."" In 2016, Alberta set an emissions cap on oilsands operations of 100 megatonnes annually. The Pembina Institute estimated oilsands emissions at 77 megatonnes in 2018. ""We want to remind the Canadian government of their responsibility to stolen lands, and remind the world that climate change is not just a random phenomenon, it is the result of a destructive colonial relationship with the natural world,"" said Ta'kaiya Blaney who is an ICA Indigenous Youth Delegate and member of Tla A'min Nation located along the southwest B.C. coast. ""Climate change is a colonial problem and to successfully fight climate change we need Indigenous rights. We need Indigenous sovereignty and Indigenous solutions."" In an emailed statement to CBC News, a spokesperson for Tech Resources said ""the regulatory submission for Frontier was the most detailed and comprehensive in oil sands history, incorporating extensive environmental and social data, and more than a decade of community engagement."" Teck has agreements with 14 Indigenous communities within the project area including Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation, Mikisew Cree First Nation and Fort McKay First Nation. Teck said these agreements set a framework for co-operation in environmental stewardship and economic opportunities. Teck said 90 per cent of the water used in processing will be recycled, greenhouse gas emissions will be half of the oil sands industry average and that land reclamation of affected areas will begin as soon as active mining is complete. COP25 meetings continue until Friday. \"

""As Canada's new Minister of Environment and Climate Change, I am pleased to be here. My predecessor, Catherine McKenna, built important partnerships with many of you, and I look forward to strengthening those relationships and building new ones.In my previous role as Canada's Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard, I saw the impacts of climate change on our oceans. ""In British Columbia, my home, we see it in what's happening to wild Pacific salmon stocks. Each year yields less, meaning less food for Indigenous communities, less income for fishers, and less biodiversity in our ecosystem. ""Lives are being impacted. Last year, heatwaves took the lives of almost a hundred. Forest fires devastated Canada's West, driving thousands from their homes. Expert Canadian scientists recently released a report that showed Canada is warming at twice the global rate, and, in our North, its three times. We've all seen the reports about the potential of an ice-free Arctic. In August, I joined Prime Minister Trudeau, in Nunavut, to declare interim protection of Tuvaijuittuq (Tu-vai-you-ee-tuq), protecting Canada's High Arctic and northern animals. ""Climate change is a defining issue of our time and one of the reasons I entered politics. Before this, I ran clean-technology companies.

""As Canada's new Minister of Environment and Climate Change, I am pleased to be here. My predecessor, Catherine McKenna, built important partnerships with many of you, and I look forward to strengthening those relationships and building new ones. ""In my previous role as Canada's Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard, I saw the impacts of climate change on our oceans.

Each year, numbers are declining meaning less food for Indigenous communities, less income for fish harvesters, and less biodiversity in our ecosystem. ""Lives are being impacted. Last year, forest fires devastated Canada's West, driving thousands from their homes. Canadian scientists recently released a report that showed Canada is warming at twice the global rate, and, in our North, it's three times. We've all seen the reports about the potential of an ice-free Arctic. In August, I joined Prime Minister Trudeau, in Nunavut, to declare interim protection of Tuvaijuittuq (Tu-vai-you-ee-tuq), protecting Canada's High Arctic. ""Climate change is a defining issue of our time and the main reason why I entered politics. Before this, I ran clean-technology companies. I am optimistic about technology's potential to help us make deep cuts to carbon emissions, carve new paths to prosperity, and create jobs. Canada is ready to be among the leaders in this global economic shift. ""In October, Canadians re-elected our government with a mandate to take ambitious climate action. Last year, we enacted a price on pollution, and many said, at the time, that the political risk was too high.

At this moment, global representatives are gathering at the 25th HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/cop25 Conference of the Parties COP25 ) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Madrid to discuss immediate steps in halting further climate crisis. Only a few weeks before COP25 , a new set of HYPERLINK https://350.org/the-science-is-screaming-how-dare-you-ignore-it/ alarming reports were released In September, Greta Thunberg joined environmental activist and writer George Monbiot to produce a video, HYPERLINK https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0B6AxeVNY8 #NatureNow , to raise the potential of \~ HYPERLINK https://www.iucn.org/commissions/commission-ecosystem-management/our-work/nature-based-solutions nature-based solutions Thunberg and Monbiot rightly recognize that expenditures on HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/18/fossil-fuel-companies-getting-10m-a-minute-in-subsidies-says-imf global fossil fuel subsidies While the need for urgent action is clear, we must be vigilant to the ways in which ""solutions"" get proposed and to whose interests are favoured over others. The solutions proposed at COP25 must reflect the demands of people. It is not clear that this is the case. For instance, the conference was meant to take place in Santiago, Chile, but was diverted to Madrid to avoid the nationwide strikes against economic policies that benefit the very rich at the expense of the majority. These same economic policies are responsible for ecological destruction. The stakes are high and time is running thin to fail to connect these issues. The devil is in the details As a group of researchers and practitioners who are deeply committed to exploring how nature-based solutions get implemented on the ground, we want to draw attention to some of the silences in Thunberg and Monbiot's video. While we cannot emphasize enough that our intervention here aims to build further on their energy and efforts, we do think it is crucial to ask important questions that all too often tend to be overlooked. Instead of furthering a ""we are all in the same boat"" rhetoric, we've got to address the deeply political issues of who wins, who loses and whose natures are being talked about when nature-based solutions are proposed. Read more: More than carbon taxes, we need wholescale energy transitions Transformational change must instead be rooted in environmental justice, emphasizing the intersections of nature conservation with migrant justice, bottom-up community-driven approaches to conservation and the recognition of land rights. Sixteen-year-old Isra Hirsi, for instance, reminds us that HYPERLINK https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/a357wp/isra-hirsi-ilhan-omar-daughter-climate-strike-profile climate advocacy has less to do with nature characterized as ""a deep love for the great outdoors"" and more to do with standing in support of communities whose air and water are being poisoned. For meaningful change to happen, we must not allow business-as-usual with a greener face to co-opt the voices for change on the streets. Protect what and for whom? Thunberg and Monbiot say that nature-based solutions can only work if we leave fossil fuels in the ground. They are, of course, absolutely right. But what happens to people that live where nature-based solutions are being suggested? For many people, nature is more than a tool or a collection of trees that suck carbon dioxide out of the air. The livelihoods of people are as much a part of forests as the insect drone and the tree canopy. We need to break from conceptions of pristine nature and make it clear and unambiguous that environments are formed by people shaping nature in ways that reflect their ways of living. Without questioning the necessity of endless economic growth, nature simply becomes a new source of extractive wealth, in which biodiversity and investment in nature conservation become big business, strategically employed in elaborate HYPERLINK https://www.ft.com/content/7cfe2c70-ff41-30c9-bb32-512dbe216f48 public relation ploys Read more: Greta Thunberg's radical climate change fairy tale is exactly the story we need Similarly, HYPERLINK putting monetary values on nature HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/06/price-rivers-rain-greatest-privatisation profit-oriented transactions Let's divest, decolonize and resist We must be aware of the dangers of green growth, which refers to the idea of growing the economy and therefore maintaining business as usual.

Let's recognize the original caretakers of the lands and waters and learn about nature from them. Nature is not an idyllic and passive landscape to consume. Greenwashed images of nature, where people are conveniently absent, shield us from the violent suppression of voices that have historically called those places home. Let's decolonize our views of nature so that we can better see it all around us and not somewhere ""out there"" and outside of our human communities. We need to deconstruct persistent ideas of nature as a global good rendering invisible local conceptions, needs and demands to the land by its inhabitants.

This goes far beyond just rallying around the banner of an abstract environmentalism. Caring for nature means resisting the commodification of nature and standing up to environmental injustice.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada21","Wilkinson says carbon price hikes won't be decided until 2022","December 4, 2019 Wednesday","Red Deer Advocate","GATINEAU, Que. - The federal Liberals will not make a decision about hiking the carbon price beyond $50 a tonne for at least another two years, Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson says. Wilkinson said his first priority in the new Parliament will be figuring out how Canada is going to meet its target for cutting greenhouse gas emissions made four years ago as part of the Paris climate change agreement. United Nations climate change conference in November 2020. Wilkinson said the forthcoming plan will lean heavily on developing clean technology to reduce the emissions from oil and gas production, and manufacturing industries. But at the moment, Wilkinson is signalling that hiking the carbon price won't be part of the plan. That price, which is at $20 a tonne now, is to be reviewed after it hits $50 a tonne in 2022. Wilkinson said Wednesday that he is not going to ""prejudge"" the outcome of that review. ""We committed to review carbon pricing as we approach 2022, we plan to do that for sure,"" he said. ""It's part of the plan, but I would say to you carbon pricing is not the only tool in the tool box. We're going to use a whole range of them to achieve this in a way that is acceptable and works for Canada."" Last week, Canada's Ecofiscal Commission issued a report saying Canada can hit its emission targets if the carbon price quadrupled to $210 a tonne by 2030, calling it the most economically efficient way to get there. The report said regulations, such as forcing cleaner burning fuels, or subsidies, such as helping Canadians buy electric cars, cost a lot more and are often less clear to people than the carbon price. Wilkinson said he appreciated the Ecofiscal report, but noted it comes from a purely economic efficiency perspective, and the government has to take more things into consideration. ""Our view has been that the pricing of pollution is part of a robust climate plan, but it is not a climate plan in and of itself,"" he said. In 2015, the new Liberal government was just weeks old when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau went to Paris and promised that by 2030 Canada would cut emissions to 70 per cent of what they were in 2005. It was the same target set earlier that year by the former Conservative government, and in the years since has been heavily criticized by political opponents and climate experts alike for not going nearly far enough. The government's current climate policies, including phasing out coal power, the carbon price and encouraging more energy-efficient buildings, leave Canada 79 million tonnes shy of its 2030 goal to reduce emissions to no more than 511 million tonnes. Wilkinson isn't speculating how Canada will close that gap, nor will he suggest how much further Canada can realistically go. In 2018, a UN climate report suggested the world has to cut emissions almost in half by 2030 - far more than any country is doing now - to avoid catastrophe. ""I am not going to get ahead of myself and say exactly how far I think we can get,"" Wilkinson said. Next week, Wilkinson is heading to Madrid for this year's UN climate conference where he said he intends to push other countries to join Canada and work on tougher targets before the 2020 meeting. The meeting, known as the 25th Conference of the Parties, or COP25 for short, will also try to finalize rules for how some countries can get credit for helping cut emissions in another country. Wilkinson said emissions trading systems are an element of a global plan, but cautioned against it being seen as a way for Canada to just buy its way out of a problem and not do much to reduce emissions in our own backyard. ""Countries all have to recognize that the bulk of the work that you do has to be done on reducing domestic emissions,"" Wilkinson said. ""It can't be you're simply going to use some emissions trading system. It cannot be a get-out-of-jail-free card."" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 4, 2019.

But don't hold your breath - the province said its ""one-stop-shop"" approach won't take effect until 2021. ""Reducing emissions from heavy diesel commercial motor vehicles is one more step . . . to hold polluters accountable while ensuring Ontario businesses remain competitive,"" Environment Minister Jeff Yurek said in the news release.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada26","Refusal to sign on to the hysteria","December 24, 2019 Tuesday","Parksville Qualicum Beach","The two-week United Nations Climate Summit known as COP25 ended Dec. 15 in Madrid. Multitudes of government representatives, environmentalists and activists from almost 200 countries participated in meetings, extending their schedule by two days. Yet they had to postpone key decisions until they all meet again in Glasgow next year. I remain puzzled that all those COP 25 experts cannot agree after so many meetings, an email buddy gets very upset with me for forwarding a meme and a YouTube video both gently mocking Greta Thunberg and her youthful followers. My buddy is nobody's fool and had a fine career in the media, but went ballistic accusing me of being a climate change denier, disseminating lies, and worse. He's not the first to accuse me, apparently because I refuse to sign on to the hysteria and extinction positions that many young advocates loudly put forth. Responding immediately, I assured him that I'm fully aware of climate change, but have put my faith in brilliant young people around the world who work in companies that will eventually find necessary solutions. Having always believed that education is the key to just about everything else in life, I'm betting the solutions will be found sooner rather than later. Simultaneously, I lack faith in those who quit learning by dropping out of school to protest against climate change around the world. Furthermore, all the noisy finger-pointing, pouting, play-acting, etc., will not solve the fate of those young children in countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo who labour under Dickensian conditions to mine cobalt and other minerals. These materials are used extensively in batteries for cellphones, computers and all manner of gadgets that every kid seems to have, and in the batteries of the electric cars they are so keen to drive in. Yet nobody questions the brutal conditions surrounding production of these vital minerals. Bernie Smith Parksville \"

However, because I don't focus on negotiation of international climate treaties, I've never attended one of the big international climate negotiations-until now. What does a professor do in advance of a new conference? Homework! International negotiators navigate a very complex legal and procedural framework with the help of a lot of acroynyms( HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-convention/glossary-of-climate-change-acronyms-and-terms https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-convention/glossary-of-climate-change-acronyms-and-terms ). Here are some of the most important acronyms for those who want to follow along with my posts from Madrid this week. COP refers to the ""Conferences of the Parties"" (meaning countries) that have ratified the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (also known as the UNFCCC - the acronyms come fast and furious). The parties have met annually since the convention took effect, with the year denoted by the number after ""COP."" The biggies have included COP-3 in Kyoto in 1997, where the Kyoto Protocol was negotiated, and COP-21 in Paris in 2015, which yielded the Paris Agreement. We're now at COP-25 , which takes place for the next two weeks. In ratifying the Paris Agreement, which is akin to an appendix to the UNFCCC, 196 countries committed to work together to limit global warming to ""well below"" 2\'baC and ideally 1\'baC. Since then, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, yet another acronym) produced a major report in 2018 that underscored the severe impacts that can be expected at 1.5\'baC of global warming, let alone 2\'baC. NDCs The Paris Agreement process is that individual countries set targets, called nationally determined contributions (NDCs), to reduce their territorial emissions by a particular date. Two features of this approach warrant elaboration. First, it's a bottom-up process. Countries set their own targets and devise their own policies to meet them. However, in doing so together, they're reassuring each other that no one's effort will be wasted, while also minimizing impacts on economic competitiveness. Second, it's an iterative process. Rather than trying to fix climate change in one fell swoop with a distant target that invites procrastination, signatories to the Paris Agreement committed not just to initial NDCs, but also to a process by which they'll ""take stock"" and report back to each other on their progress every five years (the Global Stock Take or GST). The intention is to ratchet up collective ambition via new NDCs two years later. That ratcheting process is critical because the current NDCs are only enough to limit global warming to between 3 and 3.5\'baC. Much greater ambition is needed to avoid devastating impacts on planetary ecosystems and human well-being. Canada's current NDC, adopted in 2015, is to reduce our emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. Not only do we need to strengthen our existing policies to meet that target, but we and other countries will need to up our game in 2020, the first five-yearly NDC update, if we are serious about limiting global warming to 2\'baC or less. COP25 this year is an important opportunity for countries, including Canada, to signal that they will announce more ambitious NDCs next year. AOSIS There are lots of groupings of countries with similar economic and/or environmental circumstances. Canada has traditionally negotiated with a group of carbon-intensive countries, including Australia and (until recent years) the U.S., at times joined by oil- and gas-producing post-Soviet states. In contrast, AOSIS is the Alliance of Small Island States, which are especially vulnerable to rising sea levels caused by climate change. At the limit, entire countries could be submerged. LDCs LDCs are the 47 least developed countries as defined by the UN. The 780 million people in those countries produce just over half of the annual carbon emissions of 35 million Canadians. Put another way, the average Canadian surpasses the annual emissions of an average resident of the LDCs in just 11 days. Yet through a combination of unlucky geography and limited financial resources to adapt to a warming climate - annual GDP per person in the LDCs averages roughly $3,000 compared to Canada's $43,000-they are already suffering most from extreme heat, storms, flooding and declining crop yields in countries where hunger is already commonplace. How much worse it gets depends on how quickly we return to net-zero global emissions. CBDR-RC This one stands for common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, a fundamental principle established by the UNFCCC treaty. It recognizes that countries that have contributed the most to the climate crisis and/or that have the greatest capacity to contribute to its solution have a disproportionate responsibility to take more ambitious actions to reduce their emissions, as well as to provide financial assistance to those most vulnerable. The stakes posed by the climate crisis are immense for all countries. By virtue of our northern location Canada will continue to experience double the global average temperature increase. Yet the extreme vulnerability of LDCs and AOSIS states, which have contributed almost nothing to the problem yet will suffer the most, is a stark reminder of our responsibility as one of the countries with the highest carbon footprints and highest per capita incomes in the world.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada28","Massive mural of Greta Thunberg stares down at San Francisco","November 13, 2019 Wednesday","Postmedia Breaking News","SAN FRANCISCO - A massive portrait of Greta Thunberg gazed down onto San Francisco on Tuesday night after an artist unveiled a mural of the Swedish teen activist in a bid to remind residents of the dangers posed by climate change. The 60-foot tall, 30-foot wide (18-by-9 meter) mural was revealed hours after Thunberg announced on Twitter that she would be leaving the United States by boat on Wednesday, headed for a United Nations climate change conference The teenager rejects air travel because of its high levels of greenhouse gas emissions. Argentine street artist Andres Petreselli, who signs his work Cobre, says the portrait of Thunberg, 16, was unusual because he typically does not address politics, religion or sports. ""But, this one is ... I feel connected with the politics behind (it) because I think it is real and if I have to compare it with the rest of my murals, this is the most political one that I ever made,"" the 32-year-old said as he sat on a roof with the mural behind him. Petreselli previously painted a since-demolished mural of the late actor Robin Williams in San Francisco. Paul Scott, the executive director of OneAtmosphere.org, the San Francisco nonprofit that funded the work, said he hoped passers-by would be ""touched"" by the image of Thunberg, who has mobilized a global youth movement against climate change. ""We are really just hoping that it stops and makes them think, that this will amplify Greta's message, that people will start to understand the clear call for action that she is sending out,"" Scott said. Thunberg has spent the last three months in North America after arriving in New York City by boat on Aug. 28, delivering a speech at a United Nations climate summit there in September. In her Twitter post on Tuesday she said she would set sail from Virginia in the morning on a 48-foot catamaran whose owners have offered her a ride across the Atlantic.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada29","Earth set to warm 3.2 C by 2100 unless efforts to cut emissions are tripled, new UN report finds","November 26, 2019 Tuesday 11:43 AM GMT","CBC News","Without drastic action, our planet is headed toward warming of 3.2 C in less than 100 years, according to a new report. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) released its annual Emissions Gap Report on Tuesday \'e2\€  168 pages, compiled by 57 leading scientists from 33 institutions across 25 countries \'e2\€  calling on governments to act immediately, within the next decade, to limit global warming to 1.5 C or 2 C by 2100. ""By now, we know all we need to know. The science is pretty clear, and very frightening,"" said Anne Olhoff, head of strategy, climate and planning and policy for the UNEP DTU (Technical University of Denmark) Partnership. ""But we also know we have the technological options that are needed, at least to the short to medium term."" The report assesses scientific studies on both current greenhouse gas emissions and estimated future emissions, comparing them with possible reduction targets to avoid warming the world more than 1.5 to 2 C. - Greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) have increased 1.5 per cent annually over the past decade. - By 2030, annual emissions need to be 15 gigatonnes of CO2 lower to reach the 2 C goal, and 32 gigatonnes lower for 1.5 C. - GHG emissions have to drop by 2.7 per cent per year from 2020 to 2030 for the 2 C goal, and by 7.6 per cent per year for the 1.5 C target. - To reach these goals, efforts must increase at least fivefold for the 1.5 C goal and threefold for the 2 C. Only five of the G20 nations have committed to targets in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) that align with the ambition of the Paris Agreement to limit the rise in global average temperature to well below 2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels. Canada has not committed to a target that is in line with this scenario. ""It has to be not just verbal but some kind of written commitment,"" Olhoff said. ""It doesn't have to be passed by law, but it could be a bill under development; it could be more formalized than mentioning it in public."" While, during the election campaign Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the federal government would commit to legislate net-zero emissions by 2050 \'e2\€  even stating that Canada would be below the country's 2030 emissions goal \'e2\€  the current trajectory points to a different story. In fact, the report notes, with current policies in place, Canada will be at least 15 per cent above target. It does note, however, that Canada is committed to phasing out coal and implemented a carbon tax in its efforts to reduce emissions. It also notes that Canada's 2030 emissions are forecast to be 592 megatonnes, which is 223 megatonnes lower than was projected before its rollout of the Pan-Canadian Framework for Clean Growth and Climate Change. But it still misses the target of 511 megatonnes. Dire consequences Gabriel Filippelli, a professor at the Purdue School of Science in Indianapolis, Ind., who was a senior science adviser for the U.S. State Department from 2013 to 2014, said that the difference between 2 C and 3.2 C warming may seem minor, but that's anything but the case. ""It seems mathematically like we're playing around with numbers, but they are profound numbers,"" Filippelli said. And he doesn't take those numbers lightly. He knows each fraction of a degree the planet warms means dire consequences, particularly in countries most vulnerable. ""It's frankly terrifying to me largely because, once again, it'll be a case where those countries that are the least responsible for the root cause of this \'e2\€ \£6 who will be first impacted, and in a major way."" His concerns are well-founded. In October 2018, the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a special report, Global Warming of 1.5 C, which looked at the difference between a world that had warmed by 2 C and one that warmed by 1.5 C. The findings were dramatic. Coral reefs were project to decline by 70 to 90 per cent at 1.5 C. There was a high risk of irreversible losses at 2 C of warming. Millions of people could face poverty, flooding and drought if the planet warmed by 2 C. But the IPCC didn't look at a world that warmed beyond than that. Jennifer Francis, a senior scientist at Woods Hole Research Center in Falmouth, Mass., an independent research organization that studies climate change, said that a 3.2 C warming world would cause untold suffering. ""Looking at migration, [a 3.2 C increase] would make what we're seeing coming out Latin America now into Mexico and into the U.S. look like nothing,"" Francis said. ""There's just going to be people suffering in places where it will become literally uninhabitable, where they won't be able to grow food anymore, where their animals won't be able to live anymore. ""That's what I worry about the most, the conflict and the misery that's going to happen around the world,"" she said. ""That's what keeps me up at night."" What's more, she says, it's important for people to realize the end of the century isn't really that far away. It is just one lifetime: a mere 80 years from now. And the consequences from a warming world aren't relegated to the next century: today's generations are already feeling the effects. ""It's here,"" Francis said. ""It's not the future."" As is typical with any UN climate change report, there is a positive take. Countries committed to the Paris Agreement and NDCs are set to meet in Madrid on Dec. 2 for the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ), and to meet in Glasgow in November 2020 to examine NDC efforts. But the new report says, countries can't wait that long. Action needs to be taken immediately. ""We're seriously behind on this,"" Filippelli said. ""It's all doable but \'e2\€ \£6 every month that we don't have aggressive action, we fall, frankly, four months behind."" The good news, the authors say, is that technology already exists that could help change our trajectory from 3.2 C. Renewables and energy efficiency is one of the key measures to effectively reduce emissions, and the electrification of heat and energy and even transportation could make major headway. With that, however, comes a hefty price tag: roughly $1.6 to $3.8 trillion annually over the next decade. But it will be worth the cost, Olhoff said. ""This is definitely not a world we want to pass on to our children and grandchildren,"" she said. ""It's not a world we want."" \"

The boat, La Vagabonde, carried the Swedish campaigner, who refuses to travel by plane, across the ocean so she could attend the COP25 climate summit in Madrid. She will spend the day holding meetings with Portuguese climate activists and resting before her departure for Madrid. ""Heading into Lisbon!"" she posted on Twitter along with photographs aboard the vessel. Portugal's environment minister Matos Fernandes thanked Greta for her activism in a letter last Thursday, having already departed for COP25 . Thunberg missed last Friday's climate strike as heavy winds delayed her arrival to Lisbon but she is due to join thousands of activists marching in Madrid on Friday afternoon on the fringes of the COP25 . Top priorities include establishing a common time frame for countries to implement their national climate commitment plans, and resolving the issue of international carbon markets, the only aspect of the Paris rule book which delegates failed to agree on at last year's COP24 in Poland.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada31","Two More Hits To Western Canada'S Economy","January 2, 2020 Thursday","National Post (f/k/a The Financial Post) (Canada)","The prime minister just doesn't get Western alienation. Either that or he is so obsessed with his green image he doesn't care. After rejection by two-thirds of voters, with support from less than 22 per cent of the total electorate and only four out of 62 seats in the Prairie provinces, Trudeau is downplaying regional ""frustrations,"" saying they do not amount to a national unity crisis. As if to flaunt his indifference, Trudeau reaffirmed Liberal hostility to resource development with two fateful decisions, both of which - paradoxically - undermine his avowed mission to combat climate change. The first relates to the government's stance at the failed UN Conference on Climate Change ( COP25 ) in Madrid and the second, its commitment to adopt the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). As I recently wrote, selling Canadian oil and gas to Asia will reduce net global emissions by enabling importing countries to decrease their use of higher-emitting coal. Canada can be a big contributor to the international climate effort by exporting oil and gas or it can concentrate on domestic emissions and penalize its economy. Minister of the Environment and Climate Change Jonathan Wilkinson graciously declared ""I'm not saying liquid natural gas (LNG) in the future can't be part of an overall structure"" before adding the killer: ""but the focus of the climate plan is on reducing our own domestic emissions."" Follow his self-defeating reasoning: the government will concentrate on achieving its Paris accord commitments even if doing so precludes reducing worldwide emissions. Because in the end the only number that counts is total global emissions, this approach prioritizes bragging rights over a looming threat to humanity. The Liberal scorecard evidently is more important than whether the planet fries. Those who oppose sharing carbon reduction credits worry about the possibility of double counting but that technical problem is easily resolved. China quite understandably wants to hoard the credit for reducing its own domestic emissions. But why would the Canadian government support a process that disadvantages its own energy industry for no net environmental advantage? Wilkinson's approach should be politically toxic for the Liberal government. The reason it is not pervades the discussion of an alleged climate change crisis: facts and rationality about a technical subject are no match for the stultifying conformity of the environmental bandwagon and its intolerance of dissent. As for UNDRIP, federal Justice Minister and Attorney General David Lametti promised it would be adopted into law in 2020, against the opposition of his predecessor, Jody Wilson-Raybould. Much of what the declaration says about the rights of Indigenous peoples and historical wrongs is laudable. But the requirement for ""free, prior and informed consent"" for resource project approval will create significant uncertainty both for Aboriginal peoples and for Canadians overall (as Dale Swampy, president of the National Coalition of Chiefs, recently argued on this page). Public commentary and the courts respond almost exclusively to Aboriginal people opposed to resource projects. Yet for many Indigenous communities resource development is a transformative opportunity to create jobs, long-term revenue and lasting economic partnerships. Most First Nations support pipelines that traverse their traditional territories. They resent domestic and foreign NGOs that manipulate Aboriginal rights and denigrate Aboriginal benefits in order to advance their own ideological and commercial agendas. Hard questions abound. When some nations say no and others say yes, whose voices should be heard and on what basis? What are the implications of proven versus unproven rights and titles? How critical is physical proximity to the project? Does population size matter? Should resource companies consult with hereditary chiefs, band councils or the entire community? Then there is the Canadian national interest, especially the overarching need to access overseas markets for our oil and gas. In a 2016 discussion paper, a team led by Supreme Court Justice Frank Iacobucci outlined the considerations when consent cannot be obtained, including that rights must be adequately protected and impacts mitigated, which may entail compensation. Otherwise, the infringement must be justified by balancing Indigenous rights with the need to respect other human rights, as well as the public interest in ""meeting the just and most compelling requirements of a democratic society."" We cannot know how UNDRIP will be interpreted by the courts or, crucially, whether First Nations could veto development projects. Inevitably, these complex issues will generate extensive litigation. Regulatory risk, lawfare and political opposition caused project sponsors TransCanada and Kinder Morgan to withdraw from Energy East and Trans Mountain, respectively, at a sunk cost of a billion dollars each. Adding UNDRIP to the new ""no pipelines"" Impact Assessment Act could seal the fate of new projects, leaving vast energy resources landlocked. Canadians are left to wonder whether the government considered the full implications of these two decisions for the country or, given its minority situation, whether it even cares.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada33","'People power' piles pressure on plodding U.N. climate talks","November 29, 2019 Friday","National Post (f/k/a The Financial Post) (Canada)","By Megan Rowling BARCELONA, Nov 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - As young people take to the streets around the world again on Friday urging more action to curb climate change, analysts warn that the U.N. climate conference taking place over the coming two weeks will likely fall short of their expectations. Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg has inspired a global movement of children who skip school on Fridays to hold marches and rallies demanding politicians treat climate change as an ""emergency"" and boost efforts to curb planet-warming emissions. This Friday, groups of young Americans are planning a ""Black Friday Strike,"" from Los Angeles to New York, to boycott the celebration of consumer discount shopping and to advocate for ""a change to business-as-usual to confront the climate crisis."" Andrew Steer, who heads the U.S-based World Resources Institute, noted the rise of ""people power"" over the past year, with more than 7 million turning out for protests in September as the U.N. chief convened a summit to drive climate action. ""The issue is rising on the agenda, both in the United States and globally,"" Steer told journalists ahead of the Dec. 2-13 U.N. talks in Madrid, known as COP25 . In Britain and the United States, political contenders have taken part in public debates on climate change ahead of planned elections. Meanwhile, a growing number of governments at national and city level are declaring ""climate emergencies,"" joined on Thursday by the European Parliament. Others, including small-island developing states and some Latin American and African countries, have pledged to work on cutting their emissions to net-zero by mid-century. But ahead of COP25 COP25 was ""a promise"" that countries would upgrade their national climate action plans by the end of 2020, in line with the 2015 Paris agreement. But that outcome would likely seem out of step with the ""more angry, urgent moral narrative"" shaped by youth-led popular climate strikes around the world since 2018, she noted. ""Now more than ever in this COP, we will see a very big gap between the negotiations inside and the emotions outside,"" said Araya, founder of clean development platform Costa Rica Limpia. Ahead of the Madrid talks, Spain's Minister for the Ecological Transition Teresa Ribera said the meeting should mark ""the start of a decisive year for climate ambition."" It needed to lay the foundation for countries in 2020 to commit to cut emissions more steeply, as scientists advise, with the aim of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the lower goal set in the Paris accord, she said. ""This is what societies are demanding,"" Ribera said, noting that efforts would be made to ""try to ensure that the demands by young people to raise climate ambition echo throughout COP25 ."" YOUTH VOICES At COP events scheduled for next Monday and Thursday, young people will get a chance to voice their views about the need to protect the planet for their own and future generations. Thunberg is sailing back to Europe across the Atlantic on a low-carbon journey to the climate conference after its venue was abruptly moved to Spain from Chile, which has been dogged by violent social unrest. In September, youth activists speaking alongside the U.N. summit in New York called on the United Nations and world leaders to give them a seat at the political table. But some climate experts worry the last-minute venue switch for the COP25 talks may hamstring that broader participation. Latin American activists said the cancellation on Chilean soil had disappointed many civil society groups, who could not afford to travel to Spain at short notice. Araya said the change of venue had been ""very painful"" for them, with some fearing it would undermine a hoped-for focus on respecting the human rights of environmental defenders, a big issue in South America, which is rich in natural resources. One thread uniting popular climate change movements around the world is a push for governments to take social equity into account when addressing the threat - a conversation that should start at COP25 , analysts said. Niranjali Amerasinghe, executive director of ActionAid USA, said justice issues should be key to climate responses, whether in ensuring a sustainable future for young people or helping poor communities hit hardest by wilder weather and rising seas. ""Those things resonate a bit stronger given the (global) political context,"" she added. (Reporting by Megan Rowling //news.trust.org/climate) !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

Strict rules that prevent double counting, prohibit carry forward of questionable Kyoto Protocol credits, and ensure that projects eligible for credit surpass business-as-usual performance could reinforce the ambition of the Paris Agreement. Rules that fall short of those goals could gut the treaty, leaving only the pretence of emissions reductions. What's at stake for Canada with the emissions trading rules in Article 6 of the Paris Agreement? Canada is among the countries pushing for integrity of emissions trading and protection of human rights in the current negotiations. However, with relatively high-cost emissions reductions, Canada, like other wealthy countries, is expected to be a purchaser of lower-cost reductions from developing countries. That creates contrary incentives to resist some proposals that would increase prices for emissions credits - for instance, setting aside a more generous ""share of proceeds"" for adaptation in developing countries under both Articles 6.2 and 6.4 of the treaty. It's noteworthy that Canada is already engaged in emissions trading. The Quebec and California cap-and-trade programs have been linked since 2014. Canada is counting on credits purchased from California for roughly 20 per cent of the reductions projected to be achieved by 2030. However, the U.S.'s scheduled withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in November 2020 would render those credits ineligible. U.S. withdrawal would almost certainly be reversed if a Democrat wins the 2020 presidential election, but for now that remains a big uncertainty for Canada's climate plan.

The Conservative Party has argued that Canada should be able to claim international credits for LNG exports on the grounds that natural gas will replace coal in destination countries, thus reducing global emissions. Canada is doing the world a favour and should get credit for that, or so the argument goes. There's lots to debate here, starting with the assumption of global emissions reductions. Canada's LNG may replace coal, but it could also replace renewables and thus increase global emissions. In any case, it's just not how the climate treaty works. Each country is responsible for the emissions released within its own borders. It follows that any reduction flowing from a shift to lower-carbon fuels would be ""owned"" by the country in which those fuels are burned. Canada may be able to purchase credits from those or other countries to offset the significant increase in our own emissions to produce and liquefy natural gas. But let's be clear: We would be paying, not getting paid. We've been hearing a lot recently about decline in emissions per barrel of bitumen extracted from the oilsands, and the Canadian industry's ambition to match the least-intensive crudes in the world. While reductions in emissions intensity are good news, we should not kid ourselves that we're anywhere close to achieving that goal. A 2018 study in Science, a top-ranked peer-reviewed journal, found that Canada's oilsands have among the highest carbon footprints in the world. It's also questionable that tar embedded in soil can ever be delivered and refined as efficiently as free-flowing, light crudes. As with LNG, while the emissions from combustion of Canada's oil exports appear on the ledger of destination countries, emissions associated with extraction of bitumen are our responsibility. Under the Paris Agreement, Canada would get credit should there be a reduction in total emissions (not just emissions per barrel) associated with oilsands production. However, that would count toward our own emissions target. Any suggestion to sell those credits internationally as well would be prohibited as double counting under the Paris Agreement. Last, there is a looming question of how Canada will fill the gap to meet our current Paris Agreement target, let alone the more ambitious target the Liberals promised during the election campaign, which is sorely needed if the world is to meet the goal to limit climate change to well below 2\'baC. This week's throne speech promised several additional measures, including promotion of electric vehicles, tree planting, subsidies for home retrofits, and investments in transit. However, no details have been provided to suggest that these measures will be sufficient to close a growing gap to Canada's 2030 target. Purchase of international credits may provide a way forward-though only if the rules negotiated this week ensure meaningful reductions. International emissions trading could reduce Canada's compliance costs, though with a consequence of delaying transition of our own economy. That's an important trade-off that should be acknowledged and discussed openly, rather than proceeding with a plan we know to be insufficient, then pulling international credits out of the global hat at the last minute. COP-25 Climate Change Conference in Madrid will appear here throughout the week. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved. \"

The talks, called COP25 , were scheduled to be held in Santiago, Chile, from Dec. 2-13, but protests over inequality have left 18 people dead and ground the city to a halt at times. They are aimed at fleshing out the details of the implementation of the landmark Paris Agreement climate pact, amid calls for urgency from environmental groups and climate protesters. ""Earlier today, I was informed of the decision by the Government of Chile not to host COP25 in view of the difficult situation that the country is undergoing,"" U.N. Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa said in a statement. ""We are currently exploring alternative hosting options,"" she added. The so-called Conference of the Parties (COP) is the formal meeting of parties to the United Nations' Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). They are usually held annually and the first one was held in 1995. COP25 in 2018, citing fiscal and budgetary constraints. A UNFCCC spokesman said the aim was to keep the conference in December but that might not be possible with just over a month to go and many venues booked. Germany's environment secretary, Jochen Flasbarth, tweeted that his government was in contact with Poland, which currently holds the COP presidency. A spokesman at Poland's environment ministry said: ""It is too early to say now in what direction it will go."" According to the UNFCCC website, the COP meets in Bonn, Germany, the seat of the secretariat, unless a party offers to host. As the presidency of the COP rotates among Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, Central and Eastern Europe and Western Europe there is a tendency for the venue of the COP to also shift among these groups. Last year, the conference was held in Poland and the year before that in Bonn, on behalf of host Fiji. At the end of 2020, it is scheduled to be held in Glasgow, Scotland. The Paris Agreement was negotiated at COP21 in Paris, France, in 2015.

William Sanderson of Perth Road village spent a week at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP25 ). ""You hear so much about the work happening at the UN,"" Sanderson said. ""To be witnessing or participating in those conversations, especially the conversations that I had heard lots about before, that was really unique."" Sanderson was one of six young people sent to the conference by Students on Ice, an Ottawa-based agency that organizes youth expeditions to the polar regions. Sanderson took part in a trip to Antarctica in 2014 and was selected from among interested alumni to go to Madrid for the climate conference. While there, he and some of the other Canadians helped smaller countries keep track of the various discussions. Sanderson helped the delegation from Seychelles by sitting in on workshops and discussions and taking notes for the island nation off the coast of Africa that faces a bleak future as sea levels rise. ""It was interesting to get an entirely new perspective to climate change. In Canada we experience it very differently than in other countries in the world,"" said Sanderson, who is in the third year of a double major in mechanical engineering and business administration at Western University. ""It seems very isolating having all these different climate impacts. In Canada, obviously, we have a lot of ice melting, but in other places sea level rise and changing weather affects people very differently. That perspective of seeing all these different countries at the UN, more than anything, just showed me the vastness of the impacts of climate change. ""Even though it doesn't affect everyone the same, it still affects everybody in some shape or form."" The highlight of the trip was the opportunity to meet other youth delegates from around the world, Sanderson said. While much of the discussion was taking place at a high diplomatic level, both delegates could look to each other for inspiration, he said. ""It can be very difficult because sometimes you don't feel you have the experience or the knowledge to speak on every issue,"" Sanderson said.

Thunberg, 16, started missing school on Fridays a year ago to protest outside the Swedish parliament, sparking a global climate strike movement known as Fridays for Future. She joined 14-year-old New Yorker Alexandria Villasenor on Friday, who began picketing outside the United Nations in New York December. A couple of hundred of other young protesters supported them with signs that read ""Help my home is on fire,"" ""If you won't act like adults, we will"" and ""Science not silence."" Their chants included ""we are unstoppable, a better world is possible"" and ""sea levels are rising and so are we."" Wearing t-shirts that read ""In Greta we trust,"" New York students Bianca Pilcher, 11, and Lila Sabag, 10, said they had one message for world leaders: act now. ""I don't want to live a short life, I want to live a long life and I want to have my world be healthy as well. I also want to experience having children, having grandchildren and them to not be like 'what have you brought me in to?'"" said Pilcher. Sabag said she wanted to help save the planet by trying ""to not use much carbon dioxide or fossil fuels or like plastics and stuff."" Then both girls chimed in together: ""Always reuse."" Thunberg will speak at a Sept. 23 climate summit during the annual gathering of world leaders for the U.N. General Assembly. She sailed into New York Harbor on Wednesday in a zero-carbon emissions boat, completing a nearly 14-day journey from England. In a statement when she arrived in New York, Thunberg said: ""Everyone who cares about our future should join and strike on 20 and 27 September."" Thunberg met with U.N. General Assembly President Mar\'eda Fernanda Espinosa later on Friday. ""I think this summit needs to be some kind of breaking point, tipping point, where people start to realize what is actually going on,"" Thunberg told Espinosa. ""We have high expectations in you too, and all member states to deliver. And we are going to try to do our part to make sure that they have all eyes on them and they have put the pressure on them so they can't continue to ignore it."" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned that the world faces a climate emergency and challenged leaders to come to the 193-member United Nations next month with concrete, realistic plans on how to better tackle the emergency. ""We absolutely need to keep the rise of temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius to the end of the century and to be carbon neutral in 2050 and to have a 45 per cent reduction of emissions by 2030,"" he told reporters in France on Monday. Thunberg intends to attend the 25th United Nations Climate Change conference in Santiago, Chile, in December, planning to make her way there without using air travel.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada38","Uncertainty over UN talks must not delay climate action, green groups say","October 31, 2019 Thursday","National Post (f/k/a The Financial Post) (Canada)","(Updates with offer from Spain to host the COP25 talks) BARCELONA, Oct 31 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A surprise decision by Chile, rocked by violent unrest, to withdraw as host of December's U.N. climate conference risks throwing international efforts to ramp up action on global warming off course, environmentalists and rights activists fear. They urged quick efforts to reorganize the negotiations, aimed at accelerating cuts in planet-warming emissions and helping vulnerable communities find ways to deal with the increasingly harmful impacts of climate change. The announcement by Chile's president on Wednesday came just over a month before the negotiations - known as COP25 - were due to start and left the U.N. climate change secretariat scrabbling for an alternative venue. On Thursday, the Spanish government said in a statement that acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez had indicated it was ready to do what was needed to host the summit in Madrid. U.N. climate chief Patricia Espinosa said she had been informed by Chile about Spain's offer to hold the conference as originally planned from Dec. 2-13, and was hopeful the proposed solution could be considered as soon as possible. ""It is encouraging to see countries working together in the spirit of multilateralism to address climate change, the biggest challenge facing this and future generations,"" she added. A day earlier, Climate Action Network International, which represents hundreds of environmental campaign groups, warned Chile's move ""must not detract from the political urgency to address the climate crisis"" through emissions reductions and stronger efforts to adapt to wilder weather and rising seas. Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, head of climate and energy work for conservation group WWF and president of the 2014 talks in Lima, called for a fast U.N. response in announcing updated plans for the conference. ""We encourage world leaders to continue to support the process and show it by stepping up their own country pledges, to ensure an extremely ambitious 2020,"" he added. Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, governments have committed to regularly strengthen targets in their national plans to lower planet-warming emissions, in order to meet global goals to curb rising temperatures. COP25 The logistics and cost of hosting a COP are daunting, and Costa Rica - where a preparatory meeting for the Chile gathering took place recently - had said on Wednesday it could not take on the challenge. KEEP TALKING Human rights and green groups also expressed concern about what the cancellation of the event in Chile might mean for ongoing protests there, which have resulted in close to 20 deaths, 7,000 arrests and business losses of about $1.4 billion. They urged Chilean leaders to consider environmental issues as part of reforms to meet the demands of protesters, who want the government to address social inequalities. Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said on Wednesday he had taken the ""painful"" decision to cancel COP25 , as well as an Asia-Pacific economic summit next month, to focus on restoring law and order and pushing through a new social plan. The United Nations has said it will send a team to investigate allegations of human rights abuses by Chile's security forces during the unrest. ""The same flawed economic policies that have sparked protests on the streets of Chile are fueling the global climate crisis and the global inequality crisis,"" said Asier Hernando, deputy director of Oxfam in Latin America and the Caribbean. ""Urgent action is needed by governments to build economies that put people and the environment before economic growth and corporate profits,"" he added. Some climate change experts and diplomats said they understood the decision not to host the U.N. climate talks in Chile given security concerns and the need to focus on domestic problems. Others, however, warned the decision should not shut down debate on environmental and social injustices in the troubled Latin American nation and beyond. Canceling or postponing such a meeting ""doesn't postpone climate change and its impacts,"" said Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International. ""All over the world, people are clamoring for change. The channels for dialog have to be kept open,"" she added.

Jonathan Wilkinson joined the chorus of dispirited delegates following the two-week COP25 conference, saying he and his team weren't satisfied by the decision to postpone debate about rules for international carbon markets for another year. ""Canada came to # COP25 in the spirit of compromise and commitment to action,"" he tweeted. ""While there were some successes, we are disappointed that the world was not able to agree on the rules for the international carbon markets that would help us all raise our ambition in Madrid."" The talks stretched well beyond the planned Friday end date, as major polluters resisted calls to ramp up efforts to keep global warming at bay. In addition to postponing the carbon markets debate, negotiators endorsed a general call for greater efforts to tackle climate change and several measures to help poor countries respond and adapt to its impacts. The final declaration cited an ""urgent need"" to cut planet-heating greenhouse gases in line with the goals of the landmark 2015 Paris climate change accord. But it fell far short of explicitly demanding that countries submit bolder emissions proposals next year, which developing countries and environmentalists had demanded. The Paris accord established a common goal of keeping temperature increases below 2 degrees Celsius, ideally 1.5 degrees Celsius, by the end of the century. So far, the world is on course for a 3-to 4-degree Celsius rise, with potentially dramatic consequences for many countries, including rising sea levels and fiercer storms. Wilkinson, who was sworn in late last month and received his mandate letter on Friday, wrote on Twitter that Canada would continue to work towards those targets, and noted that Canada had committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. \"

Spain announced today that it will host the climate summit in Madrid in December, but there is no word on the fate of the APEC forum that had been scheduled for mid-November. Chilean President Sebastian Pi\'c3\'b1era announced Wednesday that his country would not host the forums due to ongoing unrest in his country. Caroline Theriault, a spokeswoman for Environment and Climate Change Minister Catherine McKenna, said Canada had no plan to host the COP25 summit, but said such conferences are ""essential in our global fight against climate change."" ""Our focus remains on delivering the clear mandate Canadians elected this Parliament to work on,"" she said in an email. Large international summits such as these require significant infrastructure and security planning. A government official speaking on background said organizing a climate conference takes between one and two years and involves 10,000 to 20,000 people. Taking that on with just four weeks to go, immediately after a federal election, presented ""unrealistic timelines."" Protesters in Chile have been making demands for better pay, pensions, schools, housing and medical care. While most demonstrations have been peaceful, some have led to deadly riots and looting.

""Very sorry,"" they might say, ""but we've had a bit of an emergency and we're going to have to cancel. Please tell me you haven't set off yet?"" It is, you'll agree, annoying. Now, imagine that ""meeting"" you were due to attend was in fact a UN conference on climate change in Santiago, Chile. And the ""journey"" involved travelling from the United Kingdom to South America (just the 7,000 miles) without emitting any carbon dioxide and using only non-fossil-fuel transport - meaning cycling, paddling, sailing and electric vehicles - to raise awareness about the global climate emergency. And that, at the moment you heard the conference was cancelled, you were bobbing somewhere across the Atlantic, in a 100-year-old tall ship, with weeks still to go before landfall. And that you were filming the whole thing. And that, oh, you'd emptied your pounds 50,000 life savings to fund it all. Now that would be annoying. ""It literally knocked me sideways,"" says James Levelle, 38, to whom all this happened. ""I was bloody miles from anywhere, with still a long way to sail, when I had a message saying it had been cancelled. Everyone on board was saying: 'Oh my God, what are you going to do?'

He had set off from Dorset in a sailing boat at the end of August, and travelled across Europe (mainly by bike) with a small crew, before arriving in Seville in September, where he jumped aboard a ship heading for the Uruguayan capital of Montevideo, via Tenerife and Cape Verde. From there, he found his way to Buenos Aires, and planned to head across the Andes to Santiago for Monday this week, when the conference, also known as COP25 , was to begin. The meeting was set to draw climate activists from all over the world - including Greta Thunberg, who had already sailed across the Atlantic in September. But Chile's embattled president, Sebastian Pinera, was forced to cancel in late October, when violent protests in his capital city - which had seen thousands of arrests, as well as left dozens dead - failed to defuse. Within hours, the UN announced that it was ""exploring alternative hosting options"", and the next day, another venue was found. It was in Madrid. Thunberg appealed to her three million Twitter followers for help. Swedish teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg waves from a yacht as she starts her trans-Atlantic boat trip to New York, in Plymouth, Britain, August 14, 2019. ""It wasn't like I could say, 'Right, let's turn this ship around' - I was going to South America whether I liked it or not. Part of me almost laughed at the farcical nature of my position,"" he says. The choice became binary: should he wait to arrive in South America, then somehow try to get back to Madrid? Or plough on regardless? He plumped for the latter. ""After a while, it became really clear to me: the job's not done. There were still quite a few events going on in Santiago that were relevant, so I knew that was where I should be. I said I would do something... and so I wanted to finish it."" So that's what he'll do - barring another wild plot twist. At the time of writing, Levelle has missed his deadline by a couple of days. Cycling furiously across the Andes, having driven for 1,000km from Buenos Aires in an electric Renault van, he ought to arrive today. Throughout his time in South America, he has relied on the kindness of strangers, both for accommodation and general help. His crew has slimmed down - it's now just him and cameraman Eoghan McDonaugh - but his mission is otherwise unchanged: he's still capturing his journey, and still collecting video messages from children he meets in person and via his website, with a view to showing the film next week. Levelle was raised in London; his father was in advertising and his mother was a health practitioner. A degree in English from Edinburgh University was enough to convince him he'd like to avoid office work. He has successfully followed his hero, Sir David Attenborough, into documentaries, only Levelle's methods are quite a lot madder. Over more than a decade, he's documented child labour in India, met pirates off Sierra Leone and gone undercover in the Chinese illegal fur trade. Most audaciously, in 2015, he and another filmmaker, Rob Greenfield, travelled more than 5,000 miles from one side of South America to the other without money, just to see if they could and if people's generosity would sustain them.

""Our government remains firmly committed to lasting progress and a just ecological transition,"" Spain's interim Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez wrote on Twitter, confirming that the Spanish capital will take over as host. ""It is more important that the conference takes place, politically. I think it would have been not a good sign if the conference would have been canceled or postponed,"" Saier said. A spokesman for the Spanish government was not immediately available to comment. Madrid Mayor Jose Luis Martinez-Almeida called his city's role hosting the conference ""great news."" ""Good opportunity to show our commitment in the fight against pollution and show that we are prepared to welcome its 25,000 attendees,"" he wrote on Twitter. The conference comes amid calls for urgent action from environmental groups and climate protesters, who point out recent scientific reports urging sweeping measures to keep global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. Teenage climate change activist Greta Thunberg, who has led a high-profile global climate strike movement to focus attention on global warming, said the change of venue for the summit had stranded her on the wrong side of the Atlantic. Thunberg, currently in Los Angeles, had traveled by yacht from Europe in order to make her way to Santiago for the climate talks carbon-free, and is currently in the United States. ""It turns out I've traveled half around the world, the wrong way:),"" she wrote on Twitter. ""Now I need to find a way to cross the Atlantic in November. ... If anyone could help me find transport I would be so grateful."" Chile will continue to assume the presidency of the climate talks while in Madrid. The so-called Conference of the Parties conference is aimed at fleshing out details of the implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. ""We will continue to reinforce the work done with the understanding that social and environmental development go hand in hand,"" Chilean Environment Minister Carolina Schmidt said on Twitter on Friday.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada44","Thousands Rally In Madrid During Climate Conference","December 7, 2019 Saturday","Times Colonist (Victoria, British Columbia)","Tens of thousands of people from around the world joined Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg on Friday to demand concrete results from the world's politicians to stop climate change. The rally took place during the ongoing UN climate conference, known as COP25 , with protesters marching from the Atocha railway station along the Spanish capital's main street, Paseo del Prado. The procession was led by a group of natives from Latin America who feel particularly threatened by climate change. Other demonstrators carried placard with slogans such as ""Planet over Profit,"" ""Our climate makes us sick and kills us"" and ""Tomorrow will be too late."" The aim of the rally was to pressure the UN delegates to take more action on climate change at the conference, which runs until Dec. 13. Thunberg later told participants from a stage that the world is experiencing a climate emergency and that everyone needed to step out of their comfort zones in order to solve the problem. She called on politicians at the UN conference in Madrid to be more engaged and produce tangible results in their fight against climate change. In front of journalists in the Spanish capital, Thunberg said earlier she hoped that the conference would produce some concrete measures regarding how to stop climate change. ""I sincerely hope COP25 will lead to something concrete and that it will lead to an increase in awareness among people in general. I know that we will do everything we can that this is something that cannot be ignored anymore."" While next year's COP26 is seen as more important because, under the Paris deal, more ambitious targets must be presented in the fight against global warming, Thunberg stressed that every opportunity to discuss how to fight climate change must be taken. Thunberg had arrived by train in Madrid, tweeting that it was ""great to be in Spain."" The 16-year-old had to remain on the train for about 15 minutes due to a large crowd gathered at Madrid's Chamartin Station. This week, Thunberg arrived in Lisbon after a three-week voyage across the Atlantic en route to the Madrid conference. She will not travel by plane to avoid harming the environment. \"

Chilean President Sebasti\'e1n Pi\'f1era on Wednesday cancelled plans to host the Dec. 2-13 climate gathering, as well as a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders, to focus on restoring security in his country, where at least a dozen people have died. A statement Thursday from Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\'e1nchez's office said he offered the space because he understands why the Chilean government needs to prioritize its ""national social agenda"" and how pressed organizers of the COP25 meeting are, given the last-minute switch. S\'e1nchez, a Socialist, is trying to stay in power as Spain holds a general election on Nov. 10. Spain said U.N. officials will consider Spain's proposal next week at their meeting in Bonn, Germany. It wasn't immediately clear on what scale the conference would be held if Madrid is chosen as an alternative. Last year's climate conference in Katowice, Poland, was attended by more than 20,000 people. U.N. Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa said Spain's offer would allow organizers to host the summit on its original timetable. ""It is encouraging to see countries working together in the spirit of multilateralism to address climate change, the biggest challenge facing this and future generations,"" Espinosa said. Other options could be shifting the U.N. conference to a different month. Other possible host sites include major U.N. venues in New York, Geneva, Vienna, Bonn or Nairobi, Kenya. The COP25 conference aims to work out some of the remaining unresolved rules for countries on climate efforts, smoothing the way for a bigger climate effort at the 2020 summit to encourage countries to increase commitments to cutting their climate-changing emissions. Speaking Thursday in Santiago de Chile, Pi\'f1era called S\'e1nchez's offer ""generous"" said it would allow climate experts to put together ""all the progress that had been achieved."" ___ Frank Jordans in Berlin and Eva Vergara in Santiago, Chile, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP's full coverage of climate change issues at HYPERLINK https://www.apnews.com/Climate https://www.apnews.com/Climate \"
"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada46","Kathryn Harrison: Hope for the future thanks to kids at climate change conference","December 12, 2019 Thursday","Postmedia Breaking News","MADRID - As COP25 in Madrid draws to a close, I'm reflecting on my first time attending the international climate negotiations. There's a popular narrative that international climate meetings are just a pretense for thousands to jaunt off to exotic locales. To imply that COP is a vacation could not be further from what I witnessed: deeply-committed public servants, academics, and activists working long hours-sometimes through the night-in windowless rooms in a generic conference centre. COP offers a strange juxtaposition of highly technical debates and intense emotion. As negotiations proceed over ""share of proceeds"" from emissions trading for adaptation and financial support from wealthy countries for ""loss and damages"" in developing countries, reminders of the devastation climate change is already causing are ever-present. A young delegate from the Philippines spoke of how her activism was prompted by the devastation in her country from Typhoon Haiyan. Near the entrance to the conference centre, there is a continuous slide show of heartbreaking stories of climate change impacts. I stood transfixed by the story of a Bangladeshi family who lost their mother in a flood when one of her sons swimming with her let go of her hand to grab the bag containing the family's only money. As negotiations continue over a contentious clause to recognize human rights in the emissions trading rulebook, members of Indigenous communities from around the world, including Canada, shared experiences of displacement from traditional lands and livelihoods through deforestation and fossil fuel development. Marshall Islanders, whose entire country lies less than two metres above sea level, shared their fears of total loss of their country and culture. As countries debate long-term plans for ""net zero"" emissions, unions representing workers dependent on the fossil fuel industry remind negotiators of the need not just for transition, but for a just transition in which vulnerable workers and communities are supported. And the kids! At their core, climate negotiations are all about securing a sustainable future, so it's only fitting that voices of children and youth were prominent at COP25 . I attended panels where children as young as 11 spoke with remarkable poise, knowledge, and passion. When asked how their lives will be different from their parents, a young Chilean activist responded, ""We need to decide whether to have children."" I struggled to hold back tears. I doubt I was the only one. I reviewed the latest drafts of the rulebook for Article 6, the emissions trading regime under the Paris Agreement, to the sounds of children's voices across the hall chanting for ""Climate Justice Now."" Greta Thunberg's arrival was met with a phalanx of photographers at the Madrid train station. It's fitting that Thunberg has been recognized as Time magazine's person of the year for launching a global youth movement. Yet that movement has demonstrated that the world is full of Gretas-clear-eyed and deeply frightened for their futures. They are not alone. In the question period following a panel in which experts presented highly technical integrated assessment models of carbon pricing, a young woman asked how they could even talk about markets and economic growth when we're in the middle of a crisis. One of the panelists responded, ""We may look calm, but we're all frightened. That's why we're doing this work."" Which brings me to hope. Since returning from COP I've thought a lot about the distinction the author Rebecca Solnit draws between optimism and hope. Optimism is confidence that everything will be alright. I know that global emissions, and Canada's, are still increasing. Having witnessed the gap that remains in international negotiations over fundamental issues, including level of ambition and climate finance for developing countries, I cannot say I'm optimistic. Hope, in contrast, is a belief that things could be better. I choose to remain hopeful. As long as those kids are chanting and governments are still negotiating, there's still the possibility that we can turn this around. If adults are listening to their children and demand meaningful action from the politicians they elect, there's still hope.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada47","Fear of nuclear power can be more deadly than nuclear accidents themselves","January 14, 2020 Tuesday","thestar.com","Like many Ontarians, I was woken on Sunday morning to an emergency alert of an ""incident"" at the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station. Within a few hours, we learned that the alert was sent in error and there had been no incident. However, the real harm of stoking fear of nuclear power had already been done. Like everything else, generating nuclear power entails risk, but the fear of nuclear power can be more deadly than nuclear accidents themselves. The human brain is not naturally adept at comparing risks in the modern world, but data-based studies helps us make the right decisions. As an example, many people have a fear of flying, but most people know that flying across Canada is safer than driving the same distance, so they overcome their fears and board the airplane. Similarly, many have a visceral fear of radiation. But in the case of power generation, it is tragic that decisions are often driven by this fear instead of a dispassionate data-based comparison of risks. The 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident is a case in point. Triggered by a massive 9.1 magnitude earthquake, a tsunami swept across the eastern coast of Japan's northern islands, flooding the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant causing multiple reactor meltdowns. One workman died directly from radiation exposure and estimates of further deaths range up to 130 deaths due to increased incidents of cancer. Within 14 months of the accident, Japan shut down all nuclear power production and increased imports of fossil fuels, resulting in sharply higher energy prices. A recent paper by researchers at Columbia University, Nagoya City University and the University of Verona studies changes in mortality during cold weather periods in Japan's 21 largest cities due to the rise in energy prices. By comparing regions that relied more heavily on nuclear power prior to the accident with regions that relied more on other sources of energy, the researchers estimated a total increase of 1,280 cold-weather related deaths in these cities between 2011 and 2014. In other words, over four years, the shut down of nuclear power plants was 10 times as deadly as the highest estimate of deaths due to the accident itself. The story is even worse when considering alternatives to nuclear power. After the Fukushima accident, Germany shut down roughly half its nuclear production capacity, replacing it with coal and increased electricity imports. A study from the University of California and Carnegie Mellon University examined hourly data on power plant operations to estimate the increase in sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter and the resultant increase in mortality. The researchers estimate an ongoing additional 1,100 deaths per year due to the increased pollution. Of course, this is not to dismiss the actual risk of nuclear power. The 1984 Chernobyl disaster in the Soviet Union demonstrates the danger of a poorly designed nuclear power plant. The long-term death toll is disputed, but the United Nations estimates a total of 4,000 deaths as a result of the Chernobyl meltdown. At the high end, Greenpeace estimates mortality totalling between 93,000 and 200,000. But even at the very highest estimates, this death toll from the world's worst ever nuclear accident pales in comparison to the deaths caused by pollutants from coal plants. A Mumbai-based think tank estimates more than 100,000 deaths per year in India, including 10,000 children under the age of five, caused by pollutants that could be avoided with a switch from coal to non-polluting nuclear power. Of course, continued progress must be made to improve the safety and reduce the cost of nuclear power, and such efforts are underway. But even with current technology, nuclear power is far less damaging to humans than many alternatives. Both the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, co-winner of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, and the United Nations Climate Change Conference recommend nuclear power as part of the solution to climate change. For the sake of our health and prosperity, and for the sake of our planet, it is vital that the emotional fear of nuclear power gives way to more responsible decision making.

Members of the European Parliament said the declaration would increase pressure on the incoming EU executive, expected to start work on Dec. 1, to take a stronger leading role in the global fight against climate change. They plan to pass the symbolic declaration during a debate on the United Nations' COP25 climate summit, which opens on Dec. 2 in Madrid. Lawmakers also stressed the declaration needed to be backed up with action. ""For me, it is not enough to declare a climate emergency,"" Mohammed Chahim, the S&;D's leading lawmaker on the parliament's resolution ahead of the U.N. summit, told Reuters, drawing the parallel to a house being on fire. ""This resolution to the COP25 is the water to put out the fire,"" Chahim said, adding: ""It is a message to the world: we do not only want to be leaders, we are (also) taking the right measures."" Other political groups backing the S&;D proposal included the Greens, the centrist Renew and the left-wing GUE, and it was expected to pass with support from independent lawmakers. The parliament has repeatedly pressed the European Commission to take a stronger stance on climate change. The new president of the executive Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has said combating climate change will be among her top priorities and has set out a ""European Green Deal"" intended to achieve ""climate neutrality"" - or adding no greenhouse gases to the atmosphere beyond what can be absorbed - by 2050. Current targets aim to cut the EU's greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030 from 1990 levels. Von der Leyen hopes to raise the goal to at least 50%. All but three of the EU's 28 member states have signed up to this objective, but objections from Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic prevented the bloc promoting its stance at a U.N. climate action summit in September. Several countries, regions and organizations have symbolically declared a ""climate emergency"" to emphasize the urgency of the issue.

The differences are stark. Bright red electric buses glide serenely by, while their old diesel-powered, smoke-belching counterparts grind to a halt with a thunderous clatter. ""I use the new electric buses a lot. They're much quieter,"" said 26-year-old university student Camilo Miranda. ""People often overlook noise pollution in a city where air quality has always been the main concern."" Santiago, a city of 5.6 million people, has positioned itself as a global leader in the use of electric buses, as the South American nation pushes forward with ambitious plans to adopt cleaner energy and cut emissions from public transport. With 386 electric buses, accounting for 6 per cent of the city's fleet, Santiago has by far the largest fleet outside of global front-runner China, according to the World Resources Institute, a U.S.-based think-tank. Worldwide, cities account for about three-quarters of carbon emissions and consume more than two-thirds of energy, meaning their success or failure in cutting emissions will have a big impact on whether global warming stays within agreed limits. Chile will be keen to highlight Santiago's use of electric buses when the city hosts this year's UN climate conference ( COP25 ) in December. In June, the government unveiled a more ambitious climate action plan that included targets to shut all coal power plants by 2040 and become a carbon-neutral economy by 2050, in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement to curb global warming. In Santiago, it is also hoped the zero-emission buses can help improve poor air quality, which sees a dense smog settle over the city on most cold winter days. ""Ahead of the COP25 , we want to reinforce the image of Chile as a country that has mobilized new public transport technologies with a focus on clean solutions,"" Chile's Transport Minister Gloria Hutt told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

This election has been telling as to how shallow we have become as voters. The good news is at least 4.7 million ballots have been cast in advance polls so interest is there. Say what you want about the fact Justin Trudeau has been involved in some well documented controversies and even the dubious SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal among others, the Liberal campaign team has done a masterful job in glossing them over and the Conservatives failing to take advantage of it. All are serious allegations that get defibrillator length attention but then everyone forgets about it and then moves on to the next thing. Much like a movie or video. The ""do first, ask forgiveness later"" method works for Trudeau as there are media stories of Trudeau being the ""most apologetic leader"" ever. And that's just it, it is always stories like that get the most attention. To get a look at the issues check out the overview done by The Globe and Mail - theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-party-platformsguide-canadian-federalelection-2019/In social media's clickbait style of determining what is most desirable for us to read, such as stories on how apologetic Justin is all the time, we forget that the economy isn't in good shape, the east coast is hurting unemployment wise, provinces are fighting amongst themselves, a petroleum industry almost being dismantled without a solid plan in place for those thrown out of work or adjusting to alternative sources for energy and how that will effect ordinary life. Think of everyone switching to electric cars and solar/wind energy to power residential areas; think of the grids which need replacing as everyone plugs their vehicles at home in? Those issues are ignored. Trudeau in his own way has successfully emulated his father in regards to use charm to mesmerize voters. Whereas Pierre Elliott silenced people with his overthe-top scholarly arrogance, adding a dash of suave jetsetting, Justin silences questions about controversy and the fact that the economy is tanking with people across the country without jobs or at least decent paying ones is getting little to no attention. Whenever the petroleum industry comes up, it has been cast as a negative and turns into an environmental debate. Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, who is supportive of the energy sector, doesn't seem to be getting his message across. He stands at a podium smiling and trying to get his message across; he flatlines. NDP leader Jagmeet Singh has been getting more attention as his soundbites from the English debate went over well. The Canadian media seems more worried about a 16-year-old Swedish student who somehow captured media attention in the United States with speeches to the 2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference , and the 2019 United Nations Climate Action Summit in September. Is our lack of looking at the major issues because of a lack of time? Our society is so focused on money and status, perhaps because of necessity or perhaps were just selfish and greedy, doesn't that say a lot about who we are voting for and why? Perhaps it is as simple as we are busy trying to earn a paycheque either through multiple employers or high intensity and high energy jobs that we are so mentally and emotionally spent that we don't have the energy to make an informed choice. Has social media just taught us our attention spans are 30 seconds long? That we prefer mindless drivel to having to read actual paragraphs, actual content that makes us think? If one sits down and spends a lot of time researching each of the parties, finds out all the information what the parties stand for, what the histories of all the leaders are, we all may be surprised.

UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa said representatives of the body that organizes the annual conference had accepted Spain's offer to host it in the country's capital Dec. 2-13. Chilean President Sebastian Pinera had announced Wednesday that he was cancelling plans to host the meeting, as well as a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders, to focus on restoring security in his country following weeks of protests in which at least a dozen people have died. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's office offered to step in at short notice Thursday, sending delegates from around the world scrambling to change their travel plans. Sanchez, who is facing a national election on Nov. 10, celebrated Friday's decision. ""Excellent news: Madrid will host the global climate meeting from Dec. 2-13. Spain is already at work to guarantee its staging of COP25 . Our government firmly keeps its commitment to lasting progress and a just ecological transition,"" Sanchez wrote on Twitter. Among those who were planning to attend the conference in Chile was Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, whose climate protests have helped inspire tens of thousands of mostly young people to take to the streets demanding greater efforts from world leaders. The teenager made a high-profile crossing from England to New York by sailboat earlier this year and planned to travel overland to Santiago to speak at the meeting. Thunberg refuses to fly because of aviation's big carbon footprint. After the move to Madrid was confirmed Friday, Thunberg appealed for help. ""It turns out I've travelled half around the world, the wrong way,"" she tweeted. ""Now I need to find a way to cross the Atlantic in November . . . ,"" she added. ""If anyone could help me find transport I would be so grateful."" Thunberg voiced regret about not being able to visit Central and South America as planned, saying she had been looking forward to doing so. ""But this is of course not about me, my experiences or where I wish to travel. We're in a climate and ecological emergency,"" she said. It wasn't immediately clear on what scale the conference will be held in Madrid. Last year's climate conference in Katowice, Poland, was attended by more than 20,000 people. The 25th Conference of the Parties, or COP25 , is meant to work out some of the remaining unresolved issue on the rules that countries have to follow in their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The meetings have also become a venue for countries to announce new initiatives to respond to global warming. \"
"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada52","There's only one valid carbon target - zero; We need leaders with plans for a postcarbon economy, says Peter McCartney","August 8, 2019 Thursday","Fort Saskatchewan Record","I can forgive most people for glazing over at the mention of climate targets. They're the stuff of wonky technocrats, hardly inspiring transformative change. For almost 30 years, Canadian governments have promised to reduce carbon pollution, mostly from the burning of coal, oil and gas. And they've done a miserable job at it. I was born in 1991. For my entire life, governments have been setting climate targets and failing to meet them. At the first United Nations climate change conference , the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, Canada promised emissions cuts to 1990 levels by the year 2000. Instead, we increased pollution by 19 per cent. Under the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, we said we would drop emissions to six per cent below our previous target by 2012. Then we grew our total by another 3.5 per cent. In Copenhagen in 2009, Canada set a new target to reduce carbon emissions by 17 per cent below 2005 levels by 2020. As of 2017, we've reduced them just two per cent. Finally, in the Paris Agreement in 2015, we proudly announced we would cut pollution by 30 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030. We're currently on track to miss that target, with just a 12.5-per-cent decrease. Targets are supposed to hold the government of the day accountable, but do they? Has there been any real accountability for the three decades we've dithered while the world has warmed and communities worldwide have suffered from floods, fires, storms, drought, disease and conflict? Our targets don't even go far enough. Globally, they amount to more than double the temperature rise scientists consider safe. At the end of the day, there's only one target that ultimately matters - zero. Our best scientists tell us we need to eliminate carbon pollution by 2050 in order to stabilize the global climate at safe levels. On a global scale, that means drawing as much or more carbon down from the atmosphere as we put into it. Our leaders need to detail when and how we will reach this post-carbon economy. Planning to switch from coal power to fracked gas and reduce per-barrel emissions from the tarsands while only expanding fossil-fuel exports just isn't going to cut it. Here's the good news - life can get better as we build this new economy. There's a tremendous amount of work to be done and well-paying hard-hat union jobs to do it. We need to retrofit every building in the country, change the way we manage our forests and farms, unleash affordable public transit just about everywhere and build renewable energy from coast-to-coast-to-coast. Approving one last liquefied natural gas plant or tarsands mine on the false hope that we might squeeze it into our deeply inadequate targets is downright irresponsible. Oil and gas is already Canada's single most polluting sector and the only one continuing to grow its emissions. New fossil-fuel projects cannot help us get to a post-carbon economy just like light cigarettes don't help anyone quit smoking. I'm from Calgary. I've got plenty of friends and family working in oil and gas. But they can see the writing on the wall as well as anyone. Albertans know the world is changing, they just want to know we have a place in this new economy that's emerging. Canada can and must bring workers and their communities along just as we've done for the coal sector in Alberta. Offer free education and retraining to anybody under 50 and early retirement to the rest. Any decarbonization plan must start there. Canada will reach a post-carbon economy, the only question is when. And the sooner we get started, the easier, cheaper and fairer it will be.

U.N. climate chief Patricia Espinosa said representatives of the body that organizes the annual conference had accepted Spain's offer to host it in the country's capital Dec. 2-13. Chilean President Sebasti\'e1n Pi\'f1era had announced Wednesday that he was cancelling plans to host the meeting, as well as a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders, to focus on restoring security in his country following weeks of protests in which at least a dozen people have died. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\'e1nchez's office offered to step in at short notice Thursday, sending delegates from around the world scrambling to change their travel plans. S\'e1nchez, who is facing a national election on Nov. 10, celebrated Friday's decision. ""Excellent news: Madrid will host the global climate meeting from Dec. 2-13. Spain is already at work to guarantee its staging of COP25 . Our government firmly keeps its commitment to lasting progress and a just ecological transition,"" S\'e1nchez wrote on Twitter. Among those who were planning to attend the conference in Chile was Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, whose climate protests have helped inspire tens of thousands of mostly young people to take to the streets demanding greater efforts from world leaders. The teenager made a high-profile crossing from England to New York by sailboat earlier this year and planned to travel overland to Santiago to speak at the meeting. Thunberg refuses to fly because of aviation's big carbon footprint. After the move to Madrid was confirmed Friday, Thunberg appealed for help. ""It turns out I've travelled half around the world, the wrong way,"" she tweeted. ""Now I need to find a way to cross the Atlantic in November...,"" she added. ""If anyone could help me find transport I would be so grateful."" Thunberg voiced regret about not being able to visit Central and South America as planned, saying she had been looking forward to doing so. ""But this is of course not about me, my experiences or where I wish to travel. We're in a climate and ecological emergency,"" she said. It wasn't immediately clear on what scale the conference will be held in Madrid. Last year's climate conference in Katowice, Poland, was attended by more than 20,000 people. The 25th Conference of the Parties, or COP25 , is meant to work out some of the remaining unresolved issue on the rules that countries have to follow in their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The meetings have also become a venue for countries to announce new initiatives to respond to global warming. ___ Follow AP's full coverage of climate change issues at HYPERLINK https://www.apnews.com/Climate https://www.apnews.com/Climate \"

""I'm convinced that Europe will be in a position to negotiate with China, with India, with the United States, with Russia in a way that will allow all to understand that this must be a collective effort and that they all will have to correct their policies in order to be able to drastically reduce the emissions,"" Guterres said. He also said that the ""addiction to coal"" in parts of Asia could undermine climate action. ""Our strong recommendation is for countries to think seriously before building new coal power plants and for those that can do it to start phasing out the old ones,"" he said. ___ The above item has been corrected to show that Guterres expressed disappointment with all countries, not just the big polluters. ___ 12:25 p.m. Spain's interim prime minister says ""only a handful of fanatics deny the evidence"" of climate change - without naming any individuals or countries. In a speech at the opening of a two-week climate summit in Madrid, Pedro S\'e1nchez said ""alternative facts"" must be fought back with actions. The leader of Spain's Socialists, who is trying to assemble enough parliamentary support to remain in government, offered to host the summit after Chile was rocked by a wave of anti-government protests. ""There is no wall that will protect any country, as powerful as it might be,"" he said, calling for Europe to lead the global efforts for de-carbonization. S\'e1nchez also said development should not ignore women and the environment. Noting the contribution of Eunice Foote, the 19th-century U.S. female scientist who was one of the first people to see signs of global warming, S\'e1nchez also said that development should not ignore ""women or the physical limits of the environment."" ___ 11:30 a.m. U.N. chief Ant\'f3nio Guterres says the world has a choice to tackle climate change or surrender, asking countries to decide whether they ""really want to be remembered as the generation that buried its head in the sand, that fiddled while the planet burned?"" Speaking Monday at the opening of a two-week U.N. climate meeting in Madrid, Guterres said new data shows levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases have hit a record high. He noted that some countries are still building coal-fired power plants, adding that unless the world stops burning coal ""all our efforts to tackle climate change will be doomed."" Guterres said that big greenhouse gas emitters in particular need to step up their efforts or risk steep temperature rises by the end of the century: ""The impact on all life on the planet - including ours - will be catastrophic."" ___ 10:20 a.m. Democratic members of Congress say the United States remains committed to the Paris climate accord despite President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the 2015 agreement. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told an audience Monday at this year's U.N. climate meeting in Madrid that ""we're still in it."" Pelosi, who led a delegation of more than a dozen members of Congress to the Spanish capital, said climate change poses a threat to public health, the economy and national security. The congressional group is separate from the official U.S. delegation at the ' COP25 ' conference, which is led by Ambassador Marcia Bernicat, a senior State Department official. The United States technically remains a member of the Paris accord until Nov. 4, 2020. ___ 8:35 a.m. Delegates from almost 200 countries have begun a two-week international climate conference in Madrid that seeks to step up efforts to stop global warming. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is warning that the efforts so far are insufficient to overcome the ""point of no return"" in climate change. ""What is lacking is political will,"" Guterres told reporters on the eve of the COP25 meeting, which opened Monday. The summit, which moved to the Spanish capital after Chile had to pull out amid anti-government protests, aims to put the finishing touches to the rules governing the 2015 Paris accord.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada55","Paris won't fix the 'climate crisis'","November 15, 2019 Friday","National Post (f/k/a The Financial Post) (Canada)","Preparations are underway for COP25 , a global climate conference of thousands of politicians and observers that opens Dec. 2 in Madrid. It originally was going to be hosted by Chile but that got changed because of riots sparked by hikes in transit fares and electricity prices - of which there will be many more if COP25 participants have their way. One COP25 The media says it was to reduce global CO2 emissions. But that's not what the agreement says or does. It does not require any country to reduce its emissions. Some of the planet's largest emitters have said they will increase theirs - not just a little, but a lot. China, the world's largest emitter, accounts for 29 per cent of global CO2. India, with its for now less developed economy, is responsible for another seven per cent. Yet both countries project increased emissions without any numerical limit. Even if all 195 nations that signed the Paris Agreement do what they have said they will do, the net effect will be no significant reduction in CO2 emissions. The disconnect between what Paris is supposed to do and what nations have said they will do is glaring. The current panic over the ""climate crisis"" makes it politically necessary for most governments to respond with dramatic displays of determination to ""fight climate change."" Unfortunately, as Nobel Prize-winning economist William Nordhaus has written: ""The reality is that most countries are on a business-as-usual trajectory of minimal policies to reduce their emissions ... The international target for climate change with a limit of 2\'b0C appears to be infeasible with reasonably accessible technologies even with very ambitious abatement strategies."" Meeting the UN's global emissions reduction target for 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 are not practically possible. The only safe political path between the panic and the possible is to pretend to do the impossible - which is the real purpose of the Paris Agreement. Already, after just four years, only 17 of 195 countries are on track to their targets. If every country met its stated 2030 goals, how close would the planet come to the year 2100 target of 1.5\'b0C maximum warming? Not close. According to economist Bjorn Lomborg, the reduction in warming would be less than five per cent of 1\'b0C. Even if nations stay on track all the way to 2100, that gets you only 13 per cent of the 1.5 \'b0C target. In addition to targeting CO2 emissions, the Paris Agreement aims to transfer wealth. Developed countries have agreed to transfer $100 billion annually to developing countries, starting in 2020, to help them reduce emissions. The U.S., which had been expected to pay about $45 billion annually, recently announced it is quitting the agreement. With the U.S. out, this key part of the agreement will probably fail. Getting the entire planet completely off fossil fuels by 2050 would require a complete global energy overhaul from the current mix of 80 per cent fossil fuels and only 1.3 per cent wind and solar. That is highly unlikely. As Canadian energy expert Vaclav Smil has put it: ""As in the past, the unfolding global energy transitions will last for decades, not years, and modern civilization's dependence on fossil fuels will not be shed by a sequence of government-dictated goals."" Greta Thunberg and other eco-celebrities and protesters focus on the wrong political leaders. The developed countries account for about a third of global CO2 emissions, the developing countries two thirds. China, not Sweden or the U.S., is where most new emissions come from. Yet no one is allowed to protest in front of the Chinese legislature in Tiananmen Square against China's massive new coal plants. Human-caused climate change can only be controlled through universal global action. Every country should do its part, but how much is our part and, for that matter, what is the whole? Without knowing we cannot rationally determine what our part should be. And, with most other countries not doing enough, should we be the exception and do more, or should we also do less? If the planet's capacity for additional CO2 emissions is limited and needs to be rationed, how do we do this, who does it and by when? Blocking traffic or taking a day off school to carry placards provides drama but not answers. Over the past century or two, voters have judged governments on their success in raising overall well-being. A sudden transition off fossil fuels would drastically reduce living standards. Painfully high carbon taxes and big increases in other taxes would be needed to fund massive new energy infrastructure. Are we really willing to do this, for no net global effect, while China and others massively increase their emissions? If not, we need to stop pretending the Paris Agreement will fix the ""climate crisis.""

Meanwhile, IEA output forcast puts Canadian growth lagging U.S","November 14, 2019 Thursday","National Post's Financial Post & FP Investing (Canada)","0.5% Growth of Canadian oil production over next 20 years 1.1% Number of barrels per day in growth over next 20 years 6M Canadian oil production in barrels per day by 2040 19.8M U.S. oil production in barrels per day by 2040 CALGARY Drilling activity in Western Canada is expected to remain flat over the next year as drillers believe oil and gas sentiment is nearing an ""all-time low"" in the face of fresh forecasts that predict weak Canadian industry growth over the longer term. The Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors£nnual activity forecast released Wednesday predicted there will be 13,731 direct and indirect oilfield jobs losses next year. The association has said its member companies have already moved 29 drilling rigs to the United States ""in order to find work and generate cash flow"" and those rigs include the larger, higher-technology rigs used to drill deep, horizontal wells in new formations in Western Canada. ""It has been another extremely difficult year for our members,"" CAODC president Mark Sholz said in a release accompanying the forecast. ""If we do not create an environment where the oil and gas industry can compete internationally, we won't have an industry left in this country."" The association is forecasting that 4,905 wells will be drilled next year, nine more than last year, but statistically flat over current activity levels. The bleak outlook comes on the heels of yet another forecast for anemic growth in the Canadian industry. In its World Energy Outlook published Wednesday, the International Energy Agency predicted Canadian oil production would grow just 0.5 per cent - or 600,000 barrels per day - over the next 20 years to six million bpd. The IEA outlook also forecasted that global demand for oil under two different scenarios would peak around 2030, earlier than the organization had predicted previously. ""Sometimes the IEA's oil demand figures are lower than the U.S. (Energy Information Administration) or even OPEC's outlook,"" said Dinara Millington, the Canadian Energy Research Institute's vice-president of research, noting there are a range of forecasts for oil demand over time. Under the most optimistic outlook scenario contained in the IEA report, Canadian oil supplies will continue to grow over time and would not peak until after 2040. The IEA's outlook and CAODC's drilling forecast highlight the anxiety felt by the Canadian oil and gas sector, given that competing jurisdictions are poised to profit from the continued demand for oil and gas while Canadian companies are left to be marginal suppliers of new production. As a result, CAODC's Sholz called upon the federal government to repeal its tanker ban on oil shipments on the northern West Coast, accept Alberta's new climate plan and guarantee the completion of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion to the southern coast of British Columbia. ""It's time for the federal government to recognize what the rest of the world already knows: the Canadian oil and gas industry is a supplier of choice, good for the environment and the economy, and should be given every opportunity to compete internationally,"" Sholz said. The Paris-based IEA, which advises Western governments on energy policy, said global demand growth would continue to increase even though there would be a marked slowdown in the 2030s. The agency's central scenario - which incorporates existing energy policies and announced targets - is for demand for oil to rise by around 1 million bpd on average every year to 2025, from 97 million bpd in 2018. Demand is then seen increasing by 0.1 million bpd a year on average during the 2030s to reach 106 million bpd in 2040. ""There is a material slowdown after 2025, but this does not lead to a definitive peak in oil use,"" the IEA said, citing increased demand from trucks and the shipping, aviation and petrochemical sectors. The IEA has been criticized by groups concerned about climate change who say the outlook underplays the speed at which the world could switch to renewable energy and undermines efforts to keep increases in global temperatures within 1.5-2 degrees Celsius.

The dire report, released ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference COP25 in Madrid, found that exceptional global heat driven by greenhouse gas emissions mean this decade will most likely go down as the warmest on record. It also stated that 2019 will be the second or third warmest year, with the global average temperature during January through October roughly 1.1 C above the pre-industrial era. Whitewood said Canada was 0.8 C above average from January to August, and that the country is on track to be the 21st warmest since 1948, the year that the agency began tracking temperatures for the whole country and not just the southern half. ""It is above normal, not record-setting, but part of a warming trend across the country... the temperature is increasing over the years,"" he said in an interview Friday. ""The general trend is toward a warmer world and a warmer Canada."" Whitewood noted that overall Canada has warmed 1.7 C since 1948, about twice the global average. The Canadian Arctic has been hit even harder, with a 2.3 C increase. These findings were published earlier this year in Canada's Changing Climate Report .( HYPERLINK https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/canada-warming-twice-as-fast-as-rest-of-the-world-scientific-report-shows https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/canada-warming-twice-as-fast-as-rest-of-the-world-scientific-report-shows ) Fourteen of the last 20 years in Canada were the warmest on record, Whitewood added. The WMO report stated that concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere hit a record level of 407.8 parts per million globally in 2018 and continued to rise in 2019. Sea level rise has accelerated since the start of satellite measurements in 1993 because of the melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, according to the report. Ocean heat is at record levels and there have been widespread marine heatwaves. Also, sea water is 26 per cent more acidic than at the start of the industrial era, the report says. WMO secretary-general Petteri Taalas said, in a statement this week, that ""if we do not take urgent climate action now, then we are heading for a temperature increase of more than 3 C by the end of the century, with ever more harmful impacts on human wellbeing."" Taalas also said the world is ""nowhere near"" on track to meet the Paris Agreement target. Extreme heat conditions are taking an increasing toll on human health and health systems, the report found. In 2018, a record 220 million more heatwave exposures by vulnerable persons over the age of 65 occurred, compared with the average for the baseline of 1986 to 2005.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada62","Africa is the 'fire continent' but blazes differ from Amazon","August 28, 2019 Wednesday","The Hamilton Spectator (Ontario, Canada)","DAKAR, Senegal - As the world has watched with fear and fascination the fires burning in Brazil's Amazon rainforest, satellite images show a far greater number of blazes on the African continent. NASA has called Africa the ""fire continent"" that's home to at least 70 per cent of the 10,000 fires burning worldwide on an average August day, though the agency says the number of fires is consistent from year to year. Angola had almost three times more fires than Brazil over a period last week, according to NASA satellite imagery, which indicated around 6,000 fires in Angola, more than 3,000 in Congo and just over 2,000 in Brazil. ""There are fire management questions in these (African) ecosystems, but fire is part of their ecology,"" said Archibald, who studies fire management and savannah dynamics. ""In South America, the equivalent non-forest woodlands have been largely converted to soybean agriculture already, but in Africa they are largely untransformed."" Savanna fires release carbon dioxide, but within a year the grass regrows, sucking much of the carbon out of the atmosphere again. The fires may push toward the forests but are mostly snuffed out at that border, Archibald said, unless trees are cut down, making tropical forests more vulnerable. When a tropical forest is burned, the trees die and the carbon dioxide goes up and doesn't return to the system quickly. ""The main message is: yes we have a lot of fire, but it's not bad and can be very good for the ecology,"" she said. ""We don't know how many deforestation fires we have but the best evidence is that our forests are not decreasing, they are, in fact, increasing."" Most deforestation occurred in West Africa in the 19th century, Archibald said, adding that Cameroon and Gabon show increased forestation. However, ecosystems such as the Miombo Woodlands, which covers 10 per cent of the continent over nine countries, do need to be managed. These woodlands push up against forests and, because of an increase in population, more people are planting crops along the edges. The Miombo Network, an advisory and sustainability group that Archibald is a member of, is working with the World Bank and policy-makers to make sure there is proper fire management in these areas, she said. NASA research scientist Niels Andela also said that savannah fires have shaped Africa's landscape for thousands of years. ""Fires are therefore often a critical component of these ecosystems and are not perceived as harmful by local communities,"" he said. ""Indeed, fires are often used for agricultural purposes, for example to keep the landscape open to support livestock, as well as sometimes as part of shifting cultivation."" Andela said deforestation isn't occurring on the same scale as in South America. ""In part that may be simply due to limitations of existing infrastructure and lack of access to global markets, processes that drive large-scale agricultural expansion elsewhere,"" he said. ""It is therefore certainly a possibility that this may change in future."" Tosi Mpanu Mpanu, former chief negotiator for the Africa Zone at the 2015 United Nations climate change conference , said agricultural practices known as ""slash and burn"" need to be better managed, citing the over 3,000 fires in Congo. ""It is a great threat to our forests,"" he said of the technique used by farmers in Congo and elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa. ""You need a global ambitious program or you train people to use other practices for people to go into intensive agriculture. You have to organize these small farmers by giving them fertilizer, seeds."" The European Space Agency estimates 25-35 per cent of climate-changing greenhouse gas emissions come from so-called biomass burning, which includes fires that are intentionally set to clear land for agriculture. Most of the fires are 100 hectares (247.1 acres) or smaller in size. Other areas with extensive biomass burning are Australia, South America and southeast Asia. Globally, the amount of area burned declined by about 25 per cent over the past two decades, largely because of savannahs and grasslands being converted to agriculture, said James Randerson, an earth systems scientist at the University at California, Irvine. Randerson said the tropical forests of Africa have yet to see widespread deforestation driven by industrial-scale agriculture that is transforming parts of the Amazon. But, he said, global economic forces could potentially change this as countries in east Asia, particularly China, seek to expand trade relations with African nations. ""That could put more pressure on the African forests,"" Randerson said. \"

Standing by her door, she rushes out into the street, bringing her food waste to the collectors. ""When I cook, I separate out the remains of the vegetables. The paper and cardboard I give to the collectors, and the food to the vegetables truck,"" the 58-year-old housewife said. ""The people from the municipality taught us, and I've been doing it for years. They tell me that later all the waste is turned into earth."" The municipality of La Pintana now collects 140 tons of plant waste from homes every week, far higher than comparable neighbourhoods. That is despite the area having some of the worst socioeconomic indicators in Chile. There are few medical centres and almost no companies or major employers. The news that comes from the area is almost always related to drug trafficking, delinquency and violence. The poverty rate - at about 42 per cent of the 177,000 inhabitants - is far above the national 17 per cent average, a legacy of the area receiving poor families displaced from other richer parts of the capital during the 1973-1990 military dictatorship. ""The people of La Pintana have been treated harshly by the state, with no services, no health facilities, no education. There are children in the street, crimes, a lot of inequality,"" La Pintana Mayor Claudia Pizarro told Reuters. ""But this is one of the good things that exist in the community, and we're a pioneer in this area. We have made efforts to be recognized as a community that takes care of the environment,"" she added. Chile, already an environmental leader in Latin America for its use of renewable energy and creation of national parks, is looking to roll out further initiatives as it gears up to host the major COP25 global conference on climate change in December. These include reducing consumption of single-use plastics, trying to cut emissions and increasing the recycling rate. The environment ministry has recently set targets for the recycling of paper, plastics and glass. La Pintana, however, remains a standout case. COP25 in Chile. ""It's surprising that other municipalities have not copied it."" The process has economic and environmental benefits, since it reduces the amount of garbage residents send to the landfill, which charges to receive it. ""We started in 2005 looking for a way to generate savings to reduce our spending on waste management,"" said Felipe Marchant, head of La Pintana's environmental management division. ""It's the biggest financial burden of the municipalities."" Carol Valdebenito, an engineer who has worked as an environmental educator in the area for seven years, said it also brought the community together. ""The neighbours not only talk to us about environmental things, but about social issues, their problems and concerns,"" she said as she walked alongside the recycling truck through potholed streets roamed by groups of stray dogs. The trucks deposit the waste at a composting and vermiculture plant, where the garbage slowly transforms into piles of dark earth with a musty odour, full of long, pink worms that do a lot of the work processing the waste. This becomes fertilizer for the nearby municipal nursery, where trees are grown for the green areas of the community. The nursery also researches which species adapt best to climate change and dry weather. ""That is the basic concept of what is called the circular economy,"" said Marchant. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2019 Sun Media Corporation. All rights reserved. \"
"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada64","Interview with Environment Minister","December 16, 2019 Monday","CTV NEWS CHANNEL Television, Inc. POWER PLAY WITH DON MARTIN 17:00:00 ET","DON MARTIN: Welcome back. Well, after a couple of weeks, a stalemate in Madrid at the annual climate conference of UN member countries, no new rules were approved even as the planet continues to heat up at a rate faster than many scientists predicted. Let's look for tangible moves in the final results from a minister who was there. Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson joins me from Vancouver. Minister, the way I read it, the status quo was more or less preserved, nothing more ambitious was agreed to. Is that the way you're reading it? JONATHAN WILKINSON (Environment Minister): Well the focus of this Cop, Cop25 , was really around article 6, which is around emissions trading. I think one of the positive things coming out of this conference was the commitment on the part of participants to increase their level of ambition for Cop26, which is the Cop at which folks are supposed to come forward with enhanced targets, and so that was the positive element of Cop25 . I would say the slightly more disappointing part of Cop25 was the ability to get fully to an agreement on article 26 that would enable strong rules for emissions rating. There was progress made, but we didn't get all the way there. I think we took the position, I was pretty public about this, that we wanted good rules that had integrity, that ensured transparency, there would be no double counting, that missions reductions would be real emissions reductions, and if we weren't able to get there then we wouldn't support weak rules. And at the end of the day we weren't quite able to get there, but I expect we will next year. MARTIN: All right. So when you go to Cop26, are you going to bring more ambitious targets to the table than the Stephen Harper targets that were set almost ten years ago? WILKINSON: Well, I mean first of all, the Stephen Harper targets that were set ten years ago would have been nice if the government of the day had actually started to put in place a climate plan that actually addressed emissions. The farther that you get from the date at which you've accepted the target, the more challenging it becomes obviously. But what we have said, and what was in my mandate letter from the prime minister, is that our focus is on exceeding the 2030 targets that were established some years ago. We have identified through the Canadian climate plan over 200 megatonnes in reductions. We had a number of elements in the platform that spoke to more, but we have a ways to go to get to our target and the focus is on exceeding, and that is primarily the job that I'm going to be working on over the coming few months. MARTIN: As you're more aware than perhaps anyone, we're, what, two percent of global emissions. And the way I was looking at this, the conference ended with a promise to hold another series of roundtables, and I'm curious, isn't it pretty frustrating for you that the key result from one meeting is to hold more meetings. It just seems like the globe is turning their back on this. WILKINSON: Well, I think you could interpret it that it way. That's not the way I interpret it. I was there. I had bilateral meetings with a whole range of countries, and groupings of countries from around the world. I had the opportunity to meet the UN Secretary-General. I think the general feeling very much is we all understand we have to raise the level of ambition. We need to actually move forward with meeting and exceeding the targets that the countries have made. I think everybody understands that. The thing that didn't get done at this conference was simply the article six issue around emissions trading. That is important because it can help us to ratchet up the level of ambition, but that is not the Paris agreement. That is one small part of it. My sense is the momentum is there. I think the test of it will be Cop26 when people need to come forward, countries need to come forward with new targets and plans as to how they're going to meet them. MARTIN: Correct me if I'm wrong, the problem always seems to be that the developed countries are being asked to help the developing countries with monetary incentives to increase their ambitions and reducing emissions, and when the rich countries don't want to pay for it. Is that not the stalemate we're in here? WILKINSON: Well not entirely. I mean I do think there was a lot of conversation around issues associated with financial assistance for adaptation to climate impact. As you know, Canada made a commitment of $2.65 billion a few years ago for a period of five years. Others in the developed world made the same kinds of commitments. And again, at Cop26 the idea is that we will come forward and look at those arrangements as we look at additional ratcheting up of the targets, but it's entirely understandable that a lot of the developed world is looking to the, the developing world is looking to the developed world for some assistance in helping them to manage to develop their economies in a non-hydrocarbon intensive way, and to help them manage some of the impacts of climate change that were caused largely by emissions from the developed world. I had a breakfast meeting with the Marshall Islands. They were telling me that the highest point of land on their island is two metres. And in the absence of strong action on climate change, they simply don't live there anymore. So I think that this is a conversation that both sides have managed to move forward at this Cop, and I think we will manage to make progress at Cop26. It's an important part of the conversation. MARTIN: On another issue, the Alberta challenge to the carbon tax hit the courts again today. Are you worried? Are you expecting a different court decision that has been rendered in other provinces that basically says the feds are right to tax carbon, or have the right to do it? WILKINSON: Well, I mean carbon knows no provincial boundaries, and certainly our position is that we have a strong case with respect to the constitutional validity of the price on pollution. The Alberta court will hear it. It will provide an advisory opinion. Our view is that our case is strong, but ultimately this will be decided at the Supreme Court of Canada. Both Ontario and Saskatchewan who lost the court cases have appealed to the Supreme Court. Ultimately the Supreme Court will need to weigh in, but again, from a constitutional perspective, we are very comfortable that our position is strong, and I think Canadians in the last election told provincial governments, and I think provincial governments should listen to this, that the whole issue of addressing climate change is important, and two-thirds of Canadians supported a price on pollution. MARTIN: Okay, Minister Wilkinson, thanks for joining us. We appreciate this. WILKINSON: Thank you, Don. MARTIN: All right, coming up, two former premiers size up the political year in Atlantic Canada. Please stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \"

African meeting on Amazon","August 29, 2019 Thursday","Toronto Sun","Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said on Wednesday that South American countries would meet to determine a common policy in defence of the Amazon rainforest, and took another swipe at France for an offer of $20 million in aid. In an indication that Bolsonaro, a farright conservative, is forging closer ties with neighbouring countries than European nations, he also accepted Chile's offer of four aircraft to help fight the fires sweeping through the world's largest rainforest. Speaking to journalists after a meeting with Chilean President Sebastian Pinera in Brasilia, Bolsonaro said a meeting with regional neighbours except Venezuela to discuss a common policy in defence of the Amazon will be held on Sept. 6 in the Colombian city of Leticia. In a statement, the two leaders said environmental challenges must be met while respecting ""national sovereignty,"" and that each country should have control over the ""rational and sustainable use of their natural resources, in line with their environmental obligations and needs of their citizens, including indigenous peoples."" It also highlighted as ""valuable and important"" the use of bilateral cooperation and international financial support to deal with the crisis. Pinera, who has a close relationship with Bolsonaro, is an increasingly important figure in the environmental crisis triggered by the Amazon fires, and visited Brasilia on his return from a G7 summit in France where he attended as the rotating representative for Latin America. Chile will hold the COP25 climate summit in December, taking over from the original host, Brazil. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2019 Sun Media Corporation. All rights reserved. \"

The 16-year-old, who rejects air travel because of the high levels of greenhouse gas emissions involved, hitched a ride aboard the 48-foot vessel belonging to an Australian couple that sailed from the port of Hampton. She hoped to arrive in Madrid in time for the next U.N.-sponsored round of climate talks in December. ""So happy to say I'll hopefully make it to COP25 in Madrid,"" Thunberg said in a post on Twitter on Tuesday, using an acronym for the U.N.'s December conference. Inspired by Thunberg's solitary weekly protest outside the Swedish parliament over a year ago, millions of young people around the world have since heeded her call to demand that governments take emergency action to combat global warming. In late August, Thunberg arrived in New York in a zero-carbon emissions vessel after a 14-day journey from England to deliver a speech at the U.N. climate summit in September. Since then, she has traveled across North America, with stops in Canada's Alberta and Iowa in the United States where she joined climate protesters. On Tuesday, an artist unveiled a mural of Thunberg in San Francisco to remind residents of the dangers posed by climate change.

The Nov. 23 match is scheduled to take place in Chile's National stadium. The fixture was thrown into doubt, however, when Chile's President Sebastian Pinera abruptly said it was withdrawing as host of the Nov 16-17 APEC trade summit and the COP25 climate summit scheduled for Dec 2-13. Weeks of riots over inequality have left at least 18 people dead across Chile. CONMEBOL, however, said it had received assurances from the Chilean government.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada69","Don't forget about climate change in the 'holi-daze'","December 11, 2019 Wednesday","Waterloo Region Record","Chances are you're thinking more about the upcoming holiday season than you are about the Climate Action talks - COP25 - happening right now in Madrid. As much as I try to stay on top of what's happening on the world stage with climate action, my eyes glaze over at the language and minutiae of these global meetings. Are they effective? What impact, if any, do they have on my life and my community? These are the brief historical highlights. In 1992, representatives from United Nation member states met in Rio de Janeiro to collaborate on sustainability issues. It was called the Rio Earth Summit. Three conventions were adopted at that meeting: the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the UN Convention on Biodiversity, and the Convention to Combat Desertification. Participating members continue to meet annually in Conferences of the Parties (COP) in different host countries. The UNFCCC came into effect in March 1994, signed by 154 countries. This agreement was neither binding nor enforceable, but based on negotiated treaties and agreements. The goal was to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations ""at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic (human induced) interference with the climate system ... within a time-frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened, and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner."" That so many countries with language, culture, economic, belief system and knowledge differences came to any agreement is nothing short of miraculous. The Kyoto Protocol meeting in 1997 set enforceable targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in all participating countries within a specific time frame. The U.S. never signed it and Canada renounced it under Harper's Conservative government. The Paris Agreement in 2011 came into effect in November 2016 to limit global warming to less than 2 C but aiming for 1.5 C. Canada committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. The carbon footprint of the 20,000 plus people attending the conferences is offset by the host countries through the use of clean energy, public transit, electric vehicles and purchasing certified emission credits. Individuals attending are encouraged to offset their personal impact. Now, during COP25 The immensity of the task to reduce emissions is daunting and depressing, especially when politicians don't get it. Ontario's auditor general just released a scathing report on the province's environmental plan saying, ""the emissions reductions in the Plan are not yet supported by sound evidence."" At least, Jerry DeMarco, former managing lawyer of Sierra Legal Defense (now Ecojustice), has been appointed to replace Dianne Saxe as commissioner of the environment. There is also a glimmer of hope bringing climate action to city level. Cities account for 70 per cent of global fossil fuel CO2. Scaling down the work to where we live makes climate action plans accessible and doable. Although it also means trusting that others are doing the same in their own communities. Check out HYPERLINK http://www.C40.org www.C40.org for a great infographic on how cities can have a huge impact. Locally, the City of Kitchener is participating in a one-year pilot project as one of 25 showcase cities in Canada to receive extensive support in reducing greenhouse gases and adapting to climate change. We cannot become paralyzed by despair or the belief our efforts don't count. Millions of us, of all ages and descriptions are leaning in, showing up for climate change rallies, writing politicians, planting trees and pollinator patches, choosing to take public transit, ditching gas-powered cars, eating less meat, producing less waste, buying second-hand clothing, repairing rather than replacing, going plastic-free, starting Green Teams in our workplaces, and connecting with others to make a difference. Andres Edwards wrote: ""The shared activity of hundreds of thousands of nonprofit organizations can be seen as humanity's immune response to the toxins like political corruption, economic disease and ecological degradation.""

Disclosure information is available on the original site. ___ Author: Kamyar Razavi, PhD candidate in the School of Communication, Simon Fraser University There is a simple irony in dealing with climate change. To get a handle on the problem means that, at a certain level, the conversation has to move away from climate change. What does that mean? The secretary general of Amnesty International shed some light on this apparent contradiction ahead of September's United Nations climate change conference in New York. ""I think one of the catastrophic mistakes we made in 1992, when the Rio Earth Summit happened, was framing our response to the threat of climate change solely or primarily as an environmental issue,"" Kumi Naidoo said on the news program Democracy Now! ""I think we needed to have done then what we are trying to do now ... which is to ensure that we bring a cross-cutting understanding of climate change and bring a more human-centric approach to addressing (it)."" Broadening the climate conversation When it comes to climate-related economic issues, news narratives typically focus on the trade-off between jobs and protecting the environment. That was one of the findings of a December 2018 study by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. ""Although they tend to choose different sides, mainstream and alternative media both frequently reinforce the assumption that there is an inevitable trade-off between environmental protection and job creation,"" the study concluded. What if the discussion in the news media, and in politics, instead focused on what a post-carbon economy would actually look like, and, crucially, how such an economy would actually thrive? It's the vision of a society and of a prosperous, modern economy that has climate change baked into it. But how does the world actually get there, especially when mitigating climate change is still largely seen as an impediment to economic growth? Better climate change communication is a good place to start. Making the uncomfortable comfortable Mitigating climate change is often seen in the context of making choices that can be undesirable: flying less, buying less, ditching the car. Instead, the choices people must make to fight climate change can be framed as enjoyable, desirable or even moral, instead of avoidable. In other words, things that people actually want to do. To make that shift, University of Michigan sustainability professor Andy Hoffman argues for a ""consensus-based"" approach to climate change. Such an approach treats climate change as a cultural issue instead of simply as a scientific and environmental problem. It ""frames climate change mitigation as a gain rather than a loss to specific cultural groups,"" Hoffman writes. He adds: ""To be effective, climate communicators must use the language of the cultural community they are engaging."" It's important to speak to people about climate change through values that make sense to them. Stories of people taking action that others around them can relate to also have a huge impact. A neighbour enjoying their electric vehicle (and saving on gas) has a far more persuasive influence over other residents on the block than an expert on the news telling people they need to drive less. A different narrative When it comes to climate change coverage, doom and gloom is usually the lead. There is also a heavy emphasis in conventional climate journalism on individual lifestyle changes. Instead, climate journalism can play a much more important role in painting the picture of how a post-carbon economy might actually work. That process can begin with a conversation around solutions that are already being implemented, especially those that are happening through collective action and a sense of empowerment. A great example is a recent Global News report on the T'Sou-ke Nation on Vancouver Island, a community that is taking renewable energy production into its own hands. Or a story in Maclean's magazine about an Ontario town that is working toward a greener future. These forms of storytelling are crucial for the conversation to shift toward a new default position: climate change as the current upon which the economy rides. Ultimately, it will require political will for the world to get there. But support is building, and it's the masses who are leading the way. ""If you actually look at the most beautiful parts of our histories, it's mass movements, it's collectives, it's groundswells,"" author and activist Rebecca Solnit recently said on CBC Radio's The Current. ""We need a framework in which maybe everybody is potentially a hero, and it's not the exceptional but the ordinary people who change the world."" As stories about collective action become a more prominent feature of climate journalism, so too will climate change start to feel more accessible and less scary. In the near future, climate change will not be something big, distant and seemingly impossible to overcome. Instead, it will just be a fact of life around which everything else revolves, including human rights, jobs and the economy. The best climate change story, in other words, may very well not be a climate change story at all. ___ This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada72","Six ways we'll live more sustainably this year; Getting rid of single-use plastic bags and utensils just the start, writes Mark Wessel","February 1, 2020 Saturday","Ottawa Citizen","This year I predict we'll finally gain a 2020 perspective on sustainability (and yes, you'll soon tire of that analogy if you haven't already), by reducing our carbon footprint in response to a combination of incentives, fines and practices deemed no longer acceptable. We'll also become more sustainable simply because we feel good doing something positive about the environment. Here is a list of six top-of-mind actions and initiatives many of us will embrace this year, associated with living a more sustainable lifestyle. 1 We'll pass on single-use plastics. Canada is set to ban single-use plastics as early as 2021, but already a growing number of retailers are leading the change. For instance, Sobeys announced last year that it would phase out all plastic bags by February 2020. Plastic straws and cutlery are also on our collective radar. 2 Reusable will become cool. Further to the last point, one of the most exciting items in my 'goody bag'from the recent COP25 climate conference I attended was a reusable cutlery kit made of bamboo that you can take with you on your travels. The kit even includes a reusable bamboo straw and a brush for cleaning it. You can purchase similar kits online and you'll see them soon cropping up in local stores if they aren't already available. Reusable coffee cups and water containers have been around for some time, but this is the year many of us will religiously take them with us wherever we go. And this will lead to the growing expectation that water refilling stations should be made readily available everywhere from busy streets to our parks, shopping malls, arenas and other public venues. 3 We'll get serious about air quality. Historically, we've always paid close attention to the weather in terms of temperature and precipitation and then, as we became more aware of the perils of skin cancer, the UV index is something we've become more mindful of as well. And this year, especially if you live in a major city, you'll begin to pay closer attention to the air quality, tied to everything from vehicle exhaust to fires (whether accidental or intentional) to yard equipment. Environment Canada already posts an air quality index for cities across the country and other weather channels and websites are beginning to provide more details on air quality as well. As consumers, we'll think twice about burning fires in our own back yards, even if it's legal, because of how it impacts ourselves and our neighbours. And many communities will get serious about cracking down on unnecessary idling, imposing fines versus looking the other way. 4 We'll electrify our lifestyle. In keeping with doing our part to help clear the air, Transport Canada already has incentives in place for the purchase or rental of electric, zero-emission vehicles. Consistent with this mindset, even without incentives, more of us are purchasing electric lawnmowers and snowblowers due to significantly improved performance. As well, the combined benefits of better air quality (including not having to breathe in the toxic exhaust while cutting the grass or clearing the snow) and convenience (e.g. not having to make a special trip to buy gas when your machine runs out). 5 We'll hold on to our electronics longer. Despite the best efforts of cellphone companies and personal electronics manufacturers, we'll recognize that maybe it's not such a bad idea to keep perfectly good products longer, versus discarding them for 'product upgrades'that often really don't matter that much. You'll save money and fewer electronics will end up in landfill sites. 6 We'll buy less and share more. We'll do a better job of sharing our books, tools, yard equipment and even clothes with friends, neighbours and local charities. And instead of putting all of the time and effort into organizing yet another yard sale that attracts patrons who want to give you next to nothing for perfectly good stuff, many of us will come to the realization that it's more impactful and much easier to simply gift these items to a needy cause. We will see things more clearly this year and through the 2020s, living more sustainably, because we all stand to benefit from these actions. And much of the good that we do will take place on the home front. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved. \"

At the protest, taking place at the end of the school term in Sweden, activists presented a report card giving politicians an F for ""failed"" in tackling climate change at UN-led summits over the past decade and the verdict ""Needs to try harder!."" Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swede whose solo ""School Strike for the Climate"" outside parliament, begun in August 2018, swelled into the global Fridays for Future movement, took a low profile as other activists spoke. Axelsson said she thought Fridays for Future deserved an A for effort, but added: ""We haven't accomplished convincing our politicians to act on climate, so I don't think we should pass either, really."" In 2020, weekly school strikes and larger protests aimed at persuading politicians to act would continue, she said. Fridays for Future has seen millions of young people in more than 100 countries walk out of school on Fridays this year in support of Thunberg's demands for urgent action from governments to curb carbon emissions. After crisscrossing the globe by car, train and boat - but not plane - to demand action on climate change, Thunberg said as she was returning home from the COP25 climate summit in Madrid this week that she would take a break.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada74","Climate movement youth offer hope","December 27, 2019 Friday","Sudbury Star","The world is still on track for blowing past the safe upper limits for global heating. The rulebook for Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, meanwhile, has not been finalized, and the loss and damage mechanisms for atonement of western civilization's obscene fossil fuel emissions seem even further out of reach. Yet, I am hopeful because I felt the power of the people I encountered at COP 25 , the latest Conference of the Parties through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This is my third COP and something was palpably different at this one. The explosion of the Fridays For Future and Extinction Rebellion movements across the planet over the past year was felt. Consequently, I have decided to focus on two Fridays For Future youth who attended COP 25 . I was fortunate to attend a session with Vanessa at COP 25 that was about bringing youth and scientists together. Key to Greta Thunberg's success, which makes her impermeable to criticism from the climate destroyers, is that she is neither policy prescriptive nor partisan. Greta and the FFF movement's key message are Unite Behind the Science, which was the title of the event I attended. In this session Vanessa proved herself to be an extremely effective messenger and bridge-builder. Her leadership and communication skills defy her years. Vanessa's youth gives her the moral authority to demand climate action now. What struck me most was the additional layer she brought to the Unite Behind the Science message to include traditional knowledge of the farmers in her country, who are seeing first-hand the impacts of the climate crisis. During the Q&;A session, I was lucky enough to make a statement, which included a hello and admiration from my daughter Sophia to Vanessa. Vanessa knew who I was talking about. When the session was over, Vanessa came down off the stage and we hugged, pulled back and looked at each other. We both had tears in our eyes. I said: ""There is no need for words,"" and we hugged again. It simply was a profound moment of love, which still gives me tears of joy and hope as I write this story. One of our Citizens'Climate Lobby leaders in Mexico is Jorge Martinez. Under 30 years old, he is also involved in Fridays For Future Mexico and is a Mexican representative of YOUNGO, which is one of the official constituencies at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Jorge was the YOUNGO spokesperson at the People's Plenary which was an officially sanctioned Civil Society action on Dec. 14 in the halls of the COP 25 in Madrid. For almost 30 years Mexico, Canada and the U.S. have been trading partners, previously under NAFTA and now under CUSMA. Thus, it is critical that our three countries harmonize our responses to the climate emergency. In 2009, I followed closely the COP 15 negotiations in Copenhagen from the comfort of my home in Sudbury. I knew instinctively it was going to fail because it did not have the grassroots support it needed. That year the Kyoto Protocol began to fall apart. The protocol was linked to the UNFCCC. It was adopted in Kyoto, Japan on Dec. 11, 1997, and became international law on Feb. 16, 2005. The U.S. never ratified it and Canada was the only country to withdraw from it. My personal journey with carbon pricing and climate change began at COP 15. Suffering from climate trauma, I took a month off work in February 2010 and it was then I determined I should focus solely on carbon pricing. In June 2010, I met Marshall Saunders, the founder of Citizens'Climate Lobby, and was forever cured of climate trauma. Ten years later there has been immense progress. Today, 46 national governments either price carbon pollution or will be implementing carbon pricing. As well, 96 countries have carbon pricing in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). At COP 25 As well, the World Bank launched the Partnership for Market Implementation, which will assist countries in the Global South in either improving their current carbon pricing or implementing carbon pricing. In conclusion, sooner or later, the U.S. government will join the coalition of the willing. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, CCL leaders have brought messages of carbon pricing to our governments in over 50 countries around the world. And therein lies the hope - the hope lies within the people such as Vanessa, Jorge and the countless heroes in the climate movement. Cathy Orlando of Sudbury is international outreach manager with the Citizens' Climate Lobby. She has just returned from COP 25 - the 25th Conference of the Parties under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Madrid, Spain.

Chilean President Sebastian Pi\'c3\'b1era announced Wednesday that his country would not host the forum, which was scheduled to take place mid-November in Santiago. The country also has opted out of hosting the COP25 climate summit in December. It said Pi\'c3\'b1era called to offer Trudeau congratulations on his re-election. ""Prime Minister Trudeau also shared his concern about election irregularities in Bolivia. They welcomed the collaboration between Canada and Chile on a range of shared priorities, including efforts to address the crisis in Venezuela."" The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to ongoing cooperation, the readout says. Cancellation catches Washington off-guard It's not clear if Pi\'c3\'b1era gave Trudeau a heads-up, but according to Reuters, the cancellation caught the White House by surprise. A White House official told the news agency that Washington learned about the decision from news reports and is seeking more information. Bloomberg News reported that U.S. President Donald Trump was expected to sign a preliminary trade accord with Chinese President Xi Jinping at at the Nov. 16-17 APEC summit; his administration describes it as a ""phase one"" deal. Protesters in Chile have been making demands for better pay, pensions, schools, housing and medical care. While most demonstrations have been peaceful, some have led to deadly riots and looting. Pi\'c3\'b1era responded by pulling back a planned fare increase for subways and boosting pensions and the minimum wage. \"

The COP25 Many developing countries and campaigners had wanted to see much more explicit language spelling out the importance of countries submitting bolder pledges on emissions as the Paris process enters a crucial implementation phase next year. Brazil, China, Australia, Saudi Arabia and the United States had led resistance to bolder action, delegates said.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada77","French activists use Macron portraits to urge climate action; French activists use Macron portraits to urge climate action","December 8, 2019 Sunday 06:22 AM EST","Canadian Press","PARIS - French environmental activists brandished stolen portraits of President Emmanuel Macron at a protest Sunday near the Eiffel Tower to try to push the government to do more to fight climate change. The protest is part of an unusual climate movement that has taken root around France this year, in which activists have stolen more than 130 portraits of Macron from town halls from the Alps to the Atlantic. They feel the centrist, business-friendly Macron isn't doing enough to reduce France's emissions, even though he portrays himself on the global stage as Mr. Climate. The activists brought the portraits to Sunday's protest - carrying them upside down to show what they consider Macron's hypocrisy - to call for bolder government action at the U.N. COP25 climate talks currently underway in Madrid. Pauline Boyer from climate group ANV COP21 said the demonstration is aimed at showing ""that Emmanuel Macron uses doublespeak, by presenting himself as a climate champion while he is not enforcing a true policy in France that could tackle the environment challenge."" Activists are notably angry that France has lagged on its international commitments to increase use of solar and wind energy and reduce emissions. France remains well behind its European neighbours in its use of renewable energy. Macron has stood up to U.S. President Donald Trump on the need for countries and corporations to co-operate to cut emissions. However, Macron backed down on a fuel tax last year meant to help wean France off fossil fuels, because the tax triggered the yellow vest protest movement against economic injustice. The activists at Sunday's protest held 100 portraits, to mark 100 days until France's municipal elections to replace mayors in town halls across the country. They want to urge future mayors to take local climate action, and some held a banner reading: ""Local elections - D-day minus 100, let's reveal Macron's real face."" Activists are facing trials around France for the thefts, with some acquitted and some hit with fines. \"
"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada78","Latest climate talks end with empty promises, new doubts about global unity and many walk outs","December 16, 2019 Monday","Postmedia Breaking News","Global climate talks lurched to an end Sunday with finger pointing, accusations of failure and fresh doubts about the world's collective resolve to slow the warming of the planet - at a moment when scientists say time is running out for humans to avert steadily worsening climate disasters. After more than two weeks of negotiations, punctuated by raucous protests and constant reminders about the need to move faster, bleary-eyed negotiators barely mustered enthusiasm for the comprise they had patched together, while raising grievances about the many issues that remain unresolved. At a gathering where the mantra ""Time for Action"" was plastered throughout the hallways and on the walls, the talks failed to achieve their primary goals. Central among them: convincing the world's largest carbon-emitting countries to pledge to more aggressively tackle climate change beginning in 2020. ""We are not satisfied,"" the chair of the meeting, Chilean Environment Minister Carolina Schmidt said. ""The agreements reached by the parties are not enough."" Delegates from nearly 200 nations wrestled for more than 40 hours past their planned deadline - making these the longest in the 25-year history of these talks - even as workers broke down parts of the sprawling conference hall, food vendors closed and all but the most essential negotiators went home.

In particular, negotiators came to loggerheads while crafting the rules around a fair and transparent global carbon trading system, and pushed the issue to next year. Fights also dragged out about how to provide funding to poorer nations already coping with rising seas, crippling droughts and other consequences of climate change. The painstaking pace of the talks stood in contrast to the mass demonstrations and vehement pleas from young activists, some of whom staged protests inside the conference hall and accused world leaders of neglecting the most significant challenge facing humanity. ""This is the biggest disconnect between this process and what's going on in the real world that I've seen,"" said Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists, who has been attending climate talks since the early 1990s. ""You have the science crystal on where we need to go. You have the youth and others stepping up around the world in the streets pressing for action,"" he added. ""It's like we're in a sealed vacuum chamber in here, and no one is perceiving what is happening out there - what the science says and what people are demanding."" Sunday's outcome underscored how, only four years after the Paris agreement produced a moment of global solidarity, international divisions and a lack of momentum threaten the effort to limit the warming of the Earth to dangerous levels. ""The can-do spirit that birthed the Paris Agreement feels like a distant memory today,"" Helen Mountford, a climate expert for the World Resources Institute who watched the talks closely in Spain, said in a statement Sunday. The tepid progress in Spain sets up a critical moment ahead of next year's gathering in Glasgow, when countries had been asked to show up with more ambitious pledges to slash their carbon footprints. But Sunday's conclusion raised new doubts about the prospects on whether key nations would rise to that challenge. Already, many countries are not living up to the promises they made in Paris in 2015, when world leaders vowed to limit global warming to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius and to try to remain below 1.5 degrees Celsius. The world already has warmed more than 1 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and current pledges would put the world on a trajectory to warm more than 3 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. In Madrid, a cross-section of small and developing countries accused the United States and others, such as Brazil and Australia, of obstructing key parts of the negotiations and undermining the spirit and goals of the Paris accord. Countries already hard hit by climate change argued that large emitters continue to dawdle, even as other imperilled nations face intensifying cyclones, increased flooding and other climate-related catastrophes. ""This is an absolute tragedy and a travesty,"" Ian Fry, the climate change ambassador from the Pacific island nation of Tuvalu, told fellow negotiators. Fry specifically pointed to the U.S. for playing a destructive role in the talks. The U.S. is in its final year as part of the international agreement it once helped spearhead. The Trump administration has said it officially will withdraw from the Paris accord on Nov. 4, 2020 - the day after the U.S. presidential election. Russian Special Envoy on Climate Issues Ruslan Edelgeriev attends the closing plenary session of the UN Climate Change Conference COP25 at the 'IFEMA. As delegates voted on the final texts, many seats were empty: Some negotiators, tired and with flights to catch, had simply gone home. Those who remained had technical trouble retrieving the documents, even as they voted on them, and continually stopped the proceedings to say they needed help. ""If you refresh, maybe?"" Schmidt said from the dais. Later, as countries were offering statements, Norway's climate minister offered the floor to a 24-year-old member of the delegation, who had taken a 2-1/2 day train ride to Madrid to reduce her carbon footprint. ""Our leaders need to step up,"" Sofie Nordvik said. ""Please you are solutions."" This event in Madrid was not envisioned as a landmark moment in the implementation of the Paris accord. Negotiators had primarily been asked to iron out a set of complex but important details about how the deal will be implemented. At the same time, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres spent much of this year pleading with countries to leave here having pledged to produce more aggressive plans to combat global warming over the coming year. In the end, the promises of future action he had hoped for simply did not emerge. Empty chairs of the delegations are pictured on the last day of the UN Climate Change Conference COP25 One question that proved particularly contentious at the talks was carbon trading, an unresolved but crucial aspect of the Paris agreement. Some countries accused Brazil and others of pushing for accounting loopholes that they said would weaken transparency and mask actual emissions in a way that would undermine the integrity of the accord. After days of a stalemate, officials failed to find a consensus and ultimately punted any resolution on the issue, just as they had done a year ago - a result that many negotiators described as a major disappointment. Last month, a U.N. report found that global greenhouse gas emissions must begin falling by 7.6 per cent each year beginning in 2020 to meet the most ambitious aims of the Paris climate accord. Instead, global emissions are projected to hit another record-high in 2019. The U.N.-led Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change this year detailed how warming is already threatening food and water supplies, turning arable land to desert, killing coral reefs and supercharging monster storms. A new federal assessment on Tuesday found that the Arctic might already have crossed a key threshold and could become a contributor to global carbon emissions as huge amounts of permafrost thaw. One of the few promising developments during the talks came not from Madrid, but from Brussels, where European leaders on Friday pledged to eliminate their carbon footprint by 2050. Though the European Union talks revealed divisions of their own - coal-reliant Poland refrained from signing on for now - they provided a rare example of one of the world's big emitters taking steps to draw up more ambitious reductions goals. Climate activists gather outside the plenary room baker before United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres attends the High-Level event on Global Climate Action during the U.N. Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) in Madrid, Spain Dec. 11, 2019. During the talks, officials from many of those small countries spoke with exasperation about the pace and tenor of the proceedings, saying they had been excluded from key negotiations and stonewalled by major-emitting nations. But the most visceral displays of outrage came from young protestors, who held press conferences, chanted, and pressed - often in vain - for sit-downs with negotiators. The teenagers were part of a broader group that has staged climate strikes across the world this year, many of them inspired by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. ""I am losing all of my trust in the establishment and the people who are leading this world,"" said Jonathan Palash-Mizner, 17, one of the American leaders of Extinction Rebellion, an environmental movement. As the negotiations headed toward their drawn-out conclusion, some 300 people joined in the middle of the convention hall, with one young speaker after the next holding a megaphone and calling for ""climate justice."" COP25 climate summit in Madrid, Spain, Dec. 10, 2019. Outside, they gathered with others in front of the cavernous facility. ""The oceans are rising and so are we!"" they chanted. But a day, a night and another morning later, when negotiators finally gaveled the divisive conference to a close, the protesters were long gone. All that remained were the now-empty hallways, dead and dying potted trees and signs that people had passed each day as they exited the nearby subway, warning that time was running short. ""Tick tock,"" they read. ""Tick tock."" !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved. \"

While developing economies such as India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam increasingly turn to cheap coal to meet fast-growing demand for electricity, some nations are ramping up use of renewable energy, although its share of the total fuel mix for power generation is still small. Asian countries must set more ambitious goals to contribute to global efforts to curb climate change, said Ovais Sarmad, the deputy executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. ""That's a very, very serious problem because ... all those gains that had been made in other parts of the world would be completely negated."" The comment came as officials of Asian nations met in the Thai capital of Bangkok this week to discuss ways to spur regional, and global, efforts to fight climate change. The Paris Agreement aims to limit the global average temperature increase to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius, while seeking to tighten the goal to 1.5 C. Current policies put the world on track for a rise of at least 3 C by century's end. Further warming could push the climate system closer to irreversible tipping points, scientists warn, raising the risk of harvest failures, forced migration, mass extinction of species, ecosystem collapse and societal breakdown.

Firefighters have found fuel cans near some fires that have already occurred, Walker told a news conference, warning those who were found guilty of arson that they would face new, stiffer fines or up to 20 years imprisonment. Already, approximately 1,000 fires have been registered, principally in the central region around the port of Valpara\'c3\£dso, compared to 491 in the whole of last year, according to figures from the National Forestry Corporation (CONAF). ""Very difficult days are coming, we are expecting very high maximum temperatures, also very strong winds. And we have not previously seen the levels of intentionality we are seeing now,"" Walker said. The southern hemisphere summer season that runs between December and March could see as many as 120,000 hectares burned, the minister said. Already since July 2019, 6,800 hectares have been affected by wildfires, CONAF figures show, more than half around Valpara\'c3\£dso where some residents have had to evacuate their homes. In the period July 2018 to June 2019, a total of 1,646 hectares were burned. The Chilean government and the private sector have started a $154 million fire prevention and control plan that provides for some 6,000 firefighters and 100 aircraft. Chile is experiencing its biggest political and economic crisis since its return to democracy in 1990 that began with protests against an increase in metro and bus fares and developed into broader calls against social injustice. A Greenpeace spokesman, Mauricio Ceballos, said the wildfires highlighted how vulnerable Chile was to climate change. Chile was to host the COP25 United Nations climate change summit in December but was forced to cancel because of the protests and Madrid is hosting instead. ""It\'c2\'b4s clear that the environmental decline has turned into a direct threat for citizens and for that reason it's important to work decisively and at a high level to ensure things don't get worse,"" Ceballos said.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada84","Chileans reject president's concessions, plan new protests; Chileans reject president's concessions, plan new protests","October 29, 2019 Tuesday 09:24 PM EST","Canadian Press","SANTIAGO, Chile - Thousands of Chileans filled a plaza in the capital Tuesday in the 12th day of demonstrations that began with youth protests over a subway fare hike and transformed into a leaderless national movement demanding greater equality and better public services in a country long seen as an economic success story. A move to meet one of their demands - replacing Chile's dictatorship-era constitution - appeared to gain some momentum in the country's congress. Marches began in the early afternoon and as the sun set, there was a festive atmosphere in Plaza Italia, a rallying point during the demonstrations. The protesters banged pots and pans, blew plastic whistles and waved the Chilean and Mapuche indigenous flags. Vendors sold snacks, jewelry, hats and t-shirts. The demonstrators, many in their 20s and 30s, pressed their call for changes to a market-dominant socio-economic model that has fully or partially privatized pensions, health and education. They hoisted signs calling for pension reform, an end to the private ownership of water rights or for the resignation of President Sebasti\'e1n Pi\'f1era. ""There's an economic development system that's made us all accustomed to injustice, a profound dissatisfaction among the vast majority of people who feel that they aren't seeing the benefits of economic development,"" said Jorge Pinto, a 24-year-old student of public administration. On several side streets the atmosphere was tenser, as groups of masked protesters set fire to garbage and trees in a local park, before they were chased off by police with tear gas and water cannon. Attempts to march to La Moneda, the presidential palace, were frustrated by police barricades. Some demonstrators are angry about the retirement system, which forces Chileans to hand over 10 per cent of their income to private fund managers and then receive pensions that barely cover a third of most people's monthly expenses. Others fume about a public health system that makes many wait months for an appointment with a specialist, or seek expensive private care. Still others resent university loans that they are still paying into their 40s and 50s, even as 1% of the population earns 33 per cent of the nation's wealth, making Chile the most unequal country in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development group of wealthy nations. Virtually none have been satisfied by Pi\'f1era's response to the protests, which includes replacing eight ministers, calling for national dialogue, offering small increases in the minimum wage and the lowest pensions, higher taxes on the wealthy and decreases in the prices of medicine and electricity. Pi\'f1era, a billionaire businessman who sees the private sector and economic growth as the keys to national success, may be hoping that his relatively minor concessions will calm the streets as protests approach the two-week mark, said Lucia Dammert, a sociologist and political scientist at the University of Santiago. It remains uncertain if that will happen, Dammert said. ""It's really unclear what the government's strategy is. They find themselves facing a situation they weren't prepared for,"" she said. ""This is a government with an intense focus on economic growth. ... They may be thinking that the streets will quiet down as time passes and people get exhausted."" Pi\'f1era's approval is at 14 per cent, according to recent polls, but protests have focused mostly on replacing the constitution, saying its focus on prioritizing private control of virtually every aspect of the economy is the root of the country's problems, regardless of who's in power. ""His proposals are a joke; they're not really the solutions that the people want,"" said Lindsay Silva, a 24-year-old student working on a degree in physical therapy and health at the University of Santiago. ""Inequality affects me every day because my family can't pay its bills and has to make big sacrifices in order for me to have opportunities."" Many protesters want a new constitution to replace the one that was written in 1980 under military dictator Augusto Pinochet and that creates the legal basis of Chile's market-driven system. That idea began to gain momentum Tuesday when the leader of one of the three parties that supports Pi\'f1era in congress came out in favour of reforming the constitution. ""The idea of changing the constitution, of eventually creating a new constitution, is getting ever stronger, and that's legitimate and must be discussed,"" said Congressman Mario Desborde, president of the National Renovation party. ""If the constitution must be changed, it must be changed. ... I don't fear democracy in the slightest."" Six opposition parties control the House and Senate and favour changing the constitution but don't have enough votes between them to do that, making support from governing parties essential. The opposition parties were holding meetings Tuesday to begin moving forward on constitutional reform. From afar, Chile has been a regional success story: Under democratically elected presidents on the left and right, a free-market consensus has driven growth up, poverty down and won Chile the region's highest score on the United Nations Human Development Index, a blend of life expectancy, education and national income per capita. In 2010, Chile became the second Latin nation in the OECD, after Mexico. Next month, Pi\'f1era will host the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, followed by the 25th United Nations Climate Change Conference in December. Pi\'f1era's proposals to calm the protests so far ""are window dressing, because none of the things we've been fighting for has really been achieved,"" said Catalina Alfaro, 55, who hasn't been able to join the protests because she has been busy running a bakery she owns in western Santiago. ""Things in Chile could calm down if he says to our faces that we're going to change the constitution."" Social Development Minister said Sebasti\'e1n Sichel said the government was asking municipalities to begin calling citizen forums as part of a national dialogue to develop concrete proposals for change out of the national protests. He said that if citizens wanted a constitutional assembly, specially called to produce a new national charter, the government could support it. ""This can go where the citizens want it to,"" he said. ""There are no barriers."" _______ Associated Press journalist Marcos Sepulveda Loyola contributed to this report. \"
"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada85","Big Questions For 2020","January 8, 2020 Wednesday","Daily Oil Bulletin","By Peter Tertzakian and Jackie Forrest As we flip the calendar into the new year and a new decade, it&rsquo;s a good time to pause and think about what the next 12 months and beyond may hold in store for the oil and gas industry. Here are some of the big questions that are front of mind as we start the new year. Will oil prices go higher? Tensions between the United States and Iran have pushed the possibility of military action in the Persian Gulf much higher. That geopolitical uncertainty premium has pushed prices (WTI) solidly into the $60/bbl range. Continued conflict could take it higher, though how high would depend on the severity of any supply constraint from the region. Is the U.S. shale oil boom really over? Yes and no. Yes, if oil prices are weak. We&rsquo;ve learned that the rigs go home under $55/bbl. Conversely, more American production can be expected if prices continue strengthening into the mid-$60s and above. Yet over the past several years the &lsquo;boom&rsquo; was driven by cheap money from equity markets that financed rapid growth. Independent of oil price, the capital boom will likely remain a bust in 2020. Expect U.S. oil production to still grow, but at a more modest pace than the past few years. Is oil demand going to start peaking any time soon? Unlikely in the 2020s. Exiting 2019, the trends were not supportive of a structural demand peak. Global electric vehicle adoption rates had stalled, people continued to upsize their combustion vehicles, and the industrializing world is still pulling hard on new demand. Yet oil demand growth is vulnerable to two related factors more impactful than any carbon tax: An oil price spike in the event of Middle Eastern conflict with Iran, and a slowdown in the world economy. What will OPEC+ do? The oil market continues to be well supplied into 2020, therefore OPEC+ members have little choice but to continue production restraint. The cartel delivered some holiday cheer by extending and deepening their output cuts. As for future tactics, much will depend on the Iranian situation. Military tensions are yielding handsome prices, near $70/bbl internationally. For now, that takes pressure off more cuts, but publicly-traded Saudi Aramco will be watching carefully. The Kingdom&rsquo;s oil company should be motivated to defend its share price by defending oil. What are the implications of the recent COP25 meetings in Madrid? By the end of last year, a long list of countries, jurisdictions and companies made pledges to become carbon &lsquo;net-zero&rsquo; by 2050. But the global emissions numbers show that pledges are far from action. Despite all the notional progress, COP25 proved that achieving consensus on united action remains challenging. GHG emissions will continue to rise, leading to more alarm and exasperation. This failure will increase pressure on companies to step in where governments are failing. Pressure on consumer behaviour will increase too. What will happen with oil and gas equity markets? Last year was tough for equity prices, with some company names hitting multi decade lows. While the recent oil price surge has helped to lift share prices, many public companies are still priced below last January&rsquo;s level &mdash; when oil price was under $50/bbl. Stronger commodity prices alone are not likely to bring back a surge of investors in 2020, companies must also prove that they can return money to investors on a sustained basis, and at the same time be ESG leaders that are resilient in a low carbon future. What does Canadian climate change policy look like going forward? Justin Trudeau&rsquo;s mandate letter to his Minister of Environment and Climate Change outlines new measures for achieving greater GHG emission reductions by 2030 and &lsquo;net zero&rsquo; by 2050. Because upstream oil and gas production makes up about 25 per cent of all Canadian emissions, the sector will remain a focal point. But instead of resisting the pressure, the industry is proactively reducing their emissions. In 2019, both Canadian Natural Resources Limited and MEG Energy Corp. both announced their ambitions to become &lsquo;net-zero.&rsquo; Going forward, climate change action in Canada may be led from the least expected places. Will we see an end to curtailment of oil production in Alberta and will differentials widen again? After the alarmingly large Canadian oil price differentials from the last quarter of 2018, normal and stable price differentials returned when the Alberta government announced their oil curtailment policy last year. Curtailment has been extended to the end of 2020 and should be lifted as takeaway capacity expands. More space is being freed up on existing pipelines and crude-by-rail is growing. The completion of the Enbridge Inc. Line 3 replacement project looks positive. All these factors should keep Canadian oil markets functioning well in 2020 and beyond. Have Western Canada Natural Gas markets turned a corner? While most Canadian gas producers would like to forget the last few years of bargain basement prices, the future looks brighter. A new temporary policy on TC Energy Corporation&rsquo;s regional gas gathering system should keep prices more steady this year. Going into the 2020s, moderating production combined with substantial new export capacity are also positive indicators for stronger and more stable natural gas prices. Is 2020 going to be better than 2019? The year ahead looks better than last. Fiscally, more steady Canadian natural gas prices combined with a return of a geopolitical premium for oil should boost the Industry&rsquo;s revenue and cash flow. Western Canadian export takeaway is improving and Canadian producers are increasing the focus on reducing carbon emissions. \"
"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada86","No sign of climate apocalypse; Terence Corcoran","December 13, 2019 Friday","National Post (f/k/a The Financial Post) (Canada)","In the dying days of the two-week United Nations'25th Congress of the Parties ( COP25 ) in Madrid, a meeting described as Kafkaesque in one report, Time magazine Newsmaker of the Year Greta Thunberg said she and her Extinction Rebellion cohorts are ""desperate for any sign of hope."" Well, here are two big signs of hope for today's youth: The latest carbon emissions data and forecasts suggest the UN's climate catastrophe scenarios are way off the mark. Thirty years ago, when Time's apocalyptarian editors declared Earth as Planet of the Year for 1988, they warned of the global environmental meltdown to come. Oceans will rise, deserts will grow, and human existence will be threatened. According to computer projections, claimed Time in late 1988, ""the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere could drive up the planet's average temperature 3 F to 9 F by the middle of the next century."" Not happening. That temperature disaster (equal to an increase of 3 and 5 C) has been officially postponed at least 50 years. ""If the current trend continues we may see temperature increases 3-5 degrees C by the end of the century,"" the head of the UN's World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said in its 2018 report. But even that scaled-back WMO temperature outlook is not going to happen. Recent commentary from two climate researchers demonstrate that alarmism about rising temperatures and global environmental disaster are not justified for two reasons. First, the worst-case scenarios that are the basis for the constant barrage of catastrophic warnings from the UN and others have little or no basis in real science. Second, the latest global carbon emissions projections suggest the world is already well on the road to holding the world temperature increase down to manageable non-catastrophic levels. In a recent Forbes commentary, University of Colorado scientist Roger Pielke Jr. documented how UN officials at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) developed extreme carbon scenarios that were used to create dangerously high temperature projections. The IPCC's most alarming outlook, a ""business as usual"" scenario, assumed that global carbon emissions would reach 80 billion tons a year by the end of the century. As Pielke writes, with that scenario, ""The apocalypse had been scheduled."" Pielke outlines how the extreme became the official scenario. Instead of producing a range of possible emissions scenarios as it had in the past, the IPCC's 2013 assessment report began focusing on one scenario, almost a worst-case outlook, that became the launch pad for sensational conclusions promoted by journalists, politicians and activists. ""Decisions made within the IPCC have contributed to the apocalyptic turn in discussions of climate, moving us away from constructive discussions, scaring children and contributing to overheated rhetoric."" Importantly, the apocalyptic outcome of the worst-case scenario - brought on by 80 billion tons of carbon emissions annually at the end of this century - continue to be broadcast even though there is ample evidence that the 80 billion projection is totally out of line with current trends. The scenario, says Pielke, ""wildly overstates"" even current emissions and portrays a future that is ""highly unlikely if not impossible."" Another researcher, Justin Ritchie at the University of British Columbia, recently produced a graphic demonstration of the extreme divergence between the IPCC's apocalyptic scenarios and the latest trends in carbon emissions. Instead of tracking toward 80 billion tons any time soon, the International Energy Agency plots current emissions at less than 35 million tonnes and more or less flat-lining through to 2040. Ritchie, a post-doctoral research fellow at the Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability, plotted the IEA data on his Twitter feed showing that carbon emissions appear stable and non-catastrophic. The current trend in carbon emissions supports a dramatically non-apocalyptic outcome through to the end of the century. While the worst-case IPCC scenario implies temperature increases of +4 C, the trend plotted by the IEA suggests much lower increases. In an interview, Ritchie said the IEA scenario ""put us heading toward 2.2-2.6 C warming by 2100. Another way of framing it is an additional 1.3-1.6 C from now."" An end-of-century increase of 1.3-1.6 C would still be inconsistent with the Paris Agreement, but it is ""well outside the range of what most would consider catastrophic - more in a range of potentially manageable."" Ritchie, in a 2017 research paper, noted systemic errors and other problems behind the IPCC worst-case scenario, including use of data that failed to predict recent shifts in energy use that shifted earlier coal trend lines downward. Ritchie supports Pielke's argument that ""we are heading for a long plateau"" in global carbon emissions. If the IEA is right, said Ritchie, ""before the middle of the century we are not off track the Paris Agreement goals."" Beyond 2050 will depend on the trajectory of emissions in the second half of the century. Pielke concluded his ground-breaking Forbes commentary with a note on the importance of understanding how ""a fateful decision by the IPCC to selectively anoint an extreme scenario from among a huge range of possible futures has helped to create the climate apocalypse, a scary but imaginary future."" This imaginary future continued to dominate the COP25 meeting in Madrid over the past two weeks, motivating the language used by journalists, politicians and bureaucrats - and filling Greta and others with hopelessness. Pielke and Ritchie offer more than signs of hope. There will be no apocalypse. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved. \"

Worldwide, we are witnessing rising air and sea temperatures that are contributing to massive fires, unprecedented flooding of coastal regions and disruptive wind and ice storms that challenge municipal governments with major power disruptions and private citizens with rising costs due to property damage. For you and government representatives from all parties, now back in Canada, you/we have a problem. Most of the electorate just weeks ago at the ballot box indicated we wanted climate change responsibly addressed. Despite the obvious connection to growing carbon emissions globally and climate disruption, Premier Kenney is doggedly pressing for your government to endorse yet another tar sands project-this one massive! If put into operation, the Tech Tar Sands, projected to operate until 2067, would gobble up 53 per cent of Canada's emissions budget within 10 years of operation! The IPCC estimates that for the planet to have a 50/50 chance of escaping the ""feed-back loop"" of rising global temperatures, we need to shrink oil production by 37 per cent in the next 10 years and 87 per cent by 2050! It is not that we are reduced to no other options for generating power! Example: There are credible studies here in Alberta that, being near the mountains, we have massive geothermal potential for generating electricity. Just this summer, the MD of Greenview announced the development of the first geothermal power generation facility south of Grande Prairie at Gold Creek. Saskatchewan was ahead of us with their first. Shifting attention to thousands of orphaned oil wells, Alberta could readily put unemployed oil workers with the skills they have towards Alberta's geothermal potential. Alberta needs to seize this sustainable and non-polluting form of power generation. It is doable. Iceland generates 25 per cent of its electricity from geothermal. Leave tar in the ground. \"

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada89","Political heat is on for 2020 climate deadline; Climate change conference in Madrid ended late with little progress made","December 17, 2019 Tuesday","Kingston Whig-Standard","The unwillingness of some big carbon-emitting countries to clean up their act at this month's UN climate talks suggests Britain faces political heavy-lifting to make a success of next year's make-or-break summit in Scotland, analysts have warned. The November conference, to be held in Glasgow with the backing of Italy, is regarded as crucial to retain a chance of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times, the lower goal set in the 2015 Paris accord. Acrimonious talks in Madrid, which ended two days late on Sunday, were meant to send a clear international signal that countries would deliver stronger climate action plans next year to cut their planet-warming emissions further and faster. But many of the world's heavyweight economies - from the United States, Australia and Brazil to India, China and Japan - refused to join efforts to present an ambitious united front. Laurence Tubiana, an architect of the Paris deal and France's former climate ambassador, said the Madrid negotiations had achieved only ""the minimum outcome needed to go into 2020 - the year when climate action counts."" ""Major players who needed to deliver in Madrid did not live up to expectations,"" said Tubiana, now CEO of the European Climate Foundation. ""But thanks to a progressive alliance of small island states, European, African and Latin American countries, we obtained the best possible outcome"" in the circumstances, she added in a statement. After language interpreted by climate experts as weaker than the Paris Agreement was rejected, governments adopted a conclusion reiterating a request for updated climate plans next year. It said the new versions should be ""a progression"" and reflect countries'""highest possible ambition."" The Madrid text also emphasized the ""urgent"" need to close the gap between current pledges to reduce emissions and what is required to keep the increase in global average temperatures to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius and ideally to 1.5 C. The world has already heated up by about 1 C, and is set to warm by at least 3 C, which scientists have warned would bring more severe weather disasters and catastrophic sea level rise. There is no legal obligation for all countries to submit improved climate action plans by the end of next year. But if that does not happen, the next deadline for ambition-raising in national plans is 2025, hiking the chances of smashing through the 1.5 C ceiling as early as 2030, scientists say. Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, blamed resistance by large emitters for the lack of a ""clarion call to action"" in Madrid on reining in emissions and providing finance for poorer countries to tackle climate change. ""If this stance doesn't change between now and next year's climate summit in Glasgow,"" the task of meeting the 1.5-2 C warming goal would become ""almost impossible,"" he added. MADRID 'LESSONS' Shane Tomlinson, deputy CEO of E3G, a London-based thinktank on low-carbon economies, said the diplomatic struggles witnessed in the last two weeks showed how important it was to ""manage the geopolitics"" affecting climate change efforts. ""There are lessons the U.K. government needs to learn from what happened (in Madrid) over the next year to have a more successful outcome in Glasgow,"" he said. Those lessons included the need to reach out to key countries like China and India to enlist them in a reinforced global drive to cut emissions, and to build trust among those that felt let down this time, especially African and other climate-vulnerable nations, he said. Claire Perry O'Neill, a former British energy minister leading work on the 2020 summit for the U.K.'s Conservative government, said on Twitter that ""any shortcomings"" from Madrid would ""just make us all double down on our work to deliver in Glasgow."" On failed efforts in Madrid to create new rules for carbon markets, Perry noted it was better governments had pushed the negotiations into 2020 rather than opt for a ""bad deal."" ""We will pull no punches next year in getting clarity and certainty for natural carbon markets,"" she added in a tweet. Carbon markets allow governments, companies and other entities to earn, sell and buy credits for tonnes of avoided, reduced or stored emissions. At the weekend, more than 30 countries signed up to a set of principles which they said ""constitute the basis upon which a fair and robust carbon market should be built."" Their aim is to make sure carbon trading helps to lower global emissions and generates funding through a levy on its transactions to aid poorer countries in adapting to climate impacts. E3G's Tomlinson pointed to political risks that may affect the Glasgow talks next year, including Britain's planned exit from the European Union, which could serve as a ""distraction."" Global interest in the outcome of the U.S. presidential election in early November, meanwhile - close to the start of the talks - could also push governments to delay revealing new climate action plans until they get a sense of whether the White House will get a ""pro-climate president,"" he added. In Madrid, the administration of climate-change skeptic U.S. President Donald Trump was widely viewed as having hampered progress toward implementing the Paris accord - from which it plans to exit. Jonathan Pershing, former U.S. special envoy for climate change, said the UN conference outcome demonstrated ""how far we have to go in our collective effort to address climate change,"" despite a growing push by young people, business and some countries to move ahead. ""All governments will need to step up,"" he said in a statement. ""Next year in Glasgow, we must see real political change, and ambitious plans and national commitments commensurate with the challenge."" Reuters !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2019 Osprey Media Group Inc.

The SDG Accord is an effort by colleges and universities to support global sustainable development goals and urge action to prevent climate change. It calls on governments and higher-education institutions to back up the declaration with actions that will help create a better future for both people and the planet. Tim Killeen, the university system's president, signed on to the plan that includes mobilizing more resources for ""action-oriented"" studies and skills, going ""carbon neutral"" by 2030 or 2050 at the latest, and expanding environmental and sustainability education across their campuses and through community outreach programs, The News-Gazette reported on Sunday. The letter notes that a ""drastic society shift"" will be needed to combat the mounting threat of climate change. ""The young minds that are shaped by our institutions must be equipped with the knowledge, skills and capability to respond to the ever-growing challenges of climate change. We all need to work together to nurture a habitable planet for future generations and to play our part in building a greener and cleaner future for all,"" the letter states. The Climate Action Plan for the university's Urbana campus, which will be updated in 2020, already is committed to being carbon neutral by 2050 or sooner.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada92","Chile cancels APEC trade summit, climate gathering as Santiago burns","October 31, 2019 Thursday","Owen Sound Sun Times","SANTIAGO Chile withdrew on Wednesday as the host of an APEC summit next month at which the United States and China had been expected to sign a deal to ease trade tensions hurting the global economy, as raging street protests gripping the South American country. The abrupt move - which came after weeks of riots over inequality in Chile that have left at least 18 people dead - left the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in disarray, with participating countries caught off-guard and no alternative venue lined up. Chilean President Sebastian Pinera, fighting for his political survival, said he had taken the ""painful"" decision to cancel the summit, as well as a high-profile international gathering on climate change in December, to focus on restoring law and order and pushing through a new social plan. ""As President to all Chileans I must always put the problems and interests of Chileans, their needs, their desires and their hopes, first,"" he said in a brief statement at the La Moneda presidential palace in Santiago. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping had been due to sign an interim agreement to end the 15-monthold trade war. The cancellation might deny the two leaders a chance to meet on neutral soil soon but the Trump administration said it still expects to sign the deal with China next month. A White House official told Reuters that Chile's cancellation of the trade summit had caught the administration by surprise. The Chilean president did not mention a possible alternative venue for the APEC summit. Violent riots have left large parts of Santiago shut down, with the metro transport system suffering over $500 million in damages. A total 7,000 people have been arrested and Chilean businesses hit with losses of around $1.85 billion. Pinera also said Chile would no longer be able to host the major UN COP25 climate summit between Dec. 2 and Dec. 13. The climate summit would have brought delegates from around 190 nations to talks aimed at hashing out details of how to reduce global emissions to meet the Paris climate agreement. The United Nations is looking for a new venue for the conference after Pinera spoke with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres by phone on Wednesday to inform him of Chile's withdrawal, a UN spokesman said.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada93","Climate Commitments, Indigenous Matters Key For Asian, Japanese LNG Buyers","December 12, 2019 Thursday","Daily Oil Bulletin","Canada&rsquo;s LNG exports definitely should count towards the country&rsquo;s emissions targets, says Associate Natural Gas Minister Dale Nally, and it is very important Canada is recognized for the work it does in reducing downstream emissions as negotiators at COP25 work to adopt rules and guidelines for implementing Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. &ldquo;At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s the right thing to do &mdash; converting coal-fired power plants to natural gas,&rdquo; the Alberta minister told a Canadian LNG event in Calgary on Wednesday. &ldquo;That is how we are going to reduce our emissions globally.&rdquo; He added: &ldquo;We just need to keep advocating, and we need to educate some of these ministers at the federal level.&rdquo; In its national statement at COP25 in Madrid, Spain, Canada said in regards to Article 6 (regarding the rules for nations to reduce emissions using international carbon markets) the countryis committed to ensuring environmental integrity &mdash; by avoiding double counting, ensuring transparency, and promoting sustainable development &mdash; so that &ldquo;international co-operation can help all of us increase our ambition.&rdquo; Shawn Tupper, associate deputy minister for Natural Resources Canada, assured Wednesday&rsquo;s event that Canada has a team in Spain that is participating in Article 6 conversations. He said: &ldquo;Our goal is to ensure we have a process in place that benefits Canada, and that we get the mechanism right. That is the goal of our negotiators as well in Spain.&rdquo; In his COP25 Regarding Wednesday&rsquo;s Canadian LNG event in Calgary, its purpose was to highlightinvestment and supply opportunities following recent events held on behalf of the Alberta government in Tokyo and Londonto discuss the scope of Canadian LNG growth. According to Tupper, while in Japan for that event he was surprised with how much time he spent discussing with the Japanese government, industry representatives and investors the topic of ESG, notably in regards to Indigenous matters, including whether First Nations communities benefit from development of a Canadian LNG industry. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just big on their agenda,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They surprised me with the amount of interest and, frankly, amount of poking they did with respect to Indigenous issues, and what we&rsquo;re doing in Canada to find ways to bring forward that concept and that sense and make real that sense of economic reconciliation &mdash; the ability to engage with Indigenous communities and find ways to create that environment in which investment can move forward.&rdquo; Japan, for one, is also deeply concerned with addressing its Paris Agreement commitments, said Gregory John. A few weeks ago he was invited to the East Asian nation as one of four Indigenous leaders to discuss some of Canada&rsquo;s complexities in terms of energy project development. &ldquo;That was a really cool moment for me personally, just because they brought us there to have a conversation on Indigenous participation in energy,&rdquo; the Four Peaks Business Development Ltd. president told Wednesday&rsquo;s event. &ldquo;For me, that really makes me believe there is hope, because the Indigenous voice has been determined as critical, if not essential, to the business development environment in Canada.&rdquo; Finding an energy partner to increase energy security is critical for the Japanese, who are &ldquo;truly committed to finding an energy way forward that acknowledges their Paris Agreement targets,&rdquo; John said, adding despite Japan&rsquo;s domestic energy consumption decreasing, lack of domestic energy means its carbon emissions are increasing. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re looking to Canada as their solution, not only based on our ESG, but also &lsquo;well-to-wheel&rsquo; import. It takes 10 to 12 days [for LNG] to come from Canada and almost double from the Middle East, and they acknowledge that is a way for them to address some of their Paris Agreement.&rdquo; Having a secure, clean and ethically-sourced LNG supply &ldquo;is landing very well&rdquo; in Asia, noted Nally, particularly in Japan due to its nuclear energy. &ldquo;They realize the importance of diversity of supply, and that absolutely includes gas from the western Canadian basin. They are desperate for our gas.&rdquo; Rockies LNG CEO: ESG takes more than being &lsquo;green&rsquo; Nobody is really interested in paying more for &lsquo;green&rsquo; LNG, suggested Greg Kist, as plenty of alternatives are available around the world for buyers. As such, said the Rockies LNG Partners president and chief executive officer, OECD countries should start embedding ESG performance into their compensation structures. &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll start to see the &lsquo;rubber hit the road,&rsquo; and people will be prepared to pay up for LNG, in my view,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;This is an important piece of ensuring Canada has a big role to play in reducing emissions globally by growing its natural gas and LNG portfolio.&rdquo; Rockies LNG aims to advance a producer-led LNG project that (among other things) supports, collaborates and partners with Indigenous communities, promotes sustainable, as well as lasting economic development opportunities for its partners, while also identifying opportunities to reduce emissions. &ldquo;We think it&rsquo;s critical our audiences out there understand that LNG can make a significant contribution to reducing emissions globally,&rdquo; Kist said. &ldquo;Certainly, natural gas produced in Western Canada in Alberta and British Columbia is produced to the highest standards anywhere in the world. We know that and we must continue to talk about this story.&rdquo; For its part, Rockies LNG&rsquo;s proposed West Coast project is engineered around a barge-based liquefaction solution, which the CEO sees as clearly responding to the environmental challenges the partnership faces. Further, he added, generally such a floating project can be built overseas and brought to the location, which further reduces the associated risks of construction. However, Kist noted, the cost of doing that is it also impacts the amount of local employment that can be expected from developing the project. &ldquo;Obviously, we have to address that. It&rsquo;s the balance between addressing environmental challenges and addressing economic issues. But we think floating liquefaction, storage and offloading is the answer to some of the environmental challenges. And so, where are we at today and how are we moving forward? There&rsquo;s a significant amount of work that is going on, and we certainly have not been as public as people maybe would like us to be, but that&rsquo;s by design. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re working very hard with the Indigenous nations to develop the partnerships that will provide that economic outcome they&rsquo;re looking for and that really works for us in advancing the project.&rdquo; Also, the partnership is in &ldquo;heavy-duty discussions&rdquo; with LNG off-takers in relation to co-operation, and Kist would like to see a potential off-take consortium &mdash; an idea Rockies LNG has discussed with the Japanese. He added: &ldquo;I think there is significant capital to build infrastructure that obviously generates an appropriate rate of return. &ldquo;The biggest challenge as it relates to capital is the at-risk development capital at the front end of these projects. It&rsquo;s not huge in the context of these overall projects, but people generally are very averse right now to putting at-risk capital to work in Canada. Right now, that&rsquo;s on the producers&rsquo; backs to do that.&rdquo; How Alberta government helps Canadian LNG Canada&rsquo;s energy sector is currently struggling to raise capital for projects such as LNG facilities, noted Nally, and in terms of his role in addressing this challenge, the associate minister sees it largely as advocating on behalf of Alberta natural gas to Asian markets &mdash; serving as a &ldquo;natural gas salesman&rdquo; on behalf of industry. &ldquo;For a lot of these Asian companies, it&rsquo;s important to have government at the table, because they won&rsquo;t come to the table unless they see there&rsquo;s an official there,&rdquo; he said. However, Nally does not support a direct government financing, as Alberta is on a trajectory to be near $100 billion in debt and likely cannot afford to backstop these LNG projects. He added: &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m confident in the viability of them, and if there&rsquo;s a role for me to help bring people together so the financing can be arranged, then I&rsquo;d absolutely be receptive to doing that.&rdquo; \"

The hit underscores the wider impact of the chaos that has gripped the South American nation for almost two weeks, since protests over a hike in metro fares spun out of control, leading to riots, arson and looting that have left at least 18 dead. ""We won't be able to endure much more of this, the losses are enormous,"" said Ivan Marambio, a manager at the Principado hotel chain in Santiago. ""All the hotels are practically empty,"" he said, referring to the central area near Plaza de Italia, where many of the protests have gathered. The impact to tourism-related businesses has spread. ""Tourism is a very sensitive industry, and we've seen reservations drop by around 50% these last two weeks,"" said Monica Zalaquett, Chile's sub-secretary of tourism. ""And what is tough for the industry is that there won't be new reservations until the country's situation stabilizes."" Demonstrators say they have no intention of letting up on protests, although the streets have calmed somewhat since a long holiday weekend began on Thursday. Chilean President Sebastian Pinera, who axed a third of his cabinet this week as he scrambled to appease the protesters, also pulled the plug on plans to hold two global meetings that were set to take place in Chile - the APEC leaders summit this month, and the huge COP25 climate change meeting in December. ""We believe that around 40,000-50,000 people were going to arrive at these two events,"" said Zalaquett. U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping had been expected to seal a potential trade deal between the world's biggest two economies at APEC. December to February - the southern hemisphere summer - is a key time for tourism in Chile, when many international visitors pass through Santiago on their way to treks in Patagonia, while domestic tourists head to the beaches. ""The tourism industry is very seasonal and it's now when high season begins. It's even harder as many tourism firms in the country have endured a long wait for these summer months,"" said Zalaquett. Walter Olivares, selling souvenirs in Santiago, said his sales had dropped around 80% or even more. ""How do we live from day to day and pay our bills?"" he said. Gale Braily, an English tourist visiting the city, said that she had considered canceling her trip but ultimately went ahead.

The USA is our number one trading partner. Aligning trade deals with the climate emergency is paramount for success. Additionally, at COP25 in Madrid in December 2019, with the help of my Mexican colleague, Jorge Martinez, we met with the Mexican delegation to discuss carbon pricing. On Jan. 30, 2019, while Canada was renegotiating the new NAFTA deal, my colleague Joe Robertson and I submitted the new NAFTA Initial Environmental Assessment. We recommended that harmonization of carbon pricing and climate resilience between Canada, the USA and Mexico be considered. Citing the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation, negotiated and implemented in parallel to NAFTA in 1991, our submission laid out a persuasive argument to reduce carbon emissions. We called for a plan, similar to Canada's carbon pricing plan, to be extended across North America. The North American Free Trade zone - as defined by NAFTA and the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement, encompassing Canada, the United States and Mexico - provides an opportunity to bring half a billion people into a sustainable economy of inclusive prosperity. This depends on forces that shape overall economic potential. Climate disruption is the most serious, all-pervading and costly market failure in history. Prices in the status quo economy do not tell the truth about long-term costs of burning fuels whose emissions accumulate in the atmosphere and trap heat. Climate change impacts and related areas of risk are becoming unaffordable for public institutions, private investors, and insurers. The most straightforward, efficient, high-value way to set clear market signals is to put an explicit price on carbon-emitting fuels, upstream - at the source - and to return the revenues to households. Canada's federal backstop carbon pricing policy reflects this model. The Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act, introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives as H.R. 763, would give the U.S. this model. Mexico's carbon pricing plan, which was designed to operate at the molecular level - to ensure a fee is paid for each molecule of GHG in circulation - could apply elements of this strategy, as well. Under NAFTA Article 604: ""Export Taxes parties were allowed to maintain duties, taxes or other charge on the export of any energy or basic petrochemical good to the territory of another Party if the duty, tax or other charge applies to the exports of any such good to the territory of all other Parties and any such good when destined for domestic consumption."" In conclusion, we recommended that the harmonization of carbon pricing and climate resilience between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico be considered in the new NAFTA Initial Environmental Assessment. This would be in alignment with what was done previously under NAFTA. Cathy Orlando International Outreach Manager Citizens Climate Lobby Sudbury !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2020 Osprey Media Group Inc.

The Nov. 23 final was due to be held at the National stadium, but Santiago has been beset by violence over the last few weeks as protests that began over a rise in metro fares have amplified and spread. Millions have since marched against inequality in what have become the biggest protests seen in Chile since the country's return to democracy in 1990. Representatives from both Copa finalists and the Argentine and Brazilian football associations met at continental governing body CONMEBOL's headquarters for almost five hours before deciding the game will now take place in the Peruvian capital. ""We understand that the most viable option for everyone, and with guarantees from the Peruvian government, is that (the game is played) in Lima,"" said Alejandro Dominguez, CONMEBOL's president. Dominguez said officials had not yet decided which stadium will host the match. The decision to move the final to Peru comes six days after Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said the country was withdrawing as host of the Nov. 16-17 APEC trade summit and the COP25 climate summit scheduled for Dec 2-13. ANOTHER BLOW The move deals another blow to beleaguered CONMEBOL. The organization was last year forced to move the second leg of the Copa final between Argentine rivals Boca Juniors and River Plate to Madrid after River fans attacked the Boca coach as it neared the stadium. Organizers want the Libertadores to more closely resemble the UEFA Champions League, its European equivalent. Many had already booked flights to the Chilean capital and hotels for the weekend of the match. This year's decider is one of the most eagerly awaited in years, pitting Flamengo, who have reached the final for the first time since 1981, against reigning champions River Plate. In a separate development, the Chilean FA also decided to cancel the national team's home game against Bolivia on Nov. 15. A second match against Peru in Lima will go ahead but will only feature players who play outside Chile. The local soccer league program was halted last month because of the protests and officials said they do not know when the competition will be completed.

May emerged from the morning meeting saying that she told Trudeau he needed to attend the summit in Madrid next month to push countries to be more ambitious in their emissions-reduction targets. The Liberals promised during the election campaign to put Canada on a path to being carbon-neutral by 2050, and May said a strong statement from the leader of an oil-producing country at the international summit would send a strong signal to other nations. But attending would be difficult for Trudeau because the summit takes place as the Commons begins sitting again Dec. 5, including a throne speech that will lay out his general plans for governing. The UN gathering - the 25th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or "" COP25 "" for short - runs from Dec. 2 to 13. May said Trudeau told her he would discuss green issues with his environment minister once the new cabinet is sworn in next Wednesday. She said she anticipates Catherine McKenna will be moved from the role after holding it for the Liberals' whole first term, speculating that rookie Liberal MP Steven Guilbeault, a long-time environmentalist, makes an obvious choice for the position. May said Trudeau also promised to bring new legislation to harmonize federal laws with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), addressing a key Green request, and to stave off the loss of abortion services in New Brunswick. A bill to do that in the last Parliament died in the Senate when the election was called. May has stepped down as overall Green leader but is still the head of the Greens' three-member caucus in the House of Commons. Trudeau has sought common ground with the Conservative, Bloc Quebecois and NDP leaders in separate sessions as he prepares to return to Parliament in December without a majority in the Commons. He'll need the backing of at least one of those parties to get any law passed, and his first test will be to get support for his speech from the throne. May suggested she may not be able to support a throne speech that includes a plan to build fossil-fuel pipelines. The Greens elected more MPs in the October vote than they've ever had, but remain the only party in the Commons that doesn't have the numbers to give Trudeau's Liberals a win by voting with the government. That made Friday's meeting more a courtesy than a negotiation between rivals seeking to find compromises to advance their agendas.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada99","Climate crisis is being ignored by those in power, activist says; 'Nothing has happened' after year of protests, Thunberg tells summit","December 7, 2019 Saturday","The Toronto Star","Climate activist Greta Thunberg said Friday that calls for real action against climate change are still being ""ignored"" by political leaders, despite their continuous praise of the global environmental youth movement she helped create. The Swedish teen was in Madrid, where United Nations-sponsored talks on climate change are underway, to join fellow young climate activists, representatives of Latin America's Indigenous peoples, and thousands of other protesters. Before marching, Thunberg said at a press conference that she hoped the COP25 summit would lead to ""something concrete"" and ""increasing awareness among people in general."" ""We have been striking now for over a year, and still basically nothing has happened,"" she told reporters, surrounded by three activists from Spain and Uganda. ""The climate crisis is still being ignored by those in power."" The 16-year-old was followed by a swarm of cameras and reporters from the very first step she took out of an overnight train from Lisbon. The advocate of carbon-free transportation arrived in the Portuguese capital this week after sailing across the Atlantic Ocean from the United States by catamaran. During the Dec. 2-13 talks, nearly 200 countries are meant to streamline the rules on global carbon markets and agree on how poor countries should be compensated for destruction largely caused by emissions from rich countries. An official directly involved in the negotiations said that despite a few setbacks, the technical negotiations were progressing, although many issues were being left for ministerial-level meetings in the summit's second and final week. The official, who asked to remain anonymous given the sensitivity of the discussions, added that a political declaration on greater ""ambition"" - a buzzword at the summit - was proving ""difficult to achieve."" ""A summit that doesn't end with enhanced ambition would be something that nobody would understand if we take into account what the streets and science are telling us,"" the official said. The talks came as evidence mounts about disasters that could ensue from further global warming, including a study commissioned by 14 seafaring countries and published Friday predicting that unchecked climate change could devastate fishery industries and coral reef tourism. Demands for greater action by non-governmental organizations and a whole new generation of environment-minded activists were expected to take the spotlight with the presence of Thunberg in Madrid. Past appearances have won her plaudits from some leaders - and criticism from others who've taken offence at the angry tone of her speeches. Asked about the skepticism on global efforts to fight the warming temperatures expressed by some world leaders, she said: ""Some people want everything to continue like now, they are afraid of the change that we, the youth, are bringing."" ""They try so desperately to silence us,"" she added. ""We are tired of the praises that you keep giving the activists,"" she said. ""We want you to act."" \"

In June, the teens took part in a workshop where they learned how to film, edit and produce their own documentary. ""It's pretty awesome because we could show people how we've been through so much,"" said 17-year-old Carmen Kuptana. ""[We] see the changes happening around here by climate change, and how it's ruining our hunting routes and how less and less we're getting our natural foods."" The teenagers are now fundraising for a trip to Chile to attend the 2019 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP25 ) in December. The students range in age from 13 to 19. They call their video production collective Tuk TV, which produced the 20-minute long documentary. The teens called their film Happening to Us. ""Because it is happening to us,"" said 17-year old Eriel Lugt. ""It's our culture that's being affected most by climate change \'e2\€ \£6 and it's our land too that's getting eroded and that's where our ancestors hunted."" They worked on it for most of the summer, filming their community, interviewing people like elders and hunters about the impacts of climate change, as well as federal Environment Minister Catherine McKenna and the president of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, Natan Obed, when they visited the hamlet this summer. How the film came to be Maeva Gauthier, a University of Victoria student pursuing her PhD on engaging Arctic youth on global change, said the film came out of her research project. Gauthier said she applied for a grant that paid for film gear for the students, and to hire someone to lead the film workshop. She calls it ""amazing"" that the students will get to show their film on an international stage. ""They are very talented \'e2\€ \£6 it's almost nurturing what they know and pushing them to learn more."" Gauthier said the students aren't stopping at one film. They are already planning their next documentary on microplastics, which they hope to start filming in March. Gauthier said she's shown Happening to Us to some of her students in the South, who didn't realize the urgency of climate change. ""When they see that movie, it's a way for them to see something authentic, raw and very personal view."" So far the teens have raised about $7,000 of their $45,000 goal, so four of them can go to Chile. The summit will bring together governments, international organizations and the private sector to talk about solutions to climate change \'e2\€  from renewable energy to sustainable agriculture. The teenagers say they are excited for an experience that they never thought they'd have. \"
"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada102","Greens To Vote Against Liberal Throne Speech Unless Carbon Targets Toughened: May","November 16, 2019 Saturday","Medicine Hat News","Capping a week of meetings with opposition leaders, Justin Trudeau met Friday with the Green party's Elizabeth May, who says she will vote against the Liberal government in confidence motions unless the prime minister commits to measures that lower Canada's carbon emissions sharply. May emerged from the morning meeting saying she invoked the names of Trudeau's three children in her push for a more aggressive approach to fighting climate change. ""I was very clear with him. This is about whether Ella Grace and Hadrien and Xavier are going to have a livable world by the time they're adults. This is not impersonal, this is real, it's personal and it's a question of moral courage."" They discussed a number of areas where the Green party and Liberals share common ground, and May said her caucus of three will be willing to vote for individual laws that are in keeping with Green priorities, including implementing a universal pharmacare program and harmonizing Canada's laws with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. But when it comes to confidence motions like the upcoming throne speech or the federal budget, which the Liberal minority can pass only with support from other parties, May said she cannot vote for the Liberals if they keep their recent course. ""We could never vote confidence in a government that was pursuing pipelines and increasing greenhouse gases,"" she said. The only way to get Green support would be either to stop pursuing energy projects like the Alberta-B.C. Trans Mountain pipeline expansion and the liquefied natural gas project in northern British Columbia, or to commit to more aggressive carbon-emissions targets. The Greens campaigned on lowering emissions 60 per cent below 2005 levels to help hold a global temperature rise to 1.5 C, as recommended by the United Nations intergovernmental panel on climate change. As part of the 2015 Paris agreement, Canada committed to reducing its annual greenhouse gas emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. During the election campaign, Liberals promised to put Canada on a path to being carbon-neutral by 2050 -a move May applauded Friday as a step in the right direction. Carbon-neutrality would mean that every greenhouse-gas emission would be balanced by sucking an equal amount of greenhouse gas from the atmosphere. That's why she also urged the prime minister to attend an international climate change summit in Madrid next month, to push countries to be more ambitious in their emissions-reduction targets. Attending would be difficult for Trudeau because the summit takes place as the Commons begins sitting again Dec. 5, with a throne speech that will lay out his general plans for governing. The UN gathering -the 25th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or "" COP25 "" for short - runs from Dec. 2 to 13. Nevertheless, for the leader of an oilproducing country to attend the international summit would send a strong signal to other nations, May said. \"

Sabrina Kim, press secretary to Canada's environment minister, Jonathan Wilkinson, told the Star that Wilkinson wrote to the secretariat organizing the conference and ""expressed concern"" about security's handling of a protest that - according to the Assembly of First Nations - included Canadian delegates to the climate summit. Kim said the minister notified Global Affairs of the incident but is not aware of any Canadians that were arrested. Fran&#231;ois-Philippe Champagne, Canada's foreign affairs minister, posted on Twitter that ""we are aware of this incident"" and that the embassy in Madrid is ""actively engaged."" A spokesperson from his office did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday. In a post on social media, Perry Bellegarde, National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations (AFN), said his organization is ""aware that a group of Indigenous youth (including many from Canada) have arbitrarily been detained for a peaceful protest"" at the conference. An official from the AFN who witnessed the protest told the Star that security detained the demonstrators in a ""courtyard"" before removing their access badges. The official said the AFN is also not aware that any Canadians were arrested. In her own post to social media, Green MP Elizabeth May - who is attending the conference with the Canadian delegation - said a ""peaceful"" demonstration for ""climate action was pushed aside, with hundreds pulled from building. Youth I met after were still shaken."" She also thanked Wilkinson, adding that the ""Canadian response was heartening,"" and that the demonstrators had since been released. Catherine Abreu, executive director of the Climate Action Network Canada, also posted about the incident, criticizing UN security and thanking Wilkinson for ""promising to speak to the # COP25 presidency to stop this insanity and let (people) back in."" The Star was unable to verify details of the protest or the response by security. UN spokesperson Florencia Soto Nino told the Star there was a protest Wednesday that breached the rules of conduct for conference delegates because it disrupted proceedings. She said UN officials have since met with relevant organizations and civil society groups to ""work on a solution"" to what happened. ""We're very aware of the situation and it is never our intention to censor civil society and especially youth who have been so key in making their voices heard and bringing the climate issue to the fore,"" Soto Nino said. The annual climate conference is part of the international process that created the Paris Agreement, a deal signed by almost every country in the world to restrain global warming below two degrees C this century.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada104","Victoria Falls shrink to a trickle, feeding climate change fears","December 7, 2019 Saturday","Belleville Intelligencer","For decades Victoria Falls, where southern Africa's Zambezi river cascades down 100 metres into a gash in the earth, have drawn millions of holidaymakers to Zimbabwe and Zambia for their stunning views. But the worst drought in a century has slowed the waterfalls to a trickle, fuelling fears that climate change could kill one of the region's biggest tourist attractions. While they typically slow down during the dry season, officials said this year had brought an unprecedented decline in water levels. ""In previous years, when it gets dry, it's not to this extent. This (is) our first experience of seeing it like this,"" Dominic Nyambe, a seller of tourist handicrafts in his 30s said outside his shop in Livingstone, on the Zambian side. ""It affects us, because ... clients ... can see on the internet (that the falls are low) ... We don't have so many tourists."" As world leaders gather in Madrid for the COP25 to discuss ways to halt catastrophic warming caused by human-driven greenhouse gas emissions, southern Africa is already suffering some of its worst effects - with taps running dry and some 45 million people in need of food aid amid crop failures. Zimbabwe and Zambia have suffered power cuts as they are heavily reliant on hydropower from plants at the Kariba Dam which is on the Zambezi river upstream of the waterfalls. Stretches of this kilometre-long natural wonder are nothing but dry stone. Water flow is low in others. STARK REMINDER Data from the Zambezi River Authority shows water flow at its lowest since 1995, and well under the long term average. Zambian President Edgar Lungu has called it ""a stark reminder of what climate change is doing to our environment."" Yet scientists are cautious about categorically blaming climate change. There is always seasonal variation in levels. Harald Kling, hydrologist at engineering firm Poyry and a Zambezi river expert, said climate science deals in decades, not particular years, ""so it's sometimes difficult to say this is because of climate change because droughts have always occurred."" ""If they become more frequent, then you can start saying, OK, this may be climate change,"" he added. He said early climate models had predicted more frequent dry years in the Zambezi basin, but that ""what was surprising was that it (drought) has been so frequent"" - the last drought was only three years ago. As the river gets hotter, 437 million cubic metres of water are evaporating every second, he said. In Livingstone this week, four tourists stared into a mostly dry chasm normally gushing with white water. German student Benjamin Konig was disappointed. ""Seems to be not much (water), a few rocky stones with a little water between it,"" he said. Richard Beilfuss, head of the International Crane Foundation, who has studied the Zambezi for the past three decades, thinks climate change is delaying the monsoon, ""concentrating rain in bigger events which are then much harder to store, and a much longer, excruciating dry season.""

Paul Polman became known as a leading voice on sustainable capitalism while running consumer goods giant Unilever for 10 years and is a regular at the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting for the global elite in the upmarket ski resort. Since retiring from Unilever a year ago, Polman has set his sights on using his sway among business chiefs, governments, finance and civil society to get them to work together on climate change and making economies fairer for everyone. ""If you can bring about 25% of the industry together across the value chain, you can create tipping points, and that accelerates things,"" Dutch businessman Polman, 63, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview at a Davos hotel. His new sustainability consultancy, Imagine, set up last year, scored a major victory by organizing a fashion industry pact to announce at the G7 summit in France in August. The pact involves 62 major fashion companies striving to use sustainable cotton, cut out single-use plastics, and align their business with the Paris climate pact to address global warming. Now Polman wants to convene similar agreements in the food and land sector, tourism and travel, technology and finance, saying these companies had the biggest impact on the United Nations' global goals to address inequality and climate change. He was optimistic an agreement was achievable fairly quickly in the food industry where he is already well connected as chairman of the Food and Land Use Coalition. ""They all want to be part of it ... six months from now we'll have a substantial group in the food sector,"" he said. Polman said leaving Unilever gave him greater influence. ""As a CEO you had shackles around your legs,"" said Polman, who has taken a leading role on a powerful list of bodies including chair of the International Chamber of Commerce. With global challenges growing, governments could not be relied on, he said, adding that chief executives were starting to step up with bolder initiatives. He cited Microsoft's pledge to go carbon-negative by 2050 by removing carbon it has emitted over the past 45 years, and asset manager BlackRock saying it will stop investing in companies with a ""high sustainability-related risk."" ""Things are happening at a faster pace than perhaps people think, but the multilateral process is difficult,"" he said. He pointed to disappointment over the recent COP25 climate talks, deforestation rising in Brazil under President Jair Bolsonaro, the U.S. administration quitting the Paris pact, and the Australian government's reaction over bushfires and climate change. But there was greater awareness at Davos this year about the need to act, including a commitment to plant one trillion trees to curb climate-heating emissions, he said. ""The initiatives are becoming bigger and bolder. Is this enough? No, because you cannot change the world without governments' buy-in,"" he added.

""Our stories have been told over and over again,"" the 16-year-old Swede said, explaining why she and prominent German activist Luisa Neubauer would be handing over the stage at the UN climate meeting in Madrid to other young activists. ""It's really about them,"" Thunberg added of the young activists from developing countries already facing the effects of climate change, including violent storms, droughts and rising sea levels. ""We talk about our future, they talk about their present."" Thunberg has become the face of the youth climate movement, drawing large crowds with her appearances at protests and conferences over the past year and a half. Veteran campaigners and scientists have welcomed her activism, including her combative speeches challenging world leaders to do more to stop global warming. But some say that it's time to put the spotlight on other young activists who also have a strong story to tell about climate change. ""Greta and other youth leaders have been an incredible inspiration and catalyzed a whole group of young people,"" said Jennifer Morgan, the executive director of Greenpeace International. ""And I think that the media needs to do a better job at covering that."" Thunberg and those close to her appeared to agree. Thunberg was met by a crowd of cameras as she arrived in Portugal last week, having sailed back to Europe to avoid air travel for environmental reasons. On Friday, she left a protest march through the Spanish capital early after being mobbed by crowds of protesters and reporters. ""We want to break this up,"" Neubauer told The Associated Press. Thunberg said she felt a ""moral duty"" to use the media's attention to promote others who have struggled to get the limelight. Among them was Kisha Erah Muana, a 23-year-old activist from the Philippines, who called on global leaders to take ""robust and lasting action"" against climate change.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada107","Minister: Brazil can't stop deforestation without help; Minister: Brazil can't stop deforestation without help","December 8, 2019 Sunday 05:16 AM EST","Canadian Press","MADRID - Brazil can't stop deforestation in the Amazon without the help of rich countries, the country's environment minister said at the United Nations' two-week climate change conference. Ricardo Salles, who declined to set a target for limiting deforestation in the coming year, said in an interview Saturday with The Associated Press that his country is committed to reducing illegal activity, but needs the support of developed nations. ""We are willing to do whatever is necessary to do so, but we need that back up,"" Salles said. ""That back up was promised many years ago and we're still expecting the rich countries to participate in a proper way. Proportional funds are really are what are going to be needed for that task."" While participating in the climate conference known as COP25 , Salles is working to assure others of the environmental policies of Brazil's far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro has squabbled with some European leaders this year over his commitment to protecting the Amazon. He has worried environmental activists and others by criticizing Brazil's environment regulator and by calling for more development in the Amazon region. He also accused activists groups, without evidence, of having set fires in that region to undermine his administration. Deforestation in the 12 months through July reached the highest annual rate in 11 years. Brazil's annual deforestation report released in November showed a nearly 30% jump from the prior year in the Amazon, which lost 3,769 square miles (9,760 square kilometres) of forest. Salles said developed nations should help Brazil on the basis of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement signed in 2015 on tackling the effects of climate change. The article says monetary compensation mechanisms must be created to help developing countries. Brazil already receives money from wealthy nations, namely Germany and Norway, to fight deforestation in the vast Amazon rainforest. Norway alone has donated $1.2 billion to Brazil's Amazon Fund since its creation in 2008. However, both European nations have suspended contributions, citing the continued deforestation and questioning whether the government wants to stop it. The Brazilian newspaper O Globo reported this past week that the fund's disbursements this year were the smallest since 2013 and said zero projects were approved despite the fact the fund has 2.2 billion reais ($530 million) available. Salles in the past has questioned the fund's effectiveness. He said in the interview that Brazil is negotiating with the two European countries to restart the program. He said they exchanged draft documents, and he expects them to meet next week to discuss new terms of the fund. Brazil now has ""an appropriate approach on the problem of deforestation,'' Salles said. He said the government is putting a new emphasis on balancing protection with efforts to develop biological resources that can provide livings for people in the Amazon region. ""If we don't solve the economic development for more than 20 million Brazilians who live there and people who need to have this sustainable, from both a financial and environmental perspective, they will be easily co-opted by illegal activities,"" Salles said. ""It is a huge effort to attract the private sector to participate."" ___ Marcelo De Sousa reported from Rio de Janeiro. Load-Date: \~December 10, 2019 \"

""World leaders are still trying to run away from their responsibilities, but we have to make sure they cannot do that,"" Thunberg said at a climate march in Turin, Italy, on Friday, after attending the UN climate summit COP25 in Madrid. ""We will make sure that we put them against the wall, and they will have to do their job to protect our futures."" People quickly took issue with the latter part of the Swedish teenager's speech, claiming the phrase incites violence and refers to executing people by firing squad, against a wall. On Saturday, Thunberg took to Twitter to clarify what she meant. ""Yesterday I said we must hold our leaders accountable and unfortunately said 'put them against the wall'. That's Swenglish: £tt st\'e4lla n\'e5gon mot v\'e4ggen'(to put someone against the wall) means to hold someone accountable,"" she tweeted. ""That's what happens when you improvise speeches in a second language."" She then apologized for the misunderstanding and stated she is against violence. The next day, Thunberg had to clarify and explain herself again after posting a photo of herself seated on the floor of a German train. Nestled by her was a pile of her suitcases and looking out the window, Thunberg captioned the photo ""Traveling on overcrowded trains through Germany. And I'm finally on my way home!"" Deutsche Bahn, the train company, responded initially by apologizing, before deleting the tweet and taking offence. ""Dear Greta, thank you for supporting us railroad workers in the fight against climate change! We were pleased that you were on the ICE 74 ...,"" the company tweeted. ""It would have been even nicer if you had also reported how friendly and competent you were looked after by our team at your seat in first class."" Again, Thunberg took to Twitter to clarify the mix-up and suggested the company overreacted to her photo and inferred that she was complaining about the service. Deutsche Bahn, in a press release, pointed out that the teenager rode in a first class seat. Thunberg said she was only able to get a seat after travelling more than four hours into her journey, before switching trains at Hamburg. ""This is no problem of course and I never said it was,"" she tweeted. ""Overcrowded trains is a great sign because it means the demand for train travel is high!"" This year turned out to be eventful for the climate activist, who, last week, was the youngest ever to be named Time's Person of the Year. Thunberg shot into the spotlight for sticking true to living a low-carbon lifestyle by choosing to sail from Europe to New York to attend the UN's climate conferences in August. Following numerous climate protests across North America and Europe, the 16-year-old told reporters in Madrid that she needs a break. ""I will be home for Christmas and then I will take a holiday break because you need to take rest. Otherwise you cannot do this all the time."" Thunberg has faced numerous attacks from the far right and even American President Donald Trump during her climate campaigning. After she was named Time Person of the Year, Trump, who was Time's Person of the Year in 2016, tweeted that Thunberg's award was ""ridiculous.""

Nominally she is only vice-president, but many Argentines believe that she, rather than president-elect Alberto Fernandez, will hold real power. The Kirchner-Fernandez duo represent a restoration of a populist government that sought alliances with Iran, Syria, Russia, and the Maduro regime in Venezuela. Kirchner, meanwhile, is still facing trial for her alleged leadership of a network that traded government contracts for bribes. Macri's defeat is a loss for the Trudeau government. Trudeau visited Argentina twice in his first mandate and made time to meet Macri on the sidelines of summits from Japan to Peru. Last year Argentina presided over the Group of 20 and Canada chaired the Group of Seven, with both choosing the ""future of work"" as one of their signature themes. Macri also joined with Trudeau to create the Lima Group that sought to remove Maduro without military intervention. Argentina's new leaders, though, have been exchanging Twitter pleasantries with the Venezuelan leadeer. Brazil's radioactive president Where Argentina swung left, Brazil swung wildly in the other direction, electing the inflammatory populist Jair Bolsonaro. The so-called ""Trump of the Tropics"" can be counted on to hold the line on Venezuela. But Bolsonaro is also a climate change denying homophobe who has said Brazil's Indigenous peoples must either assimilate or disappear. Already considered a firebrand even before the world noticed that the Amazon was in flames under his administration, Bolsonaro is currently embroiled in a scandal over the murder in Rio de Janeiro of an Afro-Brazilian council member and LGBT activist. The anti-UNDRIP president It's Bolsonaro's policies, though, that pose a greater problem for the Trudeau government. He's announced plans to throw open Brazil's Indigenous reserves to mineral exploration, in spite of the fact that Brazil's constitution prohibits it. The foreign country that dominates mining in South America is Canada. If Bolsonaro invites Canadian companies to enter Brazil's reserves, it could pose a serious problem for a Trudeau government that says it's committed to both environmental protection and Indigenous reconciliation. Ultimately, only the New Democrats responded. ""We will do whatever is in the power of government to ensure Canadian companies do not violate the rights of Indigenous peoples in Brazil,"" party press secretary Nina Amrov told CBC. Mexico turns left and inward Through two years of difficult talks on NAFTA, Canada was mostly able to maintain a good relationship with the Mexican government of Enrique Pe\'c3\'b1a Nieto. Though each country defended its own interests, for the most part they faced the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump together. Mexico also was an ally in the struggle against the Maduro regime and signed the founding document of the Lima Group. Now Pena Nieto is gone, replaced 11 months ago by Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (known as ""AMLO""). AMLO has declared his presidency the ""Fourth Transformation"" of Mexico (the first three being Independence from Spain, the 19th Century reforms of Benito Juarez, and the Mexican Revolution of 1910). With such grand designs AMLO has naturally turned his focus inward. Pena Nieto visited Trudeau twice, and members of his cabinet also came North repeatedly. Trudeau also made a state visit to Mexico in 2017, where he was feted on a large scale. With the inauguration of AMLO and the end of NAFTA talks, exchanges have slowed, although Mexico's Secretary of Economy Graciela Marquez did visit in May. As for working together on Venezuela? Nicolas Maduro attended AMLO's inauguration as an honoured guest. Cuba: Embassy illnesses and an unsavoury alliance In 2016, while answering a question from a student at the University of Havana in the presence of Raul Castro, Trudeau described Cuba as an ""ally"" of Canada. But Canada's tolerant approach to Cuba's one-party state has been tested by Havana's far closer alliance with Venezuela. Canada has tried to persuade Cuba to stop supporting Maduro, inviting Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez to Ottawa for talks. But Chrystia Freeland has failed to drive a wedge between two governments that increasingly depend on each other. In the meantime, Canada has had to reduce its embassy in Havana to a skeleton crew following a series of unexplained illnesses affecting diplomats and their families, usually attributed to some kind of mystery weapon. The model nation that wasn't One of Canada's earliest bilateral trade deals was with Chile in 1997, when the South American nation was emerging as a regional model of stability and growth. The riots and looting that led Chile to cancel the APEC and COP25 summits came as a rude surprise, and foreign minister Teodoro Ribera acknowledged that ""to say that the country has the same image as before would be a mistake. If I said that, as foreign minister, I'd be misreading the international situation."" President Sebasti\'c3\£1n Pi\'c3\'b1era concluded it was no time to be seen hobnobbing with foreign leaders at huge public expense. He chose to send Chileans a message that for the remaining two years of his mandate his attention will be at home. Bolivia's disputed election Although President Evo Morales is a strong ally of Maduro, Canada had fairly good relations with the leftist Bolivian leader until this week, when the Trudeau government announced that it did not recognize the results of Bolivia's Oct. 20 elections. Morales was running for a fourth consecutive term. Two major Latin American countries that remain relatively stable \'e2\€  and are also run by leaders the Trudeau government can work with \'e2\€  are Colombia and Peru. Colombian President Iv\'c3\£1n Duque was the first Latin American leader to congratulate Trudeau on his re-election, and his administration is closely aligned with Canada on the issue of Venezuela. Martin Vizcarra was living in Ottawa as ambassador last year when he suddenly became president of Peru on the resignation of Pedro Kuczynski. No populist \'e2\€  Vizcarra's image is almost technocratic \'e2\€  he has nonetheless attained 75-80 per cent approval as a fighter of corruption. Peru was the original convener of the Lima Group and, like Macri's Argentina, hosted Trudeau twice in his first term. But those two bright spots can hardly dissipate the gloomy picture that confronts the Trudeau government as it reflects on the changes in the Western Hemisphere in just the past year. \"
"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada110","Environment minister's comments on carbon credits 'frustrating,' says CAPP boss","December 10, 2019 Tuesday 12:53 PM GMT","CBC News","The Calgary-based head of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers says he's frustrated with comments made by Canada's environment minister ahead of this week's global climate conference in Madrid. Speaking to the Globe and Mail, Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson appeared to pour cold water on the energy industry's hope that clean-burning liquefied natural gas (LNG) exported from Canada will count toward Canada's emissions targets through international co-operation provisions under Article 6 of the 2015 Paris Agreement. However, the details of Article 6 weren't finalized in Paris or the subsequent 2018 meeting in Poland, but instead were left to be hammered out at this year's conference of the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP25 ) in Spain. Wilkinson said the Liberal government's aim is to reach Canada's emission reductions targets through domestic cuts, not by relying on credit-trading within Article 6. But Tim McMillan, head of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), says Article 6 represents an important opportunity for Canadian energy to be part of the global fight to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. ""You know, I found his comments somewhat frustrating,"" he said. ""We've done a lot of work with his officials and with former ministers of the government, some of which were very positive."" ""As Minister Wilkinson comes to this conference of the parties here in Madrid, I hope he gets a strong briefing and positions himself as a real advocate for enabling Article 6 and enabling Canadian natural gas to be a global solution,"" he said. McMillan added that it's vital for the 200 or so countries taking part in the climate talks to come up with globally-based solutions. ""If there is a flaw to the Paris Agreement, it is that each country has a box around it. And no matter what you do inside your box, you can't have a global view,"" he said. ""Globally, we're building one coal fired power plant a week. If they have access to natural gas, they most certainly would want not just the gas but access to some of those credits."" McMillan said if the delegates in Madrid are unable to agree to a framework for Article 6, Canada should take the lead in negotiating an international set of rules for sharing in emissions reductions. ""They would have to be strict in how they assess what is a real carbon credit, they'd have to be credible in how accounting is done so that others can follow the work,"" he said. ""But without it, we are going to lose globally. And to look at this problem just within Canada's borders is somewhat myopic because Canada only makes up 1.5 per cent of global emissions."" Speaking at the Canadian Club in Ottawa on Monday, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney also touted the possible benefits of Article 6 in combating climate change. ""I understand that, if we were to fully satisfy the future demand for LNG in China and India, to allow them to convert off of high-emitting coal, to much lower-emitting natural gas, that the incremental reduction in their CO2 output would be equivalent to the entire Canadian economy's GHG output,"" he said. ""I hope that the federal government will seek to get credit for that kind of export through Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. We'd like to work with them on that."" \"
"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada111","Tougher carbon targets needed","November 16, 2019 Saturday","Stratford Beacon-Herald","Greens to vote against Liberal throne speech unless carbon targets toughened, says Elizabeth May OTTAWA Capping a week of meetings with opposition leaders, Justin Trudeau met Friday with the Green party's Elizabeth May, who says she will vote against the Liberal government in confidence motions unless the prime minister commits to measures that lower Canada's carbon emissions sharply. May emerged from the morning meeting saying she invoked the names of Trudeau's three children in her push for a more aggressive approach to fighting climate change. ""I was very clear with him. This is about whether Ella Grace and Hadrien and Xavier are going to have a livable world by the time they're adults. This is not impersonal, this is real, it's personal and it's a question of moral courage."" They discussed a number of areas where the Green party and Liberals share common ground, and May said her caucus of three will be willing to vote for individual laws that are in keeping with Green priorities, including implementing a universal pharmacare program and harmonizing Canada's laws with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. But when it comes to confidence motions like the upcoming throne speech or the federal budget, which the Liberal minority can pass only with support from other parties, May said she cannot vote for the Liberals if they keep their recent course. ""We could never vote confidence in a government that was pursuing pipelines and increasing greenhouse gases,"" she said. The only way to get Green support would be either to stop pursuing energy projects like the Alberta-B. C. Trans Mountain pipeline expansion and the liquefied natural gas project in northern British Columbia, or to commit to more aggressive carbon-emissions targets. The Greens campaigned on lowering emissions 60 per cent below 2005 levels to help hold a global temperature rise to 1.5 C, as recommended by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on climate change. As part of the 2015 Paris agreement, Canada committed to reducing its annual greenhouse gas emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. During the election campaign, Liberals promised to put Canada on a path to being carbon-neutral by 2050 - a move May applauded Friday as a step in the right direction. Carbon-neutrality would mean that every greenhouse-gas emission would be balanced by sucking an equal amount of greenhouse gas from the atmosphere. That's why she also urged the prime minister to attend an international climate change summit in Madrid next month, to push countries to be more ambitious in their emissions-reduction targets. Attending would be difficult for Trudeau because the summit takes place as the Commons begins sitting again Dec. 5, with a throne speech that will lay out his general plans for governing. The UN gathering - the 25th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or "" COP25 "" for short - runs from Dec. 2 to 13. Nevertheless, for the leader of an oil-producing country to attend the international summit would send a strong signal to other nations, May said.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada112","An avalanche of policy as the third week in the federal election campaign begins","September 25, 2019 Wednesday","thestar.com","OTTAWA - The second week of the 2019 federal election campaign ended with a whimper after kicking off with a bang. In the past week, there had been heightened emotions and clashes over issues ranging from racism to climate change. And as the third week on the hustings got underway Wednesday, a visible strain showed on Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau's face. In Delta, B.C., after announcing new climate action measures to help homeowners, Trudeau again faced questions - though far fewer - about the bombshell blackface photo revealed by a Time Magazine scoop. It had been followed by others - three incidents in all. His brow furrowed, Trudeau repeated what is now a refrain: ""I've spoken about the incidents that I recalled. I have recognized from the very beginning that this was something I shouldn't have done. I recognized how wrong it was; I should have known that then, but I didn't. I will continue every day to fight against racism and intolerance because that's what people expect of me and that's what I expect of me."" Several public polls suggest the impact on voters is, for now at least, less dramatic than Liberals first feared, attenuated by Trudeau's youth at the time, by his repeated apologies, by a record of funding anti-racism and promoting diversity, and perhaps by the reaction of several leaders of racialized communities who publicly criticized his self-described ""racist"" acts, yet cut him slack. The scandal had briefly derailed Trudeau's campaign even as it galvanized the others. Then just as quickly, it slid under an avalanche of policy promises unleashed by all campaigns. The Liberals vowed to tighten firearms controls short of a handgun ban; promised a tax cut targeted mainly at middle and lower income households, said they'd reduce cellphone bills; expand public health coverage for drugs, mental health and long-term care; and promised to hit far-off targets for greenhouse gas reductions that seemed unattainable under current measures. The Conservatives pledged cuts to corporate subsidies; tax breaks for seniors; $1.5 billion to cut wait times for medical tests; help for first-time homebuyers; repeals of the Liberals' corporate tax measures that had angered small businesses; and offered tax breaks for ""green"" improvements to homes. The NDP highlighted some of their biggest-ticket promises: $5 billion for affordable housing; $1.9 billion to launch a public dental care plan for mid- and lower-income Canadians; a $15 billion ""climate bank"" and $2.5 billion for climate disaster mitigation. The Greens' Elizabeth May had unveiled a platform with no price tag - and when it came, it was quickly undercut by the skeptical eye of the former parliamentary budget officer now running University of Ottawa's Institute for Fiscal Studies and Democracy. The week also saw Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg rip into global lawmakers for inaction at a UN conference on climate change . She is headed to Canada to march Friday as part of a wave of national climate action ""strikes."" Trudeau has bowed out of the only election debate centred on foreign policy, forcing its cancellation. After skipping two, he will do three others. He may be asked to explain how an apologist for Syrian president Bashar Assad was approved by Global Affairs as an honorary consul for Syria in Montreal. The government revoked it, yet it's unclear why it was ever approved in the first place. As the third week unfolds, details are often annoyingly scarce. There were targets without plans - the Liberals' pharmacare and cellphone promises, and their promise to exceed 2030 cuts to global emissions. And plans without targets. The Conservatives claim they are the ""best chance"" to hit the Liberals' goal for greenhouse gas reductions, but refuse to state their own targets. And that five-year balanced budget promise remains aspirational - with none of the cuts analysts say are unavoidable outlined in any detailed way. Robin MacLachlan, a New Democrat and lobbyist with Summa Strategies and director at Abacus Data polling, said the campaign had been ""ugly"" even before the blackface photos emerged, with mudslinging between the campaigns over candidates' past racist, homophobic, anti-Semitic or anti-Islamic comments. Yet he thinks New Democratic Leader Jagmeet Singh seized the moment, and may benefit in a way that is not reflected in early polls. ""He's got the attention of folks,"" said McLachlan, adding no one is writing the NDP's obituary anymore. Liberal Ahmed Hussen, Trudeau's immigration minister and a leader in the Somali-Canadian community, said that based on door-knocking in his riding and in other urban ridings like Hamilton, many voters are engaged in the election, but just as many haven't tuned in yet. ""Election or no election, I'm hopeful that the conversation we had nationally around these images could also lead to a more detailed conversation about the systemic issues"" of racism, Hussen said, adding most voters he spoke to are highlighting concerns about pensions, the ability of young adults to afford a home, and the environment. Jenni Byrne, a former Conservative campaign director not involved in the Scheer campaign, said two weeks in and ahead of the upcoming debates, Scheer's challenge now is to focus on ""the ballot question for the Conservatives."" She said Scheer needs to continue to present his vision for Canada ""and how families can get ahead, and that can be done from a leader who does not have any of the baggage or ethical lapses that the Liberal leader has.""

A friend, speaking of divisive politics, climate change and the lack of international co-operation, commented that the world seems hellbent on its own destruction. I have been thinking of this while helping to plan an event called Spirituality and the Climate Crisis. One of its aims is to bring some awareness that this problem is not due to a lack of capacity, but is fundamentally spiritual. Our hopes, dreams, values and motivations all begin in the world of spirit, as do our fears and vices. The stunning failure to mount an effective response to the climate crisis seems primarily due to a lack of vision, a failure to imagine a future that's healthy and in harmony with nature. Why?

Large-scale commercial whaling ended on the advice of an international body created to oversee whale populations. A whaling moratorium went into effect in 1986. The Montreal Protocol for the protection of the ozone layer was signed in 1987, also as a result of strong evidence followed by concerted international action. Our modern-day problems can't be solved without unity of purpose, co-operation and pragmatism. Individuals are not going to solve the climate crisis by changing to LED bulbs and using non-disposable cups. As virtuous as those actions might be, they're not enough. On the same day Greta Thunberg was named Time Magazine's Person of the Year, she called out the nations gathered at COP25 for their ""clever accounting and creative PR practices"" in lieu of taking truly effective international action. Sympathy for our situation might be warranted. The problem is enormous and complex, the opposing forces well-funded and clever and the public easily distracted. Now, however, we're beginning to have the advantage of desperation, including in the financial sector. For the first time in its history, environmental concerns dominate the 10-year outlook of the World Economic Forum's Global Risks Report. As Samuel Johnson said: ""Depend upon it, sir, when a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully."" Another change that's finally beginning to happen is an increasing emphasis on finding workable solutions, and away from simply scaring the dickens out of everyone. From David Attenborough's top five strategies in his 2019 documentary Our Planet Our Business to the 100 ranked solutions by Project Drawdown, the tactic is refreshingly positive. Some of the solutions proposed are breathtaking in their scope and expected results. The creation of ocean sanctuaries, protecting 30% of the ocean from fishing and destructive industries, would help to save coral reefs and prevent the collapse of the world's fisheries currently predicted by 2048. This is well within our power. Its audacity makes my heart sing. The poetic and mystical phrasing of the world's sacred texts is often far more apt than the vernacular in expressing what we intuitively know. In the 19th century, Baha'u'llah, the Prophet-Founder of the Baha'i Faith wrote: ""Ye are the fruits of one tree, and the leaves of one branch. Deal ye one with another with the utmost love and harmony, with friendliness and fellowship. He Who is the Day Star of Truth beareth Me witness!

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada117","Despite tough talk at climate summit, world leaders fail to act","December 19, 2019 Thursday","Brantford Expositor","""The point of no return is no longer over the horizon,"" warned UN Secretary General Ant\'f3nio Guterres as the 25th climate summit ( COP25 ) opened in Madrid two weeks ago, and the multitude of delegates from more than a hundred countries presumably understood what hemeant. But they ignored itanyway. The point of no return arrives in the mid-2030s, when the rising emissions of greenhouse gases (they are still rising, not falling) pushes the amount of carbon dioxide equivalent in the atmosphere up past 450 parts permillion. Four hundred and fifty ppm of CO2 drives the average global temperature up more than two Celsius degrees (two degrees higher than the pre-industrial average) and intorunaway. In diplomatic-speak, what happens then is ""dangerous climate change,"" but that actually is happening already, with carbon dioxide at 405 ppm and average global temperature1.1 degreeshigher. We are seeing firestorms in Australia, rising sea levels, catastrophic storms and meltingglaciers. What happens at 450 ppm is that the two degrees of warming caused by human beings trigger natural processes (feedbacks or tipping points) that also causewarming. And once they start, human beings cannot stopthem. The Big Three feedbacks are the loss of the Arctic Ocean's sea ice cover, the melting of the permafrost zone and the release of vast amounts of CO2 by the warming worldoceans. Guterres called it ""the point of no return"" because after that we losecontrol. The warming will then continue even if human beings eventually stop all of their ownemissions. We will be trapped on an up escalator that delivers us into a world three, four, even five degrees hotter than the pre-industrialaverage. That is exactly where the World Meteorological Organization predicts we will be by the end of this century if current promises on emissions cuts are kept, but no more isdone. Long before the end of the century, that would mean the collapse of food production in the tropics and the subtropics, famines and huge refugee flows, massdeath. They never spell these things out at the climate summits, but almost everybody there knowsthem. And yet, once again, they failed to produce a deal that moves the processforward. The best that can be said is that they stopped a concerted attempt by the biggest emitters, led by Brazil and Australia, to gut the proposed rules for a global carbonmarket. Human societies are not good at long-termthinking. Moreover, politics is dominated by those whose interests will be advanced or damaged by what the government does right now, not in 15 years'time. Take Australia, forexample. It's the driest continent, and as the heat mounts, the number and scale of bushfires hasexploded. But Australia also is the world's biggest exporter of coal, mostly to China andJapan. Coal mining employs only 38,000 Australians, but it brings in a lot ofmoney. That's why, two years ago, Liberal (that is, conservative) politician Scott Morrison brought a lump of coal intoparliament. It was ""clean"" coal, in the sense that it had been lacquered so it wouldn't dirty people'shands. Morrison passed it around to his parliamentary colleagues saying, ""Don't be afraid, don't be scared, it won't hurtyou. It'scoal."" Morrison now is prime minister, and as the country burns, he continues to deny any link between burning coal and globalheating. He offers his ""thoughts and prayers"" to the victims of the fires, but insists climate change is only one of ""many other factors"" in fuelling thebushfires. Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack takes an even more robust line, dismissing climate change as a concern of ""raving inner-citylefties."" Of all the major emitters, only the European Union is taking its responsibilitiesseriously. The rest range from deeply conflicted countries such as China and Canada, both aware that climate change is an existential threat but both hugely dependent on fossil fuels, to the outright deniers like Australia, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and the United States So one by one, we are missing all the exits on the Highway toHell.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada120","Flight shaming, offsets and electric planes: How aviation is tackling climate change","December 1, 2019 Sunday 10:17 PM GMT","CBC News","Delegates from more than 200 countries will be travelling to Madrid this week to take part in COP25 , the UN's annual climate conference. The perceived hypocrisy of so many people flying from all corners of the globe to try to tackle the climate crisis has led some to call for an air travel ban for participants. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), domestic and international aviation accounts for approximately two per cent of global CO2 emissions produced by people. It estimates international aviation alone is responsible for 1.3 per cent of global CO2 emissions. But air travel is only growing. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) predicts 7.8 billion passengers will be flying by 2036, a near doubling of the four billion who flew in 2017. According to Reuters, a Swedish-born anti-flying movement \'e2\€  perhaps inspired by teen climate activist Greta Thunberg \'e2\€  is creating a whole new vocabulary, from flygskam (which translates as ""flight shame"") to t\'c3\£5gskryt (""train brag""). The agency reports the movement is spreading to other parts of Europe. What is the aviation industry doing? In 2009, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the industry's trade organization, set out to make the industry more fuel efficient and reduce CO2 emissions to half of 2005 levels by 2050. The plan was built around: - The use of more fuel-efficient aircraft and sustainable low-carbon fuels. - More efficient aircraft operations \'e2\€  such as reducing on-board weight. - Technology and infrastructureimprovements, including modernized air traffic management systems, to allow for more direct routes. In 2016, ICAO airlines (about 290 worldwide) also agreed to the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). CORSIA aims to offset 2.6 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions by 2035, by providing more than $50 billion Cdn for climate projects. All participating countries will be required to begin offsetting any emission growth from 2019-20 levels starting in 2021. (As a signatory of CORSIA, Canada began monitoring and verifying emissions from international flights on Jan. 1, 2019.) Do offsets really work? As CBC News reported earlier this year, the general consensus is that carbon offset programs have improved. But there is still debate about whether they actually work. The anti argument says they do nothing to actually reduce carbon emissions. The pro argument says if they weren't tied to carbon offset projects, climate-friendly initiatives such as tree planting or wind and solar energy development would never happen. Kathryn Ervine, an associate professor at Saint Mary's University in Halifax who has researched carbon offsets, said they are simply a way for airlines and individual travellers to try to appease their guilt, and aren't beneficial. Her suggestion? ""Go and find a worthwhile green initiative that you know is making an impact and make a financial contribution to it."" Are individual airlines doing anything? Many airlines encourage travellers to buy carbon offsets, fly direct (which uses less fuel) and even to pack less (lighter planes use less fuel). KLM has gone a step further by encouraging potential customers to consider travelling by train instead. It points out some train travel between major European cities is faster than flying. British Airways recently announced plans to offset its domestic travel beginning next year, after becoming the first airline to commit to net carbon zero flying by 2050. But an investigation by BBC's Panorama revealed the airline was also using a cost-cutting measure called fuel tankering, in which planes load up with extra fuel to avoid refuelling costs at their destination. Panorama reported that carrying that extra fuel meant the airline generated an extra 18,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide last year. BA said it would review the practice. Qantas followed BA's lead on lowering emissions with a pledge to also be a net zero emitter by 2050. Australia's national carrier has already experimented with flying a plane from Los Angeles to Melbourne using mustard seed biofuel. ""So, we know the technology's possible,"" CEO Alan Joyce told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. He said the challenge is doing it commercially, at scale. ""That's why it'll take some time to get there."" Other airlines \'e2\€  including Air Canada \'e2\€  have committed to using more sustainable fuels. An aviation carbon tax But all of this isn't enough for some European countries. Transportation is the only European sector currently increasing its emissions, so nine EU countries (the Netherlands, Germany, France, Sweden, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark and Bulgaria) are calling for the creation of an aviation tax. In a letter to the EU chief executive of climate, the countries' finance ministers said an aviation tax where ""the polluter pays a fairer price for the use of aviation transport"" is necessary to combat climate change. A ban on business class? It's not an entirely new idea. The World Bank studied the environmental impact of flying first and business class versus economy in 2013, and found that the higher-paying passengers generated about three per cent more carbon emissions. Why? First and business class seats on airplanes are bigger, fewer passengers sit in those sections and so the aircraft's fuel is used to move fewer people. Indeed, according to this online carbon calculator, a round trip flight in economy class from Toronto's Pearson International Airport to London Heathrow produces 4.9 tonnes of carbon emissions. The same trip in business class produces 9.5 tonnes. What's the future of flying? In a word: electric. Companies around the world are working on building all-electric aircraft. One of them is Vancouver-based Harbour Air. The company's founder and CEO is getting set to fly a DHC-2 de Havilland Beaver float plane that's been retrofitted with a 750-horsepower electric motor for the first time Dec. 11. It should be about a 10-minute flight but will add to the growing body of research about electric aviation. NASA is also playing a big part in that research. Its first all-electric aircraft \'e2\€  the X-57 Maxwell \'e2\€  arrived at the Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, Calif. in early October. NASA has been involved in the research, development and testing of electric aviation technology for decades. Its goal is not to build the first all-electric commercial airliner \'e2\€  or even a prototype \'e2\€  but to help the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) establish standards for electric flight. ""Before electric aircraft start flying everywhere, [the] FAA needs to set certification standards for certain systems,"" said Matt Kamlet, senior public affairs specialist for aeronautics. ""And our goal with X-57 is to help set those standards."" That has involved years of designing and redesigning the model, as well as experimenting with different energy sources. ""We needed electric motors which take the electric power and drive the propellers,"" said Sean Clarke, principal investigator for the X-57. ""We needed motor inverters or controllers that take the DC power that batteries provide and turn it into a rotating power for the motor to use. And then we also needed batteries."" So the team modified some commercial battery cells \'e2\€  the 18650 cell \'e2\€  and repackaged them with the requirements for aircraft. The whole system weighs about nearly 400 kilograms and provides about 45 minutes of travel. Clarke said NASA will be ground testing its electric plane in the next six to eight months and doing its first crewed flight test by the end of next year. The aircraft will be far quieter than current aircraft and in flight, it would be completely carbon-free. If you think that 45 minutes of carbon-free flight isn't of much use, Clarke pointed out that the technology will almost certainly benefit large aircraft as well. ""Hybrid aircraft \'e2\€  which could use a lot of the technologies from this vehicle and even batteries to some extent \'e2\€  could make a lot of sense at small scales up to ranges of two or three hundred miles [320 to 480 kilometres] pretty soon."" So, should COP25 Natalie Jones, a research associate at the Centre for Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge, said no. Given the conference is in Spain, you'd have delegates from European countries who could take the train, maybe delegates from some North African countries who could sail across the Mediterranean and perhaps North American representation, if their delegates could afford a two-week trip by sea across the Atlantic. That would leave those most affected by climate change on the sidelines. ""You're missing most of Asia, probably. You're missing most of Africa. You're missing most of the poorest countries, the small island states in the Pacific. How are they going to send people?"" What about video conferencing? Jones said for many less-developed countries, the technology can be unreliable. Plus, so many key conversations at conferences like COP happen in hallways, in smaller rooms, even the lunch line. So being confined to one video line would be of little use. ""Arguably you'll be locked out of kind of where the ... actual power is,"" she said. ""And so if you're not there, then your interests are going to get absolutely trampled on."" \"
"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada121","UN paints bleak picture of world emissions, says drastic action needed","December 2, 2019","SNL Canada Energy Week","The world is slated to fall far short of the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change under the current pledges of countries that are signatories to the deal, the United Nations Environment Programme reported Nov. 26. The picture is even bleaker when current policies are taken into consideration, the report said. ""Our collective failure to act strongly and early means that we must now implement deep and urgent cuts,"" United Nations Environment Programme, or UNEP, Executive Director Inger Andersen said in a letter attached to the report. She argued that ""major transformation of our societies and economies we need can still happen,"" and noted that some countries, local governments and private sector companies are stepping up. The UNEP Emissions Gap Report was released one day after the U.N.'s World Meteorological Organization, or WMO, found global levels of heat-trapping emissions hit a new high in 2018, with carbon dioxide levels increasing at a rate they have largely maintained over the past decade while methane and nitrous oxide emissions have picked up the pace. Carbon, methane and nitrous oxide are the three biggest heat-trapping emissions contributing to climate change, according to scientists and the report. The WMO further reported that the increase in CO2 emissions over time is ""primarily because of emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels and cement production, deforestation and other land-use changes."" The emissions gap report largely reiterated UNEP's findings in 2018 that current country pledges to reduce emissions pursuant to the Paris climate accord would lead to a global mean temperature rise of about 3.2 degrees C by 2100 relative to preindustrial levels. This year's emissions gap report also finds that a continuation of current policies by Paris climate accord signatories would likely lead to a global mean temperature rise of 3.5 degrees, with a range of 3.4 degrees to 3.9 degrees. But the Paris accord aims to limit global warming ideally to 1.5 degrees to 2 degrees at most.G-20 countries collectively account for 78% of global emissions, and seven of those countries are not on track to meet their current pledges, the report said. Those countries are the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, the Republic of Korea and South Africa. When accounting only for current policies, global greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to be 60 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions, or GtCO2e, in 2030, the UNEP found. In comparison, scientists have estimated that the world would need to limit emissions to 41 GtCO2e to achieve the 2-degree goal and 25 GtCO2e under a 1.5-degree warming scenario. Countries have until the end of 2020 to increase their emissions reduction pledges, also known as nationally determined contributions, under the Paris climate accord. UNEP found that to get in line with the Paris climate accord, countries would need to increase their nationally determined contributions ambitions threefold to easily achieve the 2 degrees warming goal and more than fivefold to achieve the 1.5 degrees warming goal. Specifically, emissions must drop 7.6% annually from 2020 to 2030 to meet the 1.5-degree goal and 2.7% annually to achieve the 2-degree goal. In its latest Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, the WMO found that the global average concentrations of carbon dioxide hit 407.8 parts per million in 2018, which is 2.3 ppm higher than in 2017 and 147% higher than preindustrial levels. Methane emissions in 2018 hit 1,869 parts per billion, or an increase of 10 ppb, which is higher than the mean annual increase of 7.1 ppb of methane emissions the world has seen over the past decade. Studies have indicated the higher emissions are likely from both ""exploitation of natural gas and oil"" and from wetlands in the tropics. Nitrous oxide, or N2O, levels reached a new high of 331.1 ppb, up by 1.2 ppb and at a faster rate than the mean annual increase of 0.95 ppb in the last decade. ""The likely causes of N2O increase in the atmosphere are a wider use of fertilizers in agriculture and a higher release of N2O from soils,"" the report said. Representatives from around the world are slated to gather in December in Madrid for COP25 . During the meeting, they hope to hash out the rules regarding how to treat carbon markets under the Paris climate accord even as President Donald Trump has started the process of pulling the U.S. from the accord. \"
"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada122","Who Will Police Polluting Shippers?; New Rules Meant To Reduce Sulphur In Fuel Used For Ships Begin In January","December 20, 2019 Friday","Owen Sound Sun Times","Sweeping new fuel rules aiming to cut pollution belching from ships and save lives are now just a couple of weeks away, but with no central policing agency and several countries still not signed up to them, compliance is a majorconcern. From January 2020, ships must use fuel with a sulphur content of0.5 per cent, down from3.5 per cent, or install devices that strip out the toxic pollutant, known asscrubbers. As a result, refiners and shipping companies will spend billions of dollars in the years ahead on ensuring fuel and enginescomply. But enforcement of the UN convention on cleaner fuels - known as MARPOL Annex VI - rests with individual countries and flag states, meaning for some routes and regions, compliance is already lookingpatchy. A handful of major states resisted pressure this month at the UN's COP25 climate talks in Madrid to ramp up efforts to combat global warming, underscoring a need for collective action to cut carbon emissions and widerpollution. Despite two decades in the making, countries such as Israel and New Zealand have been unable to sign up in time for the 2020 IMO start date, while others such as Malaysia are considering how to apply therules. ""Without co-ordination and consistency, shipowners will be placed in a no-win situation,"" hesaid. So far, more than 90 countries have adopted the rules, which were set by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), leaving large parts of Africa and South America yet to signup. Russia said in October that while it pledged to stick to its obligations in international waters from 2020, it wants to postpone introduction of the rules domestically to prevent a sharp jump in marine fuel prices for its domestic riverfleet. The IMO said flag states which have signed up represented almost 97% of world merchant shipping bytonnage. ""It is recognized that in some areas the coverage by port state is not 100%, but as soon as a ship trades to a state which has acceded to MARPOL Annex VI they could be subject to control,"" itsaid. All commercial ships have to be registered, or flagged, with a particular country, partly to comply with safety and environmentalregulations. Nick Makar, regulatory affairs adviser with the Marshall Islands registry, among the world's top three flags, said it was an obligation under the MARPOL convention to establish sanctions, and penalties should be ""adequate to discourageviolations."" ""Compliance will be considered on a case-by-case basis,"" hesaid. Officials in Israel said the country was unable to meet the 2020 start date as a national proposal on the issue was still in the process of beingamended. Israel's Environment Ministry said its proposed regulation would be more stringent than MARPOL Annex VI, but gave no time frame for when the country wouldjoin. New Zealand's government said this month it would sign up to the IMO convention, as the country's previous administration had not initiated theprocess. Associate Transport Minister Julie Anne Genter said there would be ""a longer lead in time"" before the rules applied to domestic ships, with stricter sulphur limits from early2022. Genter's office said fuel companies in New Zealand were preparing to supply international ships with0.5 per cent fuel on entering local waters, but did not say when it wouldhappen. Malaysia, a major shipping hub for commodities and oil, said it would consider detaining ships until they had compliantfuel. ""We will have to look into how we enforce these requirements on the ships,"" said Baharin bin Abdul Hamid, director general of the Malaysia MarineDepartment. Countries in Europe are gearing up for full compliance using measures such as ""sniffers,"" which measure the sulphur content from a vessel's flue gas, and rigorous oil sampling at port control areas, all with the threat ofimprisonment. The complexities of enforcement can be seen between neighbouring countries such as the United States, which has signed up, and Mexico, which isoutside. Mexico's navy said ships still using dirty fuel would be allowed in its waters and would be allowed to sail into international waters as long as they remained outside the jurisdiction of those countries which havecomplied. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2019 Osprey Media Group Inc.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada123","Chile's recent troubles follow history of turmoil","December 23, 2019 Monday","The Times & Transcript (New Brunswick)","The South American nation of Chile has been the scene of violent anti-government protests for more than two months.\~At least 26 people have been killed and thousands more injured. The government estimates arson, looting and property destruction have caused $3\~billion in damages. They began Oct. 18 in the capital of Santiago, when students opposing a hike in the price of subway fares engaged in vandalism and violence, prompting the authorities to enact a state of emergency and curfew. As the demonstrations grew larger, a Santiago university was set ablaze and a church was looted, with religious iconography burned in the street. Walmart saw more than 120 of its supermarkets looted or burned during the recent rioting. An estimated one\~million people clogged the streets of the Chilean capital by Oct. 26. In the port city of Valparaiso, the National Congress was evacuated as protesters clashed with police. But the vehemence of the protests should have come as no surprise. Chile has failed to find an adequate response to the grave economic and social inequality that has created the most severe unrest since the country returned to democracy some three decades ago. During Augusto Pinochet's military dictatorship the foundations were laid for a neoliberal economy. The education, pension and health systems, as well as the electricity and water supplies, were largely privatized. President Sebastian Pinera at first reacted by condemning the protesters. He sent about 10,000 soldiers out onto the streets in armoured vehicles. No government has taken such measures since the end of Pinochet's regime in 1990. Pinera later sought to quell the unrest by promising to enact higher taxes for the rich and a series of wealth redistribution policies. But his announced pension increases and a subsidy that would top up the monthly minimum wage from $396 to $460 fall far short of union and social movement proposals. Pinera has been in office since 2018 but served an earlier term as president from 2010 to 2014. He has an estimated net wealth of $2.8 billion, making him one of the richest people in Chile. Some 1,600 people remain in pre-trial detention out of 28,000 detained since mid-October. People are increasingly labelling the Chilean government's actions during the state of emergency as unconstitutional. Human Rights Watch on Nov. 26 accused Chilean police of perpetrating ""serious human rights violations"" during the protests and demanded reforms of Chile's national\~police force. The UN Human Rights Office, which is headed by former Chilean President Michelle Bachelet, a political opponent of Pinera, on Dec. 13 concurred. Meanwhile, the United Nation's COP25 Climate Summit, originally scheduled for Santiago Dec. 2 to Dec.13, was moved to Madrid. As Chile again endures turbulent times, it pays to reread Colombian novelist and Nobel Prize winner Gabriel Garcia Marquez's essay ""Why Allende had to die,"" published in the British magazine New Statesman in 1974. It dealt with arguably the worst period in the country's history. The article described socialist Salvador Allende's triumph in the presidential election of Sept. 4, 1970, and the bloody military coup that followed three years later. Allende's Popular Unity government was overthrown and he was killed in the presidential palace on Sept. 11, 1973. A junta under Pinochet was established, with tens of thousands of people interned and tortured, and more than 3,000 executed. Pinochet remained Chile's ruler for 17 years. He died in 2006, without having been convicted of the crimes of which he was accused. The current unrest has already had one beneficial outcome: Chile's Congress on Dec. 19 gave the green light to a referendum for April 26, 2020 on changing the country's constitution to replace the Pinochet-era one. The present constitution does not establish the state's responsibility to provide health care and education, which are two main demands from the protesters. ""This agreement is a first step, but it is a historic and fundamental first step to start building our new social pact, and in this the citizenry will have a leading role,"" declared the country's interior minister, Gonzalo Blumel. If things continue on the current path, the movement may get much of what it demands.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada124","We have a climate emergency, and still we kick the can down the road","December 28, 2019 Saturday","The Hamilton Spectator (Ontario, Canada)","The COP25 climate change summit that just wrapped up in Madrid was not the decisive plunge into climate action the world needed. In the lead up to the conference, 11,000 scientists declared ""clearly and unequivocally that planet Earth is facing a climate emergency,"" and a half-million protesters in Madrid demanded we act accordingly. In the end, however, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres tweeted the world ""lost an important opportunity."" Unable to reach agreement on new rules for carbon trading or funding for climate change adaptation, the proverbial can was kicked down the road. Again. We urgently need action on climate change, but even if we get it, there are larger issues. It's not just climate. Humanity is overwhelming the planet, its resources and its life-supporting capacity. We are not in any danger of extinction, not yet anyway. But the human juggernaut - and the needs and aspirations that propel it - is headed for a day of reckoning. Economists like to say that inflation is what happens when there is ""too much money chasing too few goods."" If a government keeps printing too much money, runaway inflation and economic collapse ensue. Something analogous is happening today in the natural world, where too many demands are chasing too few resources. If we keep piling more and more demands on our limited supply of land, water and other resources, nature will inevitably collapse. The warning signs are everywhere. Our unrelenting demand for fossil fuels is destroying the climate, resulting in soaring temperatures, severe droughts, catastrophic flooding, rising seas, wildfires, the acidification of the oceans, disrupted weather patterns and extreme weather events. Our demand for grain and other crops is contributing to soil erosion, deforestation and the nitrification of our oceans. Our demand for fish is depleting ocean fisheries and our demand for plastic products is choking the ocean's marine life. Palm oil, hardwoods and soybean demand is levelling tropical forests and land demand is killing animal habitats. Beyond the environmental toll, there's an escalating human cost: homes destroyed by wildfires and catastrophic storms and farms decimated by severe drought, rising temperatures or falling water tables. Young men in many parts of Asia and Africa are abandoning their rural communities in search of jobs in cities, and desperate mothers in the highlands of Guatemala and other drought-stricken areas are forced to migrate to feed their children. When there are too many demands chasing too few resources, conflict can arise. Like in Sudan, where water scarcity fuelled ethnic tensions. Or places like Mali and Niger, where fights break out between herders and farmers during drought. In the future, a rising tide of climate refugees could destabilize entire regions and contribute to global political dysfunction. We are experiencing a planetary emergency. Climate action is the first priority, as time is quickly running out. But we must also come to grips with the other challenges created by an expanding human footprint, including water scarcity, food insecurity and the extinction of plant and animal species. We need to downsize the human enterprise. We must address world population, which the UN now projects will rise from 7.7 billion today to nearly 10 billion by mid-century and nearly 11 billion by the end of the century. We also must deal with the sheer size of the global economy, which by some estimates could double by mid-century or earlier. Advancing reproductive freedom could dramatically lower the world's projected population growth. All women need access to contraception; that's fundamental. But beyond that, in the developing world, where the vast majority of the world's population growth is occurring, we should invest in the education of girls, eliminate child marriage and empower women. Smaller, healthier families are better equipped to deal with climate change. Reining in resource depletion and environmental degradation is a harder task, but not impossible. It will require a fundamental reworking of capitalism, starting with carbon taxes, and a much larger tax overhaul that stiffly penalizes pollution and resource consumption. We must also ensure that technology, which now accelerates resource depletion, becomes our ally in the fight for global sustainability. Artificial intelligence could help us chart a sustainable course, but only if we act on the insights it provides. The human enterprise is not without hope, but if future generations are to prosper, not merely survive, we must curb our overconsumption of resources and become better stewards of the planet.

Thunberg's transatlantic trip is expected to take about two weeks. Greta's father and a filmmaker will join her on the boat, to be captained by race skipper Boris Herrmann and Malizia team founder Pierre Casiraghi, the grandson of Monaco's late Prince Rainier III and the actress Grace Kelly. Casiraghi said the team was ""proud to take Greta across the Atlantic in this challenging mode of transport."" ""Unfortunately today this is the only way without fossil fuel emissions. Hopefully this will change in the near future,"" the Monaco prince added in a statement. Thunberg will then use low-carbon transport to travel to the annual U.N. climate conference in Santiago, Chile, in December, with stop-offs at other Latin American sites that are key to tackling climate change, as well as visiting Canada and Mexico.

Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg attends a ""Fridays for Future"" protest in Berlin, Germany, July 19, 2019. Her example has since inspired a global movement of hundreds of thousands of young people who have also skipped school in more than 150 countries to express their frustration over inadequate measures to limit global warming. In recent speeches, Thunberg has implored policy makers everywhere to listen to what scientists have said about the need to start reducing greenhouse gas emissions fast to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement. ""We must start bending the emissions curve steeply downwards no later than 2020, if we still are to have a chance of staying below a 1.5 degrees of global temperature rise,"" Thunberg said. ""We still have a window of time when things are in our own hands. But that window is closing fast. That is why I have decided to make this trip now."" !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada128","Elizabeth May on Throne Speech","December 5, 2019 Thursday","CTV NEWS CHANNEL Television, Inc. POWER PLAY WITH DON MARTIN 17:00:00 ET","DON MARTIN: All right, the tiny but mighty Green caucus of three MPs may be in the back row, but they're determined to be heard. Let's bring in their leader in the house. Elizabeth May joins us from the House of Commons foyer. Elizabeth May, there are look-ahead initiatives to fight climate change, and that vow to get to zero emissions by 2050, but are you disappointed there aren't more specifics, or is that just the nature of throne speeches? ELIZABETH MAY (Green Party House Leader): Well I've seen throne speeches with a lot more specifics than this one, so I was disappointed. I was hoping to see a commitment to improve our target this week while we're negotiating at Cop-25 in Madrid. The timing of the speech from the throne would have been perfect to say, and our government is going to take action immediately by improving our target in the climate negotiations, showing the kind of leadership that could push other countries. Right now actually we're near the bottom of the barrel in terms of industrialized countries, in terms of our ambition and our plans. I thought it was telling, Don, and especially when I looked at the throne speech after standing there listening to it at the back of the bar behind the speaker, and realizing when I went back over and looked, it talked about climate change, but it didn't once use the term climate emergency. So I think that's the easiest way to explain my disappointment. We need urgent action, and there was a lot of content on climate, that's certainly in the right ballpark, but it sure didn't hit any home runs. MARTIN: I'm curious, though, I mean it did refer to getting to that zero emissions by 2050. I guess that's a work in progress. They're certainly not giving you any hint to how they're going to get to that never mind meet the Paris accord targets. MAY: That's right. Well of course the Paris agreement targets are expressed in terms of temperature increase, and to hold to 1.5, it's true, we need zero, we need net zero by 2050. What they've left out so far, and it's kind of a convenient omission for Liberals, is the 2030 target that is in place is the old Harper target. And to his credit, Minister Wilkinson has suggested he knows it needs to be higher. We actually know from the science exactly how much higher it must be. If we hit our 2030 target, it will make it impossible for them to hit the 2050 one. You have to, this is something that requires ambition that starts now. The most recent UN report last week said we need seven percent reductions in fossil fuel emissions globally every year starting now. Well the Liberal plan still allows for new infrastructure, new pipelines, increasing emissions. That just won't wash. MARTIN: I'm curious, I saw an article, I don't know if it was accurate, I'll assume it is, that you would not support this throne speech if it didn't deal with the lost abortion clinic in New Brunswick that's being closed down, and you wanted it to be some sort of reference that we keep it open. Does that mean you're not supporting this throne speech, because I didn't see any reference to that in it? MAY: That's right. Well we're not supporting the throne speech as of now because we've been very clear we can't vote confidence in any government that doesn't have a climate plan and a target that's consistent with science. So it's already a nonstarter to imagine voting for this. We will be pressing the government for more details. As you know, with the timing of the speech from the throne today, and the required numbers of days for debate in the house, we're not voting on this until after we resume after the January recess. In that time, Jenica Atwin, the new member of parliament for Fredericton, and I plan to press very hard to get that money so that Clinic 554 does not close. It's a critical abortion access clinic. It's also critical services for the LGBTQ+ community in Fredericton. It must not be allowed to close. MARTIN: You're more than a one-issue party. I'm curious, was there anything in this speech you particularly liked, or particularly didn't like other than to climate change story? MAY: Well there's nothing there not to like. There's a question of, you know, it's a nice array of issues that matter. It closely tracked to the letter I sent the prime minister October 24th, which is a public letter and went to all the other leaders, to say, look, here are some areas we can broadly agree on. Let's get pharmacare. Let's get universal national pharmacare. Let's move on the reconciliation agenda. So definitely I was pleased to see that UNDRIP is there for the United Nations Declaration of Rights of Indigenous People. I would say that the legislation shouldn't be delayed as long as they're suggesting. We should move on it soon. We have a model from British Columbia we can get going sooner. But it's good. I'm very, very pleased to see that they've referenced taking action on the inquiry into missing and murdered, murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls. I'm pleased to see again that they recognize we have not fulfilled the calls to action from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. So there are a lot of very good general goals in the speech from the throne. Voting for it for us though, we made a clear redliner, my colleague says I should call it clear green line, we are not voting for any motion of confidence in this government until we see climate action which is consistent with global survival. The stakes are too high to allow ourselves to be lulled into, oh, well, maybe just this time we'll give them a confidence vote. We will not vote confidence in this government until we see real climate action. MARTIN: All right. Final question. I guess you're jetting off to Cop-25 after this interview pretty much. I'm curious, what do you hope to change over there, party of three from Canada. What can you do to sort of move the dial there? MAY: Well I'll be working within the Canadian government delegation. It's my first opportunity for developing the working relationship I hope to have with Minister Wilkinson. I'll be pushing very hard. We have negotiations that are in play around the issue of global carbon markets. It's technically known as article 6 of the Paris agreement. It's really important to hold the line and not let that become a way of allowing more emissions. And frankly I also work with global Greens. My colleague, the leader of the Green Party of New Zealand is the minister of climate for New Zealand. They have one of the best laws in place right now, just like what Trudeau promised, five-year increments to get to the right goal, only they're really doing it. So there's a lot of work to be done when we're at Cop-25 . MAY: Is this our last interview ever, Don? Is this our last interview? Tell me it's not true that you're leaving. MARTIN: You never know. MAY: Take care. MARTIN: You never know. All right, thank you, Elizabeth, appreciate this. MAY: You never know, good. Glad to know it. Thank you. Bye. MARTIN: Thanks. All right, coming up, our strategists discuss what the speech from the throne means for the government mandate to come. Please stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \"
"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada129","Portugal's students march for climate as Greta visit delayed","November 29, 2019 Friday","Postmedia Breaking News","LISBON - Students took to the streets in eight cities across Portugal on Friday to call for action on climate change, but Swedish activist Greta Thunberg was unable to join them because she was held up by bad weather in mid-Atlantic. Thunberg had been due to join the students' strike in Lisbon, but her journey back from a U.N. Climate Conference in New York by sailboat was hit by heavy winds, delaying her arrival by a few days, she told social media followers. Still, Portugal's student movement expects thousands to join the marches on Friday, building on momentum of Thunberg's arrival to mobilize ahead of the United Nations COP 25 climate summit in Madrid from Dec. 2-13. ""We wish she'd been here, but the movement has to carry on without her - we've got to send our message and pressure politicians ahead of the climate summit,"" Marianna Louca, 14, told Reuters. Thunberg is due to speak in the Portuguese parliament on arrival in Lisbon before going on to Madrid. Her team confirmed she would be arriving in the middle of next week and would also give a news conference with Portuguese student activists. Friday's climate strike is the fourth in Portugal and one of thousands taking place in 2,300 cities in 153 countries around the world, according to Friday For Future's estimates. Portugal was the first country to commit to carbon neutrality by 2050, and its parliament declared a climate emergency in July. In October, it moved the deadline for closing the country's coal plants from 2030 to 2023. But activists say the government continues to take actions which will prevent the country from reaching its decarbonisation goals. ""On the contrary, a new airport, lithium mines and bigger ports are in the works,"" a member of civil disobedience group Extinction Rebellion told Reuters.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada130","Few promises, one 'lost' opportunity; After two weeks of talks, UN climate negotiators less than enthused with compromise","December 16, 2019 Monday","The Toronto Star","In what was widely denounced as one of the worst outcomes in a quarter century of climate negotiations, United Nations talks ended Sunday morning with the United States and other big polluters blocking even a nonbinding measure encouraging countries to enhance their climate targets next year. Because the U.S. is withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, it was the last chance, at least for some time, for U.S. delegates to sit at the negotiating table at the annual talks. They also used that chance to push back against a compensation mechanism, long sought by developing countries, for the economic losses they suffer from droughts, storms and slow-moving climate effects like sea level rise. The annual negotiations, held in Madrid this year, demonstrated the vast gaps between what scientists say the world needs and what the world's most powerful leaders are prepared to even discuss, let alone do. Along with the U.S., Australia and Brazil were also singled out for blocking on other issues. China and India balked at suggestions of more ambitious climate targets next year. The outcome leaves many important decisions to be made at next year's negotiations, which will begin in Glasgow, Scotland, immediately after the U.S. elections in November. If a new president is elected then, his or her administration could rejoin the Paris agreement only after taking office the following January and then setting out new U.S. national targets and timetables for cutting emissions. Many analysts say China, currently the world's largest emitter, will probably look at what direction the U.S. takes before committing to new emissions reductions targets of its own. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres offered an unusually blunt assessment of the 25th annual negotiations, formally known as the Conference of Parties. ""I am disappointed with the results of # COP25 ,"" he said on Twitter. ""The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation & finance to tackle the climate crisis."" The negotiations, which had been scheduled to end Friday, extended into the early hours Sunday. It was the longest Conference of Parties ever, and it came against the backdrop of accelerating climate threats. The talks had been meant to iron out the last unresolved details of the landmark Paris climate agreement. Under that pact, reached in 2015, countries set their own targets and timetables to rein in emissions of planet-warming gases. There was a push from both rich and poor countries to commit, at least on paper, to ramp up climate-action targets next year. That is important because even if all countries meet the voluntary targets they have set so far, according to the scientific consensus, emissions are rising at a pace that makes storms and heat waves very likely to become more severe, and coastal cities to be at risk of drowning. But there was no diplomatic consensus on even that. The final declaration was notable for what counts as exceptionally weak diplomatic language: It cited only an ""urgent need"" to reduce emissions in line with the Paris agreement. China and India joined the U.S. in pushing back against more emphatic language calling on countries to enhance their climate-action targets in 2020. The European Union joined many poor, vulnerable countries in calls to be more ambitious, although it remained unclear when the bloc, which is one of history's biggest polluters, would update its own targets. The outcome was also notable in that it followed a surge in street demonstrations this year, often led by young people, highlighting the deep fissures between the demands of thousands of ordinary citizens and their governments. One of the most contentious issues that was kicked down the road was a set of rules on carbon trading, which would allow countries and companies to trade on emissions reductions. Australia and Brazil were among those countries that insisted on accounting loopholes, including the ability to carry over credits earned under an old trading system. That was considered unacceptable by others. Some environmental advocates saw a silver lining there. No deal on carbon trading was better than a bad deal, they said. \"
"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada131","Progress: Blessing or curse?","December 14, 2019 Saturday","Kingston Whig-Standard","A few days ago I read an article by a well-known psychologist, someone I generally admire. He shared that he was tired of hearing negative things about the state of our world. Instead, he suggested we celebrate the amazing progress humanity has made, particularly over the past several generations. Even as I was reading I found myself thinking, ""I'm not sure I agree with that."" Don't get me wrong, I am definitely not anti-progress. After all, I'm sitting here in my warm house, typing away on my computer, sipping on a cup of hot tea made by my electric kettle. It makes sense to me that we acknowledge the countless ways our lives have been positively impacted by social, economic and technological change. We're living longer, healthier and more comfortable lives; people, goods and information move quickly and easily across vast distances; innovation continues to drive us forward. And yet ... Many of these advances and improvements are not universally available or even fairly distributed among the peoples of our planet or even in our own country. For example, 40 per cent of First Nations in Canada do not currently have access to clean, safe drinking water, a basic requirement for good health and sanitation. And what about the costs of progress? Our relentless pursuit of the better life we see at the end of the progress rainbow has caused immeasurable harm to communities, to the other species that share Earth and to our environment. When we dam a river for a hydroelectric complex in the Amazon basin, thousands of acres of pristine rainforest must be destroyed. When we transport fossil fuels across our country or through our oceans, we risk spills causing catastrophic damage to fragile ecosystems. And when we develop new technologies that allow us to harvest or produce the food we need to feed our ever-increasing numbers, we don't look beyond ""more-faster-easier"" to see the potential for decimated fish stocks or damaged soil. Who pays for this kind of progress? Similar to the benefits of progress, the costs are not borne equally among those who share this planet. Typically, those without voice or power pay the highest price: Indigenous Peoples forcibly removed from the land that has sustained them for thousands of years; hundreds of species of plants and animals lost forever; the earth itself clear-cut, stripmined and moulded to our needs. And now that we're on to the cost of progress, who gets to decide which ""improvements"" are worth the price that must be paid? All too often, financial gain for the few or political benefit for the powerful trumps the needs of people, communities and the environment. In a more general sense, past generations and baby boomers, in particular, are being called out for foisting the current and anticipated costs of our ""progress at any cost"" attitude onto our descendants. Some of you may have listened as 16-year-old Greta Thunberg challenged world leaders to get on board with what needs to be done to address the escalating climate crisis: ""How dare you? You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. ... We are in the beginning of a mass extinction. And all you can talk about is money and tales of eternal economic growth."" So where did I land after all these musings? I agree with those who encourage us to celebrate the benefits of progress: advancements in science, technology and medicine resulting in better health and increased longevity, for example. And I agree with those who suggest it's time we hit the pause button on the idea of progress at any cost. As Ms. Thunberg says, let's put aside political and financial motivations and look to the science as we make decisions that impact our shared and very precious planet. Progress in and of itself is not inherently good or bad. Obviously, for me, it's a mixed bag. Moving forward, we would do well to remember the Seventh Generation Principle, which is based on an ancient Iroquois philosophy. We cannot think only of our own survival, comfort or well-being. The decisions and actions we take today, as individuals, communities and nations, should result in a sustainable world seven generations into the future.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada132","Alberta asks feds to 'expedite'approval of Teck's Frontier oilsands mega mine; Province's letter highlights benefits of $20B project amid western alienation","December 14, 2019 Saturday","National Post's Financial Post & FP Investing (Canada)","Alberta's environment minister Jason Nixon is asking his federal counterpart to ""expedite"" approvals for Teck Resources Ltd.'s Frontier oilsands mega mine, to show the federal government understands Alberta's needs. In a letter sent to federal Environment and Climate Change Minister Jonathan Wilkinson on Dec. 6, seen by the Financial Post, Nixon references economic hardships in Alberta and noted that the project will create 7,000 jobs during construction and contribute $70 billion in federal, provincial and municipal taxes over 41 years of production. The letter also touches on issues of western alienation and asks the feds to consider Alberta's economic needs. ""Many Albertans are looking for positive signals from the federal government that the national interest includes Alberta,"" Nixon wrote in his letter to Wilkinson. Nixon's letter comes as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau released Wilkinson's mandate letter on Friday, which asked the newly minted environment minister to introduce new ""greenhouse gas reducing measures to exceed Canada's 2030 emissions reduction goal and beginning work so that Canada can achieve net-zero emissions by 2050."" The mandate letter also instructs Wilkinson to advance the government's goal of 30-per-cent zero-emissions vehicle sales by 2030 and 100-per-cent zero-emissions vehicle sales by 2040. The two letters, from Nixon and Trudeau, show the range of pressures facing Wilkinson, who was flying back to Ottawa from the COP25 climate conference in Madrid on Friday, as the feds attempt to implement additional emissions-reduction policies and also soothe fears over economic malaise in the West. ""The elements to proceed with this project appear to all be in place. I urge you to move forward with approvals and demonstrate that projects can be advanced in a responsible manner in Canada, for the benefit of all Canadians,"" Nixon wrote. While Wilkinson's office would not comment on the contents of Nixon's letter, spokesperson Sabrina Kim said in an email ""Canadians expect us to oversee fair and thorough environmental assessments."" Nixon's letter lays out eight steps the Alberta government has taken to address recommendations from the arms-length Joint Review Panel, which recommended the federal government approve the oilsands mega-mine on July 26, 2019. For example, the provincial government said it has implemented plans to manage the Ronald Lake bison herd in the area in the face of various challenges, including diseases from another bison herd in Wood Buffalo National Park, in northeastern Alberta. Teck's $20-billion Frontier oilsands has won the backing of First Nations groups in the area, including the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation, which has previously opposed oilsands expansion but signed an impact benefit-agreement with the company for Frontier. However, Athabasca Chipewyan Chief Allan Adam also criticized the provincial government this week for not negotiating with the First Nations on impacts from the Frontier development. ""The Alberta government is killing its own oilsands project by not negotiating with ACFN,"" Allan told CBC News. If built, Frontier would be the largest oilsands mine in Alberta. Company filings show the project is designed to produce 85,000 barrels of oil per day by 2026 before additional phases would bring it up to 260,000 bpd by 2037. Teck has pledged to build a power cogeneration facility and ensure the oil produced at Frontier would have an emissions intensity half of the average barrel produced in the U.S. More broadly, the company has pledged to reduce its emissions by 450,000 tones of CO2 per annum by 2030. In July, the Joint Review Panel - informed by recommendations from the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (CEAA) and the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER)- recommended the project be approved contingent on 62 different conditions. The two agencies withheld approvals for parts of the project near a local waterway called Big Creek. At the time the recommendation was issued, then-environment and climate change minister Catherine McKenna's office said that if the minister determined there were significant adverse environmental impacts, the decision would be referred to the wider Liberal cabinet. The CEAA and AER joint-review panel report found that ""there will be significant adverse project and cumulative effects on certain environmental components and indigenous communities"" so a referral from Wilkinson to the wider Liberal cabinet is a likely outcome. Under legislated timelines, Wilkinson has until February to make a decision on the Frontier project.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada134","Why we must get Canadian energy to global markets","December 19, 2019 Thursday","The Hamilton Spectator (Ontario, Canada)","Canada is known around the world as a country of inclusiveness, tolerance and respect for human rights. Our energy industry also holds world class standards - among the best anywhere when it comes to innovation, environmental protection and responsible resource development. According to Statistics Canada, nearly half of all money spent by Canadian businesses on environmental protection was contributed by the oil and natural gas extraction industry. It's time for Canadian energy to play a vastly more significant role on the world stage. The world's energy needs are growing significantly. By 2040, the International Energy Agency's World Energy Outlook 2019 projects global energy demand will have increased by 24 per cent. Even taking into account increased use of renewables, oil and natural gas will make up 53 per cent of the total energy used around the world. More than one billion people don't have access to electricity. As the globe's population increases and people strive for a better standard of living, energy demand will increase every year over the next couple of decades. Developing economies are depending on affordable and reliable energy to reduce energy poverty and provide things Canadians take for granted, like clean cooking facilities, lighting, and transportation. Africa, for example, is expected to increase its oil use by a whopping 72 per cent. At December's COP25 (Conference of the Parties summit) in Madrid, Spain, nations around the world faced the challenges of balancing economic stability with their greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction commitments - targets set under the Paris Agreement to reduce emissions and manage global warming. Canada is among them, yet our position is unique, in that we can offer a solution to help bring people out of energy poverty, while reducing net global GHGs. We have an opportunity to do just that, and work with China and India, who account for more than 20 per cent of the world's emissions. So what's the Canadian energy solution? Getting Canadian LNG (liquefied natural gas) to global markets that need it. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects by 2040 global demand for natural gas will increase nearly 36 per cent, replacing coal as the world's second-largest energy source. In the year-over-year period from 2017 to 2018, China's natural gas consumption increased a staggering 33 per cent. Canada has an abundant natural gas resource that's estimated to be 1,220 trillion cubic feet; enough to serve current markets for 300 years, and positioning us well to meet emerging demand worldwide. Canadian LNG would create up to 65 per cent fewer greenhouse gases than coal when used in Asia to generate electricity, as Canadian LNG facilities will have lower emissions intensity than LNG produced anywhere else. According to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, China alone is adding one large new coal-fired power plant to the grid every two weeks. The window for Canada is open right now. Canada's significant natural gas resources can help meet global demand and reduce global GHG emissions by displacing coal-fired electricity generation in China, India and Southeast Asia. With the total net global GHG reduction from each Canadian LNG plant estimated to be about 100 MtCO2e per year, we can achieve the equivalent of removing 22 million cars from the roads. It means Canada can make a much bigger difference outside of our borders in lowering global GHG emissions than we could ever achieve by focusing only on ourselves. In turn, these emissions reductions must be recognized both domestically and internationally and contribute to our commitment under the Paris Agreement. For this to happen, Article 6 of the Paris Agreement must enable countries to share offset credits - called Internationally Transferable Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) - from another country. If Canada, as the supplier of this cleaner burning fuel, is able to receive credit for a portion of these carbon offsets, Canada will be better positioned to meet its Paris climate accord targets while allowing additional LNG facility development to take place at home. If Canada can take this opportunity to grow an industry around LNG to meet global demand, it will also create economic and other benefits across Canada. The Canadian oil and natural gas industry contributes billions to government revenues every year, which supports our social fabric and standard of living by helping to fund schools, nurses, teachers and infrastructure, and making life more affordable for all Canadians. In addition, all Canadians deserve opportunities for prosperity, which the energy industry helps to support across the country. The industry remains positive as we look at the opportunity ahead. For Canada, a strong oil and natural gas industry keeps our communities strong. This includes providing opportunities for Indigenous communities and businesses to play an active role in resource development. For many Indigenous communities, involvement with the energy industry provides a path toward defeating poverty and in turn leads the country further along our road to reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. It's essential that we build upon our energy industry with innovation and thoughtful foresight so that we can all benefit socially, economically and environmentally, here in Canada and beyond our borders.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada135","Along the Fraser: food banks for eagles in crisis?","December 21, 2019 Saturday","Maple Ridge News","In an emergency, you change your behaviour - Greta Thunberg ( COP25 ) Fifteen years ago, he put a camera in an eagle's nest with chicks. The video went viral. Hancock says eagles will be hungry this year, possibly from now on as salmon numbers decline. DFO estimated five million Fraser River salmon would return in 2019, but only 600,000 did, and only three per cent headed beyond the Big Bar Landslide managed to spawn. The blockage occurred in 2018. DFO waited too long to remove it. They're still waiting. READ ALSO: Will there be salmon five years from now? Doug Stanger of ARMS searched in vain for chum in Millionaire Creek, a tributary of the Alouette River that's always produced thousands. ""It's the worst year in my memory,"" Stanger told me. We knew a crisis was coming. In October, DFO reported chum returns this year of less than one million - below a critical threshold and the lowest on record since the 1980s. DFO ruled that the Johnstone Strait mixed stock commercial fisheries will be closed. Too little, too late. The first stop in my nature pilgrimage is Nicomen Slough, a tidal ribbon between Dewdney and Deroche. The line of vehicles along the roadside is the longest in 20 years, families with children witnessing nature's bond between salmon and raptors. Morris Valley Road is near Harrison Bay and Kilby Park. I gaze across Chehalis Flats, an expansive marsh fronting the Harrison River. It's the most important chum spawning area in B.C., but there are few salmon, dead or alive, today. Weaver Creek Spawning Channel, built in 1965, is my next stop. It was built to mitigate the effects of recreation and logging on the creek. No one thought to protect a prolific producer of several species until logs, scouring the creek, destroyed millions of eggs. For years, the channel registered 75,000 sockeye, chum, and pink. The gates were later closed at 30,000 to avoid crowding. In the '90s, I saw chum spawn in ditches. So many salmon then, nobody worried that their eggs died when those ditches dried up. Few salmon returned to Weaver Creek channel in 2019. ""We saw 1,700 sockeye,"" a local hatchery worker told me. ""But,"" he added, ""it was a low brood year four years ago, so that was expected."" Returns for chum were even worse, at about 3,000. But DFO records of chum in the channel from 1965 to 1978 (when counting and stream monitoring stopped) averaged 25,000. Tapadera Estates, a gated resort area, is one of several festival venues to ""celebrate the wonders of nature"" with educational displays and viewing stands down well-groomed walkways. At least 5,000 birds are perched in trees or sitting on sandbars. Hancock calls the Harrison ""the bald eagle capital of the world."" As many as 30,000 show up every year through the Fraser Valley. About 500 pairs live here all year, Hancock says. There's a lot of competition for the few carcasses available here now. When they're eaten, says Hancock, the eagles move to garbage dumps. ""About 75 years ago, we started diminishing our creeks and rivers. At the same time, garbage became a substitute for dead salmon. Eagles fly from one dump to the next all the way to Alaska."" Garbage has become an alternate source of protein for eagles, one that might not last as cities stop dumping organic waste in landfills and recycle it inside buildings. ""It's bizarre,"" says Hancock. ""We're forcing everyone to separate garbage so we can compost it to soil, and in the process we've taken away another food source. We're about to have a disaster."" Hancock says we've been slow to recognize the problem. He's talking to government agencies about solutions that will require changes in attitude and focused will power. Food banks for eagles? That will require careful planning, but abuse and neglect of habitat make it our responsibility. Since the 1970s, DFO has abandoned the monitoring, protection, and enhancement of salmon streams while promoting fish farming despite the evidence that effluent and disease are killing wild fish. We've overfished and polluted oceans to the point that there's more plastic in them than oxygen. This year - after one of the worst salmon returns in history - the Mountainaire Avian Rescue Society on Vancouver Island stepped up for eagles. ""We're feeding a lot of them,"" caregiver Jo Stiles told Black Press. Bears are starving, too. Conservation officers say, ""don't feed them."" In the Lower Mainland, by July, they'd killed 51 hungry animals - the simple solution to another emergency. But that's another story.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada136","Charlebois: Forget flight shaming - how about food shaming?","January 6, 2020 Monday","Postmedia Breaking News","Move over flight shaming. In 2020, we may see environmentalists target a new group of individuals: Overeaters. For months now, some have taken to social media to spread their concern( HYPERLINK https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/cop25-airline-travel-carbon-emissions-offsets-electric-planes-1.5367158 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/ HYPERLINK cop25 -airline-travel-carbon-emissions-offsets-electric-planes-1.5367158 ) about choices made when travelling. Environmentalists have targeted( \~ HYPERLINK https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190909-why-flight-shame-is-making-people-swap-planes-for-trains https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190909-why-flight-shame-is-making-people-swap-planes-for-trains ) several means of travel, especially by plane, using guilt and public shaming to get people to think differently about their lifestyle. Even if air travel is responsible for less than two per cent of all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, discrediting those who travel by plane is a continuing practice. Air travel does emit GHGs, but this industry is far from being the worse culprit, and many travellers have no other option but to fly to reach their destination. Studies have suggested that reducing the number of flights could lower our carbon footprint. Perhaps, although in some cases, weaponizing science to support a social movement or political campaign has lead to contentious debate. Similarly, food, even though it can be personal and culturally charged, is not immune to this phenomenon. Public shaming in 2020 may reach a new, awkward level as we examine how much we eat. A recent study published( HYPERLINK https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-12/tos-sso121819.php https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-12/tos-sso121819.php ) by The Obesity Society suggests that obesity and overeating generates approximately 20 per cent more greenhouse gas emissions when compared to the diets of people considered to be of ""normal"" weight. Researchers found that global obesity was estimated to contribute an extra 700 megatons of carbon dioxide emissions per year, or about 1.6 per cent of all man-made emissions, which is almost the same as air travel. The authors of the new study emphasize it is crucially important that this information does not lead to more weight stigmatization. But given the era we are in, and how social media can interpret science differently, the potential for consumers with excess weight to be stigmatized is real. And some of us can be overly sensitive about this, especially after the holiday season. Climate change has clearly become an important issue for a growing number of consumers. People have encouraged governments and industries to make changes, and adopt new regulations in order to safeguard the planet. Climate change has also caused consumers to think differently and become better environmental stewards. That's all wonderful, but using guilt and dishonour to condemn choices we all make daily is starting to reach uncomfortable levels, especially if these tactics are used against people facing weight challenges. What we can and should be having is a serious discussion on food waste, which is more controllable, not as personal and not as complex. We need to reduce the amount of resources it takes to generate food - and that is where our attention should be targeted, not on overeating or obesity. Packaging and plastics also represent a more appropriate target for environmentalists. The Obesity Society's study likely won't help our quest to find a socially acceptable contract between good dieting and our environmental obligations. The year 2019 was marked by divisive debate( HYPERLINK https://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/columnists/charlebois-hey-vegans-provocative-advertising-about-dairy-will-only-polarize-people https://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/columnists/charlebois-hey-vegans-provocative-advertising-about-dairy-will-only-polarize-people ) between those who believe animal proteins are irreplaceable and those who fear our current collective course of meat consumption is not sustainable. Fuelled by reports( \~ HYPERLINK https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eating-meat-worse-burning-oil-160000717.html?guccounter=1 https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eating-meat-worse-burning-oil-160000717.html?guccounter=1 ) supporting one view or another, protein consumption has become a polarized, sensitive issue in some food-conscious circles. Considering how food can be as cultural as it is personal, shaming someone for eating a hamburger or steak is insolent. Some researchers have conceded that the imprecise nature of studying obesity should get readers to consider findings, such as those from The Obesity Society, with some caution. This, however, may not be enough to discourage some to use the study against those they believe are behaving irresponsibly in the face of our climate crisis. And that would indeed be shameful.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada137","Alberta needs a fair deal now","January 23, 2020 Thursday","National Post (f/k/a The Financial Post) (Canada)","Last week I participated in The Value of Alberta, a Calgary conference devoted to examining Alberta's importance to Canada and how the province can achieve a fairer relationship in Confederation. Most Easterners do not appreciate how profoundly frustrated Albertans are about their poor treatment - so frustrated that deeply patriotic citizens are contemplating what should be unthinkable: separation from Canada. The Laurentian elite downplays the risk and the severe, potentially existential damage Wexit would inflict on the country. For too long, Alberta has been treated as a cash cow, its enormous contribution to Confederation underappreciated by a federal government hostile to its principal industry. Albertans themselves have been disrespected by condescending Ontario and Quebec progressives who disdain their freedom-loving individualism and regard their occasional political influence as a regrettable aberration. At the COP25 The government will adopt the UN Declaration on the Rights of Aboriginal Peoples, which requires ""free, prior and informed consent"" for approval of resource projects. That is guaranteed to spawn dilatory litigation and uncertainty for supportive First Nations. The courts could easily interpret consent as a veto, rendering pipeline approval excruciatingly difficult. The next looming threat is the federal budget, which the finance minister has promised will have an environmental focus. While the West has the world's third-largest proven oil reserves and its fourth-largest production of natural gas, its energy industry is hurting badly, largely due to government policy. This is especially unjustifiable since Alberta is a world leader in ethically and environmentally responsible resource development. In the past 20 years, the oilsands has reduced its emissions per barrel by a third. Unfortunately, unfairness is not confined to the feds. From 1961 to 2018, Quebec received 78 per cent of net federal fiscal transfers. Yet Quebec just posted a $4-billion surplus, while receiving $13 billion in equalization payments disproportionately generated by Alberta taxpayers, whose province is running a $6.7-billion deficit. Unsurprisingly, an Angus Reid poll found that Albertans are the most unhappy Canadians, with 71 per cent not approving of where the country is headed. Quebecers are the happiest, with 76 approving its direction. Without evident embarrassment, Premier Fran\'e7ois Legault self-righteously blocked the Energy East pipeline because it would transport ""dirty energy"" across Quebec. But Western Canada supplied 44 per cent of his province's oil in 2017, while Quebec purchases foreign crude shipped up the St. Lawrence River. Then there is the B.C. government, which opposes Trans Mountain but whose largest export commodity is coal. Since coal usage emissions don't count against Canada's carbon bill, Justin Trudeau is silent about the hypocrisy. Although the prime minister predicts the ultimate demise of fossil fuels, in 2040 oil and gas will still supply more than half of total global primary energy. As for renewables, between 1990 and 2017 their usage rose a mere percentage point to 14 per cent of total world energy consumption. In spite of this, Mark Carney, incoming UN special envoy on ""climate action and finance,"" has prophesied that ""up to half of developed oil reserves"" will likely be stranded to limit the effects of climate change. Yet Saudi Aramco has just issued the world's largest IPO at $26.5 billion and has a $7-trillion market capitalization. Not everyone thinks the end is nigh. Canada has 170 billion proven barrels of oil. Its marketable natural gas reserves are over 71 trillion cubic feet. The future value of the half of our resources that Carney wants left in the ground would be in the trillions of dollars. It would be unforgivable to current and future Canadian generations to abandon such immense wealth and energy security for no global environmental benefit. Other countries rush their fossil fuels to market, notwithstanding stirring rhetoric about a climate emergency. Due in large part to its offshore resources, Norway has the world's third highest per capita GDP ($US72,100 in 2017), 75 per cent more than ours ($US48,400), even as it weans its citizens off fossil fuels. Norwegians don't seem too concerned about the blatant contradiction. Canada needs a rational approach to climate change and energy policy based on science, economics and political reality. All Canadians should support Alberta Premier Jason Kenney's request for a fair deal and access to overseas markets for Canadian oil and gas. Otherwise, more Albertans will seriously consider the unthinkable. Joe Oliver was minister of natural resources and minister of finance, 2011-2015 !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada138","U.S. warns Russian trolls stoking conflict in Chile","October 31, 2019 Thursday","Postmedia Breaking News","WASHINGTON/SANTIAGO - The U.S. State Department warned on Thursday that it had seen indications of Russian ""influence"" on recent unrest in Chile, where two weeks of protests and riots have rocked the administration of President Sebastian Pinera. A senior State Department official said there were ""clear indications"" people were taking advantage of the unrest in Chile - prompted by inequality and rising living costs - and ""skewing it through the use and abuse of social media, trolling."" ""We have seen indications of Russian activity supporting this negative course of the debate,"" the official said. Chilean officials did not immediately comment on the remarks. Russia has previously said it does not interfere in other countries' internal affairs. The White House had earlier said in a statement that U.S. President Donald Trump ""denounced foreign efforts to undermine Chilean institutions, democracy, or society."" Chile has been mired in chaos over the last two weeks, which led center-right Pinera on Wednesday to abruptly withdraw Chile as host of an upcoming APEC summit and a major climate change conference, to ""take care of problems at home."" Trump, who had been expected to sign a trade deal with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the APEC meeting in Santiago in November, said on Thursday he supported Pinera's decision to back out of hosting the trade and climate change conferences. The State Department official said that foreign interference was not the only trigger for the recent violence, which has seen buses and buildings burned, Santiago's metro system shut down, and much of the city at times grind to a halt. But he added that Russia had ""sought to exacerbate divisions, foment conflict and all round act as spoiler to responsible democratic debate."" NEW CONSTITUTION? Protests over a hike in metro fares spun out of control across Chile nearly two weeks ago. Riots, arson and looting have since left at least 18 dead and led to the arrest of 7,000, prosecutors said. Chilean businesses have lost more than $1.4 billion. Pinera, a billionaire businessman, has scrambled to react to the unrest, pledging worker-friendly economic reforms and reshuffling about one-third of his cabinet. But opposition lawmakers that met with members of Pinera's cabinet at the La Moneda presidential palace on Thursday said it was not enough. The leftist opposition called on the president to scrap Chile's existing constitution and draft a more worker-friendly one, warning that without major action Pinera would not successfully quell the protests. ""We are going to continue to insist on a new constitution until we are heard,"" said Fuad Chahin, head of the centrist Christian Democratic (DC) party. Socialist Party head Alvaro Elizalde said Pinera was ""not listening to the demands of citizens."" He called the existing constitution, adopted during the 1973-1990 military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, a ""straight-jacket"" that had condemned Chile to poverty and inequality. Pinera's predecessor, Michelle Bachelet, had promised to change the constitution, but ultimately failed in the teeth of right-wing opposition and a crowded legislative calendar. Newly appointed interior minister Gonzalo Blumel said Pinera's government had not ruled out ""structural reforms,"" without elaborating on what they might be. HOTELS HIT Pinera's abrupt move to cancel both the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting and December's high-profile COP25 climate change summit caught much of the world off-guard. Officials from both conferences have been scrambling to find new venues. ""The cancellations have hit us hard,"" said a desk attendant at a major international hotel chain in Santiago who asked not to be identified. ""A delegation from APEC... had reserved 100 of the 280 rooms we have at the hotel."" Santiago's metro system, once the envy of Latin America, sustained at least $400 million in damage in past weeks. Rioters set fire to 21 metro stations, burned seven trains, and attacked more than 2,000 buses. One hundred stoplights are destroyed each day, officials said. The number of protesters has fallen sharply since last Friday, when more than 1 million Chileans marched on Santiago. But violence, looting, arson and skirmishes with police continue. In Santiago's central Plaza Italia on Thursday, mounds of rubble, trash, broken glass and smoldering fires littered streets and sidewalks, even as new protesters began to gather by early evening. Spray-painted messages calling for Pinera to go and denouncing human rights violations by security forces now coat store fronts and windows of trendy cafes once popular with tourists and university students. Cristian Bigorra, a 64-year old who attends a parking garage nearby, said both politicians and violent protesters were to blame for the still simmering chaos. ""Words can't describe what they've done to this city,"" said Bigorra. But, he added, Pinera had ""done nothing"" to change things even as violence had mounted. A team of United Nations human rights officials arrived in Chile on Tuesday to scrutinize allegations of excessive use of force, torture, sexual assault and deaths at the hands of security forces during the recent unrest. Pinera on Wednesday said he welcomed the scrutiny and said the country had ""nothing to hide.""

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada140","Thunberg, Carney and ice cream","January 9, 2020 Thursday","National Post (f/k/a The Financial Post) (Canada)","It is hard to imagine the global policy environment around climate change can get any wonkier through 2020 than it has been through 2019. The Oxford Dictionary declared the two-word slogan ""climate emergency"" to be the 2019 Word of the Year, although that was before the crash-and-burnout of the 25th United Nations'intergovernmental Conference of the Parties ( COP25 ) in Madrid. It's a climate emergency, but let's put the whole thing off until COP26 next November in Glasgow. Propelled by Greta Thunberg, who attempts to live without consuming energy, the 2019 extremist policy options range from $250-a-tonne carbon levies to new climate taxes on ice cream, restaurant dining, meat and alcohol. ""How food taxes can be used to help cut GHGs,"" said a Globe and Mail column headline this week. The food tax idea is a bit of a retreat from an earlier Globe opinion piece that described climate change as a war that required such wartime measures as national rationing. The idea of using rationing - depriving consumers of their right to consume via taxes or other war measures - has been around for a couple of decades in radical enclaves frequented by such eco-activists as Britain's George Monbiot and Canada's Naomi Klein. At Canada's Socialist Project, a total wartime takeover of the economy to avoid global warming is seen as essential. As 2020 wears on, leading up to COP26 in Glasgow, we can expect to hear more of these and other wonky plans to seize control of economic activity in the name of fighting climate change - although not all ideas will take direct aim at consumers feeding on meat and ice cream at the bottom of the economic production chain. At the top of the economic system, the corporatist left is scheming to control the flow of money and cut off funding to business activities that may be contributing to the climate emergency. These schemes go by many names and cover many aspects of corporate finance beyond climate: ethical investing, sustainable financing, green financing, social financing, impact investing, ESG investment, responsible investing. At their extreme, these movements aim to impose a form of rationing on investment. Cutting off the flow of money to fossil fuel as a ""socially undesirable"" activity is certainly the prime objective of Mark Carney, who is about to become the world's leading public proponent of the idea that global financial markets need to be controlled and manipulated. The former Bank of Canada governor leaves his post as head of the Bank of England to take up a new role as United Nations'""special envoy on climate action and finance."" The UN Secretary General's announcement last month summarized Carney's new mission: ""He will focus on ambitious implementation of climate action, with special attention to significantly shifting public and private finance markets and mobilizing private finance to the levels needed to achieve the 1.5\'b0C goal of the Paris Agreement. This will include building the frameworks for financial reporting, risk management and returns in order to bring the impacts of climate change to the mainstream of private financial decision-making and to support the transition to a net zero carbon economy."" In short, Carney will assume the role of chief advocate for a centrally planned global financial system whose primary aim is to reduce carbon emissions to zero. In a year-end interview with the BBC (as part of a program guest-edited by Thunberg), Carney outlined the tricky part. The market cannot do the job since it is based on ""selective information, spin, misdirection."" Instead, he said, there needs to be a ""shared understanding about what's necessary. It is reasonable for there to be debates at the margin about where does the role of the state stop - and what's the role of markets."" The idea that the market is dumb compared with non-market state-backed actors should be more than a discussion ""at the margin."" By shuffling the topic to the sidelines, Carney is joining the UN, radical activists such as Thunberg's Extinction Rebellion and the expanding cabals of corporate executives who are willing to abandon whatever market principles they hold or pretend to hold in the name of protecting the planet from disaster. At the UN, Carney is taking over from Michael Bloomberg, the media mogul who is now running for the leadership of the Democratic Party. Bloomberg is among many corporate executives and financial billionaires - from BlackRock's Larry Fink to Tom Steyer and members of the U.S. Business Roundtable - who have decided to overthrow the role of markets in favour of greater non-market controls and authoritarian policy manipulation. More than markets are being manipulated. A recent article by the University of Colorado's Roger Pielke Jr. - ""How Billionaires Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg Corrupted Climate Science"" - describes how they helped fund and promote the most extreme and improbable climate scenarios they are now hyping as part of their platforms. As he begins his tenure as the world's official climate-planning financial propagandist, Mark Carney is promoting the same extreme scenarios as he campaigns against the fossil fuel industry. Canada's energy firms are right to be concerned. Non-energy companies should also be worried. The focus on fossil fuels is only one small part of the emerging sustainable/green/social investment movement. Ice-cream makers beware. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada141","A premier meeting and a medical marvel; In-The-News for Dec. 2; Stories in the news Dec. 2","December 2, 2019 Monday 08:04 AM EST","Canadian Press","In-The-News is a roundup of stories from The Canadian Press designed to kickstart your day. Here is what's on the radar of our editors for the morning of Dec. 2. What we are watching in Canada ... MISSISSAUGA, Ont. - Canada's premiers are meeting today just outside Toronto for the first time as a group since the federal election. The campaign laid bare some regional divisions, and the premiers of Saskatchewan and Alberta - where the Liberals won no seats - have been especially vocal about their asks from Ottawa. Saskatchewan's Scott Moe and Alberta's Jason Kenney want Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to change the equalization formula, but there is unlikely to be consensus on that around the premiers' table. Moe, who is chair of the Council of the Federation, says all of the premiers will come to the meeting with various priorities and differing opinions, but the goal is to find a few issues on which they have common ground. Ontario Premier Doug Ford says health care is a concern for everyone, and that all premiers want a 5.2 per cent annual increase to the Canada Health Transfer. Climate policy will be another tough area to get all parties on side. Ontario, Saskatchewan, Alberta and Manitoba have all launched legal challenges against the federal carbon price, while others have accepted it or launched their own programs. --- Also this ... A hockey player paralyzed in the Humboldt Broncos bus crash says he's thrilled with the progress he's made since receiving spinal surgery in Thailand a month ago. Doctors implanted an epidural stimulator in Ryan Straschnitzki's spine and one week later injected stem cells above and below the injury to try to reverse some of the damage. The 20-year-old has just a week to go before returning home to Airdrie, Alberta. Straschnitzki, paralyzed from the chest down, says he's been able to straighten his legs and walk with the use of a wheeled machine. He says the experience has left him at a loss for words, shocked and excited - all at the same time. Straschnitzki, who's hoping to make the Canadian sledge hockey team, took his sled with him to Thailand and has been sitting in it as part of his rehab. He has finally been cleared by doctors and is to get some ice time in Bangkok later this week. --- ICYMI (in case you missed it) ... WHITEHORSE, Yukon - Canada is getting its first Arctic university. This past week, the Yukon legislature passed a bill to make Yukon College a university. It will be an institution with an Indigenous flavour that will make it as unique as the region it is to serve. ""Everybody knows we're moving toward something big and something special,"" said Tom Ullyett, chairman of the board of governors. The idea of a northern university has been kicked around since at least 2007 when a survey in all three territories found residents wanted more influence over Arctic research. Northern First Nations have been asking for one for 50 years. Nunavut and the Northwest Territories have colleges that teach courses toward degrees from southern institutions and have announced plans to broaden their post-secondary offerings. Yukon College has done the same in science, education and social work and also offers courses towards bachelor's degrees in Indigenous governance and business administration. Once the college is transformed, it will become the first institution in the territories to grant a degree under its own name. Diplomas the first graduates of the governance program get next spring will read ""Yukon University."" The institution, which will also offer trades programs, will allow northerners to further their education closer to home. --- What we are watching in the U.S. ... NEW YORK - A wave of new laws in 15 states that allow people to make claims of sexual abuse going back decades could bring a deluge of lawsuits against the Roman Catholic Church that could surpass anything seen so far in its clergy abuse crisis. Associated Press interviews with attorneys and clergy abuse watchdog groups found it could result in at least 5,000 new cases against the church and more than $4 billion in payouts. It's a financial reckoning playing out in such Catholic strongholds as New York, California and New Jersey, among eight states that go the furthest with ""lookback windows"" allowing sex abuse claims no matter how old. Catholic leaders worry about the difficulty of defending such old cases, and more dioceses are considering bankruptcy and victim compensation funds. --- What we are watching in the rest of the world ... MADRID - Delegates from almost 200 countries have begun a two-week international climate conference in Madrid that seeks to step up efforts to stop global warming. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is warning that the efforts so far are insufficient to overcome the ""point of no return"" in climate change. ""What is lacking is political will,"" Guterres told reporters on the eve of the COP25 meeting, which opened today. The summit, which moved to the Spanish capital after Chile had to pull out amid anti-government protests, aims to put the finishing touches to the rules governing the 2015 Paris accord. That involves creating a functioning international emissions-trading system and compensating poor countries for losses they suffer from rising sea levels and other consequences of climate change. --- This report by The Canadian Press was first published on Dec. 2, 2019. \"
"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada142","Science warnings, US retreat add urgency to UN climate talks","November 30, 2019 Saturday","Red Deer Advocate","MADRID - Mass protests, a last-minute venue change and talk of climate tipping points are adding some unplanned drama to this year's international talks on tackling global warming. Delegates from almost 200 countries had hoped to put the finishing touches to the rules governing the 2015 Paris accord, ironing out a few wrinkles left over from last year's conference in Katowice, Poland, and setting the scene for a major review of their efforts in 2020. But then Brazil pulled its offer of hosting the talks and stand-in Chile, rattled by anti-government protests, cancelled five weeks before the meeting. Next, President Donald Trump served formal notice that the United States was quitting the Paris accord, delivering a symbolic blow to one of his predecessor's signature achievements. And scientists? Well, they didn't have any good news either. Study after study published in recent months has underscored the rapid pace of global warming and the need to urgently cut emissions of greenhouse gases. ""We have to do more in less time,"" said Spanish environment minister Teresa Ribera, whose country stepped in at short notice to host the talks, saying it wanted to support ""constructive multilateralism"" in the wake of Chile's announcement and the U.S. withdrawal. U.N. climate chief Patricia Espinosa said Saturday that ""science tells us we are still in time"" to tackle the climate crisis. ""That doesn't mean changing the world by tomorrow, but we must make decisions today,"" she said during a visit to the meeting venue. Organizers expect around 25,000 visitors, including heads of state, scientists, seasoned negotiators and activists to attend the two-week meeting. The main items on the agenda include finalizing rules on global carbon markets and agreeing how poor countries should be compensated for destruction largely caused by emissions from rich nations. Proposals to create a worldwide market for emissions permits have been around for decades. The idea is that putting a price on carbon dioxide - the main greenhouse gas - and gradually reducing the available permits will encourage countries and companies to cut their emissions, notably by shifting away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy sources. The European Union and some other jurisdictions already operate limited emissions trading systems, but efforts to roll these out worldwide have been hampered by fears that the lack of robust and transparent rules could corrupt the market. ""It would be great news to finalize this issue,"" said Ribera. But she warned that the ""solvency and integrity of the system"" was a concern. ""If we cannot complete it correctly, it's better to lay the ground for later completion,"" said Ribera. That view was echoed by Yamide Dagnet, a former EU climate negotiator now with the Washington-based environmental think-tank World Resources Institute. ""Without proper oversight and robustness these mechanisms could severely undercut climate action by creating loopholes, letting countries off the hook for making meaningful emission cuts, resulting in double counting and jeopardizing environmental integrity,"" she said. The question of compensating poor countries for environmental destruction - technically referred to as loss and damage - is also likely to be sensitive, said Dagnet. Attributing specific weather disasters such as hurricanes and floods, or slow but irreversible changes like sea level rise and desertification, to climate change remains a delicate issue given the potential sums involved. Concerns about the cost of climate change are growing on all fronts. Trump cited financial demands on the United States as one of the reasons for quitting the Paris accord; European countries have hesitated to raise fuel prices for fear of sparking yellow vest-style protests like those seen in France; meanwhile, businesses are beginning to consider the price not just of reducing emissions but also of failing to do so. Scientists say the time to act is now, if the world wants to meet the goal set in Paris of keeping global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), ideally 1.5 C by the end of the century. By some measures average temperatures have already increased by one degree Celsius since pre-industrial times, with the sharpest rise occurring in the last few decades. ""Global warming is going faster,"" said Johan Rockstr&#246;m, co-director of Germany's Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. ""Climate impacts are occurring earlier and we are approaching potentially irreversible thresholds earlier than we previously thought."" Rockstr&#246;m and several colleagues recently warned that the world is heading for several "" tipping points "" that could sharply accelerate the pace of climate change. They include deforestation in the Amazon and the decline of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica. Such messages resonate with environmental activists like Laura Laguna, a member of the Madrid chapter of Fridays for Future, one of the groups planning to protest during the climate talks, known as the 25th Conference of the Parties, or COP25 . Ribera, whose formal title is interim minister for ecological transition, indicated that European Union leaders may try to send a strong signal during the meeting that the bloc is prepared to make sharper cuts to its emissions than previously pledged. A recent proposal to aim for ""climate neutrality"" by 2050 failed to win support from all of the EU's 28 member states - including the host of last year's talks, Poland. \"

See Photo CPT14029599, SKP10329666 See Video INDEX: National, Politics HL:Greens to vote against Liberal throne speech unless carbon targets toughened: May By Teresa Wright THE CANADIAN PRESS OTTAWA - Capping a week of meetings with opposition leaders, Justin Trudeau met Friday with the Green party's Elizabeth May, who says she will vote against the Liberal government in confidence motions unless the prime minister commits to measures that lower Canada's carbon emissions sharply. May emerged from the morning meeting saying she invoked the names of Trudeau's three children in her push for a more aggressive approach to fighting climate change. ""I was very clear with him. This is about whether Ella Grace and Hadrien and Xavier are going to have a livable world by the time they're adults. This is not impersonal, this is real, it's personal and it's a question of moral courage."" They discussed a number of areas where the Green party and Liberals share common ground, and May said her caucus of three will be willing to vote for individual laws that are in keeping with Green priorities, including implementing a universal pharmacare program and harmonizing Canada's laws with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. But when it comes to confidence motions like the upcoming throne speech or the federal budget, which the Liberal minority can pass only with support from other parties, May said she cannot vote for the Liberals if they keep their recent course. ""We could never vote confidence in a government that was pursuing pipelines and increasing greenhouse gases,"" she said. The only way to get Green support would be either to stop pursuing energy projects like the Alberta-B.C. Trans Mountain pipeline expansion and the liquefied natural gas project in northern British Columbia, or to commit to more aggressive carbon-emissions targets. The Greens campaigned on lowering emissions 60 per cent below 2005 levels to help hold a global temperature rise to 1.5 C, as recommended by the United Nations intergovernmental panel on climate change. As part of the 2015 Paris agreement, Canada committed to reducing its annual greenhouse gas emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. During the election campaign, Liberals promised to put Canada on a path to being carbon-neutral by 2050 - a move May applauded Friday as a step in the right direction. Carbon-neutrality would mean that every greenhouse-gas emission would be balanced by sucking an equal amount of greenhouse gas from the atmosphere. That's why she also urged the prime minister to attend an international climate change summit in Madrid next month, to push countries to be more ambitious in their emissions-reduction targets. Attending would be difficult for Trudeau because the summit takes place as the Commons begins sitting again Dec. 5, with a throne speech that will lay out his general plans for governing. The UN gathering - the 25th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or "" COP25 "" for short - runs from Dec. 2 to 13. Nevertheless, for the leader of an oil-producing country to attend the international summit would send a strong signal to other nations, May said. Trudeau told May he will discuss green issues with his environment minister once the new cabinet is sworn in next Wednesday. She said she anticipates Catherine McKenna will be moved from the role after holding it for the Liberals' whole first term, speculating that rookie Liberal MP Steven Guilbeault, a long-time environmentalist, is an obvious choice for the position. Trudeau also promised to bring new legislation to harmonize federal laws with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), addressing a key Green request, and to stave off the loss of abortion services in New Brunswick, May said. May has stepped down as overall Green leader but is still the head of the Greens' three-member caucus in the House of Commons. Trudeau has sought common ground with the Conservative, Bloc Quebecois and NDP leaders in separate sessions over the last week as he prepares to return to Parliament without a majority in the Commons. The Greens elected more MPs in the October vote than they've ever had, but remain the only party in the Commons that doesn't have the numbers to give Trudeau's Liberals a win by voting with the government if all the other parties don't. That made Friday's meeting more a courtesy than a negotiation between rivals seeking to find compromises to advance their agendas. Before their meeting began, Trudeau acknowledged there would be areas in which he disagrees with May, ""probably on the level of ambition that you keep pushing us on,"" he said. He also recognized her decade of leadership of the Green party and fighting for action on climate issues, which he said has been a ""significant contributor to the fact that we are not in discussions on whether we should fight climate change but on how best to fight climate change."" May thanked Trudeau for the acknowledgment, then smiled. ""As former leader, I promise to be just as annoying."" They both laughed.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada146","The simplest of climate models run decades ago accurately projected global warming","December 5, 2019 Thursday","Sarnia Observer","It's a common refrain from those who question mainstream climate science findings: The computer models scientists use to project future global warming are inaccurate and shouldn't be trusted to help policy-makers decide whether to take potentially expensive steps to rein in greenhouse gas emissions. A new study effectively snuffs out that argument by looking at how climate models published between 1970 - before such models were the supercomputer-dependent behemoths of physical equations covering glaciers, ocean pH, and vegetation, as they are today - and 2007. The study, published Wednesday in Geophysical Research Letters, finds that most of the models examined were uncannily accurate in projecting how much the world would warm in response to increasing amounts of planet-warming greenhouse gases. Such gases, chiefly the main longlived greenhouse gas pollutant carbon dioxide, hit record highs this year, according to a new UN report out Tuesday. They are now higher than at any other time in human history. The study does fault some of the models, including one of the most famous calculations by former NASA researcher James Hansen, for overestimating warming because they assumed there would be even greater amounts of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere than what actually occurred. These assumptions mostly involved non-CO2 greenhouse gases, such as methane. Hansen's projection, says study lead author Zeke Hausfather, a researcher at the University of California at Berkeley, erred by about 50 per cent because it did not foresee a significant drop in emissions of substances that deplete the stratospheric ozone layer. Many of those gases are also powerful global warming agents. Hansen also didn't foresee a temporary stabilization in methane emissions during the 2000s, Hausfather says. However, his model, like many of the others examined in the new study, got the basic relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of warming they would cause, correct. The errors came from poorly predicting bigger wild cards: How societal factors would govern future emissions through economic growth, emissions reduction agreements, and other factors. ""The big take-away is that climate models have been around a long time, and in terms of getting the basic temperature of the Earth right, they've been doing that for a long time,"" Hausfather said in an interview. ""Climate models today aren't perfect, they're still being improved,"" he says. While a figure and calculations included in the study seems to show that many of the models had a slight warm bias over time, Hausfather says the study found ""no detectable consistent overestimation or underestimation of future warming"" in the models that were examined. On temperature, there's considerable confidence that the current models are accurately capturing the planet's response to record amounts of greenhouse gases in the air. However, there are many other aspects of a changing climate that contain bigger uncertainties, such as cloud formation and how small atmospheric particles known as aerosols could alter the types of clouds that form. This could either enhance or diminish warming. ""Temperature is easy, other climate variables like precipitation are a lot harder."" For the study, researchers evaluated climate models on how they performed regarding the amount of projected global mean temperature change compared to what actually took place over time. On this count, 10 out of the 17 models examined were virtually indistinguishable from observations, the study found - in other words a near-perfect match. They also looked at the relationship between a model's temperature projection and the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, also known as external forcing. On this comparison, 14 out of the 17 models ""were not differentiable from observations,"" and two of the 14 showed more warming than actually occurred, with one showing less warming, Hausfather says. ""We argue that that second test is a more accurate one,"" Hausfather says, because it allows scientists to control for the fact that models might get the amount of external forcing wrong, but the relationship between greenhouse gases and temperature change correct. ""By looking at this relationship between temperature and forcing, we can evaluate the model's performance on its physics and not on its crystal ball of future emissions,"" Hausfather said. Researchers who were not involved in the new study said it employed relatively simple statistical analyses that may miss some key influences on global surface temperatures over time. For example, Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said he has doubts about the study's key conclusion that ""climate models are effectively capturing the processes"" that drive the global mean surface temperature over many decades. He says the reality is more complex than the study shows, since some of the more uncertain factors about climate change, such as how the water cycle is responding as the world warms, could influence global temperatures, as do hurricanes and aerosols, which are either not included in climate models or, in the case of aerosols, a big question mark since they can influence cloud formation that in turn can alter temperatures. According to Trenberth, the mere fact that the models have been generally on target doesn't prove that they are getting such complex processes correct, and further research is necessary for that. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2019 Osprey Media Group Inc.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada147","'Put them against the wall': Greta Thunberg apologizes for misspeaking at climate protest","December 16, 2019 Monday","Postmedia Breaking News","Climate activist Greta Thunberg( HYPERLINK https://nationalpost.com/tag/greta-thunberg https://nationalpost.com/tag/greta-thunberg ) received quite a bit of heat this past weekend for misspeaking at climate protest, as well for seemingly calling out a German train company. ""World leaders are still trying to run away from their responsibilities, but we have to make sure they cannot do that,"" Thunberg said at a climate march in Turin, Italy on Friday, after attending the UN climate summit COP25 in Madrid. ""We will make sure that we put them against the wall, and they will have to do their job to protect our futures."" People quickly took issue with the latter part of the teenager's speech, claiming the phrase incites violence and refers to executing people by firing squad, against a wall. On Saturday, Thunberg took to Twitter to clarify what she meant. ""Yesterday I said we must hold our leaders accountable and unfortunately said 'put them against the wall'. That's Swenglish: £tt st\'e4lla n\'e5gon mot v\'e4ggen' (to put someone against the wall) means to hold someone accountable,"" she tweeted( HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/GretaThunberg/status/1205862132308488193 https://twitter.com/GretaThunberg/status/1205862132308488193 ). ""That's what happens when you improvise speeches in a second language."" ... improvise speeches in a second language. But of course I apologise if anyone misunderstood this. I can not enough express the fact that I - as well as the entire school strike movement- are against any possible form of violence.

The next day, Thunberg had to clarify and explain herself again after posting a photo of herself seated on the floor of a German train. Nestled by her was a pile of her suitcases and looking out the window, Thunberg captioned the photo ""Traveling on overcrowded trains through Germany. And I'm finally on my way home!"" Deutsche Bahn, the train company, responded initially by apologizing, before deleting the tweet and taking offence. ""Dear Greta, thank you for supporting us railroad workers in the fight against climate change! We were pleased that you were on the ICE 74...,"" the company tweeted( HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/db_presse/status/1206182673888219136 ). ""It would have been even nicer if you had also reported how friendly and competent you were looked after by our team at your seat in first class.""

Deutsche Bahn, in a press release( HYPERLINK https://www.deutschebahn.com/de/presse/pressestart_zentrales_uebersicht/Greta-Thunberg-mit-dem-ICE-der-DB-fuer-den-Klimaschutz-unterwegs-zwischen-Kassel-und-Hamburg-auf-Sitzplatz-in-der-Ersten-Klasse-4706954?contentId=1204030 ), pointed out that the teenager rode in a first class seat. Thunberg said she was only able to get a seat after travelling more than four hours into her journey, before switching trains at Hamburg. ""This is no problem of course and I never said it was,"" she tweeted. ""Overcrowded trains is a great sign because it means the demand for train travel is high!"" Our train from Basel was taken out of traffic. So we sat on the floor on 2 different trains. After G\'f6ttingen I got a seat.This is no problem of course and I never said it was.

Thunberg shot into the spotlight for sticking true to living a low-carbon lifestyle by choosing to sail from Europe to New York to attend the UN's climate conferences( HYPERLINK https://nationalpost.com/news/world/after-her-american-tour-how-is-greta-thunberg-getting-home https://nationalpost.com/news/world/after-her-american-tour-how-is-greta-thunberg-getting-home ) in August. Following numerous climate protests across North America and Europe, the 16-year-old told reporters in Madrid that she needs a break. ""I will be home for Christmas and then I will take a holiday break because you need to take rest. Otherwise you cannot do this all the time."" Thunberg has faced numerous attacks from the far right and even American President Donald Trump during her climate campaigning( HYPERLINK https://nationalpost.com/news/world/trump-mocks-teen-climate-activist-thunberg-after-she-was-named-time-person-of-the-year-chill-greta-chill?video_autoplay=true https://nationalpost.com/news/world/trump-mocks-teen-climate-activist-thunberg-after-she-was-named-time-person-of-the-year-chill-greta-chill?video_autoplay=true ).

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada148","Presents Corporate Update, COVID Response and 2019 Annual Results","May 19, 2020 Tuesday 8:55 AM PST","Market News Publishing","SIGMA LITHIUM RESOURCES CORP (""SGMA-V"") - Presents Corporate Update, COVID Response and 2019 Annual Results SIGMA Lithium Resources Corporation (""Sigma"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to present the project progress update and announce the filing of its financial statements and management's discussion and analysis for the year ended December 31, 2019. COVID-19 RESPONSE Sigma's management has been continuously assessing the situation and taking the necessary actions to address employee health and safety. Sigma is abiding by all government restrictions relating to COVID-19, notably in Sao Paulo and Toronto, where administrative and support staff, as well as third party accounting service providers have been working from home. The Company has implemented several protocols, including significantly restricting travel and generally requiring remote working for administrative personnel. Due to Sigma's pre-operating status, the required changes at its Grota do Cirilo project (the ""Project"") have not been substantial. Sigma is actively supporting its communities of Itinga and Aracuai in the Jequitinhonha Valley. As previously announced, the Company procured 12 tons of sodium hypochlorite (hospital sanitizer liquid bleach) to be distributed to numerous hospitals, medical clinics, prisons, nursing homes, care centers for people with disabilities and religious entities in the Vale do Jequitinhonha region. This amount should supply them until December 2020. The municipality of Itinga conducted a comprehensive disinfecting program of the municipal food marketplace and public areas using the chemicals provided by Sigma. ""While we remain fully committed to bringing Sigma to production, our top priority will continue to be protecting the health and safety of our employees and their families and our communities,"" commented Calvyn Gardner, Sigma's CEO. ""I couldn't be prouder of the way our employees, our communities in Vale do Jequitinhonha have responded to these unprecedented times. We have been actively supporting the efforts of the municipalities of Itinga and Aracuai to address this challenge. We will continue to engage with the municipalities to plan new initiatives in the coming months."" As of May 15th, 2020, the Brazilian government has not introduced measures which impede the normal operation of the Project. On March 20, 2020, the Brazilian Ministry of Mines and Energy issued a decree which includes the mining sector amongst the industries considered to be ""essential"" to the prosperity and economy of the country. As a result, the on-site activities of operational and pre-operational mining companies in Brazil are not subject to the physical movement restrictions and shelter-in-place, lockdowns and state border restrictions imposed by certain states and municipalities as a result of the COVID-19. Nevertheless, the Company is following closely other macroeconomic, capital markets, political and social changes that will affect the Company as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and its impact on the auto industry and demand for electric vehicles. MOST RECENT HIGHLIGHTS SUBSEQUENT TO THE YEAR-END AND IN 2019, (IN REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER):  Following the submission and ongoing review by ANM (""Agencia Nacional de Mineracao"") in Brazil of the PAE (""Plano de Aproveitamento Economico"") for the Barreiro deposit at the Project, Sigma has commissioned its environmental studies and initiated the process of obtaining its environmental license in Minas Gerais.  On March 16, 2020, Sigma formally engaged Banco do Brasil S.A. (""BB""), Brazil's largest bank, to advise and support the Company to prepare a financing package to fund the Company. BB has been in active discussions with various development banks and development agencies in Brazil: Banco do Nordeste (BNB), BNDES, BDMG and FINEP (the ""Development Banks""). The Company is seeking commitments from the Development Banks for an aggregate amount to complete a financing package that, added together with the remaining US$27 million portion of the Mitsui Pre-Payment (defined below), would fund the Project construction in full.  On February 21, 2020, Duro Felguera (""DF"") and Primero Group Americas Inc. (a subsidiary of Primero Group Ltd.) (""Primero"") successfully completed the first phase of Early Contractor Involvement (""ECI"") with Sigma and provided an updated Guaranteed Maximum Price (""GMP"") of US$70 million for the engineering, procurement and construction (""EPC"") of the Project. The construction cost in the GMP of US$59 million was lower than the US$66 million for plant and infrastructure estimated in the Feasibility Study Report (as defined below). For comparison purposes and to maintain consistency with the Feasibility Study Report, the GMP was calculated utilizing the same foreign exchange rate of the Feasibility Study Report of US$ 1 = BRL 3.85. On May 15th the exchange rate was US$ 1 = BRL 5.89. The approximate 50% devaluation of the Brazilian Real to date will have the overall effect of decreasing the expected capital expenditure (""Capex"") of the Project, a material portion of which is expected to be sourced domestically in Brazil and is, therefore, to be denominated in Brazilian Real. The parties are currently negotiating a Memorandum of Understanding formalizing the next steps of the detailed engineering phase of the Project.  On November 29, 2019, the Company entered into an agreement with A10 Group, a group of companies owned by certain directors of the Company providing for a $6.6 million (US$5 million) revolver credit facility (the ""A10 Group Credit Facility""), bearing interest at 11% per annum, calculated from the day funds are drawn. This facility has a one-year term, which is the maturity for all funds drawn, and allows funding for lender approved expenses. As of December 31, 2019, $311,760 (US$240,000) had been drawn on the A10 Group Credit Facility. As of May 14, 2020, $1,388,732 (US$986,000) had been drawn on this facility.  On November 8, 2019, the Company's Chief Strategic Officer addressed the World Climate Summit during the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP 25 in Madrid and presented the case study of the Company as an ESG ""green lithium"" company and the role played by its investors in providing the capital and the leadership to drive the implementation of environmental and social best practices.  On November 6, 2019, the Company filed the technical report titled ""Grota do Cirilo Lithium Project, Aracuai and Itinga Regions, Minas Gerais, Brazil, National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report on Feasibility Study Final Report"", dated October 18, 2019 and with an effective date of September 16, 2019 (the ""Feasibility Study Report"") on SEDAR ( HYPERLINK http://www.sedar.com www.sedar.com ). Based on the design considered by the Feasibility Study Report, the Project's commercial production plant will have the capacity to process 1.5 million metric tonnes of spodumene ore per year, expandable to 3 million metric tonnes within the same production complex. The lithium process design is proprietary and includes Dense Media Separation (""DMS"") technology. The commercial production plant design is projected to produce 220,000 tonnes of high-quality battery-grade 6% lithium oxide concentrate per annum, with one of the lowest reported levels of impurities in the world. At a later stage, Sigma has the option to double the commercial production plant capacity to process 3 million metric tonnes of spodumene ore per year, producing an expected 440,000 tonnes of high-quality battery-grade 6% lithium oxide concentrate, subject to completion of all related studies and assessments. The economic analysis in the Feasibility Study Report includes an after tax NPV for the Project's Xuxa deposit and the commercial production plant of US$249 million, IRR of 43% and payback of 3.1 years. The Feasibility Study Report includes (i) a Mineral Reserves estimate of 10.27 million tonnes of proven reserves with 1.45% Li2O content and 3.52 million tonnes of probable reserves with 1.47% Li2O content, and (ii) a Mineral Resources estimate of 26.34 million tonnes of measured resources with 1.39% Li2O content, and 19.44 million tonnes of indicated resources with 1.37% Li2O content and 6.6 million tonnes of inferred resources. This represents approximately 1,560,919 tonnes of Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (""LCE"") in the measured and indicated categories, with a further 220,070 tonnes LCE in the inferred category. The estimates were prepared using a cut-off grade of 0.5% Li2O.  In July 2019, the Company filed at the ANM (""Agencia Nacional de Mineracao"") in Brazil the PAE (""Plano de Aproveitamento Economico"") for the Project's Barreiro deposit. The PAE is the study required by the Brazilian regulators to authorize the commencement of commercial mining activities, and an approved PAE is required for the environmental licensing process. Sigma initiated sample selection for metallurgical studies and pre-feasibility level test work for the Barreiro deposit in order to confirm that its lithium spodumene can be economically processed through the same DMS processing circuit of the commercial production plant designed to process the spodumene of the Project's Xuxa deposit.  On June 11, 2019, the Company announced that it had obtained the required environmental licenses for both construction (""LP"") and installation (""LI"") of the commercial production plant from the environmental authority of the State of Minas Gerais, the Council of Environmental Policy (""Conselho Estadual de Politica Ambiental - COPAM"") in Brazil. COPAM has issued a Dual LP and LI Certificate for a period of six years expiring on May 31, 2025.  In April 2019, lithium spodumene concentrate samples were validated by several large potential customers in the chemical and cathode industries, who confirmed their exceptional quality (battery grade above 6%) and very low impurities (specifically low levels of alkaline elements and iron, both well below 1%). The Company has received significant interest in long-term offtake arrangements for its spodumene concentrate.  On April 5, 2019, the Company announced the execution of a binding heads of agreement for an offtake of spodumene concentrate (the ""Mitsui Pre-Payment"") with Mitsui &Co. Ltd. (""Mitsui"").  In February 2019, the definitive Water License for the construction of the commercial production plant was granted by Agencia Nacional de Aguas, the Federal government water agency of Brazil.  Also in February 2019, certain tax incentives and exemptions were received under an economic development program administered by SUDENE, a Brazilian federal government agency.  On January 10, 2019, the Company announced that an updated mineral resource estimate for the Project has been completed by SGS consisting of measured and indicated resources of 45.7 million tonnes and inferred resource of 6.6 million tonnes. This represents approximately 1,560,919 tonnes of Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (""LCE"") in the measured and indicated categories, with a further 220,070 tonnes LCE in the inferred category, tripling the mineral resource reflected in the previous estimate. The estimates (which are also reflected in the Feasibility Study Report) were prepared using a cut-off grade of 0.5% Li2O. The technical report, was filed on February 25, 2019 at HYPERLINK http://www.sedar.com www.sedar.com FINANCIAL RESULTS Selected consolidated financial information is presented as follows: //st (in CAD $thousands Year ended December Year ended December except per share 31,2019 31,2018 information) General and (3,907.8) (6,317.0) Administrative Expenses Net Loss (5,075.0) (10,450.1) Net Comprehensive Loss (5,175.80) (10,664.00) Loss per Common Share - (0.07) (0.23) Basic and Diluted Cash and Cash Equivalents 103.6 4,160.8 Total Assets 20,927.2 19,076.7 Total Liabilities (12,187.9) (7,694.8) The Company's net loss totalled $5,074,967 for the year ended December 31, 2019, with basic and diluted loss per share of $0.07. This compares with a net loss of $10,450,133 with basic and diluted loss per share of $0.23 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in net loss of $5,375,166 was principally because of lower general and administrative expenses, which totalled $3,907,847 for the year ended December 31, 2019 (2018 - $6,317,042). At December 31, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $103,640, compared to $4,160,792 at December 31, 2018. The decrease in cash of $4,057,152 from the December 31, 2018 cash balance of $4,160,792 was the result of net cash inflows in operating activities of $409,731 (net of the initial tranche of the Mitsui Pre-Payment), cash outflows from investing activities of $4,893,174; cash inflows in financing activities of $377,608, and positive effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash held in foreign currency of $48,683. Management believes that the Company has access to sufficient funds for its planned expenditures for the next 12 months and to meet certain ongoing obligations with third parties. The Company has considerable flexibility in terms of the pace and timing of project costs and how expenditures have been, or may be, adjusted, limited or deferred subject to current capital resources and the potential to raise further funds. The CAD$6.6 million (US$5 million) A10 Group Credit Facility provides additional support for the Company's needs. As of December 31, 2019, $311,760 (US$240,000) had been drawn on the A10 Group Credit Facility. As of May 15, 2020, $1,388,732 (US$986,000) had been drawn on the A10 Group Credit Facility. NEXT STEPS FOR SIGMA FOR 2020 (SUBJECT TO COVID-19 DEVELOPMENTS) It is not possible to reliably estimate the length and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic or its ultimate impact on the financial results and condition of the Company and its operating subsidiaries in future periods. Therefore, Sigma has been focusing on advancing the Project to construction, prioritizing the activities that can be mostly executed with Brazilian-based personnel and that require a limited amount of inbound and outbound travel to and from Brazil. In 2020, subject to COVID-19 developments, the Company intends to:  Continue to work closely with both the Development Banks and other international and Brazilian financial institutions to finalize financing for the Project construction in full.  Following the approval of the PAE (""Plano de Aproveitamento Economico"") for the Barreiro Deposit, continue to execute the environmental licensing process for the Project's Barreiro deposit, prepare the RIMA report and file with SUPRAM (""Superintendencia Regional do Meio Ambiente"").  Finalize the negotiations with DF and Primero to initiate the detailed engineering to build the commercial production plant.  Finalize the ongoing pre-feasibility study for the Barreiro Deposit, validating the economic potential and production costs outlined in the PAE, as well as its mineral reserve estimate. Mining the Barreiro deposit, subject to completion of all related feasibility studies and assessments, has the potential to double the average annual production capacity of the commercial production plant to 440,000 tonnes per year.  Continue ongoing negotiations with offtake customers and potential partners in order to finalize binding off-take agreements (interested parties to date include companies from the lithium, mining, chemicals, battery and automotive sectors), and conclude formalizing a binding additional offtake commitment with Mitsui. MINOR DELAYS IN FILING 1Q 2020 As a result of Sigma experiencing initial unforeseen difficulties implementing ""home office"" working practices for its administrative staff in Sao Paulo and Toronto in March, the company experienced a 15-day delay in filing its 2019 annual disclosure documents required under National Instrument 51-102 (""NI 51-102""). These difficulties have been resolved and administrative activities are normalized. However, the minor delay will be carried into filing the first quarter disclosures. Sigma is continuing to work diligently and expeditiously and the first quarter 2020 filings are expected to be completed on or before June 15, 2020. The Company confirms that since the recent filing of its 2019 annual financial statements, there have been no material business developments other than those disclosed through news releases. Sigma will be relying on Blanket Order 51-517 - Temporary Exemption from Certain Corporate Finance Requirements of the British Columbia Securities Commission and similar exemptions provided by the Ontario Securities Commission, which allow for a delay in required quarterly disclosure document filings in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sigma will be relying on the temporary exemption with respect to the following provisions: (i) The requirement to file interim consolidated financial statements for the three month period ended March 31, 2020 within 60 days of the end of the three month period ended March 31, 2020, as required by section 4.4(b) of NI 51-102; (ii) the requirement to file management discussion and analysis for the period covered by such first quarter financial statements within 60 days of the end of the first quarter as required by section 5.1(2) of NI 51-102; and (iii) the requirement to file certifications of the first quarter financial statements pursuant to section 5.1 of National Instrument 52-109. In the interim, management and other insiders of Sigma are subject to a management trading black-out policy as described, in principle, in section 9 of National Policy 11- 207. INDEPENDENT QUALIFIED PERSON ABOUT SIGMA LITHIUM Sigma is a Canadian company and produces environmentally sustainable battery-grade lithium concentrate on a pilot scale since 2018, shipping high-quality above 6% Li2O coarse lithium concentrate samples to potential customers in Asia.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada149","Chile cancels climate, trade summits amid protest chaos; Chile cancels climate, trade summits amid protest chaos","October 31, 2019 Thursday 00:22 AM EST","Canadian Press","SANTIAGO, Chile - Chilean President Sebasti\'e1n Pi\'f1era cancelled two major international summits and said he would focus on restoring security and moving ahead in the coming days with an attempt to satisfy popular demands for better social services and a lower cost of living. Thirteen days into a wave of protests that has left more than a dozen people dead, hundreds injured and businesses and infrastructure damaged, the streets of Santiago were mostly calm on Wednesday night after Pi\'f1era's announcement. A few thousand people protested outside the presidential palace. It was unclear if the relative tranquility would continue Thursday, the first day in a long holiday weekend in Chile. The decision to call off the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and U.N. global climate gatherings, planned for November and December, respectively, dealt a major blow to Chile's image as a regional oasis of stability and economic development. But leaders across Chile's political spectrum, and protesters on the streets Wednesday, mostly said they accepted Pi\'f1era's decision, although many lamented cancelling the climate summit. Chile has moved faster than many South American countries to reduce carbon emissions, and activists and politicians alike had high hopes for the summit. ""This has been a very difficult decision that causes us great pain,"" Pi\'f1era said in a televised address. ""A president always has to put the needs of his countrymen first."" Pi\'f1era said he was forced to cancel both events due to the chaos unleashed by 12 days of protests. Demonstrators are demanding greater economic equality and better public services in a country long seen as an economic success story. Shops have been vandalized and buildings set on fire, shutting down numerous subway stations. Heraldo Mu\'f1oz, president of Chile's opposition Party for Democracy, said he thought it was unfortunate the climate summit was cancelled. ""On the other hand, the desire to hold the meeting wasn't realistic,"" he said. ""We have to focus on domestic affairs."" Some demonstrators said they agreed with Pi\'f1era's decision. ""The political situation right now in Chile isn't right for talking productively about climate change,"" said Micha Vergara, a 20-year-old art student. Trade and climate negotiators scrambled to find new locations for their summits, aimed at resolving tariff-related conflicts between China and the U.S. and finalizing countries' climate rules in advance of a bigger summit next year during which governments will be asked to commit to new emissions limits. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping had hoped to sign a modest trade agreement at the APEC summit, formerly scheduled to take place in Santiago on Nov. 16-17. Under the tentative deal, the U.S. had agreed to suspend plans to raise tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports, and Beijing had agreed to step up purchases of U.S. farm products. White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said U.S. officials were ""awaiting potential information regarding another location,"" but it was unclear if any had been proposed. Gidley added that Trump wanted to sign the deal with China ""within the same time frame,"" hinting that a separate event could occur outside a summit. The so-called Phase One trade agreement did little to address the underlying U.S. grievances against China, including its alleged practice of forcing foreign firms to hand over trade secrets, stealing technology, and unfairly subsidizing Chinese firms. China's leaders have been reluctant to make the kind of policy reforms that would satisfy Washington, worrying such concessions would mean scaling back their aspirations to become a world leader in advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and driverless cars. Still, the apparent cancellation of the summit ""removes a hard deadline for action toward a comprehensive agreement in the trade war,"" said Jeff Moon, a former U.S. diplomat and trade official specializing in China who is now president of the China Moon Strategies consultancy. ""That hard deadline and the relatively short period of time available allowed Trump and Xi to give themselves permission to do only easy things and delay indefinitely resolving tough issues."" Now, Moon said, ""there is no excuse for not pressing forward with the full U.S. agenda of concerns."" Climate advocates said they were disappointed but expected to relocate their talks. COP25 will be moved I will now wait until I have more information,"" tweeted teen climate activist Greta Thunberg. The Santiago climate conference was meant to work out some of the remaining unresolved rules for countries on climate efforts, smoothing the way for the bigger effort in the 2020 summit: encouraging countries to up their commitments to cutting climate-changing emissions. ""The absence of rules does not stop countries from acting either alone or together"" to cut emissions, said Nigel Purvis, a climate and environment negotiator in the administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. ""It really shouldn't slow down climate action."" But other climate experts said it was important to get those rules worked out in advance. ""To load everything into one conference - I think they'll work pretty hard not to do that,"" said Henry Jacoby, a climate expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Rachel Cleetus, policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said she believed there would be ""every effort made that some type of ... meeting does happen."" U.N. Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa issued a statement saying ""alternative hosting options"" were being explored. And a U.N. official, speaking on condition of anonymity for lack of authorization to comment publicly, said that all U.N. venues are being considered as options. Those would include cities such as New York, Geneva, Bonn, Vienna and Nairobi. ___ Associated Press reporters Ellen Knickmeyer and Paul Wiseman in Washington; Frank Jordans in Berlin; and Luis Andres Henao in Buenos Aires contributed to this report. \"
"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada150","Chile's deadly weekend of fire as youth anger ignites","October 21, 2019 Monday","National Post (f/k/a The Financial Post) (Canada)","SANTIAGO - Chile's capital Santiago has been singed by fire. In riots sparked by anger over fare hikes, masked and hooded protesters have torched buses, metro stations, supermarkets, banks and the high-rise headquarters of a major energy firm. Around the city, flames and smoke mixed with tear gas and water cannon spray as armed forces mobilized on the streets for the first time in almost 30 years in a country that still shudders at the memory of military rule. Fare-dodging protests largely by school children and students exploded into violent riots on Friday. Amid the looting, arson and clashes, thousands of residents of rich and poor neighborhoods alike also took to the streets to express a more widespread discontent over rising living costs and patchy public services that is boiling beneath the surface of one of South American's wealthiest and most liberal economies. The demonstrations spread around the country over the weekend, and there was little sign of tempers cooling. ""This is not a simple protest over the rise of metro fares, this is an outpouring for years of oppression that have hit mainly the poorest,"" Karina Sepulveda, an anthropology student, told Reuters at a protest in central Santiago on Sunday as she banged a frying pan with a wooden spoon. ""The illusion of the model Chile is over. Low wages, lack of healthcare and bad pensions have made people tired."" Moments later, she was engulfed in a cloud of tear gas fired by nearby police. Roads in the gentile, tree-lined downtown area were pocked with stones and rubbish from protests the day before, as residents ventured out to find the few open shops. Some joined spontaneous protests on street corners, banging cooking pots and shouting slogans against police repression. Armored personnel carriers drove slowly through the streets with heavily-armed troops in camouflage peering out from inside. ""I have already lived this, seeing soldiers on the streets sends shivers down my spine, it's like going back to 1973,"" said Carmen Araya, 74, referring to the year the military dictator Augusto Pinochet seized control of Chile by force. TOWERING INFERNO The riots grew last week as police came out to stop mass fare evasions after an announcement on Oct. 6 that bus and metro fares would be hiked by between $0.04 and $0.1. On Friday, as the evening commute home approached for millions, some protesters lit fires at metro stations, ransacked shops, burned a bus and vandalized train station turnstiles, forcing the metro network to be shut down. The 18-story city center headquarters of energy firm Enel was set alight, rapidly turning into a towering inferno as flames licked the outside of the building. Enel said all workers had been safely evacuated. By Saturday lunchtime the usual weekend noises of the city - dogs barking, jovial barbecues and Latin pop - was replaced by the clatter of military helicopters, the banging of pots and pans, and the sirens of police and fire engines. Buses were torched and the public transport system was shut down entirely. Menacing messages calling for mass action against emblems of wealth began circulating on social media, foreign embassies warned their citizens to stay indoors, and long lines formed at petrol stations. Multinational firms began shuttering offices, and major supermarket chains and shopping malls closed early. In the port city of Valparaiso, the offices of the Mercurio newspaper, the country's oldest, were torched. RUNNING BATTLES With police and soldiers fighting running battles with protesters in Santiago and elsewhere in the country as night fell again, Pinera appeared on national television to announce a freeze of the transport price hikes. The general placed in charge of Santiago's security then announced a curfew, urging people to return to look after their homes and families. On Sunday, school for the start of the week was canceled along with scores of flights in and out of the city. The army confirmed it shot and injured two people while chasing looters. At least three more died in supermarkets set on fire. The unrest threatens to cast a shadow over the city's hosting of world leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, for the annual APEC counties summit on Nov. 16-17. Trump has said a trade deal between Beijing and Washington could be signed in Santiago. In December, the world's top copper producer will also host a major U.N. climate conference, COP25 . Guillermo Holzmann, political analyst at the University of Valpara\'c3\£dso, told Reuters if Pinera's government could not win protesters over with a promised working party set up to examine the issues that drove them onto the streets, APEC could see fewer senior attendees. ""We could end up seeing a rather intermediate-level meeting and not what was expected, which was Donald Trump signing a historic deal,"" Holzmann said. Around Santiago, meanwhile, people were stunned by the chaos. Francisca Astudillo, 27, a supermarket worker and mother of two, said she sympathized with the protesters, and that the political elite had no idea how hard life was for normal people, but she wanted the violence to stop. ""It's the people turning on the people and that's not right,"" she said. ""It's got out of control.""

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada151","Alberta gas producers need Canada to preach the clean benefits of LNG","December 10, 2019 Tuesday","Edmonton Journal (Alberta)","Petroleum producers and the province are pushing hard for more LNG plants in the country, hoping to create new export opportunities for Canada's massive supplies of natural gas. They also want to see the federal government promote the same goal, and push for international recognition of how liquefied natural gas from Canada can lower global emissions elsewhere by supplanting higher-emitting sources of energy. It's become one of the industry's core messages: Canada can assist other countries by replacing coal used in electricity generation, while creating jobs and business at home by producing more gas. But lukewarm comments from Canada's new environment minister, Jonathan Wilkinson, seem to undercut the notion Ottawa will seek such recognition at the international climate change conference now taking place in Madrid. For gas producers - and the Alberta government - it's a serious concern. ""There is certainly a lot of politics around (the comments) but in reality, I think it is a net benefit to Canada and the world"" to develop Canadian LNG facilities, said Andy Mah, CEO of Advantage Oil &; Gas, one of several producers that have joined forces to promote a proposed export terminal in the country. ""People don't want to sit back and look at the facts, and the facts are other countries are going to replace (existing) energy with coal ... If we are here to help others and the world, that's the place Canada can be."" If built, these facilities would create new markets for Canadian gas producers as their existing market share in the United States is expected to shrink. On Friday, Wilkinson spoke to reporters about Canada's position heading into the COP25 conference in Madrid, but he created more questions in Alberta than he answered. Under the Paris climate agreement, Canada has committed to lower its GHG emissions by 30 per cent below 2005 levels by the year 2030. The Madrid conference will discuss Article 6 of the accord, which would allow for international trading. Countries with lower emissions could sell carbon credit allowances to higher emitters, and this should ""establish a policy foundation for an emissions trading system, which could help lead to a global price on carbon,"" according to the International Chamber of Commerce. Wilkinson said he would push Canada's negotiators to ensure Article 6 is transparent and doesn't allow for double-counting of credits for lowering emissions in one country. While there are ""all kinds of different trades that could happen under Article 6 ... it is certainly possible that LNG could fit into that but at this stage, I think we are much more focused on getting the rules right,"" he said. ""We are not counting on emissions reductions through trading."" That doesn't answer a key question for Alberta or the industry. If the country generates more emissions to produce and export supercooled LNG from Canada, will it get any credit for lowering global emissions by displacing higher-emitting coal used in power generation? Wilkinson wasn't clear, and didn't provide any clarity when talking to the Globe and Mail. ""I think we've got to be very careful about the LNG argument,"" he said, according to the newspaper. Those comments caught the attention of Premier Jason Kenney. Speaking in Ottawa, Kenney said he was disappointed with the response, pointing out various governments in different provinces - from British Columbia and Alberta to Quebec - have backed LNG development. ""This is the single biggest thing that Canada could do to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. We should not make the mistake of looking at Canada as though we live under a sealed biodome,"" the premier told reporters. A world energy outlook report issued last month by the Paris-based International Energy Agency said coal-to-gas switching can offer ""quick wins"" for reducing global emissions. Natural gas generates one-third fewer emissions than coal, on average, for each unit of heat used across industry and in the building sector, and about half of the emissions per unit of electricity that's generated, the report states. The president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers said Wilkinson's comments were ""really making the point it didn't seem to be his intent to enable Canadian gas."" ""There's no chance Canada will meet its Paris commitment unless we enable Article 6, and that then leaves some very bad outcomes for Canada as a whole,"" Tim McMillan said in an interview from Madrid. ""Either we don't live up to what we have committed to ... or we start making dramatic policy decisions that could hamper investment for those projects."" Environmental organizations say the new minister is simply acknowledging reality and that sharing emission reductions will be part of difficult international negotiations. Isabelle Turcotte, director of federal policy at the Pembina Institute, said she was happy to see the minister's cautious approach. Letting two countries claim credit for emissions reductions might make progress on paper, ""but in reality, we're actually emitting more than we were initially,"" said Turcotte, who is also at the conference. But the industry and provincial government aren't about to give up on this point. Mah pointed out many countries are trying to move out of energy poverty and Canada has a part to play in meeting their needs, while generating jobs and revenue in this country to help with the ongoing energy transition. ""Overall gas demand ... is going up immensely in the next 10 years,"" he added. ""So do we want to be part of that in Canada, and also part of helping global emissions?"" It's a question the federal minister will have to have to answer clearly in the next week. Chris Varcoe is a Calgary Herald columnist.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada152","Climate Crisis In The Spotlight; Montreal was a hotbed of activism in 2019, but did it make any real difference?","January 4, 2020 Saturday","The Gazette (Montreal)","On a warm day in mid-March, more than 150,000 students from kindergarten to university took to the streets of Montreal to demand urgent action on climate change. It turned out to be the largest such demonstration in the world that day. The mass mobilization put Montreal on the map as a hotbed of climate activism and helped make the climate crisis the defining issue of 2019, locally, nationally and globally. What followed confirmed the trend: Montreal Mayor Val\'e9rie Plante took centre stage among heads of state at the United Nations to tout the city's climate agenda; Greta Thunberg, the Swedish climate activist who has galvanized her generation, led half a million people on a historic march through Montreal, one of her first stops after arriving in North America by solar-powered yacht; three members of Extinction Rebellion scaled the Jacques Cartier Bridge to unfurl a banner, closing the key span and causing a monster traffic jam. These were the standout moments in a year that seemed to hold such promise as a turning point in the battle against climate change, yet drew to a sobering conclusion. There was an awakening in 2019 about a peril we've been conveniently ignoring for decades. By some estimates, six million people joined demonstrations around the world in the last week of September. But the sense of urgency on the streets has not yet reached many of the decision-makers responsible for the actions needed to avert calamity. Crucial climate negotiations in Madrid ended in failure in December after Thunberg hastily recrossed the Atlantic by boat when the talks were moved there at the last minute from restive Chile. It's a paradox that is sure to continue in 2020, said Fran\'e7ois Geoffroy of La plan\'e8te s'invite au parlement, one of the organizers of the historic demonstration in Montreal. It's ""disappointing, but not surprising,"" he said, that the COP25 meeting in Madrid ended in a stalemate. ""It's certainly a slap in the face. ... It's an annual slap in the face,"" Geoffroy said. ""But it only confirms that change is not going to come from COP. It's not going to come from states and governments. It's going to come from the bottom up."" This has been especially true in Montreal. Throughout 2019, a number of new organizations took their place on the environmental scene to bolster stalwart groups like Equiterre and Greenpeace. Pacte pour la Transition made its debut in late 2018, shortly after the International Panel for Climate Change report revealed the most devastating effects of global warming will be felt at a lower temperature and sooner than previously believed. La Plan\'e8te s'invite au parlement formed in light of the environment's absence in the 2018 Quebec election campaign. Rapidly, they gained attention, prominence and credibility. Over the winter, spinoff groups formed on university and college campuses under the umbrella of La plan\'e8te s'invite \'e0 l'universit\'e9. Quebec's students flexed their muscles on March 15, a strike day for youth around the world. In the spring, Extinction Rebellion made its debut in Quebec. An offshoot of a nascent U.K.-based group, its MO is peaceful civil disobedience, like blocking traffic or sit-ins. Together, these groups joined forces to press the case of the environment to a federal government that talks the talk but doesn't always walk the walk; a Quebec government that only seems to see the environment in terms of a business opportunity to market its relatively clean hydro power; and city governments, like Montreal, that are leading the way, but can only do so much. After the high of Thunberg's visit on Sept. 27, they've been reflecting and strategizing on what's next. ""We've already showed what we're capable of,"" said Geoffroy. ""We're stronger, more energized, more united than ever."" Still, the greenest Montrealers can be forgiven for feeling a little blue as 2019 wraps up. Emissions rose 2.1 per cent worldwide in 2018, according to the latest data, despite the provisions of the Paris Accord. And though China, which is responsible for a third of global carbon emissions, has made significant investments in renewable energy, its greenhouse gas output has still increased. The pro-pipeline Conservatives, who had pledged to cancel the carbon tax, were denied power in the fall federal election, leaving more environmentally conscious parties holding the balance of power in a minority, Liberal-led Parliament. But the vote exposed a country divided, and the national agenda in the aftermath has shifted to address Western alienation. Well-known environmentalist Steven Guilbault was elected for the governing Liberals in the Montreal riding of Laurier-Sainte-Marie and ascended immediately to cabinet, but he landed in the Heritage portfolio, where many wonder whether his voice will be heard. Elizabeth Pinault of Extinction Rebellion said there are many fronts to push governments on in the coming year. Montreal will hold consultations on a zero-waste revolution. Quebec is expected to unveil a critical climate change plan. The federal government has promises to fulfill on curbing single-use plastics. ""It's going to be a hot spring,"" said Pinault. Oxford Dictionaries deemed ""climate emergency"" the word of the year. News editors in Quebec and The Canadian Press chose climate change as the top story of 2019. This recognition is welcome. But what is more important is that the climate crisis remains the most pressing issue in 2020. HYPERLINK mailto:ahanes@postmedia.co ahanes@postmedia.co \"

May has spoken with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau since Monday's election and expects to have an ongoing dialogue with federal leaders before Parliament resumes. The Greens return with three MPs, fewer than many anticipated after promising signs of support from voters early in the campaign. Still, May said in an interview Wednesday she sees opportunity for consensus with the Liberals and New Democrats on key issues. The Liberals will have incentive to prove they're accomplishing things in a minority Parliament if they want to remain in power, May said. She will try to leverage that reality to make gains on addressing the climate crisis. May wants Canada to seriously curb greenhouse-gas emissions by agreeing to aggressive new targets at the global Conference of Parties meeting in Chile in December. ""If we're going to avoid an unlivable world, we have months, not years, to fix this,"" she said. ""So we'll need to apply maximum pressure right now on the Liberals to change our climate target before the negotiations begin at COP 25 in Santiago."" At a news conference Wednesday, Trudeau signalled a willingness to work with fellow parliamentarians on priorities, including climate change, though he ruled out any kind of coalition. May sees common ground on a renegotiated national health accord that includes pharmacare and dental care for low-income Canadians. ""I think there's room for consensus on that."" Such plans could take shape informally among likeminded party leaders in coming weeks, May suggested. ""We could have some time of just talking to one another as leaders on the phone, trying to figure out are there places where we could decide now - let's work to consensus on things like pharmacare, let's work to consensus on climate action."" Parties could also agree on more affordable cellphone rates and collecting a fair share of taxes from global, web-based businesses operating in Canada, she said. May stressed the importance of working with NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh despite lingering anger over what she sees as grossly unfair attacks on her party in British Columbia during the campaign. May hopes leaders will agree to bring a more civil tone to parliamentary debate after seeing respect and decorum disintegrate in the last sitting. ""This could get much, much worse,"" she said. \"

The march was led by dozens of representatives of Latin America's indigenous peoples - a mark of deference after anti-government protests in Chile, the original host of the summit, resulted in the the talks suddenly being moved to Europe for the third year in a row. Celebrity climate activist Greta Thunberg declared from a stage that ""change is not going to come from the people in power, it's going to come from the masses."" A crowd of thousands responded chanting ""Greta! Greta!"" The Swedish teen was followed on her first day in Madrid by a swarm of cameras and reporters, as well as curious members of the public wanting to film her on their smartphones, from the very first step she took out of an overnight train from Lisbon. Two young activists earned cheers as they abseiled from a bridge and strung out a banner saying: ""Just 8 years till 1.5 degrees C. HOW DARE YOU?"" - a reference to scientists' forecasts of rising temperatures and what activists complain is a lack of a convincing political response to the threat. The crush as people tried to get a glimpse of Thunberg led her to pull out shortly after the start of the march, saying police had advised her to leave for safety's sake, and she climbed into an electric car. Earlier in the day, the 16-year-old had said at a press conference that calls for real action against climate change are still being ""ignored"" by political leaders despite their continuous praise of the global environmental youth movement she helped create. Thunberg hoped the COP25 summit would lead to ""something concrete"" and ""increasing awareness among people in general,"" but she said that after more than one year of student strikes""still basically nothing has happened."" ""The climate crisis is still being ignored by those in power,"" she added. During the Dec. 2-13 talks, nearly 200 countries are meant to streamline the rules on global carbon markets and agree on how poor countries should be compensated for destruction largely caused by emissions from rich nations. An official directly involved in the negotiations said that despite a few setbacks, the technical negotiations were progressing, although many issues were being left for ministerial-level meetings in the summit's second and final week. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the discussions, added that a political declaration on greater ""ambition"" - a buzzword at the summit - was shaping to be ""difficult to achieve."" The talks came as evidence mounts about disasters that could ensue from further global warming, including a study published Friday predicting that unchecked climate change could devastate fishery industries and coral reef tourism. The study commissioned by 14 nations whose economies rely heavily on the sea says climate change could cause hundreds of billions of dollars in losses by 2050, adding that limiting global warming would lessen the economic impact for coastal countries, but that they also need to adapt to ocean changes. Demands for greater action by non-governmental organizations and a whole new generation of environment-minded activists were expected to take the spotlight with the presence of Thunberg in Madrid. Past appearances have won her plaudits from some leaders - and criticism from others who've taken offence at the angry tone of her speeches. Asked about the skepticism on global efforts to fight the warming temperatures expressed by some world leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump and Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro, she said: ""Some people want everything to continue like now, they are afraid of the change that we, the youth, are bringing."" ""They try so desperately to silence us,"" she added. ""We are tired of the praises that you keep giving the activists,"" she said. ""We want you to act."" During a brief visit to the summit venue earlier on Friday, Thunberg did not appear unsettled by the commotion surrounding her presence. ""It's absurd. I laugh at it. I do not understand why it has become like this,"" she was quoted as saying by Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet. ""I don't like being at the centre of the focus all the time, but this is a good thing,"" she told Aftonbladet. ""As soon as the media writes about me, they also have to write about the climate crisis. If this is a way to write about the climate crisis, then I guess it is good."" Separately Friday, an alliance of American states, cities, academic institutions and companies opened its own venue at the U.N. climate talks, aiming to show that despite the federal administration's decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris accord, many Americans remain committed to the treaty's goal of curbing global warming. Elan Strait, who manages the ""We Are Still In"" initiative for the environmental conservationist World Wildlife Fund, said the movement is ""a short-term band-aid not only to get those carbon dioxide emissions down but also to encourage policymakers to lay the ground for further achievements."" ""And that, regardless of the colour of the government that is in power,"" Strait said. Over 3,800 organizations and corporations representing 70% of U.S. economic output have joined the coalition, organizers claim, amounting to roughly half of the country's emissions. ___ Jordans reported from Berlin.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada155","Grim find: Bodies of virus victims in Spanish nursing homes; Grim find: Bodies of virus victims in Spanish nursing homes","March 24, 2020 Tuesday 03:04 PM EST","Canadian Press","MADRID - Spanish army troops disinfecting nursing homes have found, to their horror, some residents living in squalor among the infectious bodies of people suspected of dying from the new coronavirus, authorities said Tuesday. Defence Minister Margarita Robles said the elderly residents were ""completely left to fend for themselves, or even dead, in their beds."" She said the discovery over the weekend included several nursing homes but did not name them or say how many bodies were found. A judicial probe into the horrific discovery was opened Tuesday as Spain announced a record one-day jump of nearly 6,600 new coronavirus infections, bringing the overall total to more than 39,600. The number of deaths also leaped by a record 514 to almost 2,700, second only to Italy and China. As bodies piled up, Madrid took over a public skating rink as a makeshift morgue after the city facility overflowed. To date, 1,535 people have died in the hard-hit Spanish capital, more than half of the national total. The capital region has over 12,350 infections. ""This is a tough week,"" Dr. Fernando Sim\'f3n, head of Spain's health emergency centre, told a daily news briefing. Relatives of elderly people and retirement homes' workers expressed growing concern about the situation at the centres. ""With everything that is happening with the coronavirus, this was a ticking bomb,"" said Esther Navarro, whose 97-year-old Alzheimer's-stricken mother lives at the Usera Seniors' Center in Madrid, where soldiers found some of the bodies. ""Now we are bracing ourselves for the worst possible outcome,"" she told the Associated Press in a telephone interview. A worker at the nursing home said at least two bodies had to remain in the home for a day before funeral workers, who are working around the clock, arrived to take them away. ""We are very saddened, because the residents are almost like our own relatives due to the time we spend with them,"" the worker, Jos\'e9 Manuel Mart\'edn, told Cadena SER radio. Pedro N\'fa\'f1ez said his father-in-law, Zoilo Pati\'f1o Lara, died at the nursing home from the virus on Saturday, although he was never diagnosed or taken to a hospital when symptoms appeared. The man, in his 80's and suffering from advanced Alzheimer's, was not removed until Sunday despite N\'fa\'f1ez's repeated calls to funeral home workers. Domusvi, the private company contracted by the Madrid regional government to run the Usera nursing home, confirmed that two residents died there over the weekend. A company spokeswoman, who declined to give her name, blamed the delay on funeral homes that failed to come quickly to take away the bodies. While most people suffer only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever or coughing. from COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, for older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause far more severe illness, including pneumonia. Nursing homes worldwide have been especially hard hit. In the United States, several facilities have seen unusually high death tolls, and federal officials found that staff members who worked while sick at multiple long-term care facilities contributed to the spread of COVID-19 among vulnerable elderly in the Seattle area. On Monday, federal regulators gave the Life Care Center in Kirkland three weeks to address the serious infractions that have been linked to the death of at least 37 residents. The nursing home failed to identify and manage sick residents and failed to notify health authorities in a way that placed residents in ""immediate jeopardy,"" regulators found. Besides Washington state, burgeoning outbreaks at nursing homes in Illinois, New Jersey and elsewhere in the U.S. have underscored long-running problems in the industry. As in Spain as well as in Italy, France and elsewhere in Europe, among the biggest problems has been a critical staffing shortage. In Spain, the government announced last week that it would take over control of senior-care facilities from private companies and, as part of an unprecedented aid package, set aside 300 million euros ($323 million) for adding additional social workers and caretakers. Although Spanish households have traditionally included three generations living under one roof, nursing homes have mushroomed across the country over the past two decades, with multinationals and investment funds entering the lucrative business. According to Spain's official scientific research body, CSIC, there were 373,000 people in more than 5,400 nursing homes across the country in 2019. Miguel V\'e1zquez, the president of Pladigmare, an association that fights for better conditions in Spain's nursing homes, said the virus pandemic has forced a spotlight on the lack of personnel and resources that the wave of profit-seeking private investors has brought to the business of running the facilities. ""Spain has turned a right to being properly cared for, as enshrined in our laws, into a business that benefits from saving costs,"" V\'e1zquez said, adding that private facilities have been even more opaque than usual since authorities trying to halt the spread of the coronavirus closed the residences to visitors earlier this month. ""Now that relatives can't get in, we don't really know what's going on there,"" he said, adding that the situation was even more dire in the Spanish capital, where 92% of some 400 nursing homes are privately owned or managed. The head of AETE, which represents the country's largest for-profit nursing home businesses, said that criticism for ""localized problems"" should not be extended to the whole industry, which he said has been urging authorities to provide additional protective gear for weeks. Jose Cubero also said that overburdened hospitals in Madrid were rejecting patients with COVID-19 from nursing homes. ""We provide assistance but we are not health care facilities. The elderly also have the right to be treated in hospitals,"" Cubero said. Sim\'f3n, the doctor appointed by the Spanish government to co-ordinate its response to the outbreak, said that over 5,400 health workers have been infected by the coronavirus. ""Everyone has been making a titanic effort, especially our health workers,"" government spokeswoman Mar\'eda Jes\'fas Montero told a televised daily news conference, where journalists submitted questions via messaging apps. At the Palacio de Hielo ice skating rink-turned-makeshift-morgue on the outskirts of Madrid, security forces guarded the premises as funeral vans entered the building via an underground car park. Madrid authorities took up the rink's offer after the city's municipal funeral service said it could take no more coronavirus victims until it restocked with more protective equipment. The city government said bodies would be held at the rink until they can be taken to be cremated or buried. Madrid has also turned two city hotels into hospitals to help with the overflow of virus patients and plans to convert five others. Madrid's hotel association has offered 40 hotels to help medical workers. Madrid also set up a field hospital in the Ifema trade fair complex, where the U.N. climate conference COP25 was held in December. ___ Follow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at HYPERLINK https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak HYPERLINK https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak \"
"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada156","Mental health stress of climate change is beginning to show","December 14, 2019 Saturday","Kingston Whig-Standard","Among the signs held by protesters at a climate strike in September was one that read, ""I'm going to die from climate change!"" It was held by a serious-looking teenager listening to the speakers on the stage talk about the grim future that awaits them as the effects of climate change unfold. Nearby other protestors held signs reading, ""There is no planet B"" and ""Climate inaction is a crime."" The speakers at that climate strike were followed by a New Orleans-style jazz funeral procession complete with a model of the planet Earth in an open casket. The protest had a tone of impending doom, something that is matched by news about climate change, the vast majority of which is bad, and that steady stream of bad news is having an effect on people. ""Those kinds of things are emerging now, people see the effects that it is having,"" said Aidan Tomkinson, 16, who organized the Fridays for Future rallies in Kingston this year, including the climate strike in September. ""People are having a really hard time because they are hearing all these terrible things happening in the world and they don't know how to fix them. It's a feeling of hopelessness."" Canadian Mental Health Association described climate anxiety or eco-anxiety as ""a deep fear of environmental doom and human catastrophe,"" and while not everyone is susceptible, it's a growing issue, something the agency said needs more attention from health professionals and governments. ""The climate emergency is not just a question of wildfires, or rising temperatures and rising oceans,"" Fardous Hosseiny, CM-HA's interim national chief executive officer, said in a statement in October. ""What will we do about rising despair and of the mental health impacts of climate trauma?"" In 2018, the Canadian Associations of Physicians for the Environment pointed out a gap in the research about the links between climate change and mental health. Two years before that, a study in the United States by researchers from the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that specific demographic and socioeconomic groups were at greater risk of mental health ""Many people will experience adverse mental health outcomes and social impacts from the threat of climate change, the perceived direct experience of climate change, and changes to one's local environment,"" the report stated. ""Media and popular culture representations of climate change influence stress responses and mental health and well-being."" Even in Kingston, somewhat removed from the most dire effects of climate change, the issue is having an impact on peoples'mental health, and the despair, grief, fear and anger is often felt most acutely by young people. ""He now has to factor in how the world is going to change in his life and what that means for him, and somehow he is supposed to be doing something about it."" There are big differences between how young people and adults process their emotions, Knight said. Young people are particularly vulnerable to the negative mental health effects of climate change because they have not yet learned the habits that allow them to put aside the stream of bad news and go about their daily routines, Knight said, and youth have fewer filters between their emotions and what they express in public. ""There is a big disconnect between how present the young people are to the feelings that they actually have, and the lack of awareness with most adults with what they are feeling,"" Knight said. ""Grown-ups are very, very good at not feeling things that they really need to feel,"" she said. ""We are really good at disconnecting from the things that we need to feel."" That disconnect can translate into loneliness and isolation as people are unable to reconcile their own fears about climate change and the lack of action they are seeing by people and governments around them. Even Tomlinson had to step back a little from her activism for the sake of her emotional health. ""I had to take a month off because we were all feeling burned out,"" she said. ""After the Sept. 20 strike, we were all saying, 'Wow, that was a lot of work.'""You won't work well if you are burned out. You have to stay healthy to actually be able to act."" And putting anxiety into action is key not only to getting the message out but also keeping morale up. ""People don't want to have a future because there is not going to be a future. That is their mindset,"" Tomkinson added. ""If you are just going to die, why are you going to do all this, right? ""That is why we are urging people to act, and come to the strikes, and come get involved in local organizations because that relieves that feeling of hopelessness because you are doing something. ""A lot of people I talk to come to the strikes to see that there are other people that are doing something. I'm hoping that if they see a bunch of their peers striking and being upset and frustrated and angry that they will feel that as well and continue to act."" Action is the best antidote for anxiety, said climate activist William Sanderson, 20, of Perth Road, who recently returned from a week-long trip to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP25 ) in Madrid. ""Especially for young people, it definitely is stressful and an anxiety-inducing reality, the climate situation, but at the same time giving up and not trying to do something won't really help the problem,"" said Sanderson, a thirdyear Western University student. ""Trying to do something is better than not doing anything at all."" Despite the immensity of the task, Sanderson's experience at the climate conference left him confident that climate change can be overcome. ""It's tough when you hear all these bad reports and not necessarily positive news to keep hopeful,"" he said. ""At the end of the day humans have always solved really challenging problems in the past and this is another set of very, very challenging problems that we will be able to fix."" !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2019 Osprey Media Group Inc.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada158","The deepest 2020 challenge to our health; Island Voices","January 12, 2020 Sunday","Times Colonist (Victoria, British Columbia)","Regular readers of this column will know that my main concern is with the deeper factors that underlie our state of health and that my main focus is on three inter-related sets of issues: Human-created ecological changes that undermine our health, social injustice that leads to large inequalities in health, and an economic system that is not fit for purpose in the 21st century. But what underpins them - and what is therefore the most profound challenge to the health of the population both locally and globally - is a morally bankrupt corporate, commercial and political system of governance. The focus of the system is on the pursuit of growth and profit and the accumulation of obscene amounts of wealth, regardless of the health, social and ecological consequences for others. The marketing of tobacco remains the poster child for this - a product that, when used as intended, is guaranteed to kill and sicken millions of people, and exert its malign influence for decades. Yet the industry continues to sell its products around the world, immorally using marketing practices elsewhere that are not allowed in high-income countries. It exemplifies how corporations are prepared to distort and obfuscate the evidence and hide what they know, and how political leaders are willing to turn a blind eye to the evidence as long as possible and generally have to be dragged kicking and screaming into taking effective action. All these factors - immoral marketing, distortion of the science and political ignorance of the evidence - have been adopted by the fossil-fuel industry and were on display at the recent failed UN COP-25 climate-change summit in Madrid. The only crumb of comfort was that for the first time - yes, you read that correctly, for the first time - the conference statement actually referred to fossil fuels. Astonishingly, noted Catherine Abreu, executive director of Climate Action Network Canada and Jamie Henn, strategic communications director of 350.org: ""The 2015 Paris Climate Agreement ran 16 pages, but didn't mention the words 'fossil fuels,'coal,'oil,'or 'gas' once."" When it comes to political ignorance, the obstructionist practices of the United States, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Russia, India, China and others were clear. But no better example is on display than Scott Morrison, the prime minister of Australia, who continues to plan for and celebrate increased fossil-fuel exports even as his country burns and its Barrier Reef decays. Of course, this has nothing to do with the fact that ""the corporate and fossil-fuel industry's powerful trade associations"" in the U.S. spent more than $1 billion between 2008 and 2017 ""to convince the American public that its products are beneficial and necessary,"" according to a report from the Climate Investigations Centre. In Europe, the Guardian reported recently: ""The five biggest oil and gas companies, and their industry groups, have spent at least \£3251m [$472 million Cdn] lobbying the European Union over climate policies since 2010."" Meanwhile, here in Canada, the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives reported in November 2019 that in the seven years between January 2011 and January 2018, ""the fossil fuel industry in Canada recorded 11,452 lobbying contacts with government officials."" This was far more than the forestry, automotive and renewable energy industries and five times more than environmental NGOs. Moreover, under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the lobbying has shifted from a focus on politicians to senior government bureaucrats so that ""key government institutions and actors become integrated with private firms and interest groups that together co-produce regulation and policy."" The danger of this shift in focus is that ""the influence of industry actors - like those in the fossil fuel sector - are likely to far outlast election cycles."" If the health of Canadians and the rest of the world's population is to be protected and indeed improved in the 21st century, we have to replace this morally bankrupt system with one founded on ethical principles of social justice, ecological sustainability and human well-being.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada159","Inuit Communities Should Contribute To Climate Talks; Northern residents hold vital data, says Maia Hoeberechts","December 13, 2019 Friday","The Vancouver Sun (British Columbia)","Could you survive a night in the vast frozen Arctic using just a candle and snow? George Angohiatok, a skilled Inuit guide and hunter in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, uses signs in the sky and ice to lead him to the right kind of snow, which he builds into a shelter solid enough to heat with the candle. His explanation brought home to me that no amount of book learning or field experience can offer a southern researcher the knowledge held by a descendant of thousands of years of northern living. Canada's climate is changing, and scientists overwhelmingly agree that human activities contribute significantly. As the United Nations COP 25 Climate Change Conference in Madrid wraps up this week, and leading up to the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-30), we must listen closely to knowledge from northern communities. The northern region is experiencing more dramatic effects than the south. Sea ice is disappearing, permafrost is thawing, coasts are eroding, and temperatures are rising. In the recent Canada's Changing Climate Report, we learned that between 1948 and 2016, the best estimate of average annual temperature increase is 1.7 C for Canada as a whole and 2.3 C for northern regions. This is already over Paris Agreement targets for limiting global temperature change to 2 C. I've worked with a northern and southern research team to understand the impacts that changes to sea ice are having in three Nunavut communities: Kugluktuk, Cambridge Bay, and Gjoa Haven. We conducted workshops, interviews, public meetings, and site visits to understand how community activities and livelihoods have been affected. Having closely observed their environment for thousands of years, the Inuit are experts in understanding northern weather and climate. The communities'perceptions align with what scientists are measuring, but their information is more detailed and includes rich links to culture and everyday life. They've noticed that sea ice freeze-up occurs later in the year and breakup happens earlier. This compromises on-ice transportation and hunting. We learned that ice is becoming thinner and less predictable, causing safety issues and affecting travel routes. Elders told us skies are greyer than in the past, which they lamented as less beautiful and can bring more precipitation. Southern species are moving north: There are small trees growing near Kugluktuk where there never were before and salmon have been caught in Cambridge Bay, which was met with curiosity and cautious excitement. Everyone agreed it is getting warmer. Last week, I was in Halifax attending the annual ArcticNet Scientific Meeting, the largest gathering in Canada focused on northern research. This summit brings together northern and southern experts from universities, government, industry and communities. The voices I sought are those who can tell me the most about our climate: the northern community members, experts on the forefront of dramatic change. Why should we, who live in southern Canada, pay attention to these voices from the North? First and foremost, as Sheila Watt-Cloutier so elegantly argues, the Inuit right to be cold - that is, to maintain a culture and way of life intertwined with the ice and snow - is a fundamental right. This drives a moral imperative for all of us to care about these changes and the people they are directly impacting. Second, changes in the Arctic not only affect the North, they affect the entire planet. Third, and most importantly, we should listen because northern communities are leading our understanding of climate change impacts. In their ongoing ability to live, adapt and thrive in the northern regions of this country, the Inuit exemplify resilience and wisdom. We will all need to gain such expertise if we are to respond to the challenges that our changing climate will present.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada164","Climate change: Time for health care sector to do its part, says new report by the Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change","November 13, 2019 Wednesday 6:31 PM Eastern Time","Canada NewsWire","Report also highlights the increasing impact of wildfires on Canadians OTTAWA, Nov. 13, 2019 /CNW/ -\~Canada's health care sector is among the worst in the world in terms of greenhouse gas pollution, says the Canada-focused policy brief, issued alongside the latest Lancet Countdown international report, and the sector requires concerted efforts to chart a new course to be consistent with its mandate to 'do no harm.' The Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change is a comprehensive yearly analysis produced by 120 experts from 35 institutions and tracks progress on key indicators of the impact of climate change on human health and the world's efforts to minimize it. The associated policy briefs provide country-specific recommendations by leading domestic experts to highlight areas in which leaders and policy-makers should focus to develop a healthy response to climate change. In Canada, the Lancet Countdown Policy Brief: Canada in 2019 was produced by a team of experts and researchers led by Dr. Courtney Howard, a wildfire researcher, recognized expert on the impact of climate change on health and Yellowknife emergency physician; the team also included Dr. Margot Parkes, Dr. Caren Rose, Dr. Andrea MacNeill and Dr. Chris Buse. Published today, the report highlights four key areas where Canada can make the biggest difference to reduce the ever-growing impact of climate change on health: Issue #1:\~Canada has the third highest per capita greenhouse gas emissions from health care in the world. Recommendation: Develop a national evidence-based sustainable initiative designed to support the greening of the health sector, including waste reduction and greenhouse gas reductions, charting a course for net-zero emissions from health care by 2050, consistent with the health sector's fair share of responsibilities under the Paris Agreement. Issue #2:\~Of the 440,000 Canadians displaced due to wildfires since the 1980s, more than half were in the last decade. Recommendation:\~Incorporate lessons learned from recent severe wildfires to strengthen a pan-Canadian emergency response approach. Issue #3: Canada's transport sector continues to be dominated by fossil fuels, and over 1,000 Canadians are estimated to have died in 2015 as a result of traffic-related fine-particulate air pollution. Electric and biofuels alternative vehicles are gaining ground too slowly, leaving benefits to Canadians' health, health care expenditures and greenhouse gas reductions largely untapped. Recommendation: Develop provincial and territorial legislation requiring automakers to gradually increase the annual percentage of new light-duty vehicles sold that are zero emissions, working toward a target of 100% by 2040. Issue #4: The health of Canadians particularly Indigenous populations, people in low-resource settings, and future generations is increasingly at risk due to the growing number of climate change-related severe weather events, wildfires, changes to infectious disease patterns, and more. Recommendation: Make health a key consideration in climate-related policy-making across sectors, including ensuring that Canada's updated Nationally Determined Contribution commitments, due to be submitted in 2020, represent Canada's fair share of emissions reductions under the Paris Agreement. Overall, the 2019 Lancet Countdown reports on the extensive health damage from climate change, and sets out the lifelong health consequences of rising temperatures for a child born today:\~ As temperatures rise, infants will bear the greatest burden of malnutrition and rising food prices the average global yield potential of maize (-4%), winter wheat (-6%), soybean (-3%) and rice (-4%) has declined over the past 30 years.Children will suffer most from the rise in infectious diseases 2018 was the second most climatically suitable year on record for the spread of bacteria that cause much of diarrhoeal disease and wound infection globally.Throughout adolescence, the impact of air pollution will worsen with premature deaths from outdoor air pollution (PM>2.5>) stagnating at 2.9 million worldwide in 2016 (over 440,000 from coal alone); the total global energy supply from coal rose 1.7% from 2016 to 2018, reversing a downward trend. Extreme weather events will intensify into adulthood, with 152 out of 196 countries experiencing an increase in people exposed to wildfires since 2001 2004, and a record 220 million more over 65 exposed to heatwaves in 2018 compared with 2000 63 million more than in 2017.A second path is possible: moving from the current high-emissions pathway to the low-emissions pathway, consistent with the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting warming to well below 2\'cb C, will allow a child born today to grow up in a world which reaches net-zero emissions by their 31st birthday and secure a healthier future for coming generations. Authors call for the human health impacts of climate change to be at forefront of the agenda at the UN Climate Conference ( COP25 ) next month. Quotes from Canadian authors: Canadian health workers have three key responsibilities: First, we must prepare for inevitable climate-related impacts on health and health systems from wildfires, floods and more. Secondly, it's time to own up to the health sector's climate impact and do our fair share to reduce emissions. Finally, we must harness the unifying power of a response to climate change that prioritizes health to help us work across silos towards a future that keeps us and our children safe and well. Dr Courtney Howard, wildfire researcher, Canadian spokesperson for the International Lancet Countdown report and Yellowknife emergency physician Canada has shown it can be a leader when it sets goals as it did when coal was phased out in Ontario. Health care accounts for approximately 4% of the country's total emissions. It's time to set a new goal and reduce this to zero emissions by 2050, consistent with our responsibility under the Paris Agreement. Dr. Andrea MacNeill, co-author and Vancouver cancer surgeon The impact of emissions is borne by some more that others. Today's children, Indigenous communities, people in low-resource settings, and future generations are disproportionately impacted. Canada must increase its commitment to decreasing its own emissions for current and future Canadians, and must also support other countries, especially middle-and-lower-income countries, to protect health globally by increasing mitigation efforts and locally by preparing for the impacts of climate change. Dr Margot Parkes, MBChB, PhD, co-author and Canada Research Chair in Health, Ecosystems and Society, UNBC Air pollution from fossil-fuel-powered transport is associated with one quarter of new asthma cases in children in Toronto, as well as over a thousand deaths per year in Canada. We have made progress, most notably in British Columbia, but we need light-duty vehicles to be emissions-free by 2040 to truly have a positive impact. Dr. Chris Buse, co-author and researcher Canada is warming far too quickly. The rise in average temperature is putting the health of Canadians at risk. Maintaining the status quo is no longer a viable option. We all need to decrease greenhouse gas emissions by increasing clean energy, improving public transit, cycling and walking rates, and adhering to a plant-rich diet.\~These measures are likely to produce concomitant health benefits. It's a win-win for the health of our planet and for Canadians. Mr. Ian Culbert, Executive Director of the Canadian Public Health Association Canada's doctors see the devastating health impacts of a changing climate first-hand. From wildfires to heat waves to new infectious diseases, we're already treating the health effects of climate change. It's time we had a comprehensive plan so that Canada meets our international climate change targets.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada165","In Conversation with Brian Mulroney","December 19, 2019 Thursday","CTV NEWS CHANNEL Television, Inc. POWER PLAY WITH DON MARTIN 17:00:00 ET","DON MARTIN: Welcome back. When it comes to listing former prime ministers who have the most to say and the experience to back up the words, my next guest takes the prize, Brian Mulroney, Progressive Conservative prime minister from '84 to '93. He introduced the original free trade deal, attempted to bring Quebec into the constitution with the Meech Lake Accord, and ratified significant environmental issues. That's why he was top of my wish list of guests of the final shows of the year. This is when I talked to him earlier this week. All right, former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney joins me from Montreal. I do want to talk about NAFTA. You did the original. The new NAFTA is about to be ratified. I'm curious what your view is of the revamped free trade deal. Is it better than the original? BRIAN MULRONEY (Former Canadian Prime Minister): I think it is. I think Ms. Freeland and her team did a very good job in the renegotiation, and I think it's a better product (a) than we had originally, and (b) that was revised last year, and I think today's product is pretty good. Certainly very good for Canada. MARTIN: I do want to ask you, though, Canada on the world stage, you've cautioned that we shouldn't maybe be boasting that we're back on that stage, and I'm curious how we get on that stage, if we want to be on that stage, or if we're just sitting in the audience being part of the spectators. MULRONEY: Well I said you shouldn't say Canada is back until we do something that backs that up, and you can start by paying our bills. We're way down the list on NATO. We committed to two percent of our GDP, and the last time any government in Canada paid two percent of GDP was mine, 25 or 30 years ago, and it's gone straight downhill ever since. We're at I think 1.2 percent, which is shameful in terms of peacekeeping, which distinguished Canada. In my nine years in office, Don, there were 16 peacekeeping initiatives by the UN, and Canada participated in all 16 of them. Now this was a concept drawn up by Lester Pearson, and it distinguishes Canada internationally, and we should have done it. And with regard to foreign aid, it's even worse. Mike Pearson presented a document 50 years ago saying that we should be paying 7/10th of one percent. We moved it up to 5/10th of one percent en route to 7/10th of one percent. It's now gone all the way back down to something in the neighbourhood of 1.5 or two percent. This is a disgrace. How are you going to assert your leadership skills when you enter a room and somebody says, hey, you haven't paid your bills. John Manley said I thought very exquisitely one day, he said in international meetings, when the bill comes around, Canada gets up and goes to the bathroom. MARTIN: Ha, Ha, I remember that. MULRONEY: That's not a good opener for a leadership bid. MARTIN: So Trump's got a point is what you're saying. MULRONEY: Yes, he has. On the NATO thing, he's completely right. And I've said that ever since he got in to office three years ago. MARTIN: How do we solve the problem with China? You get around the world quite a bit. I don't know, they're setting up a parliamentary committee, and they might actually be putting the prime minister on the witness stand there just to sort of air all our problems, but how do we get that relationship back on a firmer footing while we've got this extradition issue hanging over our heads? MULRONEY: Well, it's a tough one, there's no doubt about it, and there's no easy answer for it, and I like the idea of the parliamentary committee. The first witness they should call is David Mulroney. No relative. But he was one of the most outstanding ambassadors in our entire foreign affairs stable. And he's very practical, and he's got some great ideas as to how we can reconnect with China in a meaningful way. So he and a few other of the ambassadors would be a good place to start. MARTIN: Would you be comfortable with a prime minister going before that committee, or do you think that's not necessary? MULRONEY: Yeah, I think so. As you know, I recommended that Jean Chretien and Andy Desmarais be sent over as special envoys of the prime minister to deal with the Chinese government at a high level. Chretien knows all of these fellows, as I do, and as other prime ministers, do on a personal basis. And he gets their attention as opposed to a delegation of parliamentarians or something who will deal with people at the range of assistant deputy ministers. You don't want that. This has to be dealt with at a, on a high level. MARTIN: You remain to this day, Elizabeth May still calls you our greenest prime minister, and we just finished the Cop25 meetings, and I don't know if you think Canada is a laggard on that front still, or we should be more aggressive. What needs to be done from Canada's point of view to fight climate change? MULRONEY: Well you talk about being a laggard. The analysis of the G20 just came out on November 11th, and it showed that Canada was the second worst performer of the G20, just a little bit ahead of Australia who was the worst. And we're not meeting our commitments to Paris. We're not meeting our undertakings at all. And so, yeah, there's a big job to be done there, and it all requires one thing - leadership! Somebody has to say I am the prime minister, or I am the minister, and this is what we're going to do. And if there's objection to it, you say all right, I'll take it to the people at the appropriate time. But we need leadership on all of these issues. MARTIN: And you know that brings a point back, circling back to the whole question of the Conservatives. Could they and should they be far more aggressive on the environment file, and maybe that gives them an advantage going into the next election, because it's becoming a bigger issue all the time. MULRONEY: Don, you may remember that in September I made a statement saying that anyone who does not have an adequate, thoughtful, dynamic program to deal with climate change will not win an election in Canada. The reason being that the great middle class in our country, what they want to pass on to their children and grandchildren is a pristine environment. They don't want these niggling little tax cuts, so much for a pair of skates, and so much for that. The great middle class in Canada principally wants a pristine environment, and they are going to vote for a party or a leader who articulates that kind of vision, that satisfies their hopes and dreams for Canada and for their kids. MARTIN: But that's not reflected in the Conservative party we're seeing in parliament right now. MULRONEY: Well you saw what happened in the election. And if they want a repeat of that, be my guest, because you're just not going to win an election unless you have got a thoughtful grand vision for the future of Canada as it applies to the environment. MARTIN: Okay, that's a great place to leave it. I guess, I never thought I would be retiring before you, so I guess you don't have any advice for me, do you? MULRONEY: Ha, ha, ha. Well, yes, I do. Come on in, Don. The water is fine. You're going to love it. (LAUGHTER) MARTIN: You're the busiest retired guy I know, so there you go. All right, Brian Mulroney, it's always been a pleasure having you on the show. I've really enjoyed our conversations, and some of the best conversation I've had with you have been after the camera is off, but those are fun too. MULRONEY: Well, Don, if I could just say this, you have had a great run at this. You've brought your personality, and your background, and your thoughtfulness to these debates and dialogues over your program. You've done a great job and I wish you well. MARTIN: All right. Thank you, Sir. Appreciate you coming on. MULRONEY: Thank you. MARTIN: All right. Back by popular demand, our trio of exemplary MPs reunite for the first time in years to talk about life after politics. Please stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \"
"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada166","Morneau Delivers Fiscal Update","December 16, 2019 Monday","CTV NEWS CHANNEL Television, Inc. POWER PLAY WITH DON MARTIN 17:00:00 ET","DON MARTIN: Welcome to ""Power Play"" on a day when Canada found out it's a bit better and a little poorer than we thought. Coming up, there's a new snapshot of the federal government books out today, and the red sea of deficit dollars is getting deeper. The finance minister is standing by to explain why spending above our means makes dollars and cents. Also ahead, no deal to save the planet came out the UN climate change talks over the weekend. The federal environment minister joins us to discuss the failure of Cop25 and what that means for Canada. And our strategists and journalists start our year in review with the best moves and the biggest news of 2019. But first the deficit is rising, job creation falling, and the world economy flat-lining. All this was reflected in the government's first post election report card on the country's economic performance and outlook. With the deficit set to peak next year at just over $28 billion, the Conservative opposition was apoplectic. PIERRE POILIEVRE (Conservative Finance Critic): Today we learn of two major broken promises. One the deficit is $7 billion bigger than Liberals promised right before the election. Two, the debt-to-GDP ratio is growing this year, another broken promise. MARTIN: And Finance Minister Bill Morneau joins me in the studio. Nice to have you, Minister. Appreciate this. BILL MORNEAU (Finance Minister): Good to be with you. MARTIN: All right, on the recession question, you're like a boy scout. You keep saying be prepared, be prepared, but you know the last couple of months we've had job losses going down while the United States continues to go up. Do you see red flags in those numbers? MORNEAU: Well actually when you saw us in our economic update today, we are predicting both this year will be strong and we think next year will also be strong and growing. I think, I mean the way to answer that is to take a look at how we actually build these economic forecasts. We take 14 private sector economists, includes private sector economists from all of the six banks, from Desjardins, from the Caisse de Depot, from Canadian Federation of Independent Business, and get their projection on the future. And not one of them is predicting a recession. So in fact the only people out there who are predicting a recession are what I would call not professional economists, and that's the Conservatives, and it seems to me that they're increasing anxiety among Canadians. I mean at a certain stage it's not a responsible way to move forward. We want to actually help Canadians to understand that things are going well, that employment is strong, that wage growth is strong, and that's not only good in and of itself but it helps confidence. MARTIN: You're a man with a lot of business experience, and I guess I want to get to the deficit, because I think some people think those numbers are real eye watering. And a year ago you were looking at a $16 billion deficit, and a $3 billion cushion. A year later we're at $25 billion with a $1.5 billion cushion. I mean these numbers seem to be flights of fiscal fantasy after a while. How do we believe these numbers? MORNEAU: Well I think you need to actually look into what those numbers are. So the changes really are two things. I mean one is we've moved forward on the tax reduction. So that's a tax reduction that will help 20 million Canadians. It will put in the first year $3 billion more into people's pockets, but also more into the economy. And in the final year, in 2023, it will put $6 billion more into the economy and into people's pockets. The second thing is our pension liabilities are going up. The way it works is if interest rates go down, pension liabilities go up. And what we've said is that we want to help people understand that so we gave a bit of an explanation about how that works. So I think as people look at it, they'll see that we've followed through on what we said we were going to do. We're going to reduce taxes. That's important. We're going to continue to invest in the economy. And we can do it while maintaining, and we need to remember, a very healthy balance sheet. We have the lowest level of debt of anyone in the G7 countries, lowest by a long shot, and it's continuing to reduce each year as a function of our economy. MARTIN: Why did you cut the safety cushion by half? $1.5 billion used to be $3 billion. MORNEAU: We do that every year. So what with do is we put in a $3 billion cushion, and then as the year goes by, we're now closer to the end of the year if we don't need that. So we're now in December. And of course this is just a projection through the end of the year, so we move it down to $1.5. It's consistent with what we did last year, the year before, and the year before that. MARTIN: Some people are pointing out that this doesn't include a lot of the promises that were made during the campaign. Is it somewhere in this fiscal soup that these numbers are all included, or is that yet to be added? MORNEAU: Well we do need to continue to make the kinds of investments that we promised Canadians. I think the way you do that is by keeping your economy strong and growing so that you have the capacity to do that. We also are going to need to not only work with provinces, I think you know I'm meeting with all the finance ministers tonight and tomorrow, but also work with other parliamentarians. I mean our goal is to be cooperative, work cooperatively to get to following through on those promises and we intend on doing it. MARTIN: Well tonight you're getting a big ask from Alberta and Saskatchewan I guess to a lesser extent. I think that's a billion and a half or something on the stabilization fund. Is that included in this, or it would be kind of crazy I guess if you admitted it, but is it in here somewhere? Could you afford to give that if they... MORNEAU: I think their ask is even bigger than that, so, but that said, no, tonight and tomorrow, it's very much about listening. We've said, look, the fiscal stabilization approach, which they're asking about, we haven't reviewed it since 1995. We've said we're open minded to looking at it, but that said, we haven't really had those discussions directly. So I've had a direct conversation with the Alberta finance minister, but not with the others, so we'll have people at the table tonight and tomorrow. We'll hear where they place that in terms of priorities versus other things, because that's not the only ask that we're going to get, and that will help inform not only how we work with them, but what we do going forward on our own investments. MARTIN: Do you have the fiscal flexibility in the years to come to pay for a full national pharmacare plan? Is that in these books somewhere? MORNEAU: Well you'll remember that we did in the campaign put $6 billion in there, and the idea was to do a few things. Canadians are really worried about having access to a primary care doctor. They're very worried about things like home care and mental health care. MARTIN: Fix that first? MORNEAU: Well, I'm not saying that we're necessarily placing those in order, because we also think having universal access to pharmaceuticals is important. We do though, in the case of all these, we need to actually be at the table with the provinces, because the provinces are the deliverers of health care, and I expect I'm going to hear about that over the course of the next day and that will inform our approach. MARTIN: Oh, yeah, your ears are going to be burning tonight. All right, Bill Morneau, always a pleasure having you on. Thanks for coming on. MORNEAU: Thanks for having me. MARTIN: All right. Coming up, strategic brilliance amidst some fireworks as our best brains go out with a bang. Please stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \"
"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada167","Brexit Brings Opportunity For Canadian LNG As U.K. Investors Pivot; Unity Is Key For Canada","December 13, 2019 Friday","Daily Oil Bulletin","Investors and companies in the U.K. are concerned with uncertainty caused by Brexit, says Shawn Tupper, and they are looking at business redirection as Britain leaves the European Union &mdash; an opportunity for Canadian LNG. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t know the outcome, nobody does, and it really is kind of up in the air, but they know they&rsquo;re going to have to pivot and they know their relationship with the continent is going to have to change, and they need to find new partners,&rdquo; Natural Resource Canada&rsquo;s associate deputy minister told this week&rsquo;s Calgary HYPERLINK https://www.dailyoilbulletin.com/article/2019/12/12/climate-commitments-indigenous-matters-key-for-asi/ event highlighting the recent Tokyo and London gatherings held on behalf of Alberta&rsquo;s governmentto discuss the scope of Canadian LNG growth. &ldquo;We need to ensure that as they turn around, they turn all the way around and don&rsquo;t focus too far to the south. We need to make sure we&rsquo;re there and that we have smooth pathways to allow the U.K economy to be as smooth in its shift away from Brexit as it can. We need to be ready and we need to be good partners.&rdquo; According to Tupper, who attended these events, the British show much interest in eastern Canadian LNG, as well as elsewhere in Canada, and the ability of industry and government to talk as a cohesive team to promote this country&rsquo;s investment opportunities is imperative to success with the U.K. &ldquo;For me, one of the fundamental things we need to make sure we&rsquo;re paying attention to is where are the &lsquo;rocks on the road&rsquo; post-Brexit, and how do we get those &lsquo;rocks&rsquo; off the &lsquo;road&rsquo; to make sure British investment is coming here.&rdquo; A &ldquo;Team Canada&rdquo; approach is key not only when appealing to European investors for Canadian LNG, he said, but to Asian ones as well, as was evidenced during the event in Japan, where representatives from B.C., as well as the feds and, of course, Alberta strongly showed support for the industry. &ldquo;We had a very clear shoulder-to-shoulder, arm-to-arm approach to every single meeting we went through all week long, and that was very much noticed by our friends in Japan, and I think it had a very strong impact.&rdquo; He added: &ldquo;Having us all on the same panels and being able to talk about our collective endeavour and present a common front in terms of getting Canadian product to the world is an effective model. We should continue to do it.&rdquo; Likewise, when it comes to Canadian LNG exports, Alberta Associate Natural Gas Minister Dale Nally suggested his province is on the &ldquo;same page&rdquo; as other provincial and federal partners, and he &ldquo;can&rsquo;t stress enough the importance of demonstrating a united front&rdquo; when it comes to promoting Canada&rsquo;s energy industry. &ldquo;Our government has been working closely with the B.C. government to advance projects such as the second phase of the LNG Canada project, as well as the Coastal GasLink pipeline. We&rsquo;re also examining our options when it comes to other LNG development opportunities in B.C. and on Canada&rsquo;s East Coast. &ldquo;My department has been in discussions with Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Qu&eacute;bec on ideas to advance such projects as Pieridae and &Eacute;nergie Saguenay, including supporting pipeline construction and competitive coolant costs to move our gas more effectively to those markets.&rdquo; He added: &ldquo;We are committed to ensuring that energy projects continue moving forward, as the economic future of our province and our country depends on it.&rdquo; Unfortunately, noted Gregory John, there is political rhetoric currently from Western Canada that is a reaction to legitimate frustrations, but is also disuniting and ultimately does not serve the energy sector. &ldquo;We have heard some things about Brexit, but there&rsquo;s another exit here that is really hurting the work being done in this room. This phenomenon called &lsquo;Wexit&rsquo; is truly hurting foreign direct investment opportunities, and I think we need to take a look at some of the other alternatives that keeps us as part of a national picture.&rdquo; He added: &ldquo;[Wexit] is borne out of frustration. Over the 12 years I&rsquo;ve been involved in energy, it has been my generation that has never really been able to put a project into service.&rdquo; The degree to which young people &mdash; commonly referred to as &lsquo;Millennials&rsquo; and &lsquo;Gen Z&rsquo; &mdash; view the oil and gas sector as offering career prospects is &ldquo;pretty stark,&rdquo; according to a 2017 EY survey cited by Zsolt Vigh. &ldquo;Sixty-two per cent of Gen Zers stated that a career in oil and gas is either unappealing or very unappealing,&rdquo; the project engineer and Canadian energy advocate told the Canadian LNG event. &ldquo;Even with respect to the older [youth] generation, the 20- to- 35-year-old Millennial-aged individuals, that number was still quite high. &ldquo;Driving force behind this trend is ultimately the younger generation&rsquo;s concern around climate change. In a recent Gallup poll in the U.S. (and I imagine the results are quite similar to the Canadian context), 70 per cent of respondents aged 18 to 34 were either worried or very worried about climate change and its long-term impacts.&rdquo; If the oil and gas industry is to alter its perception with the younger generations, he said, then it must clearly articulate how its core business ties in with helping advance society&rsquo;s needs and problems, especially with how it relates to climate change and pollution. Vigh suggested this ultimately translates into the importance of LNG. He added: &ldquo;LNG exports and their emissions offset potential with respect to coal are very large. They rank up there with respect to the carbon pricing and clean fuel standards that were rolled out by the Canadian government. However, it&rsquo;s important we not only address the domestic policies and meet those. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s imperative we also look beyond our borders to see how we can really help the national community lower emissions, really framing the industry around this in terms of our ability to achieve long-term emission cuts on an international scale, and making that a core part of the business driver of these projects will be essential to really attracting towards youth.&rdquo; Fortunately, noted Nally, Canadian LNG projects are currently being designed to be the lowest-emitting facilities in the world, and on that front Alberta&rsquo;s energy sector is well ahead of the curve internationally. COP25 Deidra Garyk, Canadian energy advocate, said advocating on behalf of the energy sector is important for those who support it, and she offered various suggestions in this regard to the Calgary crowd on Wednesday. She added: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t predict the future, and so I don&rsquo;t know for certain what the workforce of 2035 is going to look like. But I do know now we need to get the conversation about LNG right.&rdquo; While LNG Canada should come online sometime in the 2024-25 timeframe, Greg Kist believes Canada needs at least another large export facility to &ldquo;start to move the needle&rdquo; in terms of natural gas prices for WCSB producers, and projects such as Woodfibre LNG or Cedar LNG might not be enough. &ldquo;There might not be a whole lot of new gas or new export necessary to move that needle, but I would suggest we at least need to get another large-scale project moving off the West Coast to start to have that impact on the basin in large part,&rdquo; said the Rockies LNG Partners president and chief executive officer. &ldquo;But having said that, you see clearly a very large reserve base. The producers will produce into that.&rdquo; \"

Thunberg travelled to Turin in an electric car after attending the COP25 climate conference in Madrid, where she had given a speech accusing world governments of ""creative PR"" over their climate change stances. The 16-year-old, who this week became the youngest person to be named Time magazine's Person of the Year, warned that the decade that is about to start will be the one that ""will define our future,"" and will have a key impact over the rest of our lives.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada169","The left loves a climate crisis; Terence Corcoran","December 4, 2019 Wednesday","National Post (f/k/a The Financial Post) (Canada)","We had major breaking news Tuesday out of the United Nations'25th Conference of the Parties ( COP 25 ) climate change summit in Madrid: Greta, the self-described ""angry kid,"" had landed. Her boat docked in Lisbon, just as the World Meteorological Organization reported that 2019 had been a cold year for Canadians. The Greta news drowned out the WMO report, which also found 2019 produced record levels of frigidity in many parts of North America, including ""the coldest February on record for several regions in Western Canada, including the city of Vancouver. It was also a rather cold first half of the year in parts of Eastern Canada. There were further outbreaks of unseasonable cold and early-season snowfall in the western and central interior of North America in late September and late October."" But forget about Canada. Who cares? The WMO reports that 2019 was hotter on average in other parts of the world, which is why Greta Thunberg and an army of young and not-so-young leftists with radical agendas are mounting a global campaign to bulldoze market capitalism and build a new socialist democratic paradise. Since nobody wants to overthrow capitalism for the usual trumped-up reasons - inequality, worker oppression, racism, fascism, rising corporate control, globalization, middle-class decline, greedy bankers, private property - the scientific claim of a climate crisis offers a new justification. From Greta's Extinction Rebellion to Green New Deal advocates in the United States to the champions of socialism in Europe, the left is using climate change to push an another agenda. In a recent commentary, Greta and two other young global activists - Luisa Neubauer from Germany and Angela Valenzuela from Chile - made it clear their objectives transcend climate change. They want climate action that is ""powerful and wide-ranging."" After all, they say, ""the climate crisis is not just about the environment. It is a crisis of human rights, of justice, and of political will. Colonial, racist, and patriarchal systems of oppression have created and fuelled it. We need to dismantle them all."" In their reading of the economic world, carbon emissions are the product of market capitalism that needs to be replaced by a government-controlled system that will forcibly eliminate fossil fuels. In the United States, Green New Deal advocates talk about a green economy, but what they have in mind is a state-directed economic system whose primary official objective is to achieve ""net-zero carbon emissions."" The same objectives dominate the Green New Deal advocates in Europe. One of those net-zero eurogreens is Yanis Varoufakis, the former Greek finance minister who is in Toronto this week to participate in a Munk Debate on the future of capitalism. In case you are wondering, his aim is to tear down market systems. Varoufakis is a superstar of the democratic socialist left and a collaborator with Canadian radical Naomi Klein and others in the Democracy in Europe Movement 2025 (DiEM25). The objectives of DiEM25 include blending Europe's ""diverse political traditions - Green, radical left, liberal - in order to repair the EU."" By repairing Europe they mean expanding the role of government via vague notions of ""democratic government."" According to Varoufakis, a key part of the new socialist plan for Europe ""will require recreating European institutions and a political economy that includes a massive Green New Deal or similar strategy."" Varoufakis said in a recent interview that he aims to ""create a vision of a liberal, socialist society that is not based on private property but does use money as a vehicle for exchange and markets as co-ordinating devices."" Well, at least we get to keep a system based on money. How far the left will be able to ride climate change as a sort of autonomous electric vehicle on the road to socialism will depend on how soon a broader population of workers and middle-class voters realize they are being taken for a ride. Accepting that climate change is a real global problem to be solved does not mean abandoning the benefits of market capitalism. Arthur C. Brooks (who will debate Varoufakis in the Munk Debate on Wednesday) argues that Green New Deal socialism will never happen, at least not in the United States. ""There's no evidence that any government is remotely capable of governing on the scale that they're talking about. The result would be unimaginable levels of unnecessary secondary consequences."" Brooks may be right about the U.S. and maybe Canada. Among the people who do not want a Green New Deal is Canadian union leader Leo Gerard, the longtime head of the United Steelworkers of America. In a recent interview with CBC radio, Gerard brought a little common sense to the climate crisis. ""The reality is that you're going to need fossil fuels for at least the next hundred years. What we need to do is, do it in a way that's going to reduce emissions, capture carbon and be healthy to the environment."" Gerard said that proposals to ban the mining industry, as occurred during the past U.S. election, demonstrate a lack of economic knowledge and understanding. ""You can't build a wind turbine without one to two tons of copper and cement to hold it down. You can't do solar panels without aluminum and glass, which is made with sand. You have to mine sand."" The vast majority of people - in North America and the world - are unlikely to embrace the idea of eliminating fossil fuels from the economy, especially if they realize going fossil-fuel free means embracing radical leftists' visions. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada170","Environment Minister to Attend Climate Summit","December 2, 2019 Monday","CTV NEWS CHANNEL Television, Inc. POWER PLAY WITH DON MARTIN 17:00:00 ET","DON MARTIN: Well the world is gathering once again to plot and redouble efforts to combat climate change. Canada remains committed to reducing emissions to 30 percent below 2005 within eleven years. The new environment minister will be attending the United Nations conference of parties in Madrid later in the week. John Wilkinson joins us from Toronto. All right, Minister, the Paris accord seems to be a bit of a fading dream with the US out, and there's no easy path along the current trajectory to have Canada achieve its targets. Is this a too big to fail challenge about to fail? JONATHAN WILKINSON (Environment Minister): Well it's too big to fail challenge. I would tell you that there are many countries around the world that remain very much committed to climate action. I would tell you that in the United States there are many states that remain very much committed to climate action. Certainly Canada is one of those countries that is committed. We have made enormous progress over the course of the first four years of this government's time in office. This is the first government that has had a credible plan to fight climate change. We've identified over 200 megatonnes in reduction. We have a little ways to go. That's part of what I have been charged to do, is to focus on how we're going to get to and exceed the targets that we have established under the Paris agreement. It's a critical initiative for all Canadians and for all citizens of this world, and most particularly for our kids and grandkids. MARTIN: Right, but I've seen an awful lot of charts that show we're an awful long way from meeting our commitments, our Paris accord commitments. Are you very confident we can meet that? And when do we start seeing that roadmap to zero emissions by 2050 you were promising in the campaign? WILKINSON: Well I've been about a week on the job, but certainly one of the first orders of business is to identify those additional measures that we will put into place to ensure that we meet and exceed our targets for 2030, and, yes, we do need to define pathways as to how we're going to achieve net zero by 2050, which is what scientists tell us we must do, and that is part of what we committed to in the campaign is to set up a group that's going to help us to figure that out. And I think there are probably different pathways. We need to map those out and determine which are the most important ones for Canada. MARTIN: All right. So what are you taking over the Cop 25 ? Is Canada going to pledge to do more faster, because it seems that a lot of the projections that we saw about warming are actually out of whack and actually accelerating faster than a lot of scientists thought. MARTIN: I'm curious what you thought about the nuclear power plan that three premiers put forward, these modular reactors. Is that a right step, a step in the right direction for you, and will the feds put their shoulder behind that plan? WILKINSON: Well the federal government and the provinces actually did a bunch of work on this in 2018 looking at small modular reactors, or SMRs. It's certainly an option. I would tell you that SMRs probably have a little ways to go before they are fully ready for prime time from a commercial perspective. But certainly in the context of a climate emergency, all non-emitting sources need to be on the table, and certainly we are interested in seeing the work that will be done through the collaboration that the provinces announced today. MARTIN: Of course then you get the problem of where do you put the nuclear waste. And I know it's not a Candu reactor level of waste, but that's still a problem that comes out of these, isn't it? WILKINSON: There's no question it is still a problem. I wouldn't describe nuclear power as clean, because you do have that issue. It is non-emitting though, and I would simply say to you that in the context of the environmental challenges that we face, I would say to you climate change is number one, we certainly will need to find and continue to work on additional solutions for waste management. But if you ask me what's the number one issue facing, environmental issue facing the world today, it is climate change, and therefore non-emitting base load sources of power to replace coal and other forms of hydrocarbon fuels is something that I don't think we can rule out. MARTIN: Yeah. Well certainly the UN secretary general was quite emphatic that this is the moment of do or die in many ways, the fight against climate change, and I'm curious what your view of his comments are and the appointment of former Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney who's going to become a UN envoy on climate change and finance. What's your reaction to both of those? WILKINSON: Well I think the UN essentially was, again, underlining the critical time that we are in. We do not have enormous amounts of time, and so we do all need to heighten the level of ambition and the level of urgency with which we're addressing this problem. I think Mark Carney's appointment is a very, very positive one. I mean Mr. Carney is somebody who could have done just about anything. The fact is that he has chosen to work on the climate file, you know, underlines the importance that somebody like he attaches to this, but also the fact that he sees that this is something that can be an enormous economic opportunity for Canada and for the world, and that's something that Mr. Carney has been very clear about, and that's something that Canada needs to take advantage of. MARTIN: Could be interesting. All right, Minister Wilkinson, thanks for joining us. We appreciate this. WILKINSON: Thank you. MARTIN: Coming up, the strategists on the Scheer agony of leading a Conservative party in mutiny. Please stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \"
"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada171","2019 - Year In Review: December","January 7, 2020 Tuesday","Kingston Whig-Standard","3 A 33-year-old Nova Scotia man was killed and 16 other people were injured during a massive pileup on Highway 401 on Sunday afternoon. Ontario Provincial Police are estimating 30 to 40 vehicles were involved in the pileup in the westbound lanes between the Montreal Street and Highway 15 exits. The OPP confirmed on Monday morning that Matthew Jamieson, 33, of Nova Scotia died in the collision. Frontenac OPP, Kingston Fire and Rescue and Frontenac Paramedic Services responded to the collision shortly after 2:30 p.m. The pileup occurred during a snowstorm that caused visibility issues and poor travel conditions across the Kingston region for much of Sunday afternoon and evening. When Jack Moon pulled up to his burning home Sunday evening, shock ran through him. There it was, the house he, his fiance and his bought win 2017 to raise their young family in, with a flurry of firefighters doing their best to douse flames ripping through it. ""The firefighters let me stand out front and watch it burn,"" Moon shrugged, looking down at his blue jeans and grey hoodie. ""That was nice because I was wearing just this. This is all I own now."" The Whig-Standard found Moon, along with his fiance, Krystiannah Summers, in their neighbour's heated garage. While Summers, 20 weeks pregnant, stayed cool and collected sitting next to the woodstove, Moon answered phone calls, listened to multiple voicemail messages and spoke to fire investigators. 4 The biggest infrastructure project in the city's history cleared its final regulatory hurdle. The federal government approved the detailed impact assessment for the new bridge across the Cataraqui River from Parks Canada, meaning in-water construction of the $180-million project can begin. ""Today's announcement is a major milestone for our community and puts us one step closer to a better connected Kingston,"" Mayor Bryan Paterson said in a statement announcing the approval. ""With investment secured from all levels of government, the provincial Environmental Assessment completed, and now the federal DIA in place, the significant preparation pieces are done. We're now ready to move forward with construction, full-steam ahead."" A local company is working to reinvent the aluminum beverage container industry. Kingston Automation Technology, a venture from Betty Pilon and her son Ben, has modernized the aluminum container production process to bring it into the 21st century and make it a more viable alternative to plastic bottles. ""It was important that we redesign these lines,"" owner Ben Pilon said. ""These are generally, around the world, 60-or 70-year-old technology. We wanted to make them smaller. ""They are a third the size,"" he said of the new facility. ""They use a third the power, they are a third the footprint and they make a fully recyclable bottle."" Kingston Automation Technology is expected to create about 30 jobs at its Montreal Street location and could produce as many as 75 million containers in 2020. 5 Public secondary school teachers and education workers across the province carried out a one-day strike on Wednesday. Nearly 700 members represented by the Ontario Secondary School Teachers'Federation in Limestone District 27 picketed outside public high schools across the Kingston region in two shifts during the school day. Secondary students were told not to attend schools that day due to the labour strike. Despite the lure of photo radar cast by the provincial government earlier this week, city council voted to move ahead with red light cameras. After more than two hours of debate, council voted 8-5 in favour of spending $3.16 million to install the cameras at 10 city intersections. It was the second time in five years that Kingston considered red light cameras and this time the question was made murkier by an announcement from the provincial government earlier this week. On Monday, the provincial government announced it would allow municipalities to put photo radar in selected areas, such as school zones and community safety zones. 7 A couple of months ago, Clark Day had to change the voice message for his Bayview Farms restaurant. In addition to the usual information was news the west-end eatery was fully booked through to the end of the year, at which time it would close. What prompted the rush of reservations wasn't just that the restaurant was closing, but that owner/chef Day, one of the city's best-known restaurateurs, would be hanging up his apron, too. More than 120 hectares of forest and wetlands north of Kingston is to be protected after being purchased by a conservation group. The Nature Conservancy of Canada bought the land near the intersection of Leland and Dean Smith roads from the estate of John ""Jack"" Hunter Allum, who purchased the land 40 years ago and subsequently planted 20,000 trees. 10 Emergency crews were at the scene of a barn fire on Simmons Road near Wilton, north of Highway 401, into the evening. Loyalist Township Emergency Services multiple crews responded to the barn at 352 Simmons Rd. just after 1:30 p.m. on Monday. A tanker from Kingston Fire and Rescue also responded to provide mutual aid. Loyalist fire Chief Fred Stephenson said the barn was fully involved when his crews from the Bath and Loyalist stations arrived. The four ponies that were outside the barn were rescued and are with their owners. No one was injured. 12 A local climate activist was among a half-dozen Canadian youth leaders who attended the global climate conference in Madrid. William Sanderson of Perth Road village spent a week at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP25 ). ""You hear so much about the work happening at the UN,"" Sanderson said. ""To be witnessing or participating in those conversations, especially the conversations that I had heard lots about before, that was really unique."" Sanderson was one of six young people sent to the conference by Students on Ice, an Ottawa-based agency that organizes youth expeditions to the polar regions. 13 A 66-year-old local man charged earlier this year with three separate decades-old cold case murders in Kingston has been committed to stand trial in the Superior Court of Justice, after waiving his right to a preliminary hearing on Wednesday. Michael Wentworth, also known as Michael Verney, has been in custody since his arrest on Feb. 14. He's accused of first-degree murder in the 1995 death of 92-year-old Henrietta Knight, who was beaten in her Macdonnell Street home in June that year and five months later succumbed to her injuries. He's also charged with murder in the presumed death of 30-year-old Richard L. Kimball, who disappeared in November 1995, and in the death of Stephen St. Denis, whose body was discovered in the burned-out living room of his Joyceville Road home following a fire in October 2001. St. Denis'identity wasn't released at the time of his death. In a small bungalow nestled between mature trees in the east end, a family is in utter disbelief and mourning. They've come together to support a mother - with three young children and another on the way - who is trying to comprehend how one month could be so disastrous. In the month of December, Krystiannah Summers has lost her home and belongings to a devastating fire, and the love of her life, Jack Moon, to a snowy car wreck on Highway 401. ""She has good moments and bad moments,"" said Janet DeChamp, Moon's aunt and godmother, on Thursday afternoon. ""She's holding it together for the kids."" On Wednesday, waves of thick snow blanketed the Highway 401 corridor in eastern Ontario. Dozens of collisions were reported by Ontario Provincial Police, but none more destructive than those in just a six-kilometre stretch east of Brockville. That is where Moon lost his life. As he would have been approaching the initial collision between the North Augusta and Maitland exits a little before 12:20 p.m., Moon was involved in a secondary crash involving eight vehicles, including a transport truck. He was alone in his vehicle, except for the two new Ikea dressers he'd just purchased for his children. 17 The organizer of a GoFundMe campaign for Jack Moon, the Kingston man killed on Highway 401 last week just days after his family was burned out of their home, has expressed the family's ""huge thanks"" to the donors who have pushed the fundraiser to more than $265,000 as of late Monday afternoon. ""I have no words to be able to express how grateful we all are for every prayer, every dollar, and every kind of donation everyone has given to them,"" Aisha Summers, sister of Moon's widow, Kristiannah Summers, wrote Sunday in an update on the GoFundMe page. And she said she hoped the Christmastime tragedy might help remind people of life's fragility. Almost two weeks after the final approval was received from the federal government, local government officials kicked off the in-water phase of the construction of the new bridge over the Cataraqui River. Politicians from the municipal, provincial and federal governments were on hand for a groundbreaking ceremony at the end of John Counter Boulevard, with a backdrop of yellow markers stretching more than a kilometre across the ice-covered Cataraqui River ""This is a milestone moment,"" Mayor Bryan Paterson said. ""We've talked about this project for so many years. Now the work begins."" 18 Retired school teacher and former junior hockey player billet Neil Joynt, 78, was found not guilty of four historical sex-related charges in a Napanee court on Tuesday. Joynt had been charged with two counts of sexual assault, one count of indecent assault and one count of indecent assault to a male. Joynt was convicted of the same charges by a jury in 2016, but in 2018 he won the right to a retrial following an appeal. He was acquitted at his 2016 trial of a third charge from an alleged incident in the 1980s. 19 City council voted to move forward with a multimillion-dollar plan that would see a local developer clean up the biggest tract of contaminated land in the city. Council voted Tuesday night in favour of a plan to work with developer Jay Patry to clean up the 13-hectare former Davis Tannery site. The plan, which is still subject to a long list of permit applications and approvals, would create a special project for the site under the Brownfield Community Improvement Plan, a funding program meant to provide financial incentives, such as tax assistance, grants or loans, to help developers build on former industrial sites that need to be cleaned up beforehand. A Kingston man is in custody as police investigate a homicide in the Hillendale neighbourhood. Kingston Police have confirmed that a woman has been killed. Police were called to the midtown area at about 9 a.m. and arrested the man. Const. Ash Gutheinz stressed that there is no danger to the public and that the major crimes unit is investigating. Police were still at 177 Hillendale Ave., a one-and-a-half-storey brick house, on Wednesday afternoon. Their cruisers were parked out front and yellow tape surrounded the property. A neighbour described the couple that lived in the home as kind and quiet. Gutheinz said investigators would be releasing more information Thursday morning. Richard Fardella has been charged with second-degree murder and appeared before justice of the peace Jack Chiang during bail court on Wednesday afternoon. The charge has not been proven in court. 21 The non-communication order banning a man charged with the second-degree murder of his wife from talking to his two sons has been lifted as the man's health continues to deteriorate. Richard Fardella, 59, has been in custody since Wednesday morning when emergency services were called to his home on Hillendale Avenue, where his 60-year-old wife had been stabbed at about 9 a.m. Witnesses of the stabbing called 911, Fardella's wife was taken to hospital, and he was taken into custody peacefully. She later died in hospital. Fardella appeared before justice of the peace Jack Chiang on Wednesday for bail court and was remanded into custody. A threeday psychiatric assessment was ordered. He was soon taken to hospital in Napanee instead of Quinte Detention Centre. 27 The province's planning appeal body rescinded a decision from earlier this year against a pair of high-rise building projects in the downtown core. In response to a request for review of the decision from the company that wanted to build the projects, Homestead Land Holdings, the Local Planning Appeals Agency also ordered a new hearing about the appeal. The company had wanted to build a 19-storey building at 51-57 Queen St. and a 23-storey building at 18 Queen St. and 282 Ontario St. The projects were opposed by the Frontenac Heritage Foundation. 31 Rod LaPorte's lucky number is 3752. That's the number on the ticket that was drawn as the winner of the 2019 Kinsmen Dream Home Lottery at Saturday night's Kingston Frontenacs'Ontario Hockey League game. The Kingston resident says he and his family were at a friend's house when he started getting text messages and phone calls that he had won. ""I got a bunch of texts from friends, and then a buddy called and said I won,"" LaPorte said, still reeling. ""I said, 'No way.'I said to my wife, 'I think we won the dream home.'"" LaPorte and his wife, Liezl Cuzon-LaPorte, work in the Kingston area as a correctional officer and an RPN, respectively. The couple lives in a semi-detached home on Kingston's west end with their twin sons, Matthew and Cameron. The lottery win has changed their life, LaPorte said. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2020 Osprey Media Group Inc. All rights reserved. \"

Thunberg answered four questions from reporters. She was asked about her meeting with Justin Trudeau this morning. ""My message to all the politicians around the world is the same, just listen and act on the current most available science. I try not to focus so much on individuals and rather focus on the whole picture because ... of course it's easier just to blame someone. And of course (Trudeau) has a lot of responsibility and he's obviously not doing enough. Because this is a system that is wrong. My message to all the politicians is the same, just listen to the science, act on the science."" Why did she invite Indigenous youth to help lead the march? ""Indigenous people have for centuries and millenniums protected the local environment and of course we need to because they are often the ones who are being, who are at the front line, so we need to be able to hear their voices. So that's why I think it's so important that indigenous people lead this fight."" Why did she decide to come to Montreal? ""Why I decided to go to Montreal, because I was planning on where to go and of course, I want to go to Canada as well and I was invited to attend the march in Montreal. I thought why not? And I decided to go there because I think it's fun to visit lots of different places. Because this is not just one country, this is everyone. Also because I know Canada is striking on the 27th and the U.S. is striking on the 20th so that's why I sort of changed countries because diff countries strike on different dates. ""From Canada I have already seen today that the strikes have been very big and I think and I hope the rest of the strikes of Canada will be very big as well. I know you have elections now, and that is always a very busy time when I really want to understand what is going on. I expect that you as well as other countries take your responsibility and do your part from a global perspective."" Does she have a theory about why some political leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump, mock her? ""Of course I don't know. I don't understand why grownups would choose to mock children and teenagers for just communicating and acting on the science when they could do something good instead. I guess they must feel like their world view or their interests or whatever it is, is threatened by and we should take that as a compliment that we are having so much impact that people want to silence us, we've become too loud for people to handle, so they want to silence us. So we should also take that as a compliment."" 10:45 a.m. Thunberg speaks Greta Thunberg addresses the press conference. The Gazette Facebook page is covering Thunberg's press conference live. Thunberg, who has been tweeting images of marches around the world this morning( HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/GretaThunberg https://twitter.com/GretaThunberg ""It's great to be here with you all in Canada. I'm looking very much forward to today.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada173","Canadian communities are tapping into greener ways to heat and cool buildings","December 3, 2019 Tuesday 8:51 AM GMT","CBC News","During the cold, snowy winters in much of Canada, many of us rely on furnaces, boilers and baseboard heaters to keep our homes and offices comfortable \'e2\€  and hope they don't suddenly quit during a cold snap. But what if you didn't need any heating equipment in your home? What if your community provided a greener, more efficient, more reliable source of heat using locally sourced energy? What if it didn't take up space in your home or office building, you didn't have to maintain it, and it was just about guaranteed to keep running and keep you warm through big storms and power outages? That's the promise of district energy systems \'e2\€  along with climate benefits that have earned them an endorsement from the United Nations Environment Program. World leaders meet Dec. 2-13 for the COP 25 UN climate conference in Madrid to discuss next steps in implementing the Paris Agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb global warming, and district energy is one potential tool. The idea is that instead of having an individual heating and cooling system for each building, multiple buildings are hooked up to a single, central system \'e2\€  similar to the idea of hooking into a municipal water service instead of each building relying on individual wells. The heating and cooling is distributed to individual buildings through pipes that typically contain heated or chilled water. It's not new \'e2\€  some district energy systems in Canada are more than 100 years old. But thanks to environmental concerns and the desire in communities to use greener energy technologies for heating and cooling, new projects are popping up across the country. ""Yes, there's a real renaissance,"" says Bruce Ander, president and CEO of Markham District Energy in the Great Toronto Area. A past chair of the International District Energy Association, Ander has been working in the field for 40 years. More than half of district energy facilities inventoried in Canada in 2014 had been commissioned since 2000, and more than half of them planned expansions in the near future. - 6 district energy projects underway in Canada They range from a project in Vancouver that recovers heat from sewer water to provide heat and hot water to more than 30 condo buildings to one that cools Toronto office towers in summer with water from the depths of Lake Ontario. And even smaller communities are jumping on board, including the village of Teslin, Yukon, which has installed a biomass system, and the rural municipality of Ritchot, Man., which has a district geothermal system. Many new projects are underway such as: Why? A major factor is climate change and climate change resilience. In Canada, buildings are the third largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, after oil and gas and transportation, Environment and Climate Change Canada reports. And nearly two-thirds of energy use in buildings is for heating and cooling. Much of that comes from burning fossil fuels, either directly in furnaces or indirectly through power generation. In 2011, for example, natural gas was used to heat half of Canadian homes and electric baseboards were used to heat most of the rest, Statistics Canada reports. When buildings are individually heated, there aren't many green options. But Ander says, once a community has installed a district energy system, ""Now you can unlock a bunch of technologies."" Buying local Many energy sources used in district energy systems, such as biomass, sewage, lake water or seawater aren't very feasible or economically viable on a small scale. The choice of energy source for a district heating system is what is available locally and can generate co-benefits for the local community. For example, Vancouver captures the heat from families' hot showers, dishwasher and laundry loads in its high-density False Creek neighbourhood. The waste heat literally is heading down the drain, but can be extracted at the nearby sewage pumping plant. ""It's a great opportunity,"" says Alex Charpentier, acting manager of the False Creek Neighourhood Utility that runs the system. ""In a dense urban environment, there's not many sources of local energy."" Charlottetown has little land for landfills and no equipment installed to prevent methane generated by rotting garbage from escaping into the atmosphere, so it burns garbage in its district energy system, says Carlyle Coutinho, president and chief operating officer for the Canadian region at Enwave Energy Corp., which runs the system. The heat is distributed through underground pipes carrying heated water. Meanwhile, Teslin, Yukon, is surrounded by boreal forest. Installing district energy means it can now heat buildings with locally sourced wood chips, generating jobs and keeping $300,000 a year that would have been spent on imported diesel in the local community, said project manager Blair Hogan, president and CEO of Gunta Business Consulting. The wood comes from trees cleared for development, and more will be cleared in the future to create fire breaks to protect the community from wildfires, a risk that grows with climate change. ""In every community, there's a unique technology for their unique situation,"" Hogan said. In addition to accessing different heating and cooling sources, district energy systems make it easy to feed in new energy sources or switch altogether. For example, a system in St. Paul, Minn., switched from fossil fuels to biomass ""almost overnight"" without affecting customers, Ander said: ""How it's fuelled doesn't really matter to them."" But it can have a huge impact on their greenhouse gas emissions. 'Key measure' for carbon targets In fact, the United Nations Environment Program calls district energy a ""key measure for cities/countries that aim to achieve 100 per cent renewable energy or carbon neutral targets."" Its District Energy in Cities Initiative notes that district energy can: - Reduce energy consumption and costs from heating and cooling by up to 50 per cent. - Store large amounts of energy at low cost. - Make transitions to sustainable heating and cooling sources fast and cost-effective. It adds that such systems are increasingly low-carbon and climate resilient \'e2\€  that is, they can often keep running through storms and extreme weather disasters that are becoming more frequent with climate change and that often knock out the electricity needed to run many traditional heating systems. That's why they're often hooked up to places like hospitals that can't afford to lose power. Ander says Markham's system has had more than 99.99 per cent reliability since it launched in 2000 \'e2\€  in 165,000 hours of continuous operation in 20 years, it's been down just 2.5 hours. ""The buildings are much easier to operate,"" he said. ""You don't need to worry about this critical equipment failing."" He notes there are other benefits for customers: - They don't need to pay the large up-front cost of installing equipment, such as furnaces, boilers, chillers or air conditioners. Nor do they need to maintain the equipment. - They free up space that would have been taken up by that kind of equipment. - There's reduced noise and vibration from heating and cooling systems. - There are safety benefits to not being directly supplied with natural gas, for instance. Markham District Energy's Markham Centre system serves every new building that has been built in the city's ""new"" downtown since 2000. It expects to ultimately heat and cool 30 million square feet of homes for 41,000 residents and 39,000 employees in commercial and institutional buildings. For now, the system burns natural gas and uses electrically powered chillers for cooling, but its use of fossil fuels remains more efficient than if the buildings had individual heating systems. It also has started to incorporate waste heat from data centres. Installation barriers Despite the benefits of district energy, most buildings in Canada are still heated and cooled individually. As of 2013, district energy heated and cooled about 2,600 buildings across the country, representing less than one per cent of total energy used for heating and cooling in Canada, reported the Canadian Energy and Emissions Data Centre at Simon Fraser University. Partly, that's because building an economically viable district energy system typically requires two things that aren't often found together: - High density. - Undeveloped land. ""So there has to be some sort of some assistance in some manner from higher levels of government,"" he suggests. Another challenge is the low price of natural gas that is the dominant heating fuel in Canada, says Lucio Mesquita, senior engineer with the Solar Thermal Renewable Heat and Power Group at Natural Resource's Canada CanmetENERGY Research Centre. ""To compete with natural gas \'e2\€  it's a tough one."" Mesquita was part of the team that built and continues to monitor the Drake Landing Solar Community in Okotoks, Alta., which collects heat using solar panels in the summer and stores it for home heating use in the winter. In the past 13 years, more than 90 per cent of home heat \'e2\€  100 per cent some years \'e2\€  has come from the solar collectors. He says not enough of the discussion on reducing emissions has been about ways to decarbonize heating in Canada. ""We have the solutions. We have the technology to do the deep decarbonization,"" he said. ""It's a matter of resources and the right market conditions."" \"
"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada174","Premiers Meet in Ontario","December 2, 2019 Monday","CTV NEWS CHANNEL Television, Inc. POWER PLAY WITH DON MARTIN 17:00:00 ET","DON MARTIN: Welcome to ""Power Play"" on a day when premiers huddled ahead of this week's return of parliament, all this to draft their wish lists for the prime minister. Coming up, two premiers, one west, one east, will be here to talk about today's meeting and what they can realistically expect from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Alberta's Jason Kenney and New Brunswick's Blaine Higgs are standing by. Also ahead, it's do or fry according to the United Nations as it takes aim at stopping climate change. Today Cop 25 kicks off to try and find a way to stop global warming before we hit the planetary tipping point. The minister of the environment joins us to discuss Canada's role in the summit. And Canada-China relations turned frosty a year ago this week with the apprehension of a Huawei executive pending extradition to the United States. We look back at the big chill in a key foreign relation. But first, they came, they talked, they issued a statement of agreement that national unity is a good thing but there's work to be done to make it stronger. Canada's premiers met in Mississauga to frame their hopes in forging a new relationship with the Trudeau government after months of pre-election acrimony in the case of some premiers. Let's find out what happened. Here's the soundtrack from the closing news conference. JOHN HORGAN (BC Premier): Look, we're in an extraordinary time. Four of us sit before you as leaders of minority governments. We look to Ottawa where there's a minority government. I find, and I think my colleagues in the minority situations would agree, that this is a unique opportunity for us to work together regardless of where we live in the country, regardless of how we vote. The passion of Canadians is directed at us succeeding. BRIAN PALLISTER (Manitoba Premier): If the federal government will listen to the unified voices of premiers from across this beautiful country on economic competitiveness, take steps to make the improvements that we recommended, if they will move on the fiscal stabilization program, if they will move on sustainable funding for health care, they can lessen the resistant remarkably. DOUG FORD (Ontario Premier): Canada is united. We're a united nation. And as you've seen in this meeting, when some of the provinces are struggling, we're all there. We're going to be there. We support them. We have their back, and we're going to do everything we can to get them back on their feet. MARTIN: And Jason Kenney, the premier of Alberta, joins us from Mississauga. Premier, you've got some big requests from the federal government, a fair deal as you call it to ease alienation and fiscal distress. Did you get a coalition of the willing from the premiers to support you as you head to Ottawa next week? JASON KENNEY (Alberta Premier): We did, and we're deeply grateful, an important win for Alberta in fight for fairness today with unanimous support from the premiers for a complete reform of something called the fiscal stabilization program. I call it sort of reverse equalization for the have provinces, Don, and it means when a province like Alberta sees a sudden decline in revenues like we've seen, $7 billion down in our provincial revenues, that the feds are supposed to give us sort of a top up. It should have been close to $2 billion, but fact we were capped at 10 percent of that. So this was really, at the end of the day, should the federal government respond and we get a couple of extra billion dollars, it will be helpful, and we'll put it to good use in job creation programs, getting folks back to work, for example through reclaiming abandoned wells and such, but I think even more importantly it sends a message to Albertans who have felt pretty isolated and pretty down that in fact we do have friends and allies in the rest of the country. So I really want to thank my fellow premiers for the solidarity they demonstrated in unanimously supporting our request today. One of our key asks for fairness, as well as strong language around bill C-69 in federal, environmental assessments and pipelines. MARTIN: You know you're setting it up if Trudeau doesn't do this, it enflames the west further, doesn't it? KENNEY: Well that's not how I look at it. I had a positive meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Freeland last week for nearly three hours. She was born in Alberta, and I think understands the deep frustration of Albertans, and she's indicated an openness on a number of these issues. But as I said to her then, and I've said publicly since, we will measure the federal government by its actions and not its words. Now you have 13 provinces and territories saying to Ottawa, please listen to the plight of Alberta in particular, but also Saskatchewan and Newfoundland, both resource provinces, in part by doing a retroactive payment on the fiscal stabilization and reforming it in the future, because after all, Don, we contribute over $20 billion net more to the rest of Canada than we get back. This is one small way of recognizing what we contribute and the pain that many families are going through in the province. I hope that Prime Minister Trudeau will listen to the voices of the premiers. MARTIN: These communiques are things you have to read carefully to figure out if there's anything in them. This one seems to suggest that the premiers, as a group, are open to ensuring natural resources get to markets, and I don't know, is that a pipeline concession of some kind, or am I misreading that? KENNEY: I think you're right, and it was, just on the point of language, normally, Don, these communiques run for 10 or 20 pages, and people are throwing everything including the kitchen sink into them. This was the most focused and shortest communique of the premiers probably ever, and we developed that purposefully to send a very clear message to Ottawa in advance of the meeting with the prime minister in the winter. And one of those issues was effectively this whole bill C-69 no more pipelines law saying work with us, we need regulatory certainty and fast approvals, we need to be able to get our natural resources to market, to global markets. For me that very clearly means pipelines. I want to remind you, Don, that in the summer the same group of premiers signed off on the concept of energy and resource corridors, including explicit mention of oil and gas pipelines. The only objection was from Quebec on the word oil. But BC did not object to that language then. Those two provinces, Quebec and BC, are working with us on liquefied natural gas exports. I think we're getting positive momentum amongst the provinces for a future of the Canadian resource industry. MARTIN: All right. Not so positive, a little deja vu for me, you faced a protest of about a thousand over the weekend after you let it be known there would be about 6,000 public servants cut over the next three years. Does that backlash in any way threaten your agenda? Doug Ford has been backpedalling away from his unpopular policies for the last year. KENNEY: Don, your old pal Ralph Klein once said that if a protest doesn't happen each day I'm wondering what I'm doing wrong. MARTIN: That's true. KENNEY: Well it's inevitable that when you have a government focused on fiscal responsibility, and finding savings, that the government unions are going to have protests. In journalistic terms I think you call it a dog bites man story. Here's what we're saying though. We don't want to see significant reductions in the labour force of our nurses, teachers, and public service. The unions can help us to reduce or minimize layoffs by helping us to find some economies and reduce some of the benefits that people in our public service get that folks in the private sector do not receive. We have the most inefficient government in Canada. We spend 20 percent more per person than the average amongst provincial governments, including in health care. We have the biggest and best paid public service in Canada. And we have unions asking for as much as an 8 percent increase in their salaries next year when average private sector family incomes are down by 8 percent over the past five years. This suggests that some of the union leaders are out of touch with the economic and fiscal reality in Alberta. We'd ask them to choose the path of cooperation with us instead of confrontation. MARTIN: All right. Last point, I got to ask you, speaking of confrontation, what's your response to those engaged from within the Conservative party to dump Andrew Scheer? Can his leadership survive this, do you think? MARTIN: All right, we'll see what happens. There's a lot of noise against him, but we'll see if that's muffled or not in the future. All right, Jason Kenney, always a pleasure having you on. Thanks for joining us, Premier, appreciate it. KENNEY: Thank you, Don. \"
"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada175","No Headline In Original","December 19, 2019 Thursday","The Toronto Star","UN meeting in Madrid lacking practical solutions Few promises, one 'lost opportunity, Dec. 16 The United Nations held a long meeting with almost 200 countries in attendance and they accomplished nothing. What they agreed on was calling for greater ""ambition,"" whatever that means, in cutting greenhouse gases, and when to hold next year's meeting. Maybe if they stopped spouting out nothing but hot air, that would help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Larry Prout, Peterborough How depressing the failure of COP25 in Madrid has been! The planet desperately needs world leaders to act to save our species and planet ... But we cannot let our own leaders off the hook. We need carbon rationing and meat rationing now. We need an end to subsidies for fossil fuels and other major greenhouse gas polluters. How can we - the people who care - institute the paradigm shift without government leadership? How can we take over the media that, like governments, are co-opted by the powerful corporate military-industrial complex? How can we re-establish democracy in our countries now controlled by corporate oligarchies? We need local, grassroots leadership; intensive public shaming of those who persist in planet destroying practices; and immediate implementation of co-operative, local, small-scale, sustainable, renewable energy and food production systems. Molly Mulloy, Belleville, Ont. Hacks of personal health data prove laws have to change LifeLabs says it paid ransom to get data back, Dec. 18 When big companies like LifeLabs, and other keepers of our personal health data, lose it to ransom hackers, how do we really know what personal data they have taken and used to create false health cards and steal from our health care system? If we were able to access and view just our own personal usage data on our OHIP health card, we could track how and when it was used. If there were any strange entries that we didn't know about, like the card being used in places we haven't visited for care or tests we didn't get, or drugs we weren't prescribed, then we could flag that to be investigated. Hopefully this would prevent illegal use and cost losses. John Purvis, Colborne, Ont. As a result of the far too frequent data ""hacks"" that can compromise the security and future of innocent people, it is time that Parliament passed legislation imposing criminal liability on corporations and executives that fail to ensure the security of customers data. After-the-fact apologies and offers to pay for credit monitoring is simply not enough. The legislation could be similar to Bill C-45 that was created as a result of the 1992 Westray Mine disaster. Bruce Cowan, Mississauga In light of the data breach at LifeLabs, there is heightened concern about identity theft. The question society should be asking is why identity theft is blamed on the individual being impersonated? If you fall for a scam where somebody impersonates the RCMP or the CRA or even your grandson, you don't expect the RCMP, the CRA or your grandson to cover your losses. So why do banks, credit card companies or mortgage brokers that fall for an impersonation scam expect the person being impersonated to cover their losses? If a financial institution gets fooled by an impostor, then it should redesign its security protocols. All the impersonated person should have to do is swear that they were not involved in, nor benefited from, the scam. After making such a declaration, it should be illegal for the innocent person to be hounded by collection agencies or have their credit rating damaged. The idea that identity theft scams are the fault of the person being impersonated needs to stop. All repercussions from data breaches should be the responsibility of the corporation whose security failed, not their customers. Steen Petersen, Nanaimo, B.C. Catholic trustee should re-examine his standing Catholic trustee scolded over incidents, Dec. 18 A pity Education Minister Stephen Lecce has fallen into the fashion for misusing words ... ""we hope the board will undertake a 'fulsome' investigation ..."" One can give a fulsome apology, but not a fulsome investigation. Sandra Hanmer, Hamilton I continue to be baffled how some professed Christians seem to act in the most non-Christian of ways. I understand that Michael Del Grande, as trustee for the Toronto Catholic District School Board, feels compelled to stand up for his publicly funded ""Catholic education and Church teachings."" However, where in the name of all things Christian does providing a safe and non-discriminatory school environment for certain marginalized members of our society become ""evil"" ? I applaud the TCDSB for amending its code of conduct to be more inclusive regarding discrimination. I don't see any conflict with Christian principles and teachings. In fact, compassion for others (i.e. human decency) is a very Christian characteristic. Mr. Del Grande's acts of martyrdom on the altar of standing up against attacks on Christian beliefs are, in my mind, largely egotistical and simply pandering to small-mindedness. If he so strongly believes that showing a little humanity in his role as trustee is in conflict with the teachings of his church, maybe he should resign from one of his positions. Brian Stratton, Milton Photo radar is not the answer to pedestrian, cyclist deaths Tory announces start to radar cameras, Dec. 17 If you look at the map where pedestrians and cyclists have been killed, it is not in neighbourhoods. It is almost always on a main street. These cameras are not going to stop any accidents. We need to spend money giving people safer locations to cross main streets and make sure people are crossing safely. Visibility is key, not cameras. I'm all for stopping pedestrian and cyclist deaths. Let's determine the root cause and fix it. Photo radar locations are not going to address this. Shawn Michajluk, Toronto \"

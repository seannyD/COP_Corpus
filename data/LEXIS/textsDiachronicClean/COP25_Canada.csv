That means doing the important work at home to cut pollution and create good jobs for Canadians. It also means working with international partners to ensure a sustainable future for the next generation. Over the past two weeks, Canada's strong team of negotiators and the Minister of Environment and Climate Change, the Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, showed leadership on climate action at COP25 and played an active role in negotiations, including on the international rules on carbon markets, under the Paris Agreement (also known as Article\~6). While Canada is pleased to see increased ambition and the launch of a new dialogue on oceans and climate in the decision, the negotiations on international markets will continue next year, in the hopes of reaching an ambitious resolution at COP26 in Glasgow.Indigenous Peoples particularly those in isolated or northern communities are disproportionately impacted by climate change. Canada called for rules to promote and protect human rights and the rights of Indigenous Peoples in activities that would occur under Article 6. We also actively promoted rules for the long-term environmental integrity of carbon markets. While a consensus was not reached on Article 6 in Madrid, discussions will continue into next year's negotiations. Canada remains determined to push\~for ambitious climate action and will participate in further negotiations to define the rules that will mobilize private-sector investment toward the global transition to a low-carbon economy.While at COP25The Minister met with international counterparts, Indigenous leaders, young people, environmental organizations, and industry leaders. At a meeting with European Union Commissioner Frans Timmermans, he discussed the strong environmental partnership between Canada and the EU and their commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Minister Wilkinson met with fellow Canadian Mark Carney and congratulated him on his new position as UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance. He also\~met with German Minister Svenja Schulze, UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres,\~and other international counterparts and climate leaders, including Small Island Developing States, to continue to strengthen Canada's relationships on climate action.Canadian-led initiatives grew at COP25, as Minister Wilkinson welcomed new endorsees of the Ocean Plastics Charter and new members of the Powering Past Coal Alliance. The Minister also announced investments through the World Bank to help developing countries design and implement carbon pricing in ways that will work for them.In Canada and across the world, work to phase out coal-power generation goes hand in hand with work to ensure the transition is a fair one for affected communities and people. While at COP25, Minister Wilkinson participated in a Just Transition event including New Zealand, Germany, Spain, and Scotland led by the International Trade Union Confederation and the Canadian Labour Congress.Global momentum toward climate action continues to accelerate as more citizens advocate for bold climate solutions. Canada is working to ensure that the implementation of the Paris Agreement will cut emissions and create a clean and prosperous future for everyone. Canada was proud to be among the leaders who were advocating for important climate commitments that will reduce pollution, implement nature-based solutions, and create more jobs by accelerating clean growth.Quotes""Science tells us and our citizens have told us that we need to not only meet our Paris target but exceed it. Canada came to in the spirit of compromise and commitment to action. While there were some successes, we are disappointed that the world was not able to agree on the rules for the international carbon markets that would help us all raise our ambition in Madrid. Canada will keep working with our global partners to land on effective rules for international markets at next year's COP. I am proud of Canada's contribution to the work at COP25, including our commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Canada will\~continue to work towards meeting our Paris Agreement commitments at home and providing support to developing countries as they reduce emissions and adapt to the consequences of climate change."" \~The Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Environment and Climate ChangeQuick facts While at COP25COP25, Canada and other countries also revised the UNFCCC Gender Action Plan to further advance women-led and gender-responsive climate action at national and multilateral levels\~and agreed to a work plan for the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform.Related products While at COP25COP25, Canada and other countries also revised the UNFCCC Gender Action Plan to further advance women-led and gender-responsive climate action at national and multilateral levels\~and agreed to a work plan for the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform.Associated links While at COP25COP25, Canada and other countries also revised the UNFCCC Gender Action Plan to further advance women-led and gender-responsive climate action at national and multilateral levels\~and agreed to a work plan for the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform.Environment and Climate Change Canada's Twitter pageEnvironment and Climate Change Canada's Facebook pageSOURCE Environment and Climate Change Canada HYPERLINK http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/December2019/16/c0206.htmlhttp://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/December2019/16/c0206.html\l"

This update follows the filing, on November 29, of its financial statements (""3Q Statements"") and Management Discussion and Analysis (the ""3Q MD&A"") of its financial and operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019.OPERATING AND CORPORATE HIGHLIGHTS: SUBSEQUENT EVENTS TO 3Q 19Sigma's Chief Strategy Officer Speaks at World Climate Summit during the United Nations in Madrid about ""Leadership in Responsible Mining"". Sigma Lithium is pleased to announce today that Ana Cabral-Gardner, Chief Strategy Officer presented at the World Climate Summit during the United Nations on the panel covering the theme of ""Leadership in responsible mining - mitigating the impacts of resource extraction"" on November 8, in Madrid. She discussed the case study of Sigma as an ESG ""green lithium"" company and the role played by Sigma's investors in providing the capital and the leadership to drive implementation of environmental and social best practices. Ms Cabral-Gardner highlighted how these key issues are part of a broader movement spearheaded by ethical and ESG-focused investors driving sweeping changes in practices across the mining industry as a whole. Excerpts from Ms Cabral-Gardner's speech include: ""In this [EV] industry a paradigm is being broken [from the ICE days], whereby now 'upstream matters' and therefore, upstream practices matter too. So ultimately, in the very last step of the value chain...the OEM hears this [message from the consumer], because they are tuned into what their customer wants. So there is a ""push for provenance"" in battery materials, and at Sigma we sense that in the contracts [for lithium offtakes]. Sigma is in binding offtake discussions with some of the EV industry leading participants in great part because of the [differentiation] of the ""green lithium' Sigma is 100% hydro, it is 100% environmentally conformed to dry stacking and other best practices. So even though the green price differentiation hasn't yet happened in metals and it isn't expected, it has been translated into displacement value: you get the best contracts, you get to sell the big volumes..."" ""Sigma produces environmentally sustainable high-quality high-grade lithium concentrate from its pilot plant on site in Brazil... and the Company has some of the world's largest and richest deposits of spodumene ore... and we set out to develop it since the very beginning six years ago as an ESG green mining case study, pioneering amongst lithium companies ... and we did that by focusing 15% of the capex towards always keeping up with best environmental practices [management and rehabilitation] and obviously focusing on the way [electric] power was sourced to beneficiate the material [lithium]."" ""Four examples of actions include dry-stacking tailings management from inception at the pilot plant to investing in water recirculation equipment that would lead the company to recycle 90% of the water...so there is an enormous focus on water efficiency. And then there is energy efficiency, 100% of the energy is green, power is sourced from hydro."" ""More importantly there is the ""S"" in ESG, the Company works in a region with the second-lowest IDH [index of human development] in Brazil and one of the lowest in the world... So [Sigma] is transformational as we become the largest investor by a factor of 20x in the region with massive social impact. This has been our mission and just demonstrates that with the right purpose and the right will we can become a great example even though we are a relatively small mining company on a small budget. But why? Because being in battery materials... the purpose of that value chain is to decarbonize at the ""mobility-end"" of the value chain. So if we do not behave accordingly by being 100% green and by powering the energy with 100% green energy and enforcing those practices all along, we would not be a sustainable member of that [EV] value chain.Signs a CAD6.6 million Revolving Credit Facility with A10 Investimentos to Meet ESG Goals and Further Advance Second Deposit into Pre-Feasibility. A10 Investimentos and its affiliates (""A10 Group"") continues to support Sigma in meeting its development and construction timetable as well as strategic environmental and social ESG goals. On November 29, A10 Group provided Sigma with a CAD6.6 million (USD5 million) senior unsecured revolving credit facility to complete the pre-feasibility study for the Barreiro deposit, to meet the current social-economic obligations under the environmental licensing as well as for general corporate purposes. The facility bears interest at 11% per annum (calculated in US Dollars from the day funds are drawn) and it has a one-year term, which is the maturity day for all funds drawn, if any. Each disbursement under the facility is subject to A10 Group's approval. This credit facility is a related party transaction for Sigma for purposes of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 (""MI 61-101"") and Policy 5.9 of the TSX Venture Exchange (which incorporates by reference MI 61-101) because Ana Cabral-Gardner, Marcelo Paiva and Anna Hartley are officers and/or directors of Sigma as well as principals of the A10 Group. In accordance with applicable law, the credit facility agreement was reviewed and unanimously approved by the directors of Sigma other than those related to the A10 Group. The credit facility, which is not convertible into securities of Sigma, is exempt from the formal valuation and minority approval requirements under MI 61-101 because the fair market value of the transaction is below 25% of Sigma's market capitalization. It is also exempt from the minority approval requirements under MI 61-101 because the facility is on reasonable commercial terms and is not convertible into securities of Sigma Selection of Global Engineering Contractor for Construction of Plant on a 'Lump Sum Turnkey Basis' Capped by a Gross Maximum Price Sigma invited global engineering firms to conduct due diligence and submit proposals for engineering and procurement services for the construction of the commercial production plant (the ""Plant"") and the production complex.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada11","Kathryn Harrison: Why all the fuss about Article 6 at COP-25?","December 4, 2019 Wednesday","Postmedia Breaking News","With more than 10,000 delegates from almost 200 countries, dozens of panels daily, and countless government, NGO, and business pavilions, there's a lot to do at the international climate conference currently underway in Madrid. With so many options, one might wonder why Tuesday afternoon saw several hundred people jammed into a hot room for a three-hour meeting of the ""Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technical Advice Contact Group on Article 6.""Although the Paris Agreement established goals and broad strategies to meet them, further guidance is necessary to determine how it all will work in practice. Most elements of the so-called Paris ""rulebook"" were completed at the international climate negotiations, COP-24, last year. However, in light of remaining disagreement, the rules for Article 6 alone were deferred to COP-25 in Madrid this year.Article 6 is the section of the Paris Agreement that authorizes international emissions trading. Section 6.2 envisions government-to-government trades, by which one country could meet its reduction target in part by paying another country to make extra reductions beyond its own target. Section 6.4 offers a mechanism for the private sector to go ""above and beyond"" to earn emissions reduction credits that can then be sold to other private actors or governments.Article 6 holds the potential to make or break the Paris Agreement. At best, by providing a mechanism to meet targets at a much lower cost, Article 6 could inspire countries to increase the ambition of their national targets. At worst, weak rules for Article 6 will encourage violation of human rights and authorize illegitimate reductions that merely give the illusion of progress.Which vision will prevail turns on how several key issues are resolved in the days to come.AdditionalityThe most fundamental issue in certifying reduction credits is to demonstrate that the activities in question would not have happened anyway, a standard referred to as ""additionality."" While that sounds obvious, it's tough in practice. For instance, as the price of renewable energy falls, projects that once seemed cutting edge can suddenly pay for themselves. Credit for extra action is no longer warranted. The challenge is to devise rules that allow outsiders to assess what is truly additional.Carry-forward of Kyoto Protocol creditsThe additionality question is closely related to a debate over carry-forward of unused Kyoto Protocol credits. The predecessor to the Paris Agreement first established emissions trading both between countries and through investment in private projects. There are, however, serious concerns about the legitimacy of many of the resulting credits.In some cases, countries such as Australia accumulated surplus credits simply by setting unambitious targets up front. Similarly, some projects are believed to have gamed the system, for instance by temporarily increasing production to justify credits when emissions were later reduced simply by cutting production. Some analysts estimate that there are upwards of 20 billion tonnes of unused Kyoto credits. Given their questionable legitimacy, allowing signatories to the Paris Agreement to meet their obligations with ""hot air"" Kyoto credits could greatly undermine already halting progress toward global climate goals.Double countingArticle 6 specifies that in emissions trading there should be a ""corresponding adjustment"" so that the same emissions reduction cannot be counted simultaneously toward two countries' compliance. Again, that sounds obvious. It's not a trade if the same reduction appears on both countries' ledgers. Yet there is continuing disagreement over which reductions require such an accounting, and whether adjustments should be mandatory or voluntary.""Overall Mitigation in Global Emissions""The Paris Agreement states that trading in carbon markets should ensure ""overall mitigation in global emissions."" That suggests going beyond merely offsetting one party's reduction with an equal, if less costly, reduction by another party. However, some argue that realization of cost savings itself will promote increasing ambition. Others are proposing that a fraction of credits be cancelled with each trade.Human rightsKyoto Protocol experience also has revealed potential negative impacts of emissions trading on Indigenous and other local communities, for instance when forests where they live or on which they rely for their livelihoods are designated ""off limits"" as part of an emissions credit swap. NGOs, Indigenous peoples, and some countries are pushing for explicit recognition of human rights in the Article 6 rulebook, but they face strong resistance from other countries.The stakes could not be higher, yet with 10 days to go in COP-25, negotiators remain a long way from agreement. The countries most vulnerable to climate change, including low-lying island states and least developed countries, are pressing for strong rules to ensure environmental integrity, no carry-forward of Kyoto credits, and retirement of a fraction of credits with each trade. However, countries that surpassed their Kyoto targets or hold unclaimed project-specific credits hope to retain those potentially valuable credits, while Brazil is leading a group arguing for a voluntary approach to fight double counting.What are the implications for Canada?

It runs based on individual donations. Since 1995, world leaders have come together annually at the Convention of the Parties (COP) to negotiate how to address the global crisis of climate change. The Paris Agreement, signed in 2016, aims to keep global temperature increases within two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels to reduce the risk and impacts of climate change. This year the focus is finalizing the agreements around Article 6 of the Paris Agreement that would allow countries to work together in lowering greenhouse gas emissions through carbon-friendly technology and carbon markets, which allow for emissions trading between countries to meet climate targets.The goals of ICA's demonstrations at COP25 are to bring attention to the extraction industry in Canada and lobby for recognition of Indigenous rights in climate change negotiations while bringing Indigenous-led solutions to climate change forward.Proposed mine located near national parkTeck Resources' proposed Frontier project would be 292 square kilometres, one of the largest oilsands mines to date.At full capacity, the Frontier project would extract 260,000 barrels of bitumen a day.

The solutions proposed at COP25 must reflect the demands of people. It is not clear that this is the case. For instance, the conference was meant to take place in Santiago, Chile, but was diverted to Madrid to avoid the nationwide strikes against economic policies that benefit the very rich at the expense of the majority. These same economic policies are responsible for ecological destruction.

While we cannot emphasize enough that our intervention here aims to build further on their energy and efforts, we do think it is crucial to ask important questions that all too often tend to be overlooked.Instead of furthering a ""we are all in the same boat"" rhetoric, we've got to address the deeply political issues of who wins, who loses and whose natures are being talked about when nature-based solutions are proposed.

They are, of course, absolutely right. But what happens to people that live where nature-based solutions are being suggested? For many people, nature is more than a tool or a collection of trees that suck carbon dioxide out of the air. The livelihoods of people are as much a part of forests as the insect drone and the tree canopy. We need to break from conceptions of pristine nature and make it clear and unambiguous that environments are formed by people shaping nature in ways that reflect their ways of living.

The Alliance\~recognizes the importance of governments supporting coal workers and their communities as they prepare for new jobs and opportunities, just as Canada is doing at home.Quotes""The Powering Past Coal Alliance is making a significant difference in accelerating the global shift away from the most polluting form of power generation and doing so in a way that takes into account the legitimate economic concerns of citizens.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada21","Wilkinson says carbon price hikes won't be decided until 2022","December 4, 2019 Wednesday","Red Deer Advocate","GATINEAU, Que. - The federal Liberals will not make a decision about hiking the carbon price beyond $50 a tonne for at least another two years, Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson says.Wilkinson said his first priority in the new Parliament will be figuring out how Canada is going to meet its target for cutting greenhouse gas emissions made four years ago as part of the Paris climate change agreement. in November 2020.Wilkinson said the forthcoming plan will lean heavily on developing clean technology to reduce the emissions from oil and gas production, and manufacturing industries.But at the moment, Wilkinson is signalling that hiking the carbon price won't be part of the plan.That price, which is at $20 a tonne now, is to be reviewed after it hits $50 a tonne in 2022. Wilkinson said Wednesday that he is not going to ""prejudge"" the outcome of that review.""We committed to review carbon pricing as we approach 2022, we plan to do that for sure,"" he said. ""It's part of the plan, but I would say to you carbon pricing is not the only tool in the tool box. We're going to use a whole range of them to achieve this in a way that is acceptable and works for Canada.""Last week, Canada's Ecofiscal Commission issued a report saying Canada can hit its emission targets if the carbon price quadrupled to $210 a tonne by 2030, calling it the most economically efficient way to get there. The report said regulations, such as forcing cleaner burning fuels, or subsidies, such as helping Canadians buy electric cars, cost a lot more and are often less clear to people than the carbon price.Wilkinson said he appreciated the Ecofiscal report, but noted it comes from a purely economic efficiency perspective, and the government has to take more things into consideration.""Our view has been that the pricing of pollution is part of a robust climate plan, but it is not a climate plan in and of itself,"" he said.In 2015, the new Liberal government was just weeks old when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau went to Paris and promised that by 2030 Canada would cut emissions to 70 per cent of what they were in 2005. It was the same target set earlier that year by the former Conservative government, and in the years since has been heavily criticized by political opponents and climate experts alike for not going nearly far enough.The government's current climate policies, including phasing out coal power, the carbon price and encouraging more energy-efficient buildings, leave Canada 79 million tonnes shy of its 2030 goal to reduce emissions to no more than 511 million tonnes.Wilkinson isn't speculating how Canada will close that gap, nor will he suggest how much further Canada can realistically go. In 2018, a UN climate report suggested the world has to cut emissions almost in half by 2030 - far more than any country is doing now - to avoid catastrophe.""I am not going to get ahead of myself and say exactly how far I think we can get,"" Wilkinson said.Next week, Wilkinson is heading to Madrid for this year's UN climate conference where he said he intends to push other countries to join Canada and work on tougher targets before the 2020 meeting.The meeting, known as the 25th Conference of the Parties, or COP25 for short, will also try to finalize rules for how some countries can get credit for helping cut emissions in another country. Wilkinson said emissions trading systems are an element of a global plan, but cautioned against it being seen as a way for Canada to just buy its way out of a problem and not do much to reduce emissions in our own backyard.""Countries all have to recognize that the bulk of the work that you do has to be done on reducing domestic emissions,"" Wilkinson said. ""It can't be you're simply going to use some emissions trading system. It cannot be a get-out-of-jail-free card.""This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 4, 2019.Mia Rabson, The Canadian Press\l"

Yet they had to postpone key decisions until they all meet again in Glasgow next year.I remain puzzled that all those COP 25 experts cannot agree after so many meetings, an email buddy gets very upset with me for forwarding a meme and a YouTube video both gently mocking Greta Thunberg and her youthful followers. My buddy is nobody's fool and had a fine career in the media, but went ballistic accusing me of being a climate change denier, disseminating lies, and worse. He's not the first to accuse me, apparently because I refuse to sign on to the hysteria and extinction positions that many young advocates loudly put forth.Responding immediately, I assured him that I'm fully aware of climate change, but have put my faith in brilliant young people around the world who work in companies that will eventually find necessary solutions.Having always believed that education is the key to just about everything else in life, I'm betting the solutions will be found sooner rather than later. Simultaneously, I lack faith in those who quit learning by dropping out of school to protest against climate change around the world. Furthermore, all the noisy finger-pointing, pouting, play-acting, etc., will not solve the fate of those young children in countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo who labour under Dickensian conditions to mine cobalt and other minerals.These materials are used extensively in batteries for cellphones, computers and all manner of gadgets that every kid seems to have, and in the batteries of the electric cars they are so keen to drive in. Yet nobody questions the brutal conditions surrounding production of these vital minerals.Bernie SmithParksville\l"
"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada27","Kathryn Harrison: About all those acronyms at a climate conference","December 2, 2019 Monday","Postmedia Breaking News","MADRID - I have researched comparative climate policy in Canada, the U.S. and other countries for the last 15 years. However, because I don't focus on negotiation of international climate treaties, I've never attended one of the big international climate negotiations-until now.What does a professor do in advance of a new conference? Homework! International negotiators navigate a very complex legal and procedural framework with the help of a lot of acroynyms( HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-convention/glossary-of-climate-change-acronyms-and-termshttps://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-convention/glossary-of-climate-change-acronyms-and-terms ).Here are some of the most important acronyms for those who want to follow along with my posts from Madrid this week.COP refers to the ""Conferences of the Parties"" (meaning countries) that have ratified the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (also known as the UNFCCC - the acronyms come fast and furious). The parties have met annually since the convention took effect, with the year denoted by the number after ""COP."" The biggies have included COP-3 in Kyoto in 1997, where the Kyoto Protocol was negotiated, and COP-21 in Paris in 2015, which yielded the Paris Agreement. We're now at COP-25, which takes place for the next two weeks.In ratifying the Paris Agreement, which is akin to an appendix to the UNFCCC, 196 countries committed to work together to limit global warming to ""well below"" 2\'baC and ideally 1\'baC. Since then, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, yet another acronym) produced a major report in 2018 that underscored the severe impacts that can be expected at 1.5\'baC of global warming, let alone 2\'baC.NDCsThe Paris Agreement process is that individual countries set targets, called nationally determined contributions (NDCs), to reduce their territorial emissions by a particular date. Two features of this approach warrant elaboration.First, it's a bottom-up process. Countries set their own targets and devise their own policies to meet them. However, in doing so together, they're reassuring each other that no one's effort will be wasted, while also minimizing impacts on economic competitiveness.Second, it's an iterative process. Rather than trying to fix climate change in one fell swoop with a distant target that invites procrastination, signatories to the Paris Agreement committed not just to initial NDCs, but also to a process by which they'll ""take stock"" and report back to each other on their progress every five years (the Global Stock Take or GST). The intention is to ratchet up collective ambition via new NDCs two years later.That ratcheting process is critical because the current NDCs are only enough to limit global warming to between 3 and 3.5\'baC. Much greater ambition is needed to avoid devastating impacts on planetary ecosystems and human well-being. Canada's current NDC, adopted in 2015, is to reduce our emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. Not only do we need to strengthen our existing policies to meet that target, but we and other countries will need to up our game in 2020, the first five-yearly NDC update, if we are serious about limiting global warming to 2\'baC or less. COP25 this year is an important opportunity for countries, including Canada, to signal that they will announce more ambitious NDCs next year.AOSISThere are lots of groupings of countries with similar economic and/or environmental circumstances. Canada has traditionally negotiated with a group of carbon-intensive countries, including Australia and (until recent years) the U.S., at times joined by oil- and gas-producing post-Soviet states.In contrast, AOSIS is the Alliance of Small Island States, which are especially vulnerable to rising sea levels caused by climate change. At the limit, entire countries could be submerged.LDCsLDCs are the 47 least developed countries as defined by the UN. The 780 million people in those countries produce just over half of the annual carbon emissions of 35 million Canadians. Put another way, the average Canadian surpasses the annual emissions of an average resident of the LDCs in just 11 days. Yet through a combination of unlucky geography and limited financial resources to adapt to a warming climate - annual GDP per person in the LDCs averages roughly $3,000 compared to Canada's $43,000-they are already suffering most from extreme heat, storms, flooding and declining crop yields in countries where hunger is already commonplace. How much worse it gets depends on how quickly we return to net-zero global emissions.CBDR-RCThis one stands for common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, a fundamental principle established by the UNFCCC treaty. It recognizes that countries that have contributed the most to the climate crisis and/or that have the greatest capacity to contribute to its solution have a disproportionate responsibility to take more ambitious actions to reduce their emissions, as well as to provide financial assistance to those most vulnerable.The stakes posed by the climate crisis are immense for all countries. By virtue of our northern location Canada will continue to experience double the global average temperature increase. Yet the extreme vulnerability of LDCs and AOSIS states, which have contributed almost nothing to the problem yet will suffer the most, is a stark reminder of our responsibility as one of the countries with the highest carbon footprints and highest per capita incomes in the world.Kathryn Harrison is a political science professor at UBC specializing in environmental and climate change policy.

The 60-foot tall, 30-foot wide (18-by-9 meter) mural was revealed hours after Thunberg announced on Twitter that she would be leaving the United States by boat on Wednesday, headed for a United Nations climate change conferenceThe teenager rejects air travel because of its high levels of greenhouse gas emissions.Argentine street artist Andres Petreselli, who signs his work Cobre, says the portrait of Thunberg, 16, was unusual because he typically does not address politics, religion or sports. ""But, this one is ... I feel connected with the politics behind (it) because I think it is real and if I have to compare it with the rest of my murals, this is the most political one that I ever made,"" the 32-year-old said as he sat on a roof with the mural behind him.Petreselli previously painted a since-demolished mural of the late actor Robin Williams in San Francisco.Paul Scott, the executive director of OneAtmosphere.org, the San Francisco nonprofit that funded the work, said he hoped passers-by would be ""touched"" by the image of Thunberg, who has mobilized a global youth movement against climate change.""We are really just hoping that it stops and makes them think, that this will amplify Greta's message, that people will start to understand the clear call for action that she is sending out,"" Scott said.Thunberg has spent the last three months in North America after arriving in New York City by boat on Aug. 28, delivering a speech at a United Nations climate summit there in September.In her Twitter post on Tuesday she said she would set sail from Virginia in the morning on a 48-foot catamaran whose owners have offered her a ride across the Atlantic.

Either that or he is so obsessed with his green image he doesn't care. After rejection by two-thirds of voters, with support from less than 22 per cent of the total electorate and only four out of 62 seats in the Prairie provinces, Trudeau is downplaying regional ""frustrations,"" saying they do not amount to a national unity crisis.As if to flaunt his indifference, Trudeau reaffirmed Liberal hostility to resource development with two fateful decisions, both of which - paradoxically - undermine his avowed mission to combat climate change. The first relates to the government's stance at the failed UN Conference on Climate Change (COP25) in Madrid and the second, its commitment to adopt the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).As I recently wrote, selling Canadian oil and gas to Asia will reduce net global emissions by enabling importing countries to decrease their use of higher-emitting coal. Canada can be a big contributor to the international climate effort by exporting oil and gas or it can concentrate on domestic emissions and penalize its economy.Minister of the Environment and Climate Change Jonathan Wilkinson graciously declared ""I'm not saying liquid natural gas (LNG) in the future can't be part of an overall structure"" before adding the killer: ""but the focus of the climate plan is on reducing our own domestic emissions.""Follow his self-defeating reasoning: the government will concentrate on achieving its Paris accord commitments even if doing so precludes reducing worldwide emissions. Because in the end the only number that counts is total global emissions, this approach prioritizes bragging rights over a looming threat to humanity. The Liberal scorecard evidently is more important than whether the planet fries.Those who oppose sharing carbon reduction credits worry about the possibility of double counting but that technical problem is easily resolved. China quite understandably wants to hoard the credit for reducing its own domestic emissions. But why would the Canadian government support a process that disadvantages its own energy industry for no net environmental advantage? Wilkinson's approach should be politically toxic for the Liberal government. The reason it is not pervades the discussion of an alleged climate change crisis: facts and rationality about a technical subject are no match for the stultifying conformity of the environmental bandwagon and its intolerance of dissent.As for UNDRIP, federal Justice Minister and Attorney General David Lametti promised it would be adopted into law in 2020, against the opposition of his predecessor, Jody Wilson-Raybould.Much of what the declaration says about the rights of Indigenous peoples and historical wrongs is laudable. But the requirement for ""free, prior and informed consent"" for resource project approval will create significant uncertainty both for Aboriginal peoples and for Canadians overall (as Dale Swampy, president of the National Coalition of Chiefs, recently argued on this page).Public commentary and the courts respond almost exclusively to Aboriginal people opposed to resource projects. Yet for many Indigenous communities resource development is a transformative opportunity to create jobs, long-term revenue and lasting economic partnerships. Most First Nations support pipel"

Strict rules that prevent double counting, prohibit carry forward of questionable Kyoto Protocol credits, and ensure that projects eligible for credit surpass business-as-usual performance could reinforce the ambition of the Paris Agreement.Rules that fall short of those goals could gut the treaty, leaving only the pretence of emissions reductions.What's at stake for Canada with the emissions trading rules in Article 6 of the Paris Agreement?Canada is among the countries pushing for integrity of emissions trading and protection of human rights in the current negotiations. However, with relatively high-cost emissions reductions, Canada, like other wealthy countries, is expected to be a purchaser of lower-cost reductions from developing countries. That creates contrary incentives to resist some proposals that would increase prices for emissions credits - for instance, setting aside a more generous ""share of proceeds"" for adaptation in developing countries under both Articles 6.2 and 6.4 of the treaty.It's noteworthy that Canada is already engaged in emissions trading. The Quebec and California cap-and-trade programs have been linked since 2014. Canada is counting on credits purchased from California for roughly 20 per cent of the reductions projected to be achieved by 2030. However, the U.S.'s scheduled withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in November 2020 would render those credits ineligible. U.S. withdrawal would almost certainly be reversed if a Democrat wins the 2020 presidential election, but for now that remains a big uncertainty for Canada's climate plan.RelatedWhy all the fuss about Article 6 at COP-25?( HYPERLINK https://vancouversun.com/opinion/op-ed/kathryn-harrison-why-all-the-fuss-about-article-6-at-cop-25https://vancouversun.com/opinion/op-ed/kathryn-harrison-why-all-the-fuss-about-article-6-at- HYPERLINK https://vancouversun.com/opinion/op-ed/kathryn-harrison-why-all-the-fuss-about-article-6-at-cop-25cop-25 )About all those acronyms at a climate conference( HYPERLINK https://vancouversun.com/opinion/op-ed/kathryn-harrison-about-all-those-acronyms-at-a-climate-conferencehttps://vancouversun.com/opinion/op-ed/kathryn-harrison-about-all-those-acronyms-at-a-climate-conference )Another issue concerns the potential for Canada to earn international credits by exporting liquefied natural gas (LNG). The Conservative Party has argued that Canada should be able to claim international credits for LNG exports on the grounds that natural gas will replace coal in destination countries, thus reducing global emissions. Canada is doing the world a favour and should get credit for that, or so the argument goes.There's lots to debate here, starting with the assumption of global emissions reductions. Canada's LNG may replace coal, but it could also replace renewables and thus increase global emissions. In any case, it's just not how the climate treaty works. Each country is responsible for the emissions released within its own borders. It follows that any reduction flowing from a shift to lower-carbon fuels would be ""owned"" by the country in which those fuels are burned.Canada may be able to purchase credits from those or other countries to offset the significant increase in our own emissions to produce and liquefy natural gas. But let's be clear: We would be paying, not getting paid.We've been hearing a lot recently about decl"

Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa said in a statement.""We are currently exploring alternative hosting options,"" she added.The so-called Conference of the Parties (COP) is the formal meeting of parties to the United Nations' Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). They are usually held annually and the first one was held in 1995. in 2018, citing fiscal and budgetary constraints.A UNFCCC spokesman said the aim was to keep the conference in December but that might not be possible with just over a month to go and many venues booked.Germany's environment secretary, Jochen Flasbarth, tweeted that his government was in contact with Poland, which currently holds the COP presidency.A spokesman at Poland's environment ministry said: ""It is too early to say now in what direction it will go.""According to the UNFCCC website, the COP meets in Bonn, Germany, the seat of the secretariat, unless a party offers to host.As the presidency of the COP rotates among Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, Central and Eastern Europe and Western Europe there is a tendency for the venue of the COP to also shift among these groups.Last year, the conference was held in Poland and the year before that in Bonn, on behalf of host Fiji.At the end of 2020, it is scheduled to be held in Glasgow, Scotland.

""To be witnessing or participating in those conversations, especially the conversations that I had heard lots about before, that was really unique.""Sanderson was one of six young people sent to the conference by Students on Ice, an Ottawa-based agency that organizes youth expeditions to the polar regions.Sanderson took part in a trip to Antarctica in 2014 and was selected from among interested alumni to go to Madrid for the climate conference.While there, he and some of the other Canadians helped smaller countries keep track of the various discussions.Sanderson helped the delegation from Seychelles by sitting in on workshops and discussions and taking notes for the island nation off the coast of Africa that faces a bleak future as sea levels rise.""It was interesting to get an entirely new perspective to climate change. In Canada we experience it very differently than in other countries in the world,"" said Sanderson, who is in the third year of a double major in mechanical engineering and business administration at Western University.""It seems very isolating having all these different climate impacts. In Canada, obviously, we have a lot of ice melting, but in other places sea level rise and changing weather affects people very differently. That perspective of seeing all these different countries at the UN, more than anything, just showed me the vastness of the impacts of climate change.""Even though it doesn't affect everyone the same, it still affects everybody in some shape or form.""The highlight of the trip was the opportunity to meet other youth delegates from around the world, Sanderson said.While much of the discussion was taking place at a high diplomatic level, both delegates could look to each other for inspiration, he said.""It can be very difficult because sometimes you don't feel you have the experience or the knowledge to speak on every issue,"" Sanderson said.""It was neat to be in a room with all these other passionate people who are using their voice to try to make change for their communities."" !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2019 Osprey Media Group Inc.

The meeting was set to draw climate activists from all over the world - including Greta Thunberg, who had already sailed across the Atlantic in September.

I know that we will do everything we can that this is something that cannot be ignored anymore.""While next year's COP26 is seen as more important because, under the Paris deal, more ambitious targets must be presented in the fight against global warming, Thunberg stressed that every opportunity to discuss how to fight climate change must be taken.Thunberg had arrived by train in Madrid, tweeting that it was ""great to be in Spain.""The 16-year-old had to remain on the train for about 15 minutes due to a large crowd gathered at Madrid's Chamartin Station.This week, Thunberg arrived in Lisbon after a three-week voyage across the Atlantic en route to the Madrid conference.

Other possible host sites include major U.N. venues in New York, Geneva, Vienna, Bonn or Nairobi, Kenya.The COP25 conference aims to work out some of the remaining unresolved rules for countries on climate efforts, smoothing the way for a bigger climate effort at the 2020 summit to encourage countries to increase commitments to cutting their climate-changing emissions.Speaking Thursday in Santiago de Chile, Pi\'f1era called S\'e1nchez's offer ""generous"" said it would allow climate experts to put together ""all the progress that had been achieved.""___ Frank Jordans in Berlin and Eva Vergara in Santiago, Chile, contributed to this report.___Follow AP's full coverage of climate change issues at HYPERLINK https://www.apnews.com/Climatehttps://www.apnews.com/Climate\l"
"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada46","Kathryn Harrison: Hope for the future thanks to kids at climate change conference","December 12, 2019 Thursday","Postmedia Breaking News","MADRID - As COP25 in Madrid draws to a close, I'm reflecting on my first time attending the international climate negotiations.There's a popular narrative that international climate meetings are just a pretense for thousands to jaunt off to exotic locales. To imply that COP is a vacation could not be further from what I witnessed: deeply-committed public servants, academics, and activists working long hours-sometimes through the night-in windowless rooms in a generic conference centre.COP offers a strange juxtaposition of highly technical debates and intense emotion.As negotiations proceed over ""share of proceeds"" from emissions trading for adaptation and financial support from wealthy countries for ""loss and damages"" in developing countries, reminders of the devastation climate change is already causing are ever-present. A young delegate from the Philippines spoke of how her activism was prompted by the devastation in her country from Typhoon Haiyan. Near the entrance to the conference centre, there is a continuous slide show of heartbreaking stories of climate change impacts. I stood transfixed by the story of a Bangladeshi family who lost their mother in a flood when one of her sons swimming with her let go of her hand to grab the bag containing the family's only money.As negotiations continue over a contentious clause to recognize human rights in the emissions trading rulebook, members of Indigenous communities from around the world, including Canada, shared experiences of displacement from traditional lands and livelihoods through deforestation and fossil fuel development. Marshall Islanders, whose entire country lies less than two metres above sea level, shared their fears of total loss of their country and culture.As countries debate long-term plans for ""net zero"" emissions, unions representing workers dependent on the fossil fuel industry remind negotiators of the need not just for transition, but for a just transition in which vulnerable workers and communities are supported.And the kids! At their core, climate negotiations are all about securing a sustainable future, so it's only fitting that voices of children and youth were prominent at COP25. I attended panels where children as young as 11 spoke with remarkable poise, knowledge, and passion. When asked how their lives will be different from their parents, a young Chilean activist responded, ""We need to decide whether to have children."" I struggled to hold back tears. I doubt I was the only one.I reviewed the latest drafts of the rulebook for Article 6, the emissions trading regime under the Paris Agreement, to the sounds of children's voices across the hall chanting for ""Climate Justice Now.""Greta Thunberg's arrival was met with a phalanx of photographers at the Madrid train station. It's fitting that Thunberg has been recognized as Time magazine's person of the year for launching a global youth movement. Yet that movement has demonstrated that the world is full of Gretas-clear-eyed and deeply frightened for their futures.They are not alone. In the question period following a panel in which experts presented highly technical integrated assessment models of carbon pricing, a young woman asked how they could even talk about markets and economic growth when we're in the middle of a crisis. One of the panelists responded, ""We may look calm, but we're all frightened. That's why we're doing this work.""Which brings me to hope. Since returning from COP I've thought a lot about the distinction the author Rebecca Solnit draws between optimism and hope. Optimism is confidence that everything will be alright. I know that global emissions, and Canada's, are still increasing. Having witnessed the gap that remains in international negotiations over fundamental issues, including level of ambition and climate finance for developing countries, I cannot say I'm optimistic.Hope, in contrast, is a belief that things could be better. I choose to remain hopeful. As long as those kids are chanting and governments are still negotiating, there's still the possibility that we can turn this around. If adults are listening to their children and demand meaningful action from the politicians they elect, there's still hope.Kathryn Harrison is a political science professor at UBC specializing in environmental and climate change policy.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada47","Fear of nuclear power can be more deadly than nuclear accidents themselves","January 14, 2020 Tuesday","thestar.com","Like many Ontarians, I was woken on Sunday morning to an emergency alert of an ""incident"" at the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station. Within a few hours, we learned that the alert was sent in error and there had been no incident.However, the real harm of stoking fear of nuclear power had already been done. Like everything else, generating nuclear power entails risk, but the fear of nuclear power can be more deadly than nuclear accidents themselves.The human brain is not naturally adept at comparing risks in the modern world, but data-based studies helps us make the right decisions.As an example, many people have a fear of flying, but most people know that flying across Canada is safer than driving the same distance, so they overcome their fears and board the airplane.Similarly, many have a visceral fear of radiation. But in the case of power generation, it is tragic that decisions are often driven by this fear instead of a dispassionate data-based comparison of risks.The 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident is a case in point. Triggered by a massive 9.1 magnitude earthquake, a tsunami swept across the eastern coast of Japan's northern islands, flooding the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant causing multiple reactor meltdowns. One workman died directly from radiation exposure and estimates of further deaths range up to 130 deaths due to increased incidents of cancer.Within 14 months of the accident, Japan shut down all nuclear power production and increased imports of fossil fuels, resulting in sharply higher energy prices. A recent paper by researchers at Columbia University, Nagoya City University and the University of Verona studies changes in mortality during cold weather periods in Japan's 21 largest cities due to the rise in energy prices.By comparing regions that relied more heavily on nuclear power prior to the accident with regions that relied more on other sources of energy, the researchers estimated a total increase of 1,280 cold-weather related deaths in these cities between 2011 and 2014. In other words, over four years, the shut down of nuclear power plants was 10 times as deadly as the highest estimate of deaths due to the accident itself.The story is even worse when considering alternatives to nuclear power. After the Fukushima accident, Germany shut down roughly half its nuclear production capacity, replacing it with coal and increased electricity imports. A study from the University of California and Carnegie Mellon University examined hourly data on power plant operations to estimate the increase in sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter and the resultant increase in mortality. The researchers estimate an ongoing additional 1,100 deaths per year due to the increased pollution.Of course, this is not to dismiss the actual risk of nuclear power. The 1984 Chernobyl disaster in the Soviet Union demonstrates the danger of a poorly designed nuclear power plant. The long-term death toll is disputed, but the United Nations estimates a total of 4,000 deaths as a result of the Chernobyl meltdown. At the high end, Greenpeace estimates mortality totalling between 93,000 and 200,000.But even at the very highest estimates, this death toll from the world's worst ever nuclear accident pales in comparison to the deaths caused by pollutants from coal plants. A Mumbai-based think tank estimates more than 100,000 deaths per year in India, including 10,000 children under the age of five, caused by pollutants that could be avoided with a switch from coal to non-polluting nuclear power.Of course, continued progress must be made to improve the safety and reduce the cost of nuclear power, and such efforts are underway. But even with current technology, nuclear power is far less damaging to humans than many alternatives.Both the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, co-winner of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, and the United Nations Climate Change Conference recommend nuclear power as part of the solution to climate change. For the sake of our health and prosperity, and for the sake of our planet, it is vital that the emotional fear of nuclear power gives way to more responsible decision making.David Goldreich is a professor of finance at the Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto.\l"

""For me, it is not enough to declare a climate emergency,"" Mohammed Chahim, the S&;D's leading lawmaker on the parliament's resolution ahead of the U.N. summit, told Reuters, drawing the parallel to a house being on fire.""This resolution to the COP25 is the water to put out the fire,"" Chahim said, adding: ""It is a message to the world: we do not only want to be leaders, we are (also) taking the right measures.""Other political groups backing the S&;D proposal included the Greens, the centrist Renew and the left-wing GUE, and it was expected to pass with support from independent lawmakers.The parliament has repeatedly pressed the European Commission to take a stronger stance on climate change.The new president of the executive Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has said combating climate change will be among her top priorities and has set out a ""European Green Deal"" intended to achieve ""climate neutrality"" - or adding no greenhouse gases to the atmosphere beyond what can be absorbed - by 2050.Current targets aim to cut the EU's greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030 from 1990 levels. Von der Leyen hopes to raise the goal to at least 50%.All but three of the EU's 28 member states have signed up to this objective, but objections from Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic prevented the bloc promoting its stance at a U.N. climate action summit in September.Several countries, regions and organizations have symbolically declared a ""climate emergency"" to emphasize the urgency of the issue.

""People often overlook noise pollution in a city where air quality has always been the main concern.""Santiago, a city of 5.6 million people, has positioned itself as a global leader in the use of electric buses, as the South American nation pushes forward with ambitious plans to adopt cleaner energy and cut emissions from public transport.With 386 electric buses, accounting for 6 per cent of the city's fleet, Santiago has by far the largest fleet outside of global front-runner China, according to the World Resources Institute, a U.S.-based think-tank.Worldwide, cities account for about three-quarters of carbon emissions and consume more than two-thirds of energy, meaning their success or failure in cutting emissions will have a big impact on whether global warming stays within agreed limits.Chile will be keen to highlight Santiago's use of electric buses when the city hosts this year's UN climate conference () in December.In June, the government unveiled a more ambitious climate action plan that included targets to shut all coal power plants by 2040 and become a carbon-neutral economy by 2050, in l"

They're the stuff of wonky technocrats, hardly inspiring transformative change. For almost 30 years, Canadian governments have promised to reduce carbon pollution, mostly from the burning of coal, oil and gas. And they've done a miserable job at it.I was born in 1991. For my entire life, governments have been setting climate targets and failing to meet them. At the first , the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, Canada promised emissions cuts to 1990 levels by the year 2000. Instead, we increased pollution by 19 per cent. Under the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, we said we would drop emissions to six per cent below our previous target by 2012. Then we grew our total by another 3.5 per cent.In Copenhagen in 2009, Canada set a new target to reduce carbon emissions by 17 per cent below 2005 levels by 2020. As of 2017, we've reduced them just two per cent. Finally, in the Paris Agreement in 2015, we proudly announced we would cut pollution by 30 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030. We're currently on track to miss that target, with just a 12.5-per-cent decrease.Targets are supposed to hold the government of the day accountable, but do they? Has there been any real accountability for the three decades we've dithered while the world has warmed and communities worldwide have suffered from floods, fires, storms, drought, disease and conflict? Our targets don't even go far enough.Globally, they amount to more than double the temperature rise scientists consider safe.At the end of the day, there's only one target that ultimately matters - zero. Our best scientists tell us we need to eliminate carbon pollution by 2050 in order to stabilize the global climate at safe levels. On a global scale, that means drawing as much or more carbon down from the atmosphere as we put into it.Our leaders need to detail when and how we will reach this post-carbon economy. Planning to switch from coal power to fracked gas and reduce per-barrel emissions from the tarsands while only expanding fossil-fuel exports just isn't going to cut it.Here's the good news - life can get better as we build this new economy. There's a tremendous amount of work to be done and well-paying hard-hat union jobs to do it. We need to retrofit every building in the country, change the way we manage our forests and farms, unleash affordable public transit just about everywhere and build renewable energy from coast-to-coast-to-coast.Approving one last liquefied natural gas plant or tarsands mine on the false hope that we might squeeze it into our deeply inadequate targets is downright irresponsible. Oil and gas is already Canada's single most polluting sector and the only one continuing to grow its emissions.New fossil-fuel projects cannot help us get to a post-carbon economy just like light cigarettes don't help anyone quit smoking.I'm from Calgary. I've got plenty of friends and family working in oil and gas. But they can see the writing on the wall as well as anyone. Albertans know the world is changing, they just want to know we have a place in this new economy that's emerging.Canada can and must bring workers and their communities along just as we've done for the coal sector in Alberta. Offer free education and retraining to anybody under 50 and early retirement to the rest. Any decarbonization plan must start there.Canada will reach a post-carbon economy, the only question is when. And the sooner we get started, the easier, cheaper and fairer it will be. Peter McCartney is the climate campaigner for the Wilderness Committee.\l"

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada55","Paris won't fix the 'climate crisis'","November 15, 2019 Friday","National Post (f/k/a The Financial Post) (Canada)","Preparations are underway for COP25, a global climate conference of thousands of politicians and observers that opens Dec. 2 in Madrid. It originally was going to be hosted by Chile but that got changed because of riots sparked by hikes in transit fares and electricity prices - of which there will be many more if COP25 participants have their way.One COP25The media says it was to reduce global CO2 emissions. But that's not what the agreement says or does. It does not require any country to reduce its emissions.Some of the planet's largest emitters have said they will increase theirs - not just a little, but a lot. China, the world's largest emitter, accounts for 29 per cent of global CO2. India, with its for now less developed economy, is responsible for another seven per cent.Yet both countries project increased emissions without any numerical limit. Even if all 195 nations that signed the Paris Agreement do what they have said they will do, the net effect will be no significant reduction in CO2 emissions. The disconnect between what Paris is supposed to do and what nations have said they will do is glaring.The current panic over the ""climate crisis"" makes it politically necessary for most governments to respond with dramatic displays of determination to ""fight climate change."" Unfortunately, as Nobel Prize-winning economist William Nordhaus has written: ""The reality is that most countries are on a business-as-usual trajectory of minimal policies to reduce their emissions ... The international target for climate change with a limit of 2\'b0C appears to be infeasible with reasonably accessible technologies even with very ambitious abatement strategies.""Meeting the UN's global emissions reduction target for 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 are not practically possible. The only safe political path between the panic and the possible is to pretend to do the impossible - which is the real purpose of the Paris Agreement.Already, after just four years, only 17 of 195 countries are on track to their targets.If every country met its stated 2030 goals, how close would the planet come to the year 2100 target of 1.5\'b0C maximum warming? Not close. According to economist Bjorn Lomborg, the reduction in warming would be less than five per cent of 1\'b0C. Even if nations stay on track all the way to 2100, that gets you only 13 per cent of the 1.5 \'b0C target.In addition to targeting CO2 emissions, the Paris Agreement aims to transfer wealth. Developed countries have agreed to transfer $100 billion annually to developing countries, starting in 2020, to help them reduce emissions. The U.S., which had been expected to pay about $45 billion annually, recently announced it is quitting the agreement. With the U.S. out, this key part of the agreement will probably fail.Getting the entire planet completely off fossil fuels by 2050 would require a complete global energy overhaul from the current mix of 80 per cent fossil fuels and only 1.3 per cent wind and solar. That is highly unlikely. As Canadian energy expert Vaclav Smil has put it: ""As in the past, the unfolding global energy transitions will last for decades, not years, and modern civilization's dependence on fossil fuels will not be shed by a sequence of government-dictated goals.""Greta Thunberg and other eco-celebrities and protesters focus on the wrong political leaders. The developed countries account for about a third of global CO2 emissions, the developing countries two thirds. China, not Sweden or the U.S., is where most new emissions come from. Yet no one is allowed to protest in front of the Chinese legislature in Tiananmen Square against China's massive new coal plants.Human-caused climate change can only be controlled through universal global action. Every country should do its part, but how much is our part and, for that matter, what is the whole? Without knowing we cannot rationally determine what our part should be. And, with most other countries not doing enough, should we be the exception and do more, or should we also do less? If the planet's capacity for additional CO2 emissions is limited and needs to be rationed, how do we do this, who does it and by when? Blocking traffic or taking a day off school to carry placards provides drama but not answers.Over the past century or two, voters have judged governments on their success in raising overall well-being. A sudden transition off fossil fuels would drastically reduce living standards. Painfully high carbon taxes and big increases in other taxes would be needed to fund massive new energy infrastructure. Are we really willing to do this, for no net global effect, while China and others massively increase their emissions? If not, we need to stop pretending the Paris Agreement will fix the ""climate crisis.""Andrew Roman is a retired litigation lawyer with experience in environmental, electricity, energy and constitutional issues. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

The Canadian Arctic has been hit even harder, with a 2.3 C increase.

""In South America, the equivalent non-forest woodlands have been largely converted to soybean agriculture already, but in Africa they are largely untransformed.""Savanna fires release carbon dioxide, but within a year the grass regrows, sucking much of the carbon out of the atmosphere again. The fires may push toward the forests but are mostly snuffed out at that border, Archibald said, unless trees are cut down, making tropical forests more vulnerable. When a tropical forest is burned, the trees die and the carbon dioxide goes up and doesn't return to the system quickly.""The main message is: yes we have a lot of fire, but it's not bad and can be very good for the ecology,"" she said. ""We don't know how many deforestation fires we have but the best evidence is that our forests are not decreasing, they are, in fact, increasing.""Most deforestation occurred in West Africa in the 19th century, Archibald said, adding that Cameroon and Gabon show increased forestation.However, ecosystems such as the Miombo Woodlands, which covers 10 per cent of the continent over nine countries, do need to be managed. These woodlands push up against forests and, because of an increase in population, more people are planting crops along the edges.The Miombo Network, an advisory and sustainability group that Archibald is a member of, is working with the World Bank and policy-makers to make sure there is proper fire management in these areas, she said.NASA research scientist Niels Andela also said that savannah fires have shaped Africa's landscape for thousands of years.""Fires are therefore often a critical component of these ecosystems and are not perceived as harmful by local communities,"" he said. ""Indeed, fires are often used for agricultural purposes, for example to keep the landscape open to support livestock, as well as sometimes as part of shifting cultivation.""Andela said deforestation isn't occurring on the same scale as in South America.""In part that may be simply due to limitations of existing infrastructure and lack of access to global markets, processes that drive large-scale agricultural expansion elsewhere,"" he said. ""It is therefore certainly a possibility that this may change in future.""Tosi Mpanu Mpanu, former chief negotiator for the Africa Zone at the 2015 United Nations climate change conference, said agricultural practices known as ""slash and burn"" need to be better managed, citing the over 3,000 fires in Congo.""It is a great threat to our forests,"" he said of the technique used by farmers in Congo and elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa. ""You need a global ambitious program or you train people to use other practices for people to go into intensive agriculture. You have to organize these small farmers by giving them fertilizer, seeds.""The European Space Agency estimates 25-35 per cent of climate-changing greenhouse gas emissions come from so-called biomass burning, which includes fires that are intentionally set to clear land for agriculture.Most of the fires are 100 hectares (247.1 acres) or smaller in size.Other areas with extensive biomass burning are Australia, South America and southeast Asia.Globally, the amount of area burned decl"

There are few medical centres and almost no companies or major employers. The news that comes from the area is almost always related to drug trafficking, delinquency and violence.The poverty rate - at about 42 per cent of the 177,000 inhabitants - is far above the national 17 per cent average, a legacy of the area receiving poor families displaced from other richer parts of the capital during the 1973-1990 military dictatorship.""The people of La Pintana have been treated harshly by the state, with no services, no health facilities, no education.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada64","Interview with Environment Minister","December 16, 2019 Monday","CTV NEWS CHANNEL Television, Inc. POWER PLAY WITH DON MARTIN 17:00:00 ET","DON MARTIN: Welcome back. Well, after a couple of weeks, a stalemate in Madrid at the annual climate conference of UN member countries, no new rules were approved even as the planet continues to heat up at a rate faster than many scientists predicted. Let's look for tangible moves in the final results from a minister who was there. Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson joins me from Vancouver. Minister, the way I read it, the status quo was more or less preserved, nothing more ambitious was agreed to. Is that the way you're reading it?JONATHAN WILKINSON (Environment Minister): Well the focus of this Cop, Cop25, was really around article 6, which is around emissions trading. I think one of the positive things coming out of this conference was the commitment on the part of participants to increase their level of ambition for Cop26, which is the Cop at which folks are supposed to come forward with enhanced targets, and so that was the positive element of Cop25. I would say the slightly more disappointing part of Cop25 was the ability to get fully to an agreement on article 26 that would enable strong rules for emissions rating. There was progress made, but we didn't get all the way there. I think we took the position, I was pretty public about this, that we wanted good rules that had integrity, that ensured transparency, there would be no double counting, that missions reductions would be real emissions reductions, and if we weren't able to get there then we wouldn't support weak rules. And at the end of the day we weren't quite able to get there, but I expect we will next year.MARTIN: All right. So when you go to Cop26, are you going to bring more ambitious targets to the table than the Stephen Harper targets that were set almost ten years ago?WILKINSON: Well, I mean first of all, the Stephen Harper targets that were set ten years ago would have been nice if the government of the day had actually started to put in place a climate plan that actually addressed emissions. The farther that you get from the date at which you've accepted the target, the more challenging it becomes obviously. But what we have said, and what was in my mandate letter from the prime minister, is that our focus is on exceeding the 2030 targets that were established some years ago. We have identified through the Canadian climate plan over 200 megatonnes in reductions. We had a number of elements in the platform that spoke to more, but we have a ways to go to get to our target and the focus is on exceeding, and that is primarily the job that I'm going to be working on over the coming few months.MARTIN: As you're more aware than perhaps anyone, we're, what, two percent of global emissions. And the way I was looking at this, the conference ended with a promise to hold another series of roundtables, and I'm curious, isn't it pretty frustrating for you that the key result from one meeting is to hold more meetings. It just seems like the globe is turning their back on this.WILKINSON: Well, I think you could interpret it that it way. That's not the way I interpret it. I was there. I had bilateral meetings with a whole range of countries, and groupings of countries from around the world. I had the opportunity to meet the UN Secretary-General. I think the general feeling very much is we all understand we have to raise the level of ambition. We need to actually move forward with meeting and exceeding the targets that the countries have made. I think everybody understands that. The thing that didn't get done at this conference was simply the article six issue around emissions trading. That is important because it can help us to ratchet up the level of ambition, but that is not the Paris agreement. That is one small part of it. My sense is the momentum is there. I think the test of it will be Cop26 when people need to come forward, countries need to come forward with new targets and plans as to how they're going to meet them.MARTIN: Correct me if I'm wrong, the problem always seems to be that the developed countries are being asked to help the developing countries with monetary incentives to increase their ambitions and reducing emissions, and when the rich countries don't want to pay for it. Is that not the stalemate we're in here?WILKINSON: Well not entirely. I mean I do think there was a lot of conversation around issues associated with financial assistance for adaptation to climate impact. As you know, Canada made a commitment of $2.65 billion a few years ago for a period of five years. Others in the developed world made the same kinds of commitments. And again, at Cop26 the idea is that we will come forward and look at those arrangements as we look at additional ratcheting up of the targets, but it's entirely understandable that a lot of the developed world is looking to the, the developing world is looking to the developed world for some assistance in helping them to manage to develop their economies in a non-hydrocarbon intensive way, and to help them manage some of the impacts of climate change that were caused largely by emissions from the developed world. I had a breakfast meeting with the Marshall Islands. They were telling me that the highest point of land on their island is two metres. And in the absence of strong action on climate change, they simply don't live there anymore. So I think that this is a conversation that both sides have managed to move forward at this Cop, and I think we will manage to make progress at Cop26. It's an important part of the conversation.MARTIN: On another issue, the Alberta challenge to the carbon tax hit the courts again today. Are you worried? Are you expecting a different court decision that has been rendered in other provinces that basically says the feds are right to tax carbon, or have the right to do it?WILKINSON: Well, I mean carbon knows no provincial boundaries, and certainly our position is that we have a strong case with respect to the constitutional validity of the price on pollution. The Alberta court will hear it. It will provide an advisory opinion. Our view is that our case is strong, but ultimately this will be decided at the Supreme Court of Canada. Both Ontario and Saskatchewan who lost the court cases have appealed to the Supreme Court. Ultimately the Supreme Court will need to weigh in, but again, from a constitutional perspective, we are very comfortable that our position is strong, and I think Canadians in the last election told provincial governments, and I think provincial governments should listen to this, that the whole issue of addressing climate change is important, and two-thirds of Canadians supported a price on pollution.MARTIN: Okay, Minister Wilkinson, thanks for joining us. We appreciate this.WILKINSON: Thank you, Don.MARTIN: All right, coming up, two former premiers size up the political year in Atlantic Canada. Please stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\l"

In an indication that Bolsonaro, a farright conservative, is forging closer ties with neighbouring countries than European nations, he also accepted Chile's offer of four aircraft to help fight the fires sweeping through the world's largest rainforest. Speaking to journalists after a meeting with Chilean President Sebastian Pinera in Brasilia, Bolsonaro said a meeting with regional neighbours except Venezuela to discuss a common policy in defence of the Amazon will be held on Sept. 6 in the Colombian city of Leticia.In a statement, the two leaders said environmental challenges must be met while respecting ""national sovereignty,"" and that each country should have control over the ""rational and sustainable use of their natural resources, in l"

She hoped to arrive in Madrid in time for the next U.N.-sponsored round of climate talks in December.""So happy to say I'll hopefully make it to COP25 in Madrid,"" Thunberg said in a post on Twitter on Tuesday, using an acronym for the U.N.'s December conference.Inspired by Thunberg's solitary weekly protest outside the Swedish parliament over a year ago, millions of young people around the world have since heeded her call to demand that governments take emergency action to combat global warming.In late August, Thunberg arrived in New York in a zero-carbon emissions vessel after a 14-day journey from England to deliver a speech at the U.N. climate summit in September.Since then, she has traveled across North America, with stops in Canada's Alberta and Iowa in the United States where she joined climate protesters.On Tuesday, an artist unveiled a mural of Thunberg in San Francisco to remind residents of the dangers posed by climate change.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada69","Don't forget about climate change in the 'holi-daze'","December 11, 2019 Wednesday","Waterloo Region Record","Chances are you're thinking more about the upcoming holiday season than you are about the Climate Action talks - COP25 - happening right now in Madrid.As much as I try to stay on top of what's happening on the world stage with climate action, my eyes glaze over at the language and minutiae of these global meetings. Are they effective? What impact, if any, do they have on my life and my community?These are the brief historical highlights. In 1992, representatives from United Nation member states met in Rio de Janeiro to collaborate on sustainability issues. It was called the Rio Earth Summit. Three conventions were adopted at that meeting: the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the UN Convention on Biodiversity, and the Convention to Combat Desertification. Participating members continue to meet annually in Conferences of the Parties (COP) in different host countries.The UNFCCC came into effect in March 1994, signed by 154 countries. This agreement was neither binding nor enforceable, but based on negotiated treaties and agreements. The goal was to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations ""at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic (human induced) interference with the climate system ... within a time-frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened, and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.""That so many countries with language, culture, economic, belief system and knowledge differences came to any agreement is nothing short of miraculous.The Kyoto Protocol meeting in 1997 set enforceable targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in all participating countries within a specific time frame. The U.S. never signed it and Canada renounced it under Harper's Conservative government.The Paris Agreement in 2011 came into effect in November 2016 to limit global warming to less than 2 C but aiming for 1.5 C. Canada committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030.The carbon footprint of the 20,000 plus people attending the conferences is offset by the host countries through the use of clean energy, public transit, electric vehicles and purchasing certified emission credits. Individuals attending are encouraged to offset their personal impact.Now, during COP25 The immensity of the task to reduce emissions is daunting and depressing, especially when politicians don't get it. Ontario's auditor general just released a scathing report on the province's environmental plan saying, ""the emissions reductions in the Plan are not yet supported by sound evidence."" At least, Jerry DeMarco, former managing lawyer of Sierra Legal Defense (now Ecojustice), has been appointed to replace Dianne Saxe as commissioner of the environment.There is also a glimmer of hope bringing climate action to city level. Cities account for 70 per cent of global fossil fuel CO2. Scaling down the work to where we live makes climate action plans accessible and doable. Although it also means trusting that others are doing the same in their own communities. Check out HYPERLINK http://www.C40.orgwww.C40.org for a great infographic on how cities can have a huge impact.Locally, the City of Kitchener is participating in a one-year pilot project as one of 25 showcase cities in Canada to receive extensive support in reducing greenhouse gases and adapting to climate change.We cannot become paralyzed by despair or the belief our efforts don't count. Millions of us, of all ages and descriptions are leaning in, showing up for climate change rallies, writing politicians, planting trees and pollinator patches, choosing to take public transit, ditching gas-powered cars, eating less meat, producing less waste, buying second-hand clothing, repairing rather than replacing, going plastic-free, starting Green Teams in our workplaces, and connecting with others to make a difference.Andres Edwards wrote: ""The shared activity of hundreds of thousands of nonprofit organizations can be seen as humanity's immune response to the toxins like political corruption, economic disease and ecological degradation."" Over the upcoming holidays talk with family, friends and neighbours about what you can do together as your gift to our planet and our future. Ask yourself, ""If not me, then who?

Or a story in Maclean's magazine about an Ontario town that is working toward a greener future.These forms of storytelling are crucial for the conversation to shift toward a new default position: climate change as the current upon which the economy rides. Ultimately, it will require political will for the world to get there. But support is building, and it's the masses who are leading the way.""If you actually look at the most beautiful parts of our histories, it's mass movements, it's collectives, it's groundswells,"" author and activist Rebecca Solnit recently said on CBC Radio's The Current.""We need a framework in which maybe everybody is potentially a hero, and it's not the exceptional but the ordinary people who change the world.""As stories about collective action become a more prominent feature of climate journalism, so too will climate change start to feel more accessible and less scary. In the near future, climate change will not be something big, distant and seemingly impossible to overcome.Instead, it will just be a fact of life around which everything else revolves, including human rights, jobs and the economy.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada74","Climate movement youth offer hope","December 27, 2019 Friday","Sudbury Star","The world is still on track for blowing past the safe upper limits for global heating. The rulebook for Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, meanwhile, has not been finalized, and the loss and damage mechanisms for atonement of western civilization's obscene fossil fuel emissions seem even further out of reach.Yet, I am hopeful because I felt the power of the people I encountered at COP 25, the latest Conference of the Parties through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.This is my third COP and something was palpably different at this one. The explosion of the Fridays For Future and Extinction Rebellion movements across the planet over the past year was felt. Consequently, I have decided to focus on two Fridays For Future youth who attended COP 25.I was fortunate to attend a session with Vanessa at COP 25 that was about bringing youth and scientists together. Key to Greta Thunberg's success, which makes her impermeable to criticism from the climate destroyers, is that she is neither policy prescriptive nor partisan. Greta and the FFF movement's key message are Unite Behind the Science, which was the title of the event I attended.In this session Vanessa proved herself to be an extremely effective messenger and bridge-builder. Her leadership and communication skills defy her years. Vanessa's youth gives her the moral authority to demand climate action now. What struck me most was the additional layer she brought to the Unite Behind the Science message to include traditional knowledge of the farmers in her country, who are seeing first-hand the impacts of the climate crisis.During the Q&;A session, I was lucky enough to make a statement, which included a hello and admiration from my daughter Sophia to Vanessa. Vanessa knew who I was talking about. When the session was over, Vanessa came down off the stage and we hugged, pulled back and looked at each other. We both had tears in our eyes. I said: ""There is no need for words,"" and we hugged again. It simply was a profound moment of love, which still gives me tears of joy and hope as I write this story.One of our Citizens'Climate Lobby leaders in Mexico is Jorge Martinez. Under 30 years old, he is also involved in Fridays For Future Mexico and is a Mexican representative of YOUNGO, which is one of the official constituencies at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Jorge was the YOUNGO spokesperson at the People's Plenary which was an officially sanctioned Civil Society action on Dec. 14 in the halls of the COP 25 in Madrid.For almost 30 years Mexico, Canada and the U.S. have been trading partners, previously under NAFTA and now under CUSMA. Thus, it is critical that our three countries harmonize our responses to the climate emergency.In 2009, I followed closely the COP 15 negotiations in Copenhagen from the comfort of my home in Sudbury. I knew instinctively it was going to fail because it did not have the grassroots support it needed. That year the Kyoto Protocol began to fall apart. The protocol was linked to the UNFCCC. It was adopted in Kyoto, Japan on Dec. 11, 1997, and became international law on Feb. 16, 2005. The U.S. never ratified it and Canada was the only country to withdraw from it.My personal journey with carbon pricing and climate change began at COP 15. Suffering from climate trauma, I took a month off work in February 2010 and it was then I determined I should focus solely on carbon pricing. In June 2010, I met Marshall Saunders, the founder of Citizens'Climate Lobby, and was forever cured of climate trauma.Ten years later there has been immense progress. Today, 46 national governments either price carbon pollution or will be implementing carbon pricing. As well, 96 countries have carbon pricing in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).At COP 25As well, the World Bank launched the Partnership for Market Implementation, which will assist countries in the Global South in either improving their current carbon pricing or implementing carbon pricing.In conclusion, sooner or later, the U.S. government will join the coalition of the willing. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, CCL leaders have brought messages of carbon pricing to our governments in over 50 countries around the world.And therein lies the hope - the hope lies within the people such as Vanessa, Jorge and the countless heroes in the climate movement.Cathy Orlando of Sudbury is international outreach manager with the Citizens' Climate Lobby.

The protesters banged pots and pans, blew plastic whistles and waved the Chilean and Mapuche indigenous flags. Vendors sold snacks, jewelry, hats and t-shirts. The demonstrators, many in their 20s and 30s, pressed their call for changes to a market-dominant socio-economic model that has fully or partially privatized pensions, health and education. They hoisted signs calling for pension reform, an end to the private ownership of water rights or for the resignation of President Sebasti\'e1n Pi\'f1era.""There's an economic development system that's made us all accustomed to injustice, a profound dissatisfaction among the vast majority of people who feel that they aren't seeing the benefits of economic development,"" said Jorge Pinto, a 24-year-old student of public administration.On several side streets the atmosphere was tenser, as groups of masked protesters set fire to garbage and trees in a local park, before they were chased off by police with tear gas and water cannon. Attempts to march to La Moneda, the presidential palace, were frustrated by police barricades.Some demonstrators are angry about the retirement system, which forces Chileans to hand over 10 per cent of their income to private fund managers and then receive pensions that barely cover a third of most people's monthly expenses. Others fume about a public health system that makes many wait months for an appointment with a specialist, or seek expensive private care.Still others resent university loans that they are still paying into their 40s and 50s, even as 1% of the population earns 33 per cent of the nation's wealth, making Chile the most unequal country in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development group of wealthy nations.Virtually none have been satisfied by Pi\'f1era's response to the protests, which includes replacing eight ministers, calling for national dialogue, offering small increases in the minimum wage and the lowest pensions, higher taxes on the wealthy and decreases in the prices of medicine and electricity.Pi\'f1era, a billionaire businessman who sees the private sector and economic growth as the keys to national success, may be hoping that his relatively minor concessions will calm the streets as protests approach the two-week mark, said Lucia Dammert, a sociologist and political scientist at the University of Santiago.It remains uncertain if that will happen, Dammert said.""It's really unclear what the government's strategy is. They find themselves facing a situation they weren't prepared for,"" she said. ""This is a government with an intense focus on economic growth. ... They may be thinking that the streets will quiet down as time passes and people get exhausted.""Pi\'f1era's approval is at 14 per cent, according to recent polls, but protests have focused mostly on replacing the constitution, saying its focus on prioritizing private control of virtually every aspect of the economy is the root of the country's problems, regardless of who's in power.""His proposals are a joke; they're not really the solutions that the people want,"" said Lindsay Silva, a 24-year-old student working on a degree in physical therapy and health at the University of Santiago. ""Inequality affects me every day because my family can't pay its bills and has to make big sacrifices in order for me to have opportunities.""Many protesters want a new constitution to replace the one that was written in 1980 under military dictator Augusto Pinochet and that creates the legal basis of Chile's market-driven system. That idea began to gain momentum Tuesday when the leader of one of the three parties that supports Pi\'f1era in congress came out in favour of reforming the constitution.""The idea of changing the constitution, of eventually creating a new constitution, is getting ever stronger, and that's legitimate and must be discussed,"" said Congressman Mario Desborde, president of the National Renovation party. ""If the constitution must be changed, it must be changed. ... I don't fear democracy in the slightest.""Six opposition parties control the House and Senate and favour changing the constitution but don't have enough votes between them to do that, making support from governing parties essential.The opposition parties were holding meetings Tuesday to begin moving forward on constitutional reform.From afar, Chile has been a regional success story: Under democratically elected presidents on the left and right, a free-market consensus has driven growth up, poverty down and won Chile the region's highest score on the United Nations Human Development Index, a blend of life expectancy, education and national income per capita.In 2010, Chile became the second Latin nation in the OECD, after Mexico. Next month, Pi\'f1era will host the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, followed by the 25th United Nations in December.Pi\'f1era's proposals to calm the protests so far ""are window dressing, because none of the things we've been fighting for has really been achieved,"" said Catalina Alfaro, 55, who hasn't been able to join the protests because she has been busy running a bakery she owns in western Santiago.""Things in Chile could calm down if he says to our faces that we're going to change the constitution.""Social Development Minister said Sebasti\'e1n Sichel said the government was asking municipalities to begin calling citizen forums as part of a national dialogue to develop concrete proposals for change out of the national protests.He said that if citizens wanted a constitutional assembly, specially called to produce a new national charter, the government could support it.""This can go where the citizens want it to,"" he said.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada85","Big Questions For 2020","January 8, 2020 Wednesday","Daily Oil Bulletin","By Peter Tertzakian and Jackie Forrest As we flip the calendar into the new year and a new decade, it&rsquo;s a good time to pause and think about what the next 12 months and beyond may hold in store for the oil and gas industry. Here are some of the big questions that are front of mind as we start the new year. Will oil prices go higher? Tensions between the United States and Iran have pushed the possibility of military action in the Persian Gulf much higher. That geopolitical uncertainty premium has pushed prices (WTI) solidly into the $60/bbl range. Continued conflict could take it higher, though how high would depend on the severity of any supply constraint from the region. Is the U.S. shale oil boom really over? Yes and no. Yes, if oil prices are weak. We&rsquo;ve learned that the rigs go home under $55/bbl. Conversely, more American production can be expected if prices continue strengthening into the mid-$60s and above. Yet over the past several years the &lsquo;boom&rsquo; was driven by cheap money from equity markets that financed rapid growth. Independent of oil price, the capital boom will likely remain a bust in 2020. Expect U.S. oil production to still grow, but at a more modest pace than the past few years. Is oil demand going to start peaking any time soon? Unlikely in the 2020s. Exiting 2019, the trends were not supportive of a structural demand peak. Global electric vehicle adoption rates had stalled, people continued to upsize their combustion vehicles, and the industrializing world is still pulling hard on new demand. Yet oil demand growth is vulnerable to two related factors more impactful than any carbon tax: An oil price spike in the event of Middle Eastern conflict with Iran, and a slowdown in the world economy. What will OPEC+ do? The oil market continues to be well supplied into 2020, therefore OPEC+ members have little choice but to continue production restraint. The cartel delivered some holiday cheer by extending and deepening their output cuts. As for future tactics, much will depend on the Iranian situation. Military tensions are yielding handsome prices, near $70/bbl internationally. For now, that takes pressure off more cuts, but publicly-traded Saudi Aramco will be watching carefully. The Kingdom&rsquo;s oil company should be motivated to defend its share price by defending oil. What are the implications of the recent COP25 meetings in Madrid? By the end of last year, a long list of countries, jurisdictions and companies made pledges to become carbon &lsquo;net-zero&rsquo; by 2050. But the global emissions numbers show that pledges are far from action. Despite all the notional progress, COP25 proved that achieving consensus on united action remains challenging. GHG emissions will continue to rise, leading to more alarm and exasperation. This failure will increase pressure on companies to step in where governments are failing. Pressure on consumer behaviour will increase too. What will happen with oil and gas equity markets? Last year was tough for equity prices, with some company names hitting multi decade lows. While the recent oil price surge has helped to lift share prices, many public companies are still priced below last January&rsquo;s level &mdash; when oil price was under $50/bbl. Stronger commodity prices alone are not likely to bring back a surge of investors in 2020, companies must also prove that they can return money to investors on a sustained basis, and at the same time be ESG leaders that are resilient in a low carbon future. What does Canadian climate change policy look like going forward? Justin Trudeau&rsquo;s mandate letter to his Minister of Environment and Climate Change outl"

Well, here are two big signs of hope for today's youth: The latest carbon emissions data and forecasts suggest the UN's climate catastrophe scenarios are way off the mark.Thirty years ago, when Time's apocalyptarian editors declared Earth as Planet of the Year for 1988, they warned of the global environmental meltdown to come. Oceans will rise, deserts will grow, and human existence will be threatened. According to computer projections, claimed Time in late 1988, ""the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere could drive up the planet's average temperature 3 F to 9 F by the middle of the next century.""Not happening. That temperature disaster (equal to an increase of 3 and 5 C) has been officially postponed at least 50 years. ""If the current trend continues we may see temperature increases 3-5 degrees C by the end of the century,"" the head of the UN's World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said in its 2018 report.But even that scaled-back WMO temperature outlook is not going to happen. Recent commentary from two climate researchers demonstrate that alarmism about rising temperatures and global environmental disaster are not justified for two reasons. First, the worst-case scenarios that are the basis for the constant barrage of catastrophic warnings from the UN and others have little or no basis in real science. Second, the latest global carbon emissions projections suggest the world is already well on the road to holding the world temperature increase down to manageable non-catastrophic levels.In a recent Forbes commentary, University of Colorado scientist Roger Pielke Jr. documented how UN officials at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) developed extreme carbon scenarios that were used to create dangerously high temperature projections. The IPCC's most alarming outlook, a ""business as usual"" scenario, assumed that global carbon emissions would reach 80 billion tons a year by the end of the century. As Pielke writes, with that scenario, ""The apocalypse had been scheduled."" Pielke outl"

Most of the electorate just weeks ago at the ballot box indicated we wanted climate change responsibly addressed.Despite the obvious connection to growing carbon emissions globally and climate disruption, Premier Kenney is doggedly pressing for your government to endorse yet another tar sands project-this one massive! If put into operation, the Tech Tar Sands, projected to operate until 2067, would gobble up 53 per cent of Canada's emissions budget within 10 years of operation! The IPCC estimates that for the planet to have a 50/50 chance of escaping the ""feed-back loop"" of rising global temperatures, we need to shrink oil production by 37 per cent in the next 10 years and 87 per cent by 2050! It is not that we are reduced to no other options for generating power! Example: There are credible studies here in Alberta that, being near the mountains, we have massive geothermal potential for generating electricity.Just this summer, the MD of Greenview announced the development of the first geothermal power generation facility south of Grande Prairie at Gold Creek. Saskatchewan was ahead of us with their first.Shifting attention to thousands of orphaned oil wells, Alberta could readily put unemployed oil workers with the skills they have towards Alberta's geothermal potential.Alberta needs to seize this sustainable and non-polluting form of power generation. It is doable. Iceland generates 25 per cent of its electricity from geothermal.Leave tar in the ground.\l"

It calls on governments and higher-education institutions to back up the declaration with actions that will help create a better future for both people and the planet.Tim Killeen, the university system's president, signed on to the plan that includes mobilizing more resources for ""action-oriented"" studies and skills, going ""carbon neutral"" by 2030 or 2050 at the latest, and expanding environmental and sustainability education across their campuses and through community outreach programs, The News-Gazette reported on Sunday.The letter notes that a ""drastic society shift"" will be needed to combat the mounting threat of climate change.""The young minds that are shaped by our institutions must be equipped with the knowledge, skills and capability to respond to the ever-growing challenges of climate change. We all need to work together to nurture a habitable planet for future generations and to play our part in building a greener and cleaner future for all,"" the letter states.The Climate Action Plan for the university's Urbana campus, which will be updated in 2020, already is committed to being carbon neutral by 2050 or sooner.University leaders globally have signed the declaration, from Germany, Great Britain, Canada, Mexico, Japan, France, Saudi Arabia, India, Uganda, Venezuela, Costa Rica and others.The 25th Conference of the Parties, or COP25, began on Monday. Delegates are gathering for the two-week, international climate summit aiming to put the finishing touches to rules governing the landmark 2015 Paris accord.More than 70 countries have committed to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, except for nations that emit the most greenhouse gases, including the United States.This is the last conference before many countries are required to submit new climate action plans in 2020.""This year's conference is important toward getting the countries on track for their current promises and to also further strengthen their reductions in emissions,"" said climate expert Donald Wuebbles, a University of Illinois professor of atmospheric sciences who was the lead author on climate change reports that were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.

""All the hotels are practically empty,"" he said, referring to the central area near Plaza de Italia, where many of the protests have gathered.The impact to tourism-related businesses has spread.""Tourism is a very sensitive industry, and we've seen reservations drop by around 50% these last two weeks,"" said Monica Zalaquett, Chile's sub-secretary of tourism. ""And what is tough for the industry is that there won't be new reservations until the country's situation stabilizes.""Demonstrators say they have no intention of letting up on protests, although the streets have calmed somewhat since a long holiday weekend began on Thursday.Chilean President Sebastian Pinera, who axed a third of his cabinet this week as he scrambled to appease the protesters, also pulled the plug on plans to hold two global meetings that were set to take place in Chile - the APEC leaders summit this month, and the huge COP25 climate change meeting in December.""We believe that around 40,000-50,000 people were going to arrive at these two events,"" said Zalaquett.U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping had been expected to seal a potential trade deal between the world's biggest two economies at APEC.December to February - the southern hemisphere summer - is a key time for tourism in Chile, when many international visitors pass through Santiago on their way to treks in Patagonia, while domestic tourists head to the beaches.""The tourism industry is very seasonal and it's now when high season begins.

The USA is our number one trading partner. Aligning trade deals with the climate emergency is paramount for success.Additionally, at COP25 in Madrid in December 2019, with the help of my Mexican colleague, Jorge Martinez, we met with the Mexican delegation to discuss carbon pricing.On Jan. 30, 2019, while Canada was renegotiating the new NAFTA deal, my colleague Joe Robertson and I submitted the new NAFTA Initial Environmental Assessment.We recommended that harmonization of carbon pricing and climate resilience between Canada, the USA and Mexico be considered.Citing the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation, negotiated and implemented in parallel to NAFTA in 1991, our submission laid out a persuasive argument to reduce carbon emissions. We called for a plan, similar to Canada's carbon pricing plan, to be extended across North America.The North American Free Trade zone - as defined by NAFTA and the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement, encompassing Canada, the United States and Mexico - provides an opportunity to bring half a billion people into a sustainable economy of inclusive prosperity. This depends on forces that shape overall economic potential.Climate disruption is the most serious, all-pervading and costly market failure in history. Prices in the status quo economy do not tell the truth about long-term costs of burning fuels whose emissions accumulate in the atmosphere and trap heat. Climate change impacts and related areas of risk are becoming unaffordable for public institutions, private investors, and insurers.The most straightforward, efficient, high-value way to set clear market signals is to put an explicit price on carbon-emitting fuels, upstream - at the source - and to return the revenues to households.Canada's federal backstop carbon pricing policy reflects this model. The Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act, introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives as H.R. 763, would give the U.S. this model. Mexico's carbon pricing plan, which was designed to operate at the molecular level - to ensure a fee is paid for each molecule of GHG in circulation - could apply elements of this strategy, as well.Under NAFTA Article 604: ""Export Taxes parties were allowed to maintain duties, taxes or other charge on the export of any energy or basic petrochemical good to the territory of another Party if the duty, tax or other charge applies to the exports of any such good to the territory of all other Parties and any such good when destined for domestic consumption.""In conclusion, we recommended that the harmonization of carbon pricing and climate resilience between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico be considered in the new NAFTA Initial Environmental Assessment.

A second match against Peru in Lima will go ahead but will only feature players who play outside Chile.The local soccer league program was halted last month because of the protests and officials said they do not know when the competition will be completed.

The UN gathering - the 25th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or ""COP25"" for short - runs from Dec. 2 to 13.May said Trudeau told her he would discuss green issues with his environment minister once the new cabinet is sworn in next Wednesday. She said she anticipates Catherine McKenna will be moved from the role after holding it for the Liberals' whole first term, speculating that rookie Liberal MP Steven Guilbeault, a long-time environmentalist, makes an obvious choice for the position.May said Trudeau also promised to bring new legislation to harmonize federal laws with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), addressing a key Green request, and to stave off the loss of abortion services in New Brunswick.A bill to do that in the last Parliament died in the Senate when the election was called.May has stepped down as overall Green leader but is still the head of the Greens' three-member caucus in the House of Commons.Trudeau has sought common ground with the Conservative, Bloc Quebecois and NDP leaders in separate sessions as he prepares to return to Parliament in December without a majority in the Commons.

""The initiatives are becoming bigger and bolder. Is this enough? No, because you cannot change the world without governments' buy-in,"" he added.

And no matter what you do inside your box, you can't have a global view,"" he said.""Globally, we're building one coal fired power plant a week. If they have access to natural gas, they most certainly would want not just the gas but access to some of those credits.""McMillan said if the delegates in Madrid are unable to agree to a framework for Article 6, Canada should take the lead in negotiating an international set of rules for sharing in emissions reductions.""They would have to be strict in how they assess what is a real carbon credit, they'd have to be credible in how accounting is done so that others can follow the work,"" he said.""But without it, we are going to lose globally. And to look at this problem just within Canada's borders is somewhat myopic because Canada only makes up 1.5 per cent of global emissions.""Speaking at the Canadian Club in Ottawa on Monday, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney also touted the possible benefits of Article 6 in combating climate change.""I understand that, if we were to fully satisfy the future demand for LNG in China and India, to allow them to convert off of high-emitting coal, to much lower-emitting natural gas, that the incremental reduction in their CO2 output would be equivalent to the entire Canadian economy's GHG output,"" he said.""I hope that the federal government will seek to get credit for that kind of export through Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.

And as the third week on the hustings got underway Wednesday, a visible strain showed on Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau's face.In Delta, B.C., after announcing new climate action measures to help homeowners, Trudeau again faced questions - though far fewer - about the bombshell blackface photo revealed by a Time Magazine scoop. It had been followed by others - three incidents in all.His brow furrowed, Trudeau repeated what is now a refrain: ""I've spoken about the incidents that I recalled. I have recognized from the very beginning that this was something I shouldn't have done. I recognized how wrong it was; I should have known that then, but I didn't. I will continue every day to fight against racism and intolerance because that's what people expect of me and that's what I expect of me.""Several public polls suggest the impact on voters is, for now at least, less dramatic than Liberals first feared, attenuated by Trudeau's youth at the time, by his repeated apologies, by a record of funding anti-racism and promoting diversity, and perhaps by the reaction of several leaders of racialized communities who publicly criticized his self-described ""racist"" acts, yet cut him slack.The scandal had briefly derailed Trudeau's campaign even as it galvanized the others.Then just as quickly, it slid under an avalanche of policy promises unleashed by all campaigns.The Liberals vowed to tighten firearms controls short of a handgun ban; promised a tax cut targeted mainly at middle and lower income households, said they'd reduce cellphone bills; expand public health coverage for drugs, mental health and long-term care; and promised to hit far-off targets for greenhouse gas reductions that seemed unattainable under current measures.The Conservatives pledged cuts to corporate subsidies; tax breaks for seniors; $1.5 billion to cut wait times for medical tests; help for first-time homebuyers; repeals of the Liberals' corporate tax measures that had angered small businesses; and offered tax breaks for ""green"" improvements to homes.The NDP highlighted some of their biggest-ticket promises: $5 billion for affordable housing; $1.9 billion to launch a public dental care plan for mid- and lower-income Canadians; a $15 billion ""climate bank"" and $2.5 billion for climate disaster mitigation.The Greens' Elizabeth May had unveiled a platform with no price tag - and when it came, it was quickly undercut by the skeptical eye of the former parliamentary budget officer now running University of Ottawa's Institute for Fiscal Studies and Democracy.The week also saw Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg rip into global lawmakers for inaction at a UN conference on climate change. She is headed to Canada to march Friday as part of a wave of national climate action ""strikes.""Trudeau has bowed out of the only election debate centred on foreign policy, forcing its cancellation. After skipping two, he will do three others.He may be asked to explain how an apologist for Syrian president Bashar Assad was approved by Global Affairs as an honorary consul for Syria in Montreal. The government revoked it, yet it's unclear why it was ever approved in the first place.As the third week unfolds, details are often annoyingly scarce.There were targets without plans - the Liberals' pharmacare and cellphone promises, and their promise to exceed 2030 cuts to global emissions.And plans without targets. The Conservatives claim they are the ""best chance"" to hit the Liberals' goal for greenhouse gas reductions, but refuse to state their own targets. And that five-year balanced budget promise remains aspirational - with none of the cuts analysts say are unavoidable outl"

One of its aims is to bring some awareness that this problem is not due to a lack of capacity, but is fundamentally spiritual. Our hopes, dreams, values and motivations all begin in the world of spirit, as do our fears and vices. The stunning failure to mount an effective response to the climate crisis seems primarily due to a lack of vision, a failure to imagine a future that's healthy and in harmony with nature. Why?

The Montreal Protocol for the protection of the ozone layer was signed in 1987, also as a result of strong evidence followed by concerted international action.Our modern-day problems can't be solved without unity of purpose, co-operation and pragmatism. Individuals are not going to solve the climate crisis by changing to LED bulbs and using non-disposable cups. As virtuous as those actions might be, they're not enough. On the same day Greta Thunberg was named Time Magazine's Person of the Year, she called out the nations gathered at COP25 for their ""clever accounting and creative PR practices"" in lieu of taking truly effective international action.Sympathy for our situation might be warranted. The problem is enormous and complex, the opposing forces well-funded and clever and the public easily distracted. Now, however, we're beginning to have the advantage of desperation, including in the financial sector. For the first time in its history, environmental concerns dominate the 10-year outlook of the World Economic Forum's Global Risks Report. As Samuel Johnson said: ""Depend upon it, sir, when a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully.""Another change that's finally beginning to happen is an increasing emphasis on finding workable solutions, and away from simply scaring the dickens out of everyone.From David Attenborough's top five strategies in his 2019 documentary Our Planet Our Business to the 100 ranked solutions by Project Drawdown, the tactic is refreshingly positive. Some of the solutions proposed are breathtaking in their scope and expected results.The creation of ocean sanctuaries, protecting 30% of the ocean from fishing and destructive industries, would help to save coral reefs and prevent the collapse of the world's fisheries currently predicted by 2048. This is well within our power.Its audacity makes my heart sing.The poetic and mystical phrasing of the world's sacred texts is often far more apt than the vernacular in expressing what we intuitively know.

But they ignored itanyway.The point of no return arrives in the mid-2030s, when the rising emissions of greenhouse gases (they are still rising, not falling) pushes the amount of carbon dioxide equivalent in the atmosphere up past 450 parts permillion. Four hundred and fifty ppm of CO2 drives the average global temperature up more than two Celsius degrees (two degrees higher than the pre-industrial average) and intorunaway.In diplomatic-speak, what happens then is ""dangerous climate change,"" but that actually is happening already, with carbon dioxide at 405 ppm and average global temperature1.1 degreeshigher. We are seeing firestorms in Australia, rising sea levels, catastrophic storms and meltingglaciers.What happens at 450 ppm is that the two degrees of warming caused by human beings trigger natural processes (feedbacks or tipping points) that also causewarming. And once they start, human beings cannot stopthem. The Big Three feedbacks are the loss of the Arctic Ocean's sea ice cover, the melting of the permafrost zone and the release of vast amounts of CO2 by the warming worldoceans.Guterres called it ""the point of no return"" because after that we losecontrol. The warming will then continue even if human beings eventually stop all of their ownemissions. We will be trapped on an up escalator that delivers us into a world three, four, even five degrees hotter than the pre-industrialaverage.That is exactly where the World Meteorological Organization predicts we will be by the end of this century if current promises on emissions cuts are kept, but no more isdone. Long before the end of the century, that would mean the collapse of food production in the tropics and the subtropics, famines and huge refugee flows, massdeath.They never spell these things out at the climate summits, but almost everybody there knowsthem. And yet, once again, they failed to produce a deal that moves the processforward. The best that can be said is that they stopped a concerted attempt by the biggest emitters, led by Brazil and Australia, to gut the proposed rules for a global carbonmarket.Human societies are not good at long-termthinking. Moreover, politics is dominated by those whose interests will be advanced or damaged by what the government does right now, not in 15 years'time. Take Australia, forexample.It's the driest continent, and as the heat mounts, the number and scale of bushfires hasexploded.But Australia also is the world's biggest exporter of coal, mostly to China andJapan. Coal mining employs only 38,000 Australians, but it brings in a lot ofmoney.That's why, two years ago, Liberal (that is, conservative) politician Scott Morrison brought a lump of coal intoparliament. It was ""clean"" coal, in the sense that it had been lacquered so it wouldn't dirty people'shands. Morrison passed it around to his parliamentary colleagues saying, ""Don't be afraid, don't be scared, it won't hurtyou. It'scoal.""Morrison now is prime minister, and as the country burns, he continues to deny any link between burning coal and globalheating. He offers his ""thoughts and prayers"" to the victims of the fires, but insists climate change is only one of ""many other factors"" in fuelling thebushfires.Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack takes an even more robust l"

Elizabeth May is focusing on specifically Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.""\~Thompson said they've been talking with and learning from other world leaders about how Canada, and in his case New Brunswick, can move forward on climate goals.\~""Things that we could bring back to New Brunswick, [that's] the focus of the three New Brunswickers who are here,"" he said.\~At the conference, Thompson\~sat in on lectures and discussions with Al Gore and Greta Thunberg. He attended with two other Green Party former candidates including Moncton-Review-Dieppe Claire Kelly, federal party leader Elizabeth May, and Thompson campaign manager Addison Fach, as well as two former candidates from British Columbia.\~""She's actually used her platform, instead of her speaking, to allow scientists to speak,"" he said. ""So we had some of the world's leaders in science speak to us, and even youth around the world speak to us about the impact of climate change in their region.""\~He said one of the things that has impacted him the most at the conference is how small the world actually is when it comes to the impacts of climate change.\~""For me, it's been how small the world actually is,"" he said. ""What we do in Canada has major effects on the places far away from us, like small pacific islands.""\~He said he would like to see a look at the transportation system, like creating a more efficient travelling model that maximizes the number of users and minimizes the carbon footprint.\~Personally, Thompson said the experience has been eye-opening for him.\~""Life-changing, I would say,"" he said.Thompson said he is eager to return to New Brunswick to start discussions on how to move forward on preventing more devastation by floods, and also deal with mental health issues associated with the occurrence of natural disasters and the damage they leave behind.\~Fredericton South MLA David Coon also attended COP in 2015 and said the conference provides a wealth of resources for policy-makers but noted New Brunswick fell far behind other areas in the country and internationally.\~""The most important thing is what they learn about what the rest of the world is doing to mount an emergency response to the climate emergency,"" he said in an interview. ""That is what struck me in 2015 when I was at the Paris Climate summit as part of the New Brunswick delegation.""\~He said it didn't matter who was speaking or what they were speaking about, it was clear that New Brunswick was not where it needed to be.\~Coon believes the public's mounting pressure of political leaders to act will help.""There is a real push, that is only continuing to grow, to get political leaders to act and respond to the climate emergency as an emergency.""He said it's important for those attending the conference to learn from what other countries are doing. Some of the things they'll see over there have been pioneered right here in New Brunswick, but because of barriers to entry to the various industries, they have been prevented from reaching their full potential.\~""I think another thing they will bring back is a greater sense of urgency that we need to act,"" he said. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2019 Telegraph-Journal (New Brunswick)\l"

The perceived hypocrisy of so many people flying from all corners of the globe to try to tackle the climate crisis has led some to call for an air travel ban for participants.According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), domestic and international aviation accounts for approximately two per cent of global CO2 emissions produced by people. It estimates international aviation alone is responsible for 1.3 per cent of global CO2 emissions.But air travel is only growing. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) predicts 7.8 billion passengers will be flying by 2036, a near doubling of the four billion who flew in 2017.According to Reuters, a Swedish-born anti-flying movement \'e2\€  perhaps inspired by teen climate activist Greta Thunberg \'e2\€  is creating a whole new vocabulary, from flygskam (which translates as ""flight shame"") to t\'c3\£5gskryt (""train brag""). The agency reports the movement is spreading to other parts of Europe.What is the aviation industry doing?In 2009, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the industry's trade organization, set out to make the industry more fuel efficient and reduce CO2 emissions to half of 2005 levels by 2050. The plan was built around:- The use of more fuel-efficient aircraft and sustainable low-carbon fuels.- More efficient aircraft operations \'e2\€  such as reducing on-board weight.- Technology and infrastructureimprovements, including modernized air traffic management systems, to allow for more direct routes.In 2016, ICAO airl"

The picture is even bleaker when current policies are taken into consideration, the report said.""Our collective failure to act strongly and early means that we must now implement deep and urgent cuts,"" United Nations Environment Programme, or UNEP, Executive Director Inger Andersen said in a letter attached to the report. She argued that ""major transformation of our societies and economies we need can still happen,"" and noted that some countries, local governments and private sector companies are stepping up.The UNEP Emissions Gap Report was released one day after the U.N.'s World Meteorological Organization, or WMO, found global levels of heat-trapping emissions hit a new high in 2018, with carbon dioxide levels increasing at a rate they have largely maintained over the past decade while methane and nitrous oxide emissions have picked up the pace. Carbon, methane and nitrous oxide are the three biggest heat-trapping emissions contributing to climate change, according to scientists and the report.The WMO further reported that the increase in CO2 emissions over time is ""primarily because of emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels and cement production, deforestation and other land-use changes.""The emissions gap report largely reiterated UNEP's findings in 2018 that current country pledges to reduce emissions pursuant to the Paris climate accord would lead to a global mean temperature rise of about 3.2 degrees C by 2100 relative to preindustrial levels.This year's emissions gap report also finds that a continuation of current policies by Paris climate accord signatories would likely lead to a global mean temperature rise of 3.5 degrees, with a range of 3.4 degrees to 3.9 degrees. But the Paris accord aims to limit global warming ideally to 1.5 degrees to 2 degrees at most.G-20 countries collectively account for 78% of global emissions, and seven of those countries are not on track to meet their current pledges, the report said. Those countries are the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, the Republic of Korea and South Africa.When accounting only for current policies, global greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to be 60 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions, or GtCO2e, in 2030, the UNEP found. In comparison, scientists have estimated that the world would need to limit emissions to 41 GtCO2e to achieve the 2-degree goal and 25 GtCO2e under a 1.5-degree warming scenario.Countries have until the end of 2020 to increase their emissions reduction pledges, also known as nationally determined contributions, under the Paris climate accord.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada123","Chile's recent troubles follow history of turmoil","December 23, 2019 Monday","The Times & Transcript (New Brunswick)","The South American nation of Chile has been the scene of violent anti-government protests for more than two months.\~At least 26 people have been killed and thousands more injured.The government estimates arson, looting and property destruction have caused $3\~billion in damages.They began Oct. 18 in the capital of Santiago, when students opposing a hike in the price of subway fares engaged in vandalism and violence, prompting the authorities to enact a state of emergency and curfew.As the demonstrations grew larger, a Santiago university was set ablaze and a church was looted, with religious iconography burned in the street. Walmart saw more than 120 of its supermarkets looted or burned during the recent rioting.An estimated one\~million people clogged the streets of the Chilean capital by Oct. 26. In the port city of Valparaiso, the National Congress was evacuated as protesters clashed with police.But the vehemence of the protests should have come as no surprise. Chile has failed to find an adequate response to the grave economic and social inequality that has created the most severe unrest since the country returned to democracy some three decades ago.During Augusto Pinochet's military dictatorship the foundations were laid for a neoliberal economy. The education, pension and health systems, as well as the electricity and water supplies, were largely privatized.President Sebastian Pinera at first reacted by condemning the protesters. He sent about 10,000 soldiers out onto the streets in armoured vehicles. No government has taken such measures since the end of Pinochet's regime in 1990.Pinera later sought to quell the unrest by promising to enact higher taxes for the rich and a series of wealth redistribution policies. But his announced pension increases and a subsidy that would top up the monthly minimum wage from $396 to $460 fall far short of union and social movement proposals.Pinera has been in office since 2018 but served an earlier term as president from 2010 to 2014. He has an estimated net wealth of $2.8 billion, making him one of the richest people in Chile.Some 1,600 people remain in pre-trial detention out of 28,000 detained since mid-October. People are increasingly labelling the Chilean government's actions during the state of emergency as unconstitutional.Human Rights Watch on Nov. 26 accused Chilean police of perpetrating ""serious human rights violations"" during the protests and demanded reforms of Chile's national\~police force.The UN Human Rights Office, which is headed by former Chilean President Michelle Bachelet, a political opponent of Pinera, on Dec. 13 concurred.Meanwhile, the United Nation's COP25 Climate Summit, originally scheduled for Santiago Dec. 2 to Dec.13, was moved to Madrid.As Chile again endures turbulent times, it pays to reread Colombian novelist and Nobel Prize winner Gabriel Garcia Marquez's essay ""Why Allende had to die,"" published in the British magazine New Statesman in 1974. It dealt with arguably the worst period in the country's history.The article described socialist Salvador Allende's triumph in the presidential election of Sept. 4, 1970, and the bloody military coup that followed three years later.Allende's Popular Unity government was overthrown and he was killed in the presidential palace on Sept. 11, 1973. A junta under Pinochet was established, with tens of thousands of people interned and tortured, and more than 3,000 executed.Pinochet remained Chile's ruler for 17 years. He died in 2006, without having been convicted of the crimes of which he was accused. The current unrest has already had one beneficial outcome: Chile's Congress on Dec. 19 gave the green light to a referendum for April 26, 2020 on changing the country's constitution to replace the Pinochet-era one.The present constitution does not establish the state's responsibility to provide health care and education, which are two main demands from the protesters.""This agreement is a first step, but it is a historic and fundamental first step to start building our new social pact, and in this the citizenry will have a leading role,"" declared the country's interior minister, Gonzalo Blumel.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada124","We have a climate emergency, and still we kick the can down the road","December 28, 2019 Saturday","The Hamilton Spectator (Ontario, Canada)","The COP25 climate change summit that just wrapped up in Madrid was not the decisive plunge into climate action the world needed. In the lead up to the conference, 11,000 scientists declared ""clearly and unequivocally that planet Earth is facing a climate emergency,"" and a half-million protesters in Madrid demanded we act accordingly. In the end, however, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres tweeted the world ""lost an important opportunity.""Unable to reach agreement on new rules for carbon trading or funding for climate change adaptation, the proverbial can was kicked down the road. Again.We urgently need action on climate change, but even if we get it, there are larger issues. It's not just climate. Humanity is overwhelming the planet, its resources and its life-supporting capacity. We are not in any danger of extinction, not yet anyway. But the human juggernaut - and the needs and aspirations that propel it - is headed for a day of reckoning.Economists like to say that inflation is what happens when there is ""too much money chasing too few goods."" If a government keeps printing too much money, runaway inflation and economic collapse ensue. Something analogous is happening today in the natural world, where too many demands are chasing too few resources. If we keep piling more and more demands on our limited supply of land, water and other resources, nature will inevitably collapse.The warning signs are everywhere. Our unrelenting demand for fossil fuels is destroying the climate, resulting in soaring temperatures, severe droughts, catastrophic flooding, rising seas, wildfires, the acidification of the oceans, disrupted weather patterns and extreme weather events. Our demand for grain and other crops is contributing to soil erosion, deforestation and the nitrification of our oceans. Our demand for fish is depleting ocean fisheries and our demand for plastic products is choking the ocean's marine life. Palm oil, hardwoods and soybean demand is levelling tropical forests and land demand is killing animal habitats.Beyond the environmental toll, there's an escalating human cost: homes destroyed by wildfires and catastrophic storms and farms decimated by severe drought, rising temperatures or falling water tables. Young men in many parts of Asia and Africa are abandoning their rural communities in search of jobs in cities, and desperate mothers in the highlands of Guatemala and other drought-stricken areas are forced to migrate to feed their children.When there are too many demands chasing too few resources, conflict can arise. Like in Sudan, where water scarcity fuelled ethnic tensions. Or places like Mali and Niger, where fights break out between herders and farmers during drought. In the future, a rising tide of climate refugees could destabilize entire regions and contribute to global political dysfunction.We are experiencing a planetary emergency. Climate action is the first priority, as time is quickly running out. But we must also come to grips with the other challenges created by an expanding human footprint, including water scarcity, food insecurity and the extinction of plant and animal species.We need to downsize the human enterprise. We must address world population, which the UN now projects will rise from 7.7 billion today to nearly 10 billion by mid-century and nearly 11 billion by the end of the century. We also must deal with the sheer size of the global economy, which by some estimates could double by mid-century or earlier.Advancing reproductive freedom could dramatically lower the world's projected population growth. All women need access to contraception; that's fundamental. But beyond that, in the developing world, where the vast majority of the world's population growth is occurring, we should invest in the education of girls, eliminate child marriage and empower women. Smaller, healthier families are better equipped to deal with climate change.Reining in resource depletion and environmental degradation is a harder task, but not impossible. It will require a fundamental reworking of capitalism, starting with carbon taxes, and a much larger tax overhaul that stiffly penalizes pollution and resource consumption. We must also ensure that technology, which now accelerates resource depletion, becomes our ally in the fight for global sustainability. Artificial intelligence could help us chart a sustainable course, but only if we act on the insights it provides.The human enterprise is not without hope, but if future generations are to prosper, not merely survive, we must curb our overconsumption of resources and become better stewards of the planet.Robert Walker is the president of the Population Institute, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit striving to bring humanity into balance with nature.\l"

Let's bring in their leader in the house. Elizabeth May joins us from the House of Commons foyer. Elizabeth May, there are look-ahead initiatives to fight climate change, and that vow to get to zero emissions by 2050, but are you disappointed there aren't more specifics, or is that just the nature of throne speeches?ELIZABETH MAY (Green Party House Leader): Well I've seen throne speeches with a lot more specifics than this one, so I was disappointed. I was hoping to see a commitment to improve our target this week while we're negotiating at Cop-25 in Madrid. The timing of the speech from the throne would have been perfect to say, and our government is going to take action immediately by improving our target in the climate negotiations, showing the kind of leadership that could push other countries. Right now actually we're near the bottom of the barrel in terms of industrialized countries, in terms of our ambition and our plans. I thought it was telling, Don, and especially when I looked at the throne speech after standing there listening to it at the back of the bar behind the speaker, and realizing when I went back over and looked, it talked about climate change, but it didn't once use the term climate emergency. So I think that's the easiest way to explain my disappointment. We need urgent action, and there was a lot of content on climate, that's certainly in the right ballpark, but it sure didn't hit any home runs.MARTIN: I'm curious, though, I mean it did refer to getting to that zero emissions by 2050. I guess that's a work in progress. They're certainly not giving you any hint to how they're going to get to that never mind meet the Paris accord targets.MAY: That's right. Well of course the Paris agreement targets are expressed in terms of temperature increase, and to hold to 1.5, it's true, we need zero, we need net zero by 2050. What they've left out so far, and it's kind of a convenient omission for Liberals, is the 2030 target that is in place is the old Harper target. And to his credit, Minister Wilkinson has suggested he knows it needs to be higher. We actually know from the science exactly how much higher it must be. If we hit our 2030 target, it will make it impossible for them to hit the 2050 one. You have to, this is something that requires ambition that starts now. The most recent UN report last week said we need seven percent reductions in fossil fuel emissions globally every year starting now.

Climate Conference in New York by sailboat was hit by heavy winds, delaying her arrival by a few days, she told social media followers.Still, Portugal's student movement expects thousands to join the marches on Friday, building on momentum of Thunberg's arrival to mobilize ahead of the United Nations COP 25 climate summit in Madrid from Dec. 2-13.""We wish she'd been here, but the movement has to carry on without her - we've got to send our message and pressure politicians ahead of the climate summit,"" Marianna Louca, 14, told Reuters.Thunberg is due to speak in the Portuguese parliament on arrival in Lisbon before going on to Madrid.Her team confirmed she would be arriving in the middle of next week and would also give a news conference with Portuguese student activists.Friday's climate strike is the fourth in Portugal and one of thousands taking place in 2,300 cities in 153 countries around the world, according to Friday For Future's estimates.Portugal was the first country to commit to carbon neutrality by 2050, and its parliament declared a climate emergency in July.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada130","Few promises, one 'lost' opportunity; After two weeks of talks, UN climate negotiators less than enthused with compromise","December 16, 2019 Monday","The Toronto Star","In what was widely denounced as one of the worst outcomes in a quarter century of climate negotiations, United Nations talks ended Sunday morning with the United States and other big polluters blocking even a nonbinding measure encouraging countries to enhance their climate targets next year.Because the U.S. is withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, it was the last chance, at least for some time, for U.S. delegates to sit at the negotiating table at the annual talks. They also used that chance to push back against a compensation mechanism, long sought by developing countries, for the economic losses they suffer from droughts, storms and slow-moving climate effects like sea level rise.The annual negotiations, held in Madrid this year, demonstrated the vast gaps between what scientists say the world needs and what the world's most powerful leaders are prepared to even discuss, let alone do.Along with the U.S., Australia and Brazil were also singled out for blocking on other issues. China and India balked at suggestions of more ambitious climate targets next year.The outcome leaves many important decisions to be made at next year's negotiations, which will begin in Glasgow, Scotland, immediately after the U.S. elections in November. If a new president is elected then, his or her administration could rejoin the Paris agreement only after taking office the following January and then setting out new U.S. national targets and timetables for cutting emissions. Many analysts say China, currently the world's largest emitter, will probably look at what direction the U.S. takes before committing to new emissions reductions targets of its own.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres offered an unusually blunt assessment of the 25th annual negotiations, formally known as the Conference of Parties. ""I am disappointed with the results of #COP25,"" he said on Twitter. ""The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation & finance to tackle the climate crisis.""The negotiations, which had been scheduled to end Friday, extended into the early hours Sunday. It was the longest Conference of Parties ever, and it came against the backdrop of accelerating climate threats.The talks had been meant to iron out the last unresolved details of the landmark Paris climate agreement. Under that pact, reached in 2015, countries set their own targets and timetables to rein in emissions of planet-warming gases.There was a push from both rich and poor countries to commit, at least on paper, to ramp up climate-action targets next year. That is important because even if all countries meet the voluntary targets they have set so far, according to the scientific consensus, emissions are rising at a pace that makes storms and heat waves very likely to become more severe, and coastal cities to be at risk of drowning.But there was no diplomatic consensus on even that. The final declaration was notable for what counts as exceptionally weak diplomatic language: It cited only an ""urgent need"" to reduce emissions in l"
"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada131","Progress: Blessing or curse?","December 14, 2019 Saturday","Kingston Whig-Standard","A few days ago I read an article by a well-known psychologist, someone I generally admire. He shared that he was tired of hearing negative things about the state of our world. Instead, he suggested we celebrate the amazing progress humanity has made, particularly over the past several generations.Even as I was reading I found myself thinking, ""I'm not sure I agree with that."" Don't get me wrong, I am definitely not anti-progress. After all, I'm sitting here in my warm house, typing away on my computer, sipping on a cup of hot tea made by my electric kettle.It makes sense to me that we acknowledge the countless ways our lives have been positively impacted by social, economic and technological change. We're living longer, healthier and more comfortable lives; people, goods and information move quickly and easily across vast distances; innovation continues to drive us forward.And yet ... Many of these advances and improvements are not universally available or even fairly distributed among the peoples of our planet or even in our own country. For example, 40 per cent of First Nations in Canada do not currently have access to clean, safe drinking water, a basic requirement for good health and sanitation.And what about the costs of progress? Our relentless pursuit of the better life we see at the end of the progress rainbow has caused immeasurable harm to communities, to the other species that share Earth and to our environment.When we dam a river for a hydroelectric complex in the Amazon basin, thousands of acres of pristine rainforest must be destroyed. When we transport fossil fuels across our country or through our oceans, we risk spills causing catastrophic damage to fragile ecosystems. And when we develop new technologies that allow us to harvest or produce the food we need to feed our ever-increasing numbers, we don't look beyond ""more-faster-easier"" to see the potential for decimated fish stocks or damaged soil.Who pays for this kind of progress? Similar to the benefits of progress, the costs are not borne equally among those who share this planet. Typically, those without voice or power pay the highest price: Indigenous Peoples forcibly removed from the land that has sustained them for thousands of years; hundreds of species of plants and animals lost forever; the earth itself clear-cut, stripmined and moulded to our needs.And now that we're on to the cost of progress, who gets to decide which ""improvements"" are worth the price that must be paid? All too often, financial gain for the few or political benefit for the powerful trumps the needs of people, communities and the environment.In a more general sense, past generations and baby boomers, in particular, are being called out for foisting the current and anticipated costs of our ""progress at any cost"" attitude onto our descendants.Some of you may have listened as 16-year-old Greta Thunberg challenged world leaders to get on board with what needs to be done to address the escalating climate crisis: ""How dare you? You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. ... We are in the beginning of a mass extinction. And all you can talk about is money and tales of eternal economic growth.""So where did I land after all these musings? I agree with those who encourage us to celebrate the benefits of progress: advancements in science, technology and medicine resulting in better health and increased longevity, for example. And I agree with those who suggest it's time we hit the pause button on the idea of progress at any cost. As Ms. Thunberg says, let's put aside political and financial motivations and look to the science as we make decisions that impact our shared and very precious planet. Progress in and of itself is not inherently good or bad. Obviously, for me, it's a mixed bag.Moving forward, we would do well to remember the Seventh Generation Principle, which is based on an ancient Iroquois philosophy. We cannot think only of our own survival, comfort or well-being. The decisions and actions we take today, as individuals, communities and nations, should result in a sustainable world seven generations into the future.

The letter also touches on issues of western alienation and asks the feds to consider Alberta's economic needs.""Many Albertans are looking for positive signals from the federal government that the national interest includes Alberta,"" Nixon wrote in his letter to Wilkinson.Nixon's letter comes as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau released Wilkinson's mandate letter on Friday, which asked the newly minted environment minister to introduce new ""greenhouse gas reducing measures to exceed Canada's 2030 emissions reduction goal and beginning work so that Canada can achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.""The mandate letter also instructs Wilkinson to advance the government's goal of 30-per-cent zero-emissions vehicle sales by 2030 and 100-per-cent zero-emissions vehicle sales by 2040.The two letters, from Nixon and Trudeau, show the range of pressures facing Wilkinson, who was flying back to Ottawa from the COP25 climate conference in Madrid on Friday, as the feds attempt to implement additional emissions-reduction policies and also soothe fears over economic malaise in the West.""The elements to proceed with this project appear to all be in place. I urge you to move forward with approvals and demonstrate that projects can be advanced in a responsible manner in Canada, for the benefit of all Canadians,"" Nixon wrote.While Wilkinson's office would not comment on the contents of Nixon's letter, spokesperson Sabrina Kim said in an email ""Canadians expect us to oversee fair and thorough environmental assessments."" Nixon's letter lays out eight steps the Alberta government has taken to address recommendations from the arms-length Joint Review Panel, which recommended the federal government approve the oilsands mega-mine on July 26, 2019.For example, the provincial government said it has implemented plans to manage the Ronald Lake bison herd in the area in the face of various challenges, including diseases from another bison herd in Wood Buffalo National Park, in northeastern Alberta.Teck's $20-billion Frontier oilsands has won the backing of First Nations groups in the area, including the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation, which has previously opposed oilsands expansion but signed an impact benefit-agreement with the company for Frontier.However, Athabasca Chipewyan Chief Allan Adam also criticized the provincial government this week for not negotiating with the First Nations on impacts from the Frontier development.""The Alberta government is killing its own oilsands project by not negotiating with ACFN,"" Allan told CBC News.If built, Frontier would be the largest oilsands mine in Alberta. Company filings show the project is designed to produce 85,000 barrels of oil per day by 2026 before additional phases would bring it up to 260,000 bpd by 2037. Teck has pledged to build a power cogeneration facility and ensure the oil produced at Frontier would have an emissions intensity half of the average barrel produced in the U.S.More broadly, the company has pledged to reduce its emissions by 450,000 tones of CO2 per annum by 2030.In July, the Joint Review Panel - informed by recommendations from the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (CEAA) and the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER)- recommended the project be approved contingent on 62 different conditions. The two agencies withheld approvals for parts of the project near a local waterway called Big Creek.At the time the recommendation was issued, then-environment and climate change minister Catherine McKenna's office said that if the minister determined there were significant adverse environmental impacts, the decision would be referred to the wider Liberal cabinet.The CEAA and AER joint-review panel report found that ""there will be significant adverse project and cumulative effects on certain environmental components and indigenous communities"" so a referral from Wilkinson to the wider Liberal cabinet is a likely outcome.Under legislated timel"

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada134","Why we must get Canadian energy to global markets","December 19, 2019 Thursday","The Hamilton Spectator (Ontario, Canada)","Canada is known around the world as a country of inclusiveness, tolerance and respect for human rights. Our energy industry also holds world class standards - among the best anywhere when it comes to innovation, environmental protection and responsible resource development.According to Statistics Canada, nearly half of all money spent by Canadian businesses on environmental protection was contributed by the oil and natural gas extraction industry.It's time for Canadian energy to play a vastly more significant role on the world stage.The world's energy needs are growing significantly. By 2040, the International Energy Agency's World Energy Outlook 2019 projects global energy demand will have increased by 24 per cent. Even taking into account increased use of renewables, oil and natural gas will make up 53 per cent of the total energy used around the world.More than one billion people don't have access to electricity. As the globe's population increases and people strive for a better standard of living, energy demand will increase every year over the next couple of decades. Developing economies are depending on affordable and reliable energy to reduce energy poverty and provide things Canadians take for granted, like clean cooking facilities, lighting, and transportation. Africa, for example, is expected to increase its oil use by a whopping 72 per cent.At December's COP25 (Conference of the Parties summit) in Madrid, Spain, nations around the world faced the challenges of balancing economic stability with their greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction commitments - targets set under the Paris Agreement to reduce emissions and manage global warming. Canada is among them, yet our position is unique, in that we can offer a solution to help bring people out of energy poverty, while reducing net global GHGs.We have an opportunity to do just that, and work with China and India, who account for more than 20 per cent of the world's emissions.So what's the Canadian energy solution? Getting Canadian LNG (liquefied natural gas) to global markets that need it.The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects by 2040 global demand for natural gas will increase nearly 36 per cent, replacing coal as the world's second-largest energy source. In the year-over-year period from 2017 to 2018, China's natural gas consumption increased a staggering 33 per cent.Canada has an abundant natural gas resource that's estimated to be 1,220 trillion cubic feet; enough to serve current markets for 300 years, and positioning us well to meet emerging demand worldwide. Canadian LNG would create up to 65 per cent fewer greenhouse gases than coal when used in Asia to generate electricity, as Canadian LNG facilities will have lower emissions intensity than LNG produced anywhere else.According to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, China alone is adding one large new coal-fired power plant to the grid every two weeks. The window for Canada is open right now. Canada's significant natural gas resources can help meet global demand and reduce global GHG emissions by displacing coal-fired electricity generation in China, India and Southeast Asia.With the total net global GHG reduction from each Canadian LNG plant estimated to be about 100 MtCO2e per year, we can achieve the equivalent of removing 22 million cars from the roads. It means Canada can make a much bigger difference outside of our borders in lowering global GHG emissions than we could ever achieve by focusing only on ourselves.In turn, these emissions reductions must be recognized both domestically and internationally and contribute to our commitment under the Paris Agreement. For this to happen, Article 6 of the Paris Agreement must enable countries to share offset credits - called Internationally Transferable Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) - from another country.If Canada, as the supplier of this cleaner burning fuel, is able to receive credit for a portion of these carbon offsets, Canada will be better positioned to meet its Paris climate accord targets while allowing additional LNG facility development to take place at home.If Canada can take this opportunity to grow an industry around LNG to meet global demand, it will also create economic and other benefits across Canada. The Canadian oil and natural gas industry contributes billions to government revenues every year, which supports our social fabric and standard of living by helping to fund schools, nurses, teachers and infrastructure, and making life more affordable for all Canadians.In addition, all Canadians deserve opportunities for prosperity, which the energy industry helps to support across the country.The industry remains positive as we look at the opportunity ahead. For Canada, a strong oil and natural gas industry keeps our communities strong. This includes providing opportunities for Indigenous communities and businesses to play an active role in resource development. For many Indigenous communities, involvement with the energy industry provides a path toward defeating poverty and in turn leads the country further along our road to reconciliation with Indigenous peoples.It's essential that we build upon our energy industry with innovation and thoughtful foresight so that we can all benefit socially, economically and environmentally, here in Canada and beyond our borders.Tim McMillan is president and CEO of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. \£9 Troy Media\l"

Russia has previously said it does not interfere in other countries' internal affairs.The White House had earlier said in a statement that U.S. President Donald Trump ""denounced foreign efforts to undermine Chilean institutions, democracy, or society.""Chile has been mired in chaos over the last two weeks, which led center-right Pinera on Wednesday to abruptly withdraw Chile as host of an upcoming APEC summit and a major climate change conference, to ""take care of problems at home.""Trump, who had been expected to sign a trade deal with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the APEC meeting in Santiago in November, said on Thursday he supported Pinera's decision to back out of hosting the trade and climate change conferences.The State Department official said that foreign interference was not the only trigger for the recent violence, which has seen buses and buildings burned, Santiago's metro system shut down, and much of the city at times grind to a halt.But he added that Russia had ""sought to exacerbate divisions, foment conflict and all round act as spoiler to responsible democratic debate.""NEW CONSTITUTION?Protests over a hike in metro fares spun out of control across Chile nearly two weeks ago. Riots, arson and looting have since left at least 18 dead and led to the arrest of 7,000, prosecutors said. Chilean businesses have lost more than $1.4 billion.Pinera, a billionaire businessman, has scrambled to react to the unrest, pledging worker-friendly economic reforms and reshuffling about one-third of his cabinet. But opposition lawmakers that met with members of Pinera's cabinet at the La Moneda presidential palace on Thursday said it was not enough.The leftist opposition called on the president to scrap Chile's existing constitution and draft a more worker-friendly one, warning that without major action Pinera would not successfully quell the protests.""We are going to continue to insist on a new constitution until we are heard,"" said Fuad Chahin, head of the centrist Christian Democratic (DC) party.Socialist Party head Alvaro Elizalde said Pinera was ""not listening to the demands of citizens."" He called the existing constitution, adopted during the 1973-1990 military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, a ""straight-jacket"" that had condemned Chile to poverty and inequality.Pinera's predecessor, Michelle Bachelet, had promised to change the constitution, but ultimately failed in the teeth of right-wing opposition and a crowded legislative calendar.Newly appointed interior minister Gonzalo Blumel said Pinera's government had not ruled out ""structural reforms,"" without elaborating on what they might be.HOTELS HITPinera's abrupt move to cancel both the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting and December's high-profile COP25 climate change summit caught much of the world off-guard. Officials from both conferences have been scrambling to find new venues.""The cancellations have hit us hard,"" said a desk attendant at a major international hotel chain in Santiago who asked not to be identified. ""A delegation from APEC... had reserved 100 of the 280 rooms we have at the hotel.""Santiago's metro system, once the envy of Latin America, sustained at least $400 million in damage in past weeks. Rioters set fire to 21 metro stations, burned seven trains, and attacked more than 2,000 buses. One hundred stoplights are destroyed each day, officials said.The number of protesters has fallen sharply since last Friday, when more than 1 million Chileans marched on Santiago. But violence, looting, arson and skirmishes with police continue.In Santiago's central Plaza Italia on Thursday, mounds of rubble, trash, broken glass and smoldering fires littered streets and sidewalks, even as new protesters began to gather by early evening.Spray-painted messages calling for Pinera to go and denouncing human rights violations by security forces now coat store fronts and windows of trendy cafes once popular with tourists and university students.Cristian Bigorra, a 64-year old who attends a parking garage nearby, said both politicians and violent protesters were to blame for the still simmering chaos.""Words can't describe what they've done to this city,"" said Bigorra. But, he added, Pinera had ""done nothing"" to change things even as violence had mounted.A team of United Nations human rights officials arrived in Chile on Tuesday to scrutinize allegations of excessive use of force, torture, sexual assault and deaths at the hands of security forces during the recent unrest.Pinera on Wednesday said he welcomed the scrutiny and said the country had ""nothing to hide.""

Here is what's on the radar of our editors for the morning of Dec. 2.What we are watching in Canada ...MISSISSAUGA, Ont. - Canada's premiers are meeting today just outside Toronto for the first time as a group since the federal election.The campaign laid bare some regional divisions, and the premiers of Saskatchewan and Alberta - where the Liberals won no seats - have been especially vocal about their asks from Ottawa.Saskatchewan's Scott Moe and Alberta's Jason Kenney want Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to change the equalization formula, but there is unlikely to be consensus on that around the premiers' table. Moe, who is chair of the Council of the Federation, says all of the premiers will come to the meeting with various priorities and differing opinions, but the goal is to find a few issues on which they have common ground.Ontario Premier Doug Ford says health care is a concern for everyone, and that all premiers want a 5.2 per cent annual increase to the Canada Health Transfer.Climate policy will be another tough area to get all parties on side. Ontario, Saskatchewan, Alberta and Manitoba have all launched legal challenges against the federal carbon price, while others have accepted it or launched their own programs.---Also this ...A hockey player paralyzed in the Humboldt Broncos bus crash says he's thrilled with the progress he's made since receiving spinal surgery in Thailand a month ago.Doctors implanted an epidural stimulator in Ryan Straschnitzki's spine and one week later injected stem cells above and below the injury to try to reverse some of the damage.The 20-year-old has just a week to go before returning home to Airdrie, Alberta.Straschnitzki, paralyzed from the chest down, says he's been able to straighten his legs and walk with the use of a wheeled machine.He says the experience has left him at a loss for words, shocked and excited - all at the same time.Straschnitzki, who's hoping to make the Canadian sledge hockey team, took his sled with him to Thailand and has been sitting in it as part of his rehab. He has finally been cleared by doctors and is to get some ice time in Bangkok later this week.---ICYMI (in case you missed it) ...WHITEHORSE, Yukon - Canada is getting its first Arctic university.This past week, the Yukon legislature passed a bill to make Yukon College a university. It will be an institution with an Indigenous flavour that will make it as unique as the region it is to serve. ""Everybody knows we're moving toward something big and something special,"" said Tom Ullyett, chairman of the board of governors.The idea of a northern university has been kicked around since at least 2007 when a survey in all three territories found residents wanted more influence over Arctic research. Northern First Nations have been asking for one for 50 years.Nunavut and the Northwest Territories have colleges that teach courses toward degrees from southern institutions and have announced plans to broaden their post-secondary offerings.Yukon College has done the same in science, education and social work and also offers courses towards bachelor's degrees in Indigenous governance and business administration.Once the college is transformed, it will become the first institution in the territories to grant a degree under its own name. Diplomas the first graduates of the governance program get next spring will read ""Yukon University.""The institution, which will also offer trades programs, will allow northerners to further their education closer to home.---What we are watching in the U.S. ...NEW YORK - A wave of new laws in 15 states that allow people to make claims of sexual abuse going back decades could bring a deluge of lawsuits against the Roman Catholic Church that could surpass anything seen so far in its clergy abuse crisis.Associated Press interviews with attorneys and clergy abuse watchdog groups found it could result in at least 5,000 new cases against the church and more than $4 billion in payouts.It's a financial reckoning playing out in such Catholic strongholds as New York, California and New Jersey, among eight states that go the furthest with ""lookback windows"" allowing sex abuse claims no matter how old.Catholic leaders worry about the difficulty of defending such old cases, and more dioceses are considering bankruptcy and victim compensation funds.---What we are watching in the rest of the world ...MADRID - Delegates from almost 200 countries have begun a two-week international climate conference in Madrid that seeks to step up efforts to stop global warming.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is warning that the efforts so far are insufficient to overcome the ""point of no return"" in climate change.""What is lacking is political will,"" Guterres told reporters on the eve of the COP25 meeting, which opened today.The summit, which moved to the Spanish capital after Chile had to pull out amid anti-government protests, aims to put the finishing touches to the rules governing the 2015 Paris accord.That involves creating a functioning international emissions-trading system and compensating poor countries for losses they suffer from rising sea levels and other consequences of climate change. ---This report by The Canadian Press was first published on Dec. 2, 2019.\l"
"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada142","Science warnings, US retreat add urgency to UN climate talks","November 30, 2019 Saturday","Red Deer Advocate","MADRID - Mass protests, a last-minute venue change and talk of climate tipping points are adding some unplanned drama to this year's international talks on tackling global warming.Delegates from almost 200 countries had hoped to put the finishing touches to the rules governing the 2015 Paris accord, ironing out a few wrinkles left over from last year's conference in Katowice, Poland, and setting the scene for a major review of their efforts in 2020.But then Brazil pulled its offer of hosting the talks and stand-in Chile, rattled by anti-government protests, cancelled five weeks before the meeting. Next, President Donald Trump served formal notice that the United States was quitting the Paris accord, delivering a symbolic blow to one of his predecessor's signature achievements.And scientists? Well, they didn't have any good news either. Study after study published in recent months has underscored the rapid pace of global warming and the need to urgently cut emissions of greenhouse gases.""We have to do more in less time,"" said Spanish environment minister Teresa Ribera, whose country stepped in at short notice to host the talks, saying it wanted to support ""constructive multilateralism"" in the wake of Chile's announcement and the U.S. withdrawal.U.N. climate chief Patricia Espinosa said Saturday that ""science tells us we are still in time"" to tackle the climate crisis.""That doesn't mean changing the world by tomorrow, but we must make decisions today,"" she said during a visit to the meeting venue.Organizers expect around 25,000 visitors, including heads of state, scientists, seasoned negotiators and activists to attend the two-week meeting.The main items on the agenda include finalizing rules on global carbon markets and agreeing how poor countries should be compensated for destruction largely caused by emissions from rich nations.Proposals to create a worldwide market for emissions permits have been around for decades. The idea is that putting a price on carbon dioxide - the main greenhouse gas - and gradually reducing the available permits will encourage countries and companies to cut their emissions, notably by shifting away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy sources.The European Union and some other jurisdictions already operate limited emissions trading systems, but efforts to roll these out worldwide have been hampered by fears that the lack of robust and transparent rules could corrupt the market.""It would be great news to finalize this issue,"" said Ribera. But she warned that the ""solvency and integrity of the system"" was a concern.""If we cannot complete it correctly, it's better to lay the ground for later completion,"" said Ribera.That view was echoed by Yamide Dagnet, a former EU climate negotiator now with the Washington-based environmental think-tank World Resources Institute.""Without proper oversight and robustness these mechanisms could severely undercut climate action by creating loopholes, letting countries off the hook for making meaningful emission cuts, resulting in double counting and jeopardizing environmental integrity,"" she said.The question of compensating poor countries for environmental destruction - technically referred to as loss and damage - is also likely to be sensitive, said Dagnet. Attributing specific weather disasters such as hurricanes and floods, or slow but irreversible changes like sea level rise and desertification, to climate change remains a delicate issue given the potential sums involved.Concerns about the cost of climate change are growing on all fronts. Trump cited financial demands on the United States as one of the reasons for quitting the Paris accord; European countries have hesitated to raise fuel prices for fear of sparking yellow vest-style protests like those seen in France; meanwhile, businesses are beginning to consider the price not just of reducing emissions but also of failing to do so.Scientists say the time to act is now, if the world wants to meet the goal set in Paris of keeping global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), ideally 1.5 C by the end of the century. By some measures average temperatures have already increased by one degree Celsius since pre-industrial times, with the sharpest rise occurring in the last few decades.""Global warming is going faster,"" said Johan Rockstr&#246;m, co-director of Germany's Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. ""Climate impacts are occurring earlier and we are approaching potentially irreversible thresholds earlier than we previously thought.""Rockstr&#246;m and several colleagues recently warned that the world is heading for several "" tipping points "" that could sharply accelerate the pace of climate change.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada146","The simplest of climate models run decades ago accurately projected global warming","December 5, 2019 Thursday","Sarnia Observer","It's a common refrain from those who question mainstream climate science findings: The computer models scientists use to project future global warming are inaccurate and shouldn't be trusted to help policy-makers decide whether to take potentially expensive steps to rein in greenhouse gas emissions.A new study effectively snuffs out that argument by looking at how climate models published between 1970 - before such models were the supercomputer-dependent behemoths of physical equations covering glaciers, ocean pH, and vegetation, as they are today - and 2007.The study, published Wednesday in Geophysical Research Letters, finds that most of the models examined were uncannily accurate in projecting how much the world would warm in response to increasing amounts of planet-warming greenhouse gases. Such gases, chiefly the main longlived greenhouse gas pollutant carbon dioxide, hit record highs this year, according to a new UN report out Tuesday.They are now higher than at any other time in human history.The study does fault some of the models, including one of the most famous calculations by former NASA researcher James Hansen, for overestimating warming because they assumed there would be even greater amounts of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere than what actually occurred. These assumptions mostly involved non-CO2 greenhouse gases, such as methane.Hansen's projection, says study lead author Zeke Hausfather, a researcher at the University of California at Berkeley, erred by about 50 per cent because it did not foresee a significant drop in emissions of substances that deplete the stratospheric ozone layer.Many of those gases are also powerful global warming agents. Hansen also didn't foresee a temporary stabilization in methane emissions during the 2000s, Hausfather says.However, his model, like many of the others examined in the new study, got the basic relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of warming they would cause, correct. The errors came from poorly predicting bigger wild cards: How societal factors would govern future emissions through economic growth, emissions reduction agreements, and other factors.""The big take-away is that climate models have been around a long time, and in terms of getting the basic temperature of the Earth right, they've been doing that for a long time,"" Hausfather said in an interview.""Climate models today aren't perfect, they're still being improved,"" he says.While a figure and calculations included in the study seems to show that many of the models had a slight warm bias over time, Hausfather says the study found ""no detectable consistent overestimation or underestimation of future warming"" in the models that were examined.On temperature, there's considerable confidence that the current models are accurately capturing the planet's response to record amounts of greenhouse gases in the air. However, there are many other aspects of a changing climate that contain bigger uncertainties, such as cloud formation and how small atmospheric particles known as aerosols could alter the types of clouds that form.This could either enhance or diminish warming.""Temperature is easy, other climate variables like precipitation are a lot harder.""For the study, researchers evaluated climate models on how they performed regarding the amount of projected global mean temperature change compared to what actually took place over time.On this count, 10 out of the 17 models examined were virtually indistinguishable from observations, the study found - in other words a near-perfect match.They also looked at the relationship between a model's temperature projection and the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, also known as external forcing. On this comparison, 14 out of the 17 models ""were not differentiable from observations,"" and two of the 14 showed more warming than actually occurred, with one showing less warming, Hausfather says.""We argue that that second test is a more accurate one,"" Hausfather says, because it allows scientists to control for the fact that models might get the amount of external forcing wrong, but the relationship between greenhouse gases and temperature change correct.""By looking at this relationship between temperature and forcing, we can evaluate the model's performance on its physics and not on its crystal ball of future emissions,"" Hausfather said.Researchers who were not involved in the new study said it employed relatively simple statistical analyses that may miss some key influences on global surface temperatures over time.For example, Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said he has doubts about the study's key conclusion that ""climate models are effectively capturing the processes"" that drive the global mean surface temperature over many decades.He says the reality is more complex than the study shows, since some of the more uncertain factors about climate change, such as how the water cycle is responding as the world warms, could influence global temperatures, as do hurricanes and aerosols, which are either not included in climate models or, in the case of aerosols, a big question mark since they can influence cloud formation that in turn can alter temperatures.According to Trenberth, the mere fact that the models have been generally on target doesn't prove that they are getting such complex processes correct, and further research is necessary for that. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2019 Osprey Media Group Inc.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada148","Presents Corporate Update, COVID Response and 2019 Annual Results","May 19, 2020 Tuesday 8:55 AM PST","Market News Publishing","SIGMA LITHIUM RESOURCES CORP (""SGMA-V"") - Presents Corporate Update, COVID Response and 2019 Annual ResultsSIGMA Lithium Resources Corporation (""Sigma"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to present the project progress update and announce the filing of its financial statements and management's discussion and analysis for the year ended December 31, 2019.COVID-19 RESPONSESigma's management has been continuously assessing the situation and taking the necessary actions to address employee health and safety. Sigma is abiding by all government restrictions relating to COVID-19, notably in Sao Paulo and Toronto, where administrative and support staff, as well as third party accounting service providers have been working from home. The Company has implemented several protocols, including significantly restricting travel and generally requiring remote working for administrative personnel. Due to Sigma's pre-operating status, the required changes at its Grota do Cirilo project (the ""Project"") have not been substantial.Sigma is actively supporting its communities of Itinga and Aracuai in the Jequitinhonha Valley. As previously announced, the Company procured 12 tons of sodium hypochlorite (hospital sanitizer liquid bleach) to be distributed to numerous hospitals, medical clinics, prisons, nursing homes, care centers for people with disabilities and religious entities in the Vale do Jequitinhonha region. This amount should supply them until December 2020. The municipality of Itinga conducted a comprehensive disinfecting program of the municipal food marketplace and public areas using the chemicals provided by Sigma.""While we remain fully committed to bringing Sigma to production, our top priority will continue to be protecting the health and safety of our employees and their families and our communities,"" commented Calvyn Gardner, Sigma's CEO. ""I couldn't be prouder of the way our employees, our communities in Vale do Jequitinhonha have responded to these unprecedented times. We have been actively supporting the efforts of the municipalities of Itinga and Aracuai to address this challenge. We will continue to engage with the municipalities to plan new initiatives in the coming months.""As of May 15th, 2020, the Brazilian government has not introduced measures which impede the normal operation of the Project. On March 20, 2020, the Brazilian Ministry of Mines and Energy issued a decree which includes the mining sector amongst the industries considered to be ""essential"" to the prosperity and economy of the country. As a result, the on-site activities of operational and pre-operational mining companies in Brazil are not subject to the physical movement restrictions and shelter-in-place, lockdowns and state border restrictions imposed by certain states and municipalities as a result of the COVID-19. Nevertheless, the Company is following closely other macroeconomic, capital markets, political and social changes that will affect the Company as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and its impact on the auto industry and demand for electric vehicles.MOST RECENT HIGHLIGHTS SUBSEQUENT TO THE YEAR-END AND IN 2019, (IN REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER): Following the submission and ongoing review by ANM (""Agencia Nacional de Mineracao"") in Brazil of the PAE (""Plano de Aproveitamento Economico"") for the Barreiro deposit at the Project, Sigma has commissioned its environmental studies and initiated the process of obtaining its environmental license in Minas Gerais. On March 16, 2020, Sigma formally engaged Banco do Brasil S.A. (""BB""), Brazil's largest bank, to advise and support the Company to prepare a financing package to fund the Company. BB has been in active discussions with various development banks and development agencies in Brazil: Banco do Nordeste (BNB), BNDES, BDMG and FINEP (the ""Development Banks""). The Company is seeking commitments from the Development Banks for an aggregate amount to complete a financing package that, added together with the remaining US$27 million portion of the Mitsui Pre-Payment (defined below), would fund the Project construction in full. On February 21, 2020, Duro Felguera (""DF"") and Primero Group Americas Inc. (a subsidiary of Primero Group Ltd.) (""Primero"") successfully completed the first phase of Early Contractor Involvement (""ECI"") with Sigma and provided an updated Guaranteed Maximum Price (""GMP"") of US$70 million for the engineering, procurement and construction (""EPC"") of the Project. The construction cost in the GMP of US$59 million was lower than the US$66 million for plant and infrastructure estimated in the Feasibility Study Report (as defined below). For comparison purposes and to maintain consistency with the Feasibility Study Report, the GMP was calculated utilizing the same foreign exchange rate of the Feasibility Study Report of US$ 1 = BRL 3.85. On May 15th the exchange rate was US$ 1 = BRL 5.89. The approximate 50% devaluation of the Brazilian Real to date will have the overall effect of decreasing the expected capital expenditure (""Capex"") of the Project, a material portion of which is expected to be sourced domestically in Brazil and is, therefore, to be denominated in Brazilian Real. The parties are currently negotiating a Memorandum of Understanding formalizing the next steps of the detailed engineering phase of the Project. On November 29, 2019, the Company entered into an agreement with A10 Group, a group of companies owned by certain directors of the Company providing for a $6.6 million (US$5 million) revolver credit facility (the ""A10 Group Credit Facility""), bearing interest at 11% per annum, calculated from the day funds are drawn. This facility has a one-year term, which is the maturity for all funds drawn, and allows funding for lender approved expenses. As of December 31, 2019, $311,760 (US$240,000) had been drawn on the A10 Group Credit Facility. As of May 14, 2020, $1,388,732 (US$986,000) had been drawn on this facility. On November 8, 2019, the Company's Chief Strategic Officer addressed the World Climate Summit during the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP 25 in Madrid and presented the case study of the Company as an ESG ""green lithium"" company and the role played by its investors in providing the capital and the leadership to drive the implementation of environmental and social best practices. On November 6, 2019, the Company filed the technical report titled ""Grota do Cirilo Lithium Project, Aracuai and Itinga Regions, Minas Gerais, Brazil, National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report on Feasibility Study Final Report"", dated October 18, 2019 and with an effective date of September 16, 2019 (the ""Feasibility Study Report"") on SEDAR ( HYPERLINK http://www.sedar.comwww.sedar.com). Based on the design considered by the Feasibility Study Report, the Project's commercial production plant will have the capacity to process 1.5 million metric tonnes of spodumene ore per year, expandable to 3 million metric tonnes within the same production complex. The lithium process design is proprietary and includes Dense Media Separation (""DMS"") technology. The commercial production plant design is projected to produce 220,000 tonnes of high-quality battery-grade 6% lithium oxide concentrate per annum, with one of the lowest reported levels of impurities in the world. At a later stage, Sigma has the option to double the commercial production plant capacity to process 3 million metric tonnes of spodumene ore per year, producing an expected 440,000 tonnes of high-quality battery-grade 6% lithium oxide concentrate, subject to completion of all related studies and assessments. The economic analysis in the Feasibility Study Report includes an after tax NPV for the Project's Xuxa deposit and the commercial production plant of US$249 million, IRR of 43% and payback of 3.1 years. The Feasibility Study Report includes (i) a Mineral Reserves estimate of 10.27 million tonnes of proven reserves with 1.45% Li2O content and 3.52 million tonnes of probable reserves with 1.47% Li2O content, and (ii) a Mineral Resources estimate of 26.34 million tonnes of measured resources with 1.39% Li2O content, and 19.44 million tonnes of indicated resources with 1.37% Li2O content and 6.6 million tonnes of inferred resources. This represents approximately 1,560,919 tonnes of Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (""LCE"") in the measured and indicated categories, with a further 220,070 tonnes LCE in the inferred category. The estimates were prepared using a cut-off grade of 0.5% Li2O. In July 2019, the Company filed at the ANM (""Agencia Nacional de Mineracao"") in Brazil the PAE (""Plano de Aproveitamento Economico"") for the Project's Barreiro deposit. The PAE is the study required by the Brazilian regulators to authorize the commencement of commercial mining activities, and an approved PAE is required for the environmental licensing process. Sigma initiated sample selection for metallurgical studies and pre-feasibility level test work for the Barreiro deposit in order to confirm that its lithium spodumene can be economically processed through the same DMS processing circuit of the commercial production plant designed to process the spodumene of the Project's Xuxa deposit. On June 11, 2019, the Company announced that it had obtained the required environmental licenses for both construction (""LP"") and installation (""LI"") of the commercial production plant from the environmental authority of the State of Minas Gerais, the Council of Environmental Policy (""Conselho Estadual de Politica Ambiental - COPAM"") in Brazil. COPAM has issued a Dual LP and LI Certificate for a period of six years expiring on May 31, 2025. In April 2019, lithium spodumene concentrate samples were validated by several large potential customers in the chemical and cathode industries, who confirmed their exceptional quality (battery grade above 6%) and very low impurities (specifically low levels of alkal"

A few thousand people protested outside the presidential palace.It was unclear if the relative tranquility would continue Thursday, the first day in a long holiday weekend in Chile.The decision to call off the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and U.N. global climate gatherings, planned for November and December, respectively, dealt a major blow to Chile's image as a regional oasis of stability and economic development.But leaders across Chile's political spectrum, and protesters on the streets Wednesday, mostly said they accepted Pi\'f1era's decision, although many lamented cancelling the climate summit. Chile has moved faster than many South American countries to reduce carbon emissions, and activists and politicians alike had high hopes for the summit.""This has been a very difficult decision that causes us great pain,"" Pi\'f1era said in a televised address. ""A president always has to put the needs of his countrymen first.""Pi\'f1era said he was forced to cancel both events due to the chaos unleashed by 12 days of protests. Demonstrators are demanding greater economic equality and better public services in a country long seen as an economic success story. Shops have been vandalized and buildings set on fire, shutting down numerous subway stations.Heraldo Mu\'f1oz, president of Chile's opposition Party for Democracy, said he thought it was unfortunate the climate summit was cancelled.""On the other hand, the desire to hold the meeting wasn't realistic,"" he said. ""We have to focus on domestic affairs.""Some demonstrators said they agreed with Pi\'f1era's decision.""The political situation right now in Chile isn't right for talking productively about climate change,"" said Micha Vergara, a 20-year-old art student.Trade and climate negotiators scrambled to find new locations for their summits, aimed at resolving tariff-related conflicts between China and the U.S. and finalizing countries' climate rules in advance of a bigger summit next year during which governments will be asked to commit to new emissions limits.President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping had hoped to sign a modest trade agreement at the APEC summit, formerly scheduled to take place in Santiago on Nov. 16-17. Under the tentative deal, the U.S. had agreed to suspend plans to raise tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports, and Beijing had agreed to step up purchases of U.S. farm products.White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said U.S. officials were ""awaiting potential information regarding another location,"" but it was unclear if any had been proposed. Gidley added that Trump wanted to sign the deal with China ""within the same time frame,"" hinting that a separate event could occur outside a summit.The so-called Phase One trade agreement did little to address the underlying U.S. grievances against China, including its alleged practice of forcing foreign firms to hand over trade secrets, stealing technology, and unfairly subsidizing Chinese firms. China's leaders have been reluctant to make the kind of policy reforms that would satisfy Washington, worrying such concessions would mean scaling back their aspirations to become a world leader in advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and driverless cars.Still, the apparent cancellation of the summit ""removes a hard deadl"

In riots sparked by anger over fare hikes, masked and hooded protesters have torched buses, metro stations, supermarkets, banks and the high-rise headquarters of a major energy firm.Around the city, flames and smoke mixed with tear gas and water cannon spray as armed forces mobilized on the streets for the first time in almost 30 years in a country that still shudders at the memory of military rule.Fare-dodging protests largely by school children and students exploded into violent riots on Friday. Amid the looting, arson and clashes, thousands of residents of rich and poor neighborhoods alike also took to the streets to express a more widespread discontent over rising living costs and patchy public services that is boiling beneath the surface of one of South American's wealthiest and most liberal economies.The demonstrations spread around the country over the weekend, and there was little sign of tempers cooling.""This is not a simple protest over the rise of metro fares, this is an outpouring for years of oppression that have hit mainly the poorest,"" Karina Sepulveda, an anthropology student, told Reuters at a protest in central Santiago on Sunday as she banged a frying pan with a wooden spoon.""The illusion of the model Chile is over.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada151","Alberta gas producers need Canada to preach the clean benefits of LNG","December 10, 2019 Tuesday","Edmonton Journal (Alberta)","Petroleum producers and the province are pushing hard for more LNG plants in the country, hoping to create new export opportunities for Canada's massive supplies of natural gas.They also want to see the federal government promote the same goal, and push for international recognition of how liquefied natural gas from Canada can lower global emissions elsewhere by supplanting higher-emitting sources of energy.It's become one of the industry's core messages: Canada can assist other countries by replacing coal used in electricity generation, while creating jobs and business at home by producing more gas. But lukewarm comments from Canada's new environment minister, Jonathan Wilkinson, seem to undercut the notion Ottawa will seek such recognition at the international climate change conference now taking place in Madrid.For gas producers - and the Alberta government - it's a serious concern.""There is certainly a lot of politics around (the comments) but in reality, I think it is a net benefit to Canada and the world"" to develop Canadian LNG facilities, said Andy Mah, CEO of Advantage Oil &; Gas, one of several producers that have joined forces to promote a proposed export terminal in the country.""People don't want to sit back and look at the facts, and the facts are other countries are going to replace (existing) energy with coal ... If we are here to help others and the world, that's the place Canada can be.""If built, these facilities would create new markets for Canadian gas producers as their existing market share in the United States is expected to shrink.On Friday, Wilkinson spoke to reporters about Canada's position heading into the COP25 conference in Madrid, but he created more questions in Alberta than he answered.Under the Paris climate agreement, Canada has committed to lower its GHG emissions by 30 per cent below 2005 levels by the year 2030.The Madrid conference will discuss Article 6 of the accord, which would allow for international trading. Countries with lower emissions could sell carbon credit allowances to higher emitters, and this should ""establish a policy foundation for an emissions trading system, which could help lead to a global price on carbon,"" according to the International Chamber of Commerce.Wilkinson said he would push Canada's negotiators to ensure Article 6 is transparent and doesn't allow for double-counting of credits for lowering emissions in one country.While there are ""all kinds of different trades that could happen under Article 6 ... it is certainly possible that LNG could fit into that but at this stage, I think we are much more focused on getting the rules right,"" he said.""We are not counting on emissions reductions through trading.""That doesn't answer a key question for Alberta or the industry. If the country generates more emissions to produce and export supercooled LNG from Canada, will it get any credit for lowering global emissions by displacing higher-emitting coal used in power generation? Wilkinson wasn't clear, and didn't provide any clarity when talking to the Globe and Mail. ""I think we've got to be very careful about the LNG argument,"" he said, according to the newspaper.Those comments caught the attention of Premier Jason Kenney.Speaking in Ottawa, Kenney said he was disappointed with the response, pointing out various governments in different provinces - from British Columbia and Alberta to Quebec - have backed LNG development.""This is the single biggest thing that Canada could do to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. We should not make the mistake of looking at Canada as though we live under a sealed biodome,"" the premier told reporters.A world energy outlook report issued last month by the Paris-based International Energy Agency said coal-to-gas switching can offer ""quick wins"" for reducing global emissions.Natural gas generates one-third fewer emissions than coal, on average, for each unit of heat used across industry and in the building sector, and about half of the emissions per unit of electricity that's generated, the report states.The president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers said Wilkinson's comments were ""really making the point it didn't seem to be his intent to enable Canadian gas.""""There's no chance Canada will meet its Paris commitment unless we enable Article 6, and that then leaves some very bad outcomes for Canada as a whole,"" Tim McMillan said in an interview from Madrid.""Either we don't live up to what we have committed to ... or we start making dramatic policy decisions that could hamper investment for those projects.""Environmental organizations say the new minister is simply acknowledging reality and that sharing emission reductions will be part of difficult international negotiations.Isabelle Turcotte, director of federal policy at the Pembina Institute, said she was happy to see the minister's cautious approach.Letting two countries claim credit for emissions reductions might make progress on paper, ""but in reality, we're actually emitting more than we were initially,"" said Turcotte, who is also at the conference.But the industry and provincial government aren't about to give up on this point.Mah pointed out many countries are trying to move out of energy poverty and Canada has a part to play in meeting their needs, while generating jobs and revenue in this country to help with the ongoing energy transition.""Overall gas demand ... is going up immensely in the next 10 years,"" he added.""So do we want to be part of that in Canada, and also part of helping global emissions?"" It's a question the federal minister will have to have to answer clearly in the next week. Chris Varcoe is a Calgary Herald columnist.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada152","Climate Crisis In The Spotlight; Montreal was a hotbed of activism in 2019, but did it make any real difference?","January 4, 2020 Saturday","The Gazette (Montreal)","On a warm day in mid-March, more than 150,000 students from kindergarten to university took to the streets of Montreal to demand urgent action on climate change.It turned out to be the largest such demonstration in the world that day. The mass mobilization put Montreal on the map as a hotbed of climate activism and helped make the climate crisis the defining issue of 2019, locally, nationally and globally.What followed confirmed the trend: Montreal Mayor Val\'e9rie Plante took centre stage among heads of state at the United Nations to tout the city's climate agenda; Greta Thunberg, the Swedish climate activist who has galvanized her generation, led half a million people on a historic march through Montreal, one of her first stops after arriving in North America by solar-powered yacht; three members of Extinction Rebellion scaled the Jacques Cartier Bridge to unfurl a banner, closing the key span and causing a monster traffic jam.These were the standout moments in a year that seemed to hold such promise as a turning point in the battle against climate change, yet drew to a sobering conclusion.There was an awakening in 2019 about a peril we've been conveniently ignoring for decades. By some estimates, six million people joined demonstrations around the world in the last week of September. But the sense of urgency on the streets has not yet reached many of the decision-makers responsible for the actions needed to avert calamity.Crucial climate negotiations in Madrid ended in failure in December after Thunberg hastily recrossed the Atlantic by boat when the talks were moved there at the last minute from restive Chile.It's a paradox that is sure to continue in 2020, said Fran\'e7ois Geoffroy of La plan\'e8te s'invite au parlement, one of the organizers of the historic demonstration in Montreal. It's ""disappointing, but not surprising,"" he said, that the COP25 meeting in Madrid ended in a stalemate.""It's certainly a slap in the face. ... It's an annual slap in the face,"" Geoffroy said. ""But it only confirms that change is not going to come from COP. It's not going to come from states and governments. It's going to come from the bottom up.""This has been especially true in Montreal. Throughout 2019, a number of new organizations took their place on the environmental scene to bolster stalwart groups like Equiterre and Greenpeace.Pacte pour la Transition made its debut in late 2018, shortly after the International Panel for Climate Change report revealed the most devastating effects of global warming will be felt at a lower temperature and sooner than previously believed.La Plan\'e8te s'invite au parlement formed in light of the environment's absence in the 2018 Quebec election campaign. Rapidly, they gained attention, prominence and credibility.Over the winter, spinoff groups formed on university and college campuses under the umbrella of La plan\'e8te s'invite \'e0 l'universit\'e9. Quebec's students flexed their muscles on March 15, a strike day for youth around the world.In the spring, Extinction Rebellion made its debut in Quebec. An offshoot of a nascent U.K.-based group, its MO is peaceful civil disobedience, like blocking traffic or sit-ins.Together, these groups joined forces to press the case of the environment to a federal government that talks the talk but doesn't always walk the walk; a Quebec government that only seems to see the environment in terms of a business opportunity to market its relatively clean hydro power; and city governments, like Montreal, that are leading the way, but can only do so much.After the high of Thunberg's visit on Sept. 27, they've been reflecting and strategizing on what's next.""We've already showed what we're capable of,"" said Geoffroy. ""We're stronger, more energized, more united than ever.""Still, the greenest Montrealers can be forgiven for feeling a little blue as 2019 wraps up.Emissions rose 2.1 per cent worldwide in 2018, according to the latest data, despite the provisions of the Paris Accord. And though China, which is responsible for a third of global carbon emissions, has made significant investments in renewable energy, its greenhouse gas output has still increased.The pro-pipel"

""I think there's room for consensus on that.""Such plans could take shape informally among likeminded party leaders in coming weeks, May suggested.""We could have some time of just talking to one another as leaders on the phone, trying to figure out are there places where we could decide now - let's work to consensus on things like pharmacare, let's work to consensus on climate action.""Parties could also agree on more affordable cellphone rates and collecting a fair share of taxes from global, web-based businesses operating in Canada, she said.May stressed the importance of working with NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh despite lingering anger over what she sees as grossly unfair attacks on her party in British Columbia during the campaign.May hopes leaders will agree to bring a more civil tone to parliamentary debate after seeing respect and decorum disintegrate in the last sitting.""This could get much, much worse,"" she said.\l"

The capital region has over 12,350 infections.""This is a tough week,"" Dr. Fernando Sim\'f3n, head of Spain's health emergency centre, told a daily news briefing.Relatives of elderly people and retirement homes' workers expressed growing concern about the situation at the centres.""With everything that is happening with the coronavirus, this was a ticking bomb,"" said Esther Navarro, whose 97-year-old Alzheimer's-stricken mother lives at the Usera Seniors' Center in Madrid, where soldiers found some of the bodies.""Now we are bracing ourselves for the worst possible outcome,"" she told the Associated Press in a telephone interview.A worker at the nursing home said at least two bodies had to remain in the home for a day before funeral workers, who are working around the clock, arrived to take them away.""We are very saddened, because the residents are almost like our own relatives due to the time we spend with them,"" the worker, Jos\'e9 Manuel Mart\'edn, told Cadena SER radio.Pedro N\'fa\'f1ez said his father-in-law, Zoilo Pati\'f1o Lara, died at the nursing home from the virus on Saturday, although he was never diagnosed or taken to a hospital when symptoms appeared. The man, in his 80's and suffering from advanced Alzheimer's, was not removed until Sunday despite N\'fa\'f1ez's repeated calls to funeral home workers.Domusvi, the private company contracted by the Madrid regional government to run the Usera nursing home, confirmed that two residents died there over the weekend.

It was held by a serious-looking teenager listening to the speakers on the stage talk about the grim future that awaits them as the effects of climate change unfold.Nearby other protestors held signs reading, ""There is no planet B"" and ""Climate inaction is a crime.""The speakers at that climate strike were followed by a New Orleans-style jazz funeral procession complete with a model of the planet Earth in an open casket.The protest had a tone of impending doom, something that is matched by news about climate change, the vast majority of which is bad, and that steady stream of bad news is having an effect on people. ""Those kinds of things are emerging now, people see the effects that it is having,"" said Aidan Tomkinson, 16, who organized the Fridays for Future rallies in Kingston this year, including the climate strike in September.""People are having a really hard time because they are hearing all these terrible things happening in the world and they don't know how to fix them. It's a feeling of hopelessness.""Canadian Mental Health Association described climate anxiety or eco-anxiety as ""a deep fear of environmental doom and human catastrophe,"" and while not everyone is susceptible, it's a growing issue, something the agency said needs more attention from health professionals and governments.""The climate emergency is not just a question of wildfires, or rising temperatures and rising oceans,"" Fardous Hosseiny, CM-HA's interim national chief executive officer, said in a statement in October. ""What will we do about rising despair and of the mental health impacts of climate trauma?"" In 2018, the Canadian Associations of Physicians for the Environment pointed out a gap in the research about the links between climate change and mental health.Two years before that, a study in the United States by researchers from the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that specific demographic and socioeconomic groups were at greater risk of mental health ""Many people will experience adverse mental health outcomes and social impacts from the threat of climate change, the perceived direct experience of climate change, and changes to one's local environment,"" the report stated. ""Media and popular culture representations of climate change influence stress responses and mental health and well-being.""Even in Kingston, somewhat removed from the most dire effects of climate change, the issue is having an impact on peoples'mental health, and the despair, grief, fear and anger is often felt most acutely by young people.""He now has to factor in how the world is going to change in his life and what that means for him, and somehow he is supposed to be doing something about it.""There are big differences between how young people and adults process their emotions, Knight said.Young people are particularly vulnerable to the negative mental health effects of climate change because they have not yet learned the habits that allow them to put aside the stream of bad news and go about their daily routines, Knight said, and youth have fewer filters between their emotions and what they express in public.""There is a big disconnect between how present the young people are to the feelings that they actually have, and the lack of awareness with most adults with what they are feeling,"" Knight said. ""Grown-ups are very, very good at not feeling things that they really need to feel,"" she said.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada158","The deepest 2020 challenge to our health; Island Voices","January 12, 2020 Sunday","Times Colonist (Victoria, British Columbia)","Regular readers of this column will know that my main concern is with the deeper factors that underlie our state of health and that my main focus is on three inter-related sets of issues: Human-created ecological changes that undermine our health, social injustice that leads to large inequalities in health, and an economic system that is not fit for purpose in the 21st century.But what underpins them - and what is therefore the most profound challenge to the health of the population both locally and globally - is a morally bankrupt corporate, commercial and political system of governance. The focus of the system is on the pursuit of growth and profit and the accumulation of obscene amounts of wealth, regardless of the health, social and ecological consequences for others.The marketing of tobacco remains the poster child for this - a product that, when used as intended, is guaranteed to kill and sicken millions of people, and exert its malign influence for decades. Yet the industry continues to sell its products around the world, immorally using marketing practices elsewhere that are not allowed in high-income countries.It exemplifies how corporations are prepared to distort and obfuscate the evidence and hide what they know, and how political leaders are willing to turn a blind eye to the evidence as long as possible and generally have to be dragged kicking and screaming into taking effective action.All these factors - immoral marketing, distortion of the science and political ignorance of the evidence - have been adopted by the fossil-fuel industry and were on display at the recent failed UN COP-25 climate-change summit in Madrid.The only crumb of comfort was that for the first time - yes, you read that correctly, for the first time - the conference statement actually referred to fossil fuels. Astonishingly, noted Catherine Abreu, executive director of Climate Action Network Canada and Jamie Henn, strategic communications director of 350.org: ""The 2015 Paris Climate Agreement ran 16 pages, but didn't mention the words 'fossil fuels,'coal,'oil,'or 'gas' once.""When it comes to political ignorance, the obstructionist practices of the United States, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Russia, India, China and others were clear. But no better example is on display than Scott Morrison, the prime minister of Australia, who continues to plan for and celebrate increased fossil-fuel exports even as his country burns and its Barrier Reef decays.Of course, this has nothing to do with the fact that ""the corporate and fossil-fuel industry's powerful trade associations"" in the U.S. spent more than $1 billion between 2008 and 2017 ""to convince the American public that its products are beneficial and necessary,"" according to a report from the Climate Investigations Centre.In Europe, the Guardian reported recently: ""The five biggest oil and gas companies, and their industry groups, have spent at least \£3251m [$472 million Cdn] lobbying the European Union over climate policies since 2010.""Meanwhile, here in Canada, the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives reported in November 2019 that in the seven years between January 2011 and January 2018, ""the fossil fuel industry in Canada recorded 11,452 lobbying contacts with government officials.""This was far more than the forestry, automotive and renewable energy industries and five times more than environmental NGOs. Moreover, under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the lobbying has shifted from a focus on politicians to senior government bureaucrats so that ""key government institutions and actors become integrated with private firms and interest groups that together co-produce regulation and policy.""The danger of this shift in focus is that ""the influence of industry actors - like those in the fossil fuel sector - are likely to far outlast election cycles.""If the health of Canadians and the rest of the world's population is to be protected and indeed improved in the 21st century, we have to replace this morally bankrupt system with one founded on ethical principles of social justice, ecological sustainability and human well-being.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada159","Inuit Communities Should Contribute To Climate Talks; Northern residents hold vital data, says Maia Hoeberechts","December 13, 2019 Friday","The Vancouver Sun (British Columbia)","Could you survive a night in the vast frozen Arctic using just a candle and snow? George Angohiatok, a skilled Inuit guide and hunter in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, uses signs in the sky and ice to lead him to the right kind of snow, which he builds into a shelter solid enough to heat with the candle.His explanation brought home to me that no amount of book learning or field experience can offer a southern researcher the knowledge held by a descendant of thousands of years of northern living. Canada's climate is changing, and scientists overwhelmingly agree that human activities contribute significantly. As the United Nations COP 25 Climate Change Conference in Madrid wraps up this week, and leading up to the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-30), we must listen closely to knowledge from northern communities.The northern region is experiencing more dramatic effects than the south. Sea ice is disappearing, permafrost is thawing, coasts are eroding, and temperatures are rising.In the recent Canada's Changing Climate Report, we learned that between 1948 and 2016, the best estimate of average annual temperature increase is 1.7 C for Canada as a whole and 2.3 C for northern regions. This is already over Paris Agreement targets for limiting global temperature change to 2 C.I've worked with a northern and southern research team to understand the impacts that changes to sea ice are having in three Nunavut communities: Kugluktuk, Cambridge Bay, and Gjoa Haven.We conducted workshops, interviews, public meetings, and site visits to understand how community activities and livelihoods have been affected.Having closely observed their environment for thousands of years, the Inuit are experts in understanding northern weather and climate. The communities'perceptions align with what scientists are measuring, but their information is more detailed and includes rich links to culture and everyday life. They've noticed that sea ice freeze-up occurs later in the year and breakup happens earlier. This compromises on-ice transportation and hunting.We learned that ice is becoming thinner and less predictable, causing safety issues and affecting travel routes. Elders told us skies are greyer than in the past, which they lamented as less beautiful and can bring more precipitation. Southern species are moving north: There are small trees growing near Kugluktuk where there never were before and salmon have been caught in Cambridge Bay, which was met with curiosity and cautious excitement. Everyone agreed it is getting warmer.Last week, I was in Halifax attending the annual ArcticNet Scientific Meeting, the largest gathering in Canada focused on northern research. This summit brings together northern and southern experts from universities, government, industry and communities. The voices I sought are those who can tell me the most about our climate: the northern community members, experts on the forefront of dramatic change.Why should we, who live in southern Canada, pay attention to these voices from the North? First and foremost, as Sheila Watt-Cloutier so elegantly argues, the Inuit right to be cold - that is, to maintain a culture and way of life intertwined with the ice and snow - is a fundamental right.This drives a moral imperative for all of us to care about these changes and the people they are directly impacting.Second, changes in the Arctic not only affect the North, they affect the entire planet.Third, and most importantly, we should listen because northern communities are leading our understanding of climate change impacts. In their ongoing ability to live, adapt and thrive in the northern regions of this country, the Inuit exemplify resilience and wisdom.We will all need to gain such expertise if we are to respond to the challenges that our changing climate will present.

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada164","Climate change: Time for health care sector to do its part, says new report by the Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change","November 13, 2019 Wednesday 6:31 PM Eastern Time","Canada NewsWire","Report also highlights the increasing impact of wildfires on CanadiansOTTAWA, Nov. 13, 2019 /CNW/ -\~Canada's health care sector is among the worst in the world in terms of greenhouse gas pollution, says the Canada-focused policy brief, issued alongside the latest Lancet Countdown international report, and the sector requires concerted efforts to chart a new course to be consistent with its mandate to 'do no harm.' The Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change is a comprehensive yearly analysis produced by 120 experts from 35 institutions and tracks progress on key indicators of the impact of climate change on human health and the world's efforts to minimize it. The associated policy briefs provide country-specific recommendations by leading domestic experts to highlight areas in which leaders and policy-makers should focus to develop a healthy response to climate change. In Canada, the Lancet Countdown Policy Brief: Canada in 2019 was produced by a team of experts and researchers led by Dr. Courtney Howard, a wildfire researcher, recognized expert on the impact of climate change on health and Yellowknife emergency physician; the team also included Dr. Margot Parkes, Dr. Caren Rose, Dr. Andrea MacNeill and Dr. Chris Buse.Published today, the report highlights four key areas where Canada can make the biggest difference to reduce the ever-growing impact of climate change on health:Issue #1:\~Canada has the third highest per capita greenhouse gas emissions from health care in the world. Recommendation: Develop a national evidence-based sustainable initiative designed to support the greening of the health sector, including waste reduction and greenhouse gas reductions, charting a course for net-zero emissions from health care by 2050, consistent with the health sector's fair share of responsibilities under the Paris Agreement.Issue #2:\~Of the 440,000 Canadians displaced due to wildfires since the 1980s, more than half were in the last decade.Recommendation:\~Incorporate lessons learned from recent severe wildfires to strengthen a pan-Canadian emergency response approach. Issue #3: Canada's transport sector continues to be dominated by fossil fuels, and over 1,000 Canadians are estimated to have died in 2015 as a result of traffic-related fine-particulate air pollution. Electric and biofuels alternative vehicles are gaining ground too slowly, leaving benefits to Canadians' health, health care expenditures and greenhouse gas reductions largely untapped.Recommendation: Develop provincial and territorial legislation requiring automakers to gradually increase the annual percentage of new light-duty vehicles sold that are zero emissions, working toward a target of 100% by 2040.Issue #4: The health of Canadians particularly Indigenous populations, people in low-resource settings, and future generations is increasingly at risk due to the growing number of climate change-related severe weather events, wildfires, changes to infectious disease patterns, and more.Recommendation: Make health a key consideration in climate-related policy-making across sectors, including ensuring that Canada's updated Nationally Determined Contribution commitments, due to be submitted in 2020, represent Canada's fair share of emissions reductions under the Paris Agreement. Overall, the 2019 Lancet Countdown reports on the extensive health damage from climate change, and sets out the lifelong health consequences of rising temperatures for a child born today:\~ As temperatures rise, infants will bear the greatest burden of malnutrition and rising food prices the average global yield potential of maize (-4%), winter wheat (-6%), soybean (-3%) and rice (-4%) has decl"

POWER PLAY WITH DON MARTIN 17:00:00 ET","DON MARTIN: Welcome back. When it comes to listing former prime ministers who have the most to say and the experience to back up the words, my next guest takes the prize, Brian Mulroney, Progressive Conservative prime minister from '84 to '93. He introduced the original free trade deal, attempted to bring Quebec into the constitution with the Meech Lake Accord, and ratified significant environmental issues. That's why he was top of my wish list of guests of the final shows of the year. This is when I talked to him earlier this week. All right, former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney joins me from Montreal. I do want to talk about NAFTA. You did the original. The new NAFTA is about to be ratified. I'm curious what your view is of the revamped free trade deal. Is it better than the original?BRIAN MULRONEY (Former Canadian Prime Minister): I think it is. I think Ms. Freeland and her team did a very good job in the renegotiation, and I think it's a better product (a) than we had originally, and (b) that was revised last year, and I think today's product is pretty good. Certainly very good for Canada.MARTIN: I do want to ask you, though, Canada on the world stage, you've cautioned that we shouldn't maybe be boasting that we're back on that stage, and I'm curious how we get on that stage, if we want to be on that stage, or if we're just sitting in the audience being part of the spectators.MULRONEY: Well I said you shouldn't say Canada is back until we do something that backs that up, and you can start by paying our bills. We're way down the list on NATO. We committed to two percent of our GDP, and the last time any government in Canada paid two percent of GDP was mine, 25 or 30 years ago, and it's gone straight downhill ever since. We're at I think 1.2 percent, which is shameful in terms of peacekeeping, which distinguished Canada. In my nine years in office, Don, there were 16 peacekeeping initiatives by the UN, and Canada participated in all 16 of them. Now this was a concept drawn up by Lester Pearson, and it distinguishes Canada internationally, and we should have done it. And with regard to foreign aid, it's even worse. Mike Pearson presented a document 50 years ago saying that we should be paying 7/10th of one percent. We moved it up to 5/10th of one percent en route to 7/10th of one percent. It's now gone all the way back down to something in the neighbourhood of 1.5 or two percent. This is a disgrace. How are you going to assert your leadership skills when you enter a room and somebody says, hey, you haven't paid your bills. John Manley said I thought very exquisitely one day, he said in international meetings, when the bill comes around, Canada gets up and goes to the bathroom.MARTIN: Ha, Ha, I remember that.MULRONEY: That's not a good opener for a leadership bid.MARTIN: So Trump's got a point is what you're saying.MULRONEY: Yes, he has. On the NATO thing, he's completely right. And I've said that ever since he got in to office three years ago.MARTIN: How do we solve the problem with China? You get around the world quite a bit. I don't know, they're setting up a parliamentary committee, and they might actually be putting the prime minister on the witness stand there just to sort of air all our problems, but how do we get that relationship back on a firmer footing while we've got this extradition issue hanging over our heads?MULRONEY: Well, it's a tough one, there's no doubt about it, and there's no easy answer for it, and I like the idea of the parliamentary committee. The first witness they should call is David Mulroney. No relative. But he was one of the most outstanding ambassadors in our entire foreign affairs stable. And he's very practical, and he's got some great ideas as to how we can reconnect with China in a meaningful way. So he and a few other of the ambassadors would be a good place to start.MARTIN: Would you be comfortable with a prime minister going before that committee, or do you think that's not necessary?MULRONEY: Yeah, I think so. As you know, I recommended that Jean Chretien and Andy Desmarais be sent over as special envoys of the prime minister to deal with the Chinese government at a high level. Chretien knows all of these fellows, as I do, and as other prime ministers, do on a personal basis. And he gets their attention as opposed to a delegation of parliamentarians or something who will deal with people at the range of assistant deputy ministers. You don't want that. This has to be dealt with at a, on a high level.MARTIN: You remain to this day, Elizabeth May still calls you our greenest prime minister, and we just finished the meetings, and I don't know if you think Canada is a laggard on that front still, or we should be more aggressive. What needs to be done from Canada's point of view to fight climate change?MULRONEY: Well you talk about being a laggard. The analysis of the G20 just came out on November 11th, and it showed that Canada was the second worst performer of the G20, just a little bit ahead of Australia who was the worst. And we're not meeting our commitments to Paris. We're not meeting our undertakings at all. And so, yeah, there's a big job to be done there, and it all requires one thing - leadership! Somebody has to say I am the prime minister, or I am the minister, and this is what we're going to do. And if there's objection to it, you say all right, I'll take it to the people at the appropriate time. But we need leadership on all of these issues.MARTIN: And you know that brings a point back, circling back to the whole question of the Conservatives. Could they and should they be far more aggressive on the environment file, and maybe that gives them an advantage going into the next election, because it's becoming a bigger issue all the time.MULRONEY: Don, you may remember that in September I made a statement saying that anyone who does not have an adequate, thoughtful, dynamic program to deal with climate change will not win an election in Canada. The reason being that the great middle class in our country, what they want to pass on to their children and grandchildren is a pristine environment. They don't want these niggling little tax cuts, so much for a pair of skates, and so much for that. The great middle class in Canada principally wants a pristine environment, and they are going to vote for a party or a leader who articulates that kind of vision, that satisfies their hopes and dreams for Canada and for their kids.MARTIN: But that's not reflected in the Conservative party we're seeing in parliament right now.MULRONEY: Well you saw what happened in the election. And if they want a repeat of that, be my guest, because you're just not going to win an election unless you have got a thoughtful grand vision for the future of Canada as it applies to the environment.MARTIN: Okay, that's a great place to leave it. I guess, I never thought I would be retiring before you, so I guess you don't have any advice for me, do you?MULRONEY: Ha, ha, ha. Well, yes, I do. Come on in, Don. The water is fine. You're going to love it.(LAUGHTER)MARTIN: You're the busiest retired guy I know, so there you go. All right, Brian Mulroney, it's always been a pleasure having you on the show. I've really enjoyed our conversations, and some of the best conversation I've had with you have been after the camera is off, but those are fun too.MULRONEY: Well, Don, if I could just say this, you have had a great run at this. You've brought your personality, and your background, and your thoughtfulness to these debates and dialogues over your program. You've done a great job and I wish you well.MARTIN: All right. Thank you, Sir. Appreciate you coming on.MULRONEY: Thank you.MARTIN: All right.

Do you see red flags in those numbers?MORNEAU: Well actually when you saw us in our economic update today, we are predicting both this year will be strong and we think next year will also be strong and growing. I think, I mean the way to answer that is to take a look at how we actually build these economic forecasts. We take 14 private sector economists, includes private sector economists from all of the six banks, from Desjardins, from the Caisse de Depot, from Canadian Federation of Independent Business, and get their projection on the future. And not one of them is predicting a recession. So in fact the only people out there who are predicting a recession are what I would call not professional economists, and that's the Conservatives, and it seems to me that they're increasing anxiety among Canadians. I mean at a certain stage it's not a responsible way to move forward. We want to actually help Canadians to understand that things are going well, that employment is strong, that wage growth is strong, and that's not only good in and of itself but it helps confidence.MARTIN: You're a man with a lot of business experience, and I guess I want to get to the deficit, because I think some people think those numbers are real eye watering. And a year ago you were looking at a $16 billion deficit, and a $3 billion cushion. A year later we're at $25 billion with a $1.5 billion cushion. I mean these numbers seem to be flights of fiscal fantasy after a while. How do we believe these numbers?MORNEAU: Well I think you need to actually look into what those numbers are. So the changes really are two things. I mean one is we've moved forward on the tax reduction. So that's a tax reduction that will help 20 million Canadians. It will put in the first year $3 billion more into people's pockets, but also more into the economy. And in the final year, in 2023, it will put $6 billion more into the economy and into people's pockets. The second thing is our pension liabilities are going up. The way it works is if interest rates go down, pension liabilities go up. And what we've said is that we want to help people understand that so we gave a bit of an explanation about how that works. So I think as people look at it, they'll see that we've followed through on what we said we were going to do. We're going to reduce taxes. That's important. We're going to continue to invest in the economy. And we can do it while maintaining, and we need to remember, a very healthy balance sheet. We have the lowest level of debt of anyone in the G7 countries, lowest by a long shot, and it's continuing to reduce each year as a function of our economy.MARTIN: Why did you cut the safety cushion by half? $1.5 billion used to be $3 billion.MORNEAU: We do that every year. So what with do is we put in a $3 billion cushion, and then as the year goes by, we're now closer to the end of the year if we don't need that. So we're now in December. And of course this is just a projection through the end of the year, so we move it down to $1.5. It's consistent with what we did last year, the year before, and the year before that.MARTIN: Some people are pointing out that this doesn't include a lot of the promises that were made during the campaign. Is it somewhere in this fiscal soup that these numbers are all included, or is that yet to be added?MORNEAU: Well we do need to continue to make the kinds of investments that we promised Canadians. I think the way you do that is by keeping your economy strong and growing so that you have the capacity to do that. We also are going to need to not only work with provinces, I think you know I'm meeting with all the finance ministers tonight and tomorrow, but also work with other parliamentarians. I mean our goal is to be cooperative, work cooperatively to get to following through on those promises and we intend on doing it.MARTIN: Well tonight you're getting a big ask from Alberta and Saskatchewan I guess to a lesser extent. I think that's a billion and a half or something on the stabilization fund. Is that included in this, or it would be kind of crazy I guess if you admitted it, but is it in here somewhere? Could you afford to give that if they...MORNEAU: I think their ask is even bigger than that, so, but that said, no, tonight and tomorrow, it's very much about listening. We've said, look, the fiscal stabilization approach, which they're asking about, we haven't reviewed it since 1995. We've said we're open minded to looking at it, but that said, we haven't really had those discussions directly. So I've had a direct conversation with the Alberta finance minister, but not with the others, so we'll have people at the table tonight and tomorrow. We'll hear where they place that in terms of priorities versus other things, because that's not the only ask that we're going to get, and that will help inform not only how we work with them, but what we do going forward on our own investments.MARTIN: Do you have the fiscal flexibility in the years to come to pay for a full national pharmacare plan? Is that in these books somewhere?MORNEAU: Well you'll remember that we did in the campaign put $6 billion in there, and the idea was to do a few things. Canadians are really worried about having access to a primary care doctor. They're very worried about things like home care and mental health care.MARTIN: Fix that first?MORNEAU: Well, I'm not saying that we're necessarily placing those in order, because we also think having universal access to pharmaceuticals is important. We do though, in the case of all these, we need to actually be at the table with the provinces, because the provinces are the deliverers of health care, and I expect I'm going to hear about that over the course of the next day and that will inform our approach.MARTIN: Oh, yeah, your ears are going to be burning tonight. All right, Bill Morneau, always a pleasure having you on. Thanks for coming on.MORNEAU: Thanks for having me.MARTIN: All right. Coming up, strategic brilliance amidst some fireworks as our best brains go out with a bang. Please stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\l"

We need to make sure we&rsquo;re there and that we have smooth pathways to allow the U.K economy to be as smooth in its shift away from Brexit as it can. We need to be ready and we need to be good partners.&rdquo;According to Tupper, who attended these events, the British show much interest in eastern Canadian LNG, as well as elsewhere in Canada, and the ability of industry and government to talk as a cohesive team to promote this country&rsquo;s investment opportunities is imperative to success with the U.K.&ldquo;For me, one of the fundamental things we need to make sure we&rsquo;re paying attention to is where are the &lsquo;rocks on the road&rsquo; post-Brexit, and how do we get those &lsquo;rocks&rsquo; off the &lsquo;road&rsquo; to make sure British investment is coming here.&rdquo;A &ldquo;Team Canada&rdquo; approach is key not only when appealing to European investors for Canadian LNG, he said, but to Asian ones as well, as was evidenced during the event in Japan, where representatives from B.C., as well as the feds and, of course, Alberta strongly showed support for the industry.&ldquo;We had a very clear shoulder-to-shoulder, arm-to-arm approach to every single meeting we went through all week long, and that was very much noticed by our friends in Japan, and I think it had a very strong impact.&rdquo;He added: &ldquo;Having us all on the same panels and being able to talk about our collective endeavour and present a common front in terms of getting Canadian product to the world is an effective model. We should continue to do it.&rdquo;Likewise, when it comes to Canadian LNG exports, Alberta Associate Natural Gas Minister Dale Nally suggested his province is on the &ldquo;same page&rdquo; as other provincial and federal partners, and he &ldquo;can&rsquo;t stress enough the importance of demonstrating a united front&rdquo; when it comes to promoting Canada&rsquo;s energy industry.&ldquo;Our government has been working closely with the B.C. government to advance projects such as the second phase of the LNG Canada project, as well as the Coastal GasLink pipel"

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada170","Environment Minister to Attend Climate Summit","December 2, 2019 Monday","CTV NEWS CHANNEL Television, Inc. POWER PLAY WITH DON MARTIN 17:00:00 ET","DON MARTIN: Well the world is gathering once again to plot and redouble efforts to combat climate change. Canada remains committed to reducing emissions to 30 percent below 2005 within eleven years. The new environment minister will be attending the United Nations conference of parties in Madrid later in the week. John Wilkinson joins us from Toronto. All right, Minister, the Paris accord seems to be a bit of a fading dream with the US out, and there's no easy path along the current trajectory to have Canada achieve its targets. Is this a too big to fail challenge about to fail?JONATHAN WILKINSON (Environment Minister): Well it's too big to fail challenge. I would tell you that there are many countries around the world that remain very much committed to climate action. I would tell you that in the United States there are many states that remain very much committed to climate action. Certainly Canada is one of those countries that is committed. We have made enormous progress over the course of the first four years of this government's time in office. This is the first government that has had a credible plan to fight climate change. We've identified over 200 megatonnes in reduction. We have a little ways to go. That's part of what I have been charged to do, is to focus on how we're going to get to and exceed the targets that we have established under the Paris agreement. It's a critical initiative for all Canadians and for all citizens of this world, and most particularly for our kids and grandkids.MARTIN: Right, but I've seen an awful lot of charts that show we're an awful long way from meeting our commitments, our Paris accord commitments. Are you very confident we can meet that? And when do we start seeing that roadmap to zero emissions by 2050 you were promising in the campaign?WILKINSON: Well I've been about a week on the job, but certainly one of the first orders of business is to identify those additional measures that we will put into place to ensure that we meet and exceed our targets for 2030, and, yes, we do need to define pathways as to how we're going to achieve net zero by 2050, which is what scientists tell us we must do, and that is part of what we committed to in the campaign is to set up a group that's going to help us to figure that out. And I think there are probably different pathways. We need to map those out and determine which are the most important ones for Canada.MARTIN: All right. So what are you taking over the Cop 25? Is Canada going to pledge to do more faster, because it seems that a lot of the projections that we saw about warming are actually out of whack and actually accelerating faster than a lot of scientists thought.MARTIN: I'm curious what you thought about the nuclear power plan that three premiers put forward, these modular reactors. Is that a right step, a step in the right direction for you, and will the feds put their shoulder behind that plan?WILKINSON: Well the federal government and the provinces actually did a bunch of work on this in 2018 looking at small modular reactors, or SMRs. It's certainly an option. I would tell you that SMRs probably have a little ways to go before they are fully ready for prime time from a commercial perspective. But certainly in the context of a climate emergency, all non-emitting sources need to be on the table, and certainly we are interested in seeing the work that will be done through the collaboration that the provinces announced today.MARTIN: Of course then you get the problem of where do you put the nuclear waste. And I know it's not a Candu reactor level of waste, but that's still a problem that comes out of these, isn't it? WILKINSON: There's no question it is still a problem. I wouldn't describe nuclear power as clean, because you do have that issue. It is non-emitting though, and I would simply say to you that in the context of the environmental challenges that we face, I would say to you climate change is number one, we certainly will need to find and continue to work on additional solutions for waste management. But if you ask me what's the number one issue facing, environmental issue facing the world today, it is climate change, and therefore non-emitting base load sources of power to replace coal and other forms of hydrocarbon fuels is something that I don't think we can rule out.MARTIN: Yeah. Well certainly the UN secretary general was quite emphatic that this is the moment of do or die in many ways, the fight against climate change, and I'm curious what your view of his comments are and the appointment of former Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney who's going to become a UN envoy on climate change and finance. What's your reaction to both of those?WILKINSON: Well I think the UN essentially was, again, underlining the critical time that we are in. We do not have enormous amounts of time, and so we do all need to heighten the level of ambition and the level of urgency with which we're addressing this problem. I think Mark Carney's appointment is a very, very positive one. I mean Mr. Carney is somebody who could have done just about anything. The fact is that he has chosen to work on the climate file, you know, underl"

"COP25","Canada","COP25_Canada173","Canadian communities are tapping into greener ways to heat and cool buildings","December 3, 2019 Tuesday 8:51 AM GMT","CBC News","During the cold, snowy winters in much of Canada, many of us rely on furnaces, boilers and baseboard heaters to keep our homes and offices comfortable \'e2\€  and hope they don't suddenly quit during a cold snap.But what if you didn't need any heating equipment in your home? What if your community provided a greener, more efficient, more reliable source of heat using locally sourced energy? What if it didn't take up space in your home or office building, you didn't have to maintain it, and it was just about guaranteed to keep running and keep you warm through big storms and power outages?That's the promise of district energy systems \'e2\€  along with climate benefits that have earned them an endorsement from the United Nations Environment Program. World leaders meet Dec. 2-13 for the COP 25 UN climate conference in Madrid to discuss next steps in implementing the Paris Agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb global warming, and district energy is one potential tool.The idea is that instead of having an individual heating and cooling system for each building, multiple buildings are hooked up to a single, central system \'e2\€  similar to the idea of hooking into a municipal water service instead of each building relying on individual wells. The heating and cooling is distributed to individual buildings through pipes that typically contain heated or chilled water.It's not new \'e2\€  some district energy systems in Canada are more than 100 years old.But thanks to environmental concerns and the desire in communities to use greener energy technologies for heating and cooling, new projects are popping up across the country.""Yes, there's a real renaissance,"" says Bruce Ander, president and CEO of Markham District Energy in the Great Toronto Area. A past chair of the International District Energy Association, Ander has been working in the field for 40 years.More than half of district energy facilities inventoried in Canada in 2014 had been commissioned since 2000, and more than half of them planned expansions in the near future.- 6 district energy projects underway in CanadaThey range from a project in Vancouver that recovers heat from sewer water to provide heat and hot water to more than 30 condo buildings to one that cools Toronto office towers in summer with water from the depths of Lake Ontario. And even smaller communities are jumping on board, including the village of Teslin, Yukon, which has installed a biomass system, and the rural municipality of Ritchot, Man., which has a district geothermal system.Many new projects are underway such as:Why? A major factor is climate change and climate change resilience.In Canada, buildings are the third largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, after oil and gas and transportation, Environment and Climate Change Canada reports. And nearly two-thirds of energy use in buildings is for heating and cooling.Much of that comes from burning fossil fuels, either directly in furnaces or indirectly through power generation. In 2011, for example, natural gas was used to heat half of Canadian homes and electric baseboards were used to heat most of the rest, Statistics Canada reports.When buildings are individually heated, there aren't many green options.But Ander says, once a community has installed a district energy system, ""Now you can unlock a bunch of technologies."" Buying local Many energy sources used in district energy systems, such as biomass, sewage, lake water or seawater aren't very feasible or economically viable on a small scale.The choice of energy source for a district heating system is what is available locally and can generate co-benefits for the local community.For example, Vancouver captures the heat from families' hot showers, dishwasher and laundry loads in its high-density False Creek neighbourhood. The waste heat literally is heading down the drain, but can be extracted at the nearby sewage pumping plant.""It's a great opportunity,"" says Alex Charpentier, acting manager of the False Creek Neighourhood Utility that runs the system. ""In a dense urban environment, there's not many sources of local energy.""Charlottetown has little land for landfills and no equipment installed to prevent methane generated by rotting garbage from escaping into the atmosphere, so it burns garbage in its district energy system, says Carlyle Coutinho, president and chief operating officer for the Canadian region at Enwave Energy Corp., which runs the system.The heat is distributed through underground pipes carrying heated water.Meanwhile, Teslin, Yukon, is surrounded by boreal forest. Installing district energy means it can now heat buildings with locally sourced wood chips, generating jobs and keeping $300,000 a year that would have been spent on imported diesel in the local community, said project manager Blair Hogan, president and CEO of Gunta Business Consulting.The wood comes from trees cleared for development, and more will be cleared in the future to create fire breaks to protect the community from wildfires, a risk that grows with climate change.""In every community, there's a unique technology for their unique situation,"" Hogan said.In addition to accessing different heating and cooling sources, district energy systems make it easy to feed in new energy sources or switch altogether. For example, a system in St. Paul, Minn., switched from fossil fuels to biomass ""almost overnight"" without affecting customers, Ander said: ""How it's fuelled doesn't really matter to them.""But it can have a huge impact on their greenhouse gas emissions.'Key measure' for carbon targetsIn fact, the United Nations Environment Program calls district energy a ""key measure for cities/countries that aim to achieve 100 per cent renewable energy or carbon neutral targets."" Its District Energy in Cities Initiative notes that district energy can:- Reduce energy consumption and costs from heating and cooling by up to 50 per cent.- Store large amounts of energy at low cost.- Make transitions to sustainable heating and cooling sources fast and cost-effective.It adds that such systems are increasingly low-carbon and climate resilient \'e2\€  that is, they can often keep running through storms and extreme weather disasters that are becoming more frequent with climate change and that often knock out the electricity needed to run many traditional heating systems.That's why they're often hooked up to places like hospitals that can't afford to lose power.Ander says Markham's system has had more than 99.99 per cent reliability since it launched in 2000 \'e2\€  in 165,000 hours of continuous operation in 20 years, it's been down just 2.5 hours.""The buildings are much easier to operate,"" he said. ""You don't need to worry about this critical equipment failing.""He notes there are other benefits for customers:- They don't need to pay the large up-front cost of installing equipment, such as furnaces, boilers, chillers or air conditioners. Nor do they need to maintain the equipment.- They free up space that would have been taken up by that kind of equipment.- There's reduced noise and vibration from heating and cooling systems.- There are safety benefits to not being directly supplied with natural gas, for instance.Markham District Energy's Markham Centre system serves every new building that has been built in the city's ""new"" downtown since 2000. It expects to ultimately heat and cool 30 million square feet of homes for 41,000 residents and 39,000 employees in commercial and institutional buildings. For now, the system burns natural gas and uses electrically powered chillers for cooling, but its use of fossil fuels remains more efficient than if the buildings had individual heating systems. It also has started to incorporate waste heat from data centres.Installation barriersDespite the benefits of district energy, most buildings in Canada are still heated and cooled individually. As of 2013, district energy heated and cooled about 2,600 buildings across the country, representing less than one per cent of total energy used for heating and cooling in Canada, reported the Canadian Energy and Emissions Data Centre at Simon Fraser University.Partly, that's because building an economically viable district energy system typically requires two things that aren't often found together:- High density.- Undeveloped land. ""So there has to be some sort of some assistance in some manner from higher levels of government,"" he suggests.Another challenge is the low price of natural gas that is the dominant heating fuel in Canada, says Lucio Mesquita, senior engineer with the Solar Thermal Renewable Heat and Power Group at Natural Resource's Canada CanmetENERGY Research Centre.""To compete with natural gas \'e2\€  it's a tough one.""Mesquita was part of the team that built and continues to monitor the Drake Landing Solar Community in Okotoks, Alta., which collects heat using solar panels in the summer and stores it for home heating use in the winter. In the past 13 years, more than 90 per cent of home heat \'e2\€  100 per cent some years \'e2\€  has come from the solar collectors.He says not enough of the discussion on reducing emissions has been about ways to decarbonize heating in Canada.""We have the solutions. We have the technology to do the deep decarbonization,"" he said. ""It's a matter of resources and the right market conditions.""\l"

POWER PLAY WITH DON MARTIN 17:00:00 ET","DON MARTIN: Welcome to ""Power Play"" on a day when premiers huddled ahead of this week's return of parliament, all this to draft their wish lists for the prime minister. Coming up, two premiers, one west, one east, will be here to talk about today's meeting and what they can realistically expect from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Alberta's Jason Kenney and New Brunswick's Blaine Higgs are standing by. Also ahead, it's do or fry according to the United Nations as it takes aim at stopping climate change. Today Cop 25 kicks off to try and find a way to stop global warming before we hit the planetary tipping point. The minister of the environment joins us to discuss Canada's role in the summit. And Canada-China relations turned frosty a year ago this week with the apprehension of a Huawei executive pending extradition to the United States. We look back at the big chill in a key foreign relation. But first, they came, they talked, they issued a statement of agreement that national unity is a good thing but there's work to be done to make it stronger. Canada's premiers met in Mississauga to frame their hopes in forging a new relationship with the Trudeau government after months of pre-election acrimony in the case of some premiers. Let's find out what happened. Here's the soundtrack from the closing news conference.JOHN HORGAN (BC Premier): Look, we're in an extraordinary time. Four of us sit before you as leaders of minority governments. We look to Ottawa where there's a minority government. I find, and I think my colleagues in the minority situations would agree, that this is a unique opportunity for us to work together regardless of where we live in the country, regardless of how we vote. The passion of Canadians is directed at us succeeding.BRIAN PALLISTER (Manitoba Premier): If the federal government will listen to the unified voices of premiers from across this beautiful country on economic competitiveness, take steps to make the improvements that we recommended, if they will move on the fiscal stabilization program, if they will move on sustainable funding for health care, they can lessen the resistant remarkably.DOUG FORD (Ontario Premier): Canada is united. We're a united nation. And as you've seen in this meeting, when some of the provinces are struggling, we're all there. We're going to be there. We support them. We have their back, and we're going to do everything we can to get them back on their feet.MARTIN: And Jason Kenney, the premier of Alberta, joins us from Mississauga. Premier, you've got some big requests from the federal government, a fair deal as you call it to ease alienation and fiscal distress. Did you get a coalition of the willing from the premiers to support you as you head to Ottawa next week?JASON KENNEY (Alberta Premier): We did, and we're deeply grateful, an important win for Alberta in fight for fairness today with unanimous support from the premiers for a complete reform of something called the fiscal stabilization program.

What they agreed on was calling for greater ""ambition,"" whatever that means, in cutting greenhouse gases, and when to hold next year's meeting. Maybe if they stopped spouting out nothing but hot air, that would help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Larry Prout, PeterboroughHow depressing the failure of COP25 in Madrid has been! The planet desperately needs world leaders to act to save our species and planet ... But we cannot let our own leaders off the hook. We need carbon rationing and meat rationing now. We need an end to subsidies for fossil fuels and other major greenhouse gas polluters.How can we - the people who care - institute the paradigm shift without government leadership? How can we take over the media that, like governments, are co-opted by the powerful corporate military-industrial complex? How can we re-establish democracy in our countries now controlled by corporate oligarchies?We need local, grassroots leadership; intensive public shaming of those who persist in planet destroying practices; and immediate implementation of co-operative, local, small-scale, sustainable, renewable energy and food production systems.Molly Mulloy, Belleville, Ont.Hacks of personal health data prove laws have to changeLifeLabs says it paid ransom to get data back, Dec. 18When big companies like LifeLabs, and other keepers of our personal health data, lose it to ransom hackers, how do we really know what personal data they have taken and used to create false health cards and steal from our health care system?If we were able to access and view just our own personal usage data on our OHIP health card, we could track how and when it was used. If there were any strange entries that we didn't know about, like the card being used in places we haven't visited for care or tests we didn't get, or drugs we weren't prescribed, then we could flag that to be investigated. Hopefully this would prevent illegal use and cost losses.John Purvis, Colborne, Ont.As a result of the far too frequent data ""hacks"" that can compromise the security and future of innocent people, it is time that Parliament passed legislation imposing criminal liability on corporations and executives that fail to ensure the security of customers data. After-the-fact apologies and offers to pay for credit monitoring is simply not enough. The legislation could be similar to Bill C-45 that was created as a result of the 1992 Westray Mine disaster.Bruce Cowan, MississaugaIn light of the data breach at LifeLabs, there is heightened concern about identity theft. The question society should be asking is why identity theft is blamed on the individual being impersonated? If you fall for a scam where somebody impersonates the RCMP or the CRA or even your grandson, you don't expect the RCMP, the CRA or your grandson to cover your losses. So why do banks, credit card companies or mortgage brokers that fall for an impersonation scam expect the person being impersonated to cover their losses?If a financial institution gets fooled by an impostor, then it should redesign its security protocols. All the impersonated person should have to do is swear that they were not involved in, nor benefited from, the scam. After making such a declaration, it should be illegal for the innocent person to be hounded by collection agencies or have their credit rating damaged.The idea that identity theft scams are the fault of the person being impersonated needs to stop. All repercussions from data breaches should be the responsibility of the corporation whose security failed, not their customers.Steen Petersen, Nanaimo, B.C.Catholic trustee should re-examine his standingCatholic trustee scolded over incidents, Dec. 18A pity Education Minister Stephen Lecce has fallen into the fashion for misusing words ... ""we hope the board will undertake a 'fulsome' investigation ...""One can give a fulsome apology, but not a fulsome investigation.Sandra Hanmer, HamiltonI continue to be baffled how some professed Christians seem to act in the most non-Christian of ways. I understand that Michael Del Grande, as trustee for the Toronto Catholic District School Board, feels compelled to stand up for his publicly funded ""Catholic education and Church teachings."" However, where in the name of all things Christian does providing a safe and non-discriminatory school environment for certain marginalized members of our society become ""evil"" ?I applaud the TCDSB for amending its code of conduct to be more inclusive regarding discrimination. I don't see any conflict with Christian principles and teachings. In fact, compassion for others (i.e. human decency) is a very Christian characteristic. Mr. Del Grande's acts of martyrdom on the altar of standing up against attacks on Christian beliefs are, in my mind, largely egotistical and simply pandering to small-mindedness. If he so strongly believes that showing a little humanity in his role as trustee is in conflict with the teachings of his church, maybe he should resign from one of his positions.Brian Stratton, MiltonPhoto radar is not the answer to pedestrian, cyclist deathsTory announces start to radar cameras, Dec. 17If you look at the map where pedestrians and cyclists have been killed, it is not in neighbourhoods. It is almost always on a main street. These cameras are not going to stop any accidents. We need to spend money giving people safer locations to cross main streets and make sure people are crossing safely. Visibility is key, not cameras. I'm all for stopping pedestrian and cyclist deaths. Let's determine the root cause and fix it. Photo radar locations are not going to address this.Shawn Michajluk, Toronto\l"

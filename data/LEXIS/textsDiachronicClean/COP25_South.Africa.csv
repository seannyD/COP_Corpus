"COP25","South.Africa","COP25_South.Africa1","COP25 efforts utterly inadequate","December 15, 2019","Sunday Tribune (South Africa)","TIME magazine has named 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg as its Person of the Year. This is a resounding affirmation of the next generation's surging prominence in worldwide efforts to prevent the worst effects of climate change. Greta is the publication's youngest individual to be chosen for this honour, which dates back to the 1920s. Greta's recognition by Time turns the spotlight on the vexed issue of our imperilled planet, and she's become a leading face of a movement that has inspired millions of other children in at least 100 countries to argue passionately for action against climate change. The teenager's honour coincides with COP25 , the UN climate change conference, which ended in Madrid, Spain, in the early hours of yesterday. COP25 was graced by rulers and delegates from almost 200 countries with the purpose of negotiating more ambitious plans to limit global warming to 1.5C, in line with the Paris Agreement. It also sought to establish new international rules for emissions trading, and broker systems of compensation for poorer countries already affected by global warming. The Alliance of Small Island States, representing nations most at risk from rising seas, regards the talks as the last chance to avert potential catastrophe, while Save the Children warns that 33 million African children are facing hunger as a result of cyclones and droughts made more likely by climate change. COP25 has come and gone, but the quest for a global agreement, supported by all including the big polluters such as the US, is still elusive. Activists complain that negotiators continued to ignore the science. The COPs were born in 1992 and since then we have had disappointment after disappointment. COP17 was held in Durban in 2011 - and since then several conferences have been held, with the last moment of real hope being the Paris Agreement in 2015. There has not been the same level of enthusiasm from world leaders since. Experts warn that the planet is nearer ""the point of no return"" and say current attempts to combat climate change are utterly inadequate. Young activists such as Greta are sounding a warning that current efforts by world leaders are utterly inadequate. We cast our eyes to COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, next December, with hope, but not much inspiration. \"

The protesters said that as the global struggle against air pollution and climate change became even more urgent, Japan's support for coal was a huge threat to the future of the planet. The aim of the protest was to encourage Japan to move away from financing coal and ""instead finance renewable energy which is good for climate crisis and also good for the economy of places like South Africa where solar is cheaper than coal"", said Jesse Burton, an energy and policy researcher at UCT. ""We've done some research on the independent coal power producers programme on new coal power plants, Thabametsi and Khanyisa, we found that compared to a least cost energy pathway made up of wind and solar and fixable capacity, Thabametsi and Khanyisa would need subsidies of up to R28 billion over their lifetimes,"" she said, adding it was inappropriate for South African consumers to be subsidising Japanese investors. Sussane Wong from No Coal Japan said there must be a concerted effort to ensure that Japan's policies stopped supporting coal as a source of energy, and that it instead used its massive financial power to take advantage of the global transition to renewable energy. ""Right now, a fleet of new coal-fired power stations is in the pipeline across Asia, Africa and parts of the Middle East. In Indonesia and Vietnam alone, dozens of new coal power stations are under construction and planning,"" Wong said. | African News Agency (ANA) \"
"COP25","South.Africa","COP25_South.Africa3","Under Pressure. Can COP25 Deliver? [analysis]","December 02, 2019","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","Mass public pressure backed by the weight of scientific reports is starting to bring governments to their senses as the annual UN climate summit kicks off in Madrid today. But despite warnings that the planet is reaching critical tipping points, the two weeks of talks with nearly 30,000 participants and dozens of heads of government attending may still end in that familiar sense of disappointment and an opportunity missed. The annual Conference of the Parties, this year being COP25 , was to have been a highly arcane if crucial process of finding agreement on carbon markets, known in the jargon as Article 6 of the 'rulebook' to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement on stopping the planet from overheating. Highly contentious, and in part pitting developing countries like Brazil, China and India against others, the Article 6 debate could not be resolved at last year's summit - COP24 in Katowice, Poland - nor at meetings in Bonn in June and hence was left for COP25 to try and fix. The other big elephant in the room - setting more ambitious national targets to reduce carbon emissions - was conveniently going to be left to be settled at next year's COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland. But action is needed now, and senior officials representing nearly 200 countries have been put on notice that the climate emergency in all its forms is dominating the public sphere across the world. Just last week we saw student-led demonstrations and strikes in many places that appropriately fell on Black Friday, delivering a broadside against rampant consumerism as well as government inaction. ""Striking is not a choice we relish; we do it because we see no other options,"" youth leaders Greta Thunberg of Sweden, Luisa Neubauer of Germany and Angela Valenzuela of Chile declared in a joint statement. ""We have watched a string of United Nations climate conferences unfold. Countless negotiations have produced much-hyped but ultimately empty commitments from the world's governments--the same governments that allow fossil fuel companies to drill for ever-more oil and gas, and burn away our futures for their profit."" UN Secretary General Ant\'f3nio Guterres has told COP25 that ""the point of no return is no longer over the horizon"". ""In the crucial 12 months ahead, it is essential that we secure more ambitious national commitments - particularly from the main emitters - to immediately start reducing greenhouse gas emissions at a pace consistent to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. We simply have to stop digging and drilling and take advantage of the vast possibilities offered by renewable energy and nature-based solutions,"" Guterres said. Just last month the UN Environment Programme's annual Emissions Gap Report warned that the Paris Agreement ambition of keeping average temperatures within 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times was ""on the brink of becoming impossible"". Global greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 would have to be under 25 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent to reach that target but, at current rates of growth, emissions are projected to reach more than double that level. Clearly drastic action is needed. Reinforcing the sense of emergency, the World Meteorological Organization reported that atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases reached new record highs in 2018. China is the world's largest emitter. Spain stepped in to offer Madrid as a venue for COP25 after Chile withdrew as host because of mass anti-government unrest. However Chile is still leading the conference and together with Spain will be pushing countries to act quickly to raise the ambition of their carbon emission reduction targets. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez says the goal is for ""the largest number of countries"" to commit to net zero emissions by 2050. From 2020 to 2030, emissions must be cut 7.6% a year to meet the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal, the UNEP says. However the main negotiation process in Madrid is expected to focus on the unfinished business of the market-based mechanisms to create and manage new carbon markets under the Paris Agreement. This would allow countries and industries to earn credits for above-target emission reductions that can then be traded. Big developing countries have already accumulated huge amounts of carbon credits under the previous but now largely discredited carbon credit scheme. It is a highly complex tangle of interests. Carbon Brief, a UK-based climate website, says the Article 6 debate has the potential to ""make or break"" implementation of the Paris Agreement which comes into force next year. ""To its proponents, Article 6 offers a path to significantly raising climate ambition or lowering costs, while engaging the private sector and spreading finance, technology and expertise into new areas. To its critics, it risks fatally undermining the ambition of the Paris Agreement at a time when there is clear evidence of the need to go further and faster to avoid the worst effects of climate change,"" Carbon Brief explains. While Article 6 is a highly technical area, the underlying issues are political, with some countries forming unofficial alliances to defend their own interests rather than the common good of the planet. But politicians have been put on notice that this time the world's public is watching closely. Horse-trading cannot be allowed to put our futures at risk. \"
"COP25","South.Africa","COP25_South.Africa4","DBSA participates at COP25","December 13, 2019","Mail & Guardian","On the sidelines of COP25 , the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA)'s head of climate finance, Olympus Manthata, participated in an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) panel discussion on the role of national development finance institutions (DFIs) in scaling up sustainable financial instruments. The DBSA convened a high-level panel discussion, which unpacked the challenges and opportunities facing sub-Saharan Africa with regards to climate finance solutions. The bank's climate finance solutions which include managing facilities, funds and programmes that promote a green economy, drive sustainability and development impact and support a just transition to a low-carbon economy was presented. ""DBSA is uniquely positioned to play the role of integrator between the public and private sectors and support and finance climate change initiatives,"" said Manthata. He also shared DBSA's climate finance initiatives at a side event organised by the Climate Policy Initiative and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), which discussed climate alignment in the financial sector. Over the past few years, the DBSA has been progressively greening its portfolio, as an accredited entity of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) the bank has partnered with the GCF to pioneer a number of innovative funding solutions that seek to ""crowd in"" private investment. ""We see our role as being one of supporting government's commitment to contribute to a wide range of goals of transitioning to a greener economy. And we do this by supporting government and the region in meeting its Nationally Determined Contributions by developing innovative financing solutions to support implementation of climate change initiatives,"" said Manthata. ""Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) encompasses each country's targets to reduce emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change, the achievement of these country long-term climate change targets is at the heart of the Paris Agreement. We see our role as being one of supporting government's commitment to contribute to a wide range of goals of transitioning to a greener economy. And we do this through the development of funding solutions that support government and the region in meeting their NDCs,"" said Manthata. ""The DBSA has been on a climate change journey for some time. We have developed a climate change policy framework, which provides us with a road map to progressively transition to a greener portfolio over a reasonable period of time by providing a cohesive, measurable and accountable response to climate change. ""Our climate finance initiatives include managing a number of facilities and programmes that promote a greener economy, drive sustainability and support a just transition to a low-carbon economy,"" he added. The DBSA played a significant role in the country's renewable energy programme (REIPPP). ""We have also recently set up a Climate Finance Facility (CFF) with funding from the Green Climate Fund (GCF). This is a structured finance platform that will have initial committed debt funding of R2-billion. It aims to support projects that mitigate or adapt to climate change. The DBSA plays a significant role in dealing with the challenges of climate change by advancing sustainable and environmentally friendly infrastructure solutions. Its climate finance initiatives involve managing facilities, funds and programmes that promote a greener economy, drive sustainability and development impact and support a just transition to a low carbon economy and adapts to climate change. Some of the key initiatives the DBSA has to date championed include: Managing the National Green Fund on behalf of the Department of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries (DEFF), the current portfolio consists of;- 8 capacity development projects - 16 R&D projects and - 22 Investment projects Green Climate Fund (GCF): DBSA's accreditation to the GCF gives access to funds for low-carbon and climate resilient development, current portfolio includes; -2 project preparation facilities to develop financing solutions -Readiness project to assist in developing capacity to access GCF funding in the Kingdom of Lesotho-2 facilities, one to support Embedded Generation Investment Programme in South Africa and another a Climate Finance Facility to support various climate projects in South Africa, Lesotho, eSwatini and Namibia. Global Environment Facility: DBSA is also accredited to the Global Environmental facility, current portfolio includes; -4 approved projects (3 under implementation, one awaiting regulatory clearance)-2 at final stage of approval International Development Finance Club (IDFC): DBSA is an active member of the IDFC, which is a network of 26 leading national, regional and international development banks that share a similar vision of promoting low-carbon and climate resilient futures. Global Innovation Lab for Climate Change: DBSA is also a member of this organisation, which supports the identification and piloting of climate change financing instruments and products to catalyse private sector money into climate change mitigation projects in developing countries. In conclusion ""For the DBSA, we are encouraged by the engagements and meetings we have had at COP25 , as well as the prospect of even greater collaboration within the broader DFI community to work together towards supporting and financing climate change projects. The DBSA as a member of the International Development Finance Club have had meaningful engagements with fellow member institutions as well as other institutions such as the Climate Policy Initiative, OECD and institutions operating in South Africa, SADC region and beyond during our time here at COP25 ."" \"
"COP25","South.Africa","COP25_South.Africa5","COP25 climate summit: what's happened?","December 13, 2019","Mail & Guardian","Envoys from almost 200 countries gathered in Madrid on December 2 for two weeks of talks on climate change organised by the United Nations (UN), as the 25th summit of the UN's Conference of the Parties ( COP25 ) climate talks got under way. Earlier that week, a report on the world's carbon budget revealed how far we are from meeting the goals of the Paris climate agreement signed five years ago. It showed that greenhouse gas emissions rose by 0.6% last year  less than in recent years, but still not enough to reverse climate change. Delegates and activists suggest the world must alter the trajectory to an outright reduction in carbon emissions.What is COP - and how does it help?For almost three decades, representatives of world governments have met every year to forge a global response to the climate emergency. Under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC), every country on earth is treaty-bound to ""avoid dangerous climate change"", and find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally in an equitable way. COP's annual meetings have been interspersed with occasional triumph (the Paris agreement in 2015) and disaster (Copenhagen in 2009). Spain hosts the 25th Summit for Climate ChangeThis conference in turn has been dogged by controversy: everything was set for a December COP in Santiago, Chile, but rioting in the capital and a political crisis forced the COP to be moved to Madrid, where this year's talks took place. This abrupt change of venue caused many headaches, not least for the young activist Greta Thunberg, who had been targeting the talks. Activists and protesters hurriedly re-crossed the Atlantic to gear up to make public pressure felt. In many respects the conference has been overshadowed by Thunberg, who arrived to join a 500 000-strong march through the centre of Madrid, demanding that world leaders listen. The young activist slammed the COP meetings for achieving nothing, noting that greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise. Scientists, campaigners and some politicians have similarly called for the injection of a sense of urgency. Early in the proceedings, negotiators put out a text on the future of carbon markets  the so-called article 6 talks, named after the section of the Paris agreement. There are still major disagreements over how carbon credits should be counted and no guarantee of any resolution to the dispute. If this issue is not resolved, this technical question will hang over next year's talks in Glasgow too, getting in the way of substantive issues such as further cuts in emission targets to align with scientific advice on staying within 2\'c2\'b0C of global heating above pre-industrial levels. Ocean campaigners have so far struggled to have a voice at these talks, which were meant to highlight the state of the oceans and the often-overlooked part they play in Earth's climate. On Tuesday and Wednesday in week two, environment and finance ministers arrived to give directions to the ""high-level"" part of the talks and actual decision-making. These aim at a concrete outcome in the form of resolutions on the key issues. The EU was expected to give context to the talks with its new green deal proposals from the European commission on Wednesday. The UK delegation should have played a central role in preparation for next year's COP in Glasgow but its delegation was hamstrung by that country's general election, which means officials and the next COP president could not speak ""on the record"".What is special about the meetings?World leaders were not expected to turn up, so environmental ministers and their civil servants instead led the negotiations, aided by UN officials. Almost every country is expected to send a voting representative at the level of environment secretary or equivalent. The annual COPs are the only forum on the climate crisis and the opinions and concerns of developing countries carry as much weight as those of the biggest economies. COP decisions carry global authority because agreement is by consensus, though this also means reluctant countries can hold back more ambitious action. Each of the 196 nations on Earth, bar a few exceptions, is a signatory to the UNFCCC foundation treaty and no country has yet opted to withdraw from it. That includes the US, though it is in the process of withdrawing from the Paris accord. Under the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement, nations committed to holding global heating to no more than 2\'c2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels. The vast majority of nations  185 countries  have now ratified the deal, which is legally binding. Nonetheless, the commitments that countries made to cut their national emission levels to the best-case scenario were not part of the binding Paris deal, but contained in non-binding additions, which will have to be ratcheted up next year if the aims of Paris are to be met. Not all countries are wholeheartedly behind the Paris Agreement: the US has played a low-key role in the UN climate process under Donald Trump; while other potential objectors include big oil powers such as Saudi Arabia, Russia and Venezuela, as well as Brazil and Bolivia. Key to progress at COP are China, the world's biggest emitter, and India, where emissions are rapidly rising.Carbon markets to be decided this year?The primary subject of discussion at COP25 is a provision in the Paris Agreement known as article 6, which allows for the use of a global market in carbon to help countries cut emissions and to fund measures that reduce emissions in developing countries. Carbon markets have existed since the first 1997 Kyoto Protocol. The general idea is for developed countries to meet their targets by buying carbon credits awarded to projects reducing emissions in developing countries. In this way, rich nations could buy themselves time, while poorer nations got money to ease them on the road to a green future. But too many easy credits devalued the system, and the financial crisis of 2008 led to the outright collapse of the carbon market. Today, resuscitating the article 6 carbon market is back on the agenda. Activists see the markets as an easy way out for developed countries to get away with continuing to burn fossil fuels, while buying off poor countries to clean up. What activists want is not talk of carbon ""offsets"", but absolute emission cuts  now. This set the scene for a conflict over article 6, which might threaten the delicate consensus achieved at Paris. That consensus must be preserved if countries are to fulfil the aims of Paris by ratcheting up their commitments to bring down emissions next year. There are many other issues hanging over COP25 , but these will not be decided until next year. Emissions are increasing once again; temperatures are higher than ever; and countries are not mandated by law to act. The IPCC has concluded that at current rates we are running out of time, with little over a decade to halt emissions growth and bring down carbon rapidly to keep warming within the 1.5\'c2\'b0C threshold. Existing commitments made by each government under the Paris accord fall short of what is required. According to the UN's latest ""emissions gap"" report, published a few days before the start of COP25 , countries must further reduce their greenhouse gases by 7.6% per year for the next 10 years to stay within the 1.5\'c2\'b0C Paris limit.Crunch timeTo meet the Paris objectives national targets must be revised upwards by next year  which is also when previous targets, set at Copenhagen, expire for many countries. That makes 2020 a critical year for climate action. Consequently, the most important focus of this year's COP is to smooth the way for the crunch summit next year. The Glasgow meeting will be the most important on climate change since the 2015 Paris Agreement itself. The past five years have been spent spelling out the ""rules of engagement"", which have not addressed the core issues of emission reductions that governments are prepared to accept. COP26 will require coaxing countries into the commitments necessary  something that could not be achieved in Paris five years ago. In the years since Paris, many argue matters have gone backwards: developing countries have accelerated their infrastructure roll-out of roads, coal-fired power plants and automobiles; new oil and gas fields have opened up; and some countries elected governments that have become openly hostile to climate action: the US, Brazil and Australia. \"
"COP25","South.Africa","COP25_South.Africa6","Green Economy 'Not to Be Feared, but an Opportunity to Be Embraced' Says UN Chief As COP25 Gets Underway","December 02, 2019","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","A green economy is ""not one to be feared but an opportunity to be embraced"", UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres said on Monday, in a keynote speech to delegates at the opening of the COP25 UN climate conference in Madrid on Monday. The tasks are many, timelines are tight, every item is important Mr. Guterres outlined the work programme for what will be a busy two-week event covering multiple aspects of the climate crisis, including capacity-building, deforestation, indigenous peoples, cities, finance, technology, and gender. ""The tasks are many"", he said, ""our timelines are tight, and every item is important"". ""Do we really want to be remembered as the generation that buried its head in the sand, that fiddled while the planet burned?"" The conference must convey a firm determination to change course, demonstrate that the world is seriously committed to stopping the ""war against nature"", and has the political will to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, he continued. COP25 marks the beginning of a 12 month process to review countries' ""Nationally Determined Contributions"" or NDCs (the commitments made under the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement), and ensure that they are ambitious enough to defeat the climate emergency. Overcome divisions, put a price on carbon Encouraging signs of progress, noted Mr. Guterres, came out of the UN's Climate Action Summit, held in September, which saw initiatives proposed by small island nations and least-developed countries, major cities and regional economies, as well as the private and financial sectors. The stated intention of some 70 countries to submit enhanced NDCs in 2020 - with 65 countries and major economies committing to work for net zero emissions by 2050 - while governments and investors are backing away from fossil fuels, were also cited as positive signs. The UN chief called for leaders to end division over climate change, and reach consensus on carbon pricing, a crucial tool for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Doing so, he said, will ""get markets up and running, mobilize the private sector, and ensure that the rules are the same for everyone."" Is this the generation that 'fiddled while the planet burned?' However, failing to decide on a price for carbon will, warned Mr. Guterres, risk fragmenting the carbon markets, sending a negative message that can undermine efforts to solve the climate crisis. Throughout his speech, the Secretary-General was crystal clear about the urgent, existential level of the climate crisis. Failure to act, he said, will be the path of surrender: ""Do we really want to be remembered as the generation that buried its head in the sand, that fiddled while the planet burned?"" The signs of potential disaster are unmissable, he declared. For example, the current concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is comparable to that seen between 3 and 5 million years ago, when the temperature was between 2 and 3 degrees Celsius warmer than now and sea levels were 10 to 20 metres higher than today. Other indicators include the fact that the last five years have been the hottest on record, and have seen extreme weather events and associated disasters, from hurricanes to drought to floods to wildfires. Ice caps are melting at a rapid rate, sea levels are rising, and oceans are acidifying, threatening all marine life. Meanwhile, coal plants continue to be planned and built, and large, important parts of the global economy - from agriculture to transportation, from urban planning and construction to cement, steel and other carbon-intensive industries - are still run in ways that are unsustainable. ""There is no time and no reason to delay"", concluded Mr. Guterres. ""We have the tools, we have the science, we have the resources. Let us show we also have the political will that people demand from us. To do anything less will be a betrayal of our entire human family and all the generations to come"". Time for politicians to lead, not follow Speaking at a roundtable with Heads of State and government attending COP25 , Mr. Guterres urged them to lead, and not follow, at a time when public opinion over the environment is evolving very quickly, and cities, regions and the business community are taking action to tackle the climate crisis. The Secretary-General reminded them that at the recent G20 meeting of the world's leading economies in Osaka, a group of asset management companies, representing some $34 trillion dollars had asked political leaders to enhance climate action, end subsidies to fossil fuels, and put a price on carbon. The private sector, he added, is increasingly demonstrating a strong commitment to move forward, and complaining that it's governments who are lagging behind: regulation is inadequate, fiscal systems are not favourable, subsidies are still going to fossil fuels, and companies face obstacles to climate action. With a head of steam building for action, it is for political leaders to ""to be able to take profit of this movement and to lead, for us to be able to defeat climate change"". Climate crisis mostly affecting 'those least responsible for it' The Secretary-General also addressed a forum of ""climate vulnerable"" countries, where he pointed out the ""great injustice"" of climate change: its effects fall most on those least responsible for it. He cited examples, including Mozambique and the Caribbean, ravaged by storms that cause devastation, in terms of lives lost, communities uprooted, and economies crippled; and drought in the Sahel and the Horn of Africa. Nevertheless, some of the most vulnerable nations are in the forefront of climate action, showing leadership at September's Climate Action Summit: Mr. Guterres expressed his hope that their example will be followed by the world's big emitters.

"COP25","South.Africa","COP25_South.Africa7","COP 25 leaders must act now on climate","December 11, 2019 Wednesday","Cape Argus (South Africa)","FOR far too long it has been said that South Africa is on the threshold of water stress. Despite the vast rain in parts of the country, particularly flooding in Gauteng, the reality is that we have moved into a drought crisis threatening to wipe out our farming sector. To some extent, this has been a direct result of a gulf between promises and actions at gatherings such as the 2019 UN Climate Change Conference - COP 25 - held in Madrid, Spain. Environmentalists criticise world leaders for not following through on promises to mitigate climate change, especially in developing countries like South Africa. Poorly resourced developing countries that contribute minimally to the causes of climate change are left to their own devices to deal with this weather phenomenon's impact. Such is the impact of climate change on South Africa that it cannot be labelled just ""water stress"". It is firmly in the throes of a crisis, ranking as one of the 30 driest countries in the world. This dire situation has gone beyond paying lip service. It requires world leaders to prioritise assistance to developing countries. On top of a raft of legislative measures, developing countries have to deploy their limited resources to fend off the effects of climate change. The result has been a lack of progress in developing countries, including the inability to invest sufficiently in the maintenance of ageing infrastructure and developing new ones. In most instances, this happens amid a myriad of challenges ranging from stagnating economies to inequality and poverty. Investment in other priorities - education, health care and communication - have to be put on hold as funds have to be directed to climate change projects. The stark reality was illustrated by the floods in Mozambique where the devastation bears testimony to how developing countries are affected. The UN estimates that more than 11million people now face crisis levels of food security in Zimbabwe and Mozambique, a situation that looks set to continue into the foreseeable future. In South Africa, large parts are in the grip of a devastating drought moving at an alarming rate, with the farming community the hardest hit. So great is the impact of climate change that Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu had to announce a strategic response. She said the recent drought - the worst in many decades - has had a very negative impact on the economy, especially the agricultural sector, affecting food security and exports. She said: ""The drought that devastated most parts of the country has highlighted the need for a more elaborate facility to guide management of water supply and as mitigation against risks."" No economy or community can thrive without good, toxic-free, reliable and secure water services, she said. Following through with concrete actions on promises made at the COP 25 by committing to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and investing in climate change counter-measures will go a long way. They must act on their climate commitments, allowing developing countries like South Africa - which has one of the lowest rainfall averages in the world - to use its limited water resources for economic development and job creation.

"COP25","South.Africa","COP25_South.Africa8","Africa's Civil Society Calls for Action As COP25 Kicks Off in Madrid","December 02, 2019","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","During the 25th round of climate change negotiations starting today in Madrid, Spain, African civil society organisations will call on governments from both developing and developed nations to play their promised roles in combating climate change. ""We're fatigued by COP [Conference of Parties] jamborees which have become a ritual every year,"" said Dr Mithika Mwenda of the Pan Africa Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA) - an umbrella organisation that brings together over 1,000 African climate and environment civil society organisations. ""We know the science is clear about the level [in which] we need to act, yet we procrastinate and prevaricate while maintaining our profligate lifestyles,"" he told IPS in an interview. The 25th United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of Parties ( COP 25 ) comes a week after the U.N. Environment Programme (UNEP) released a report warning that unless global greenhouse gas emissions fall by 7.6 percent each year between 2020 and 2030, the world will miss the opportunity to get on track towards the 1.5\'b0C temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement is an agreement reached at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP 21) in Paris, France, where the world's nations undertook a determined course to reduce climate change. Among the commitments was to reduce the increase in global temperatures. The annual Emissions Gap Report, which was released on Nov. 26 warns that even if all current unconditional commitments under the Paris Agreement are implemented, temperatures are expected to rise by 3.2\'b0C, bringing even wider-ranging and more destructive climate impacts. ""Any slight change in global temperatures can have a devastating effect on millions of livelihoods, and could expose people to life-threatening heat waves, water shortages and coastal flooding,"" said Dr Mohammed Said, a climate change research scientist based in Kenya. According to his research in Kenya's Arid and Semi Arid regions, people in counties that experienced increased temperatures in the past 50 years have suffered significant loss of livelihoods with some having to change their lifestyles altogether. ""In Turkana County for example, the temperatures increased by 1.8\'b0C, and as a result, the cattle population declined by 60 percent, and now residents have been forced to turn to more resilient camels, goats and sheep,"" he told IPS. It is the same situation all over the world. A study published in Nature Climate Change points out that if global warming causes a rise of 1.5\'b0C or 2\'b0C, then there will be extremely hot summers across Australia, more frequent drought conditions and more frequent heat leading to bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef. Another study by the United Kingdom's Met Office reveals that the changing climate will make heat waves a common phenomena worldwide and even intense in the U.K.. In Africa, climate change has caused flooding, drought, change in the distribution of rainfall, and the drying up of rivers. It has affected agriculture, food security and human health. And it has also led to conflicts over resources, impacting national security in various countries. In Kenya, residents of West Pokot County are currently grappling with the deaths of 50 people who were last week buried alive by landslides following heavy rainfall that continues to pound the East African region. However, Mwenda believes that all is not lost. He notes that though the Nationally Determined Commitments (NDCs) are inadequate to lead to emission levels required by science and justice, there is still hope that momentum building on their implementation won't be compromised. ""We will not be tired of telling our leaders that the future generations will judge them harshly as they have failed to rise to the occasion even when science is very clear that we have exceeded planetary boundaries,"" he said. In order to address climate change adequately, civil society is also calling for a dedicated financial mechanism to be established in Madrid to support Loss and Damage with a clear agreement on new sources of finance. ""As we head to Madrid, we expect that all countries will endeavour to deliver on ambitious commitments in climate finance, especially in regard to loss and damage, strong national targets, and clear rules on trading emissions between countries,"" said Robert Bakiika, the Executive Director of EMLI Bwaise Facility, a Ugandan NGO and one of the admitted observer organisations at the UNFCCC. \"

But we must flag our concern... - Africa contributes the least to global warming emissions yet is the continent most vulnerable to climate change, as witnessed by devastating natural disasters recently. Africa Day has been held at the conference every year since COP 17 in 2011 to rally support for the continent s cause. Predictable, unified response needed Vera Songwe, executive secretary of the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), said the ECA would support African countries to revise their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to attract private sector investments in clean energy. The lack of concerted and meaningful global ambition and action to tackle climate change poses an existential threat to African populations, Songwe said. The Paris Agreement is the guiding force of current climate negotiations. It calls on nations to curb temperature increases at 2\'b0C by the end of this century, while attempting to contain rises within 1.5\'b0C. The next step is to implement NDCs, which set out national targets under the Paris Agreement. While African countries outlined bold aspirations to build climate-resilient and low-carbon economies in their NDCs, the continent s position is that it should not be treated the same as developed nations as its carbon emissions constitute a fraction of the world s big economies. The African Union Development Agency (AUDA-NEPAD) remains committed to partnering with other institutions in providing the requisite support to AU member states in reviewing and updating their NDCs, said Estherine Fotabong, director of programmes at AUDA-NEPAD. Investment in renewables Africa is already responding positively to the challenge of climate change, said Anthony Nyong, director for climate change and green growth at the African Development Bank, citing huge investment interest in renewables at the Bank s Africa Investment Forum in Johannesburg. Clearly, we are a continent that has what it takes to create the Africa that we want to see happen. I believe what has been the missing link is the ability to brand right and to act on the market signals, Nyong said. We continue to present Africa as a vulnerable case and not as a business case with opportunities. In fact, where we have attempted the latter, the results have been spot-on. Chief Fortune Charumbira, vice president of the Pan-African Parliament, said robust climate legislation was key. The world s response to the challenge has shown that legislation is imperative to cement efforts employed by various stakeholders; from the Paris Agreement to nationally determined contributions, he said. - {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell \"

The initiative, which was announced during the 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference of Parties in Madrid, Spain, also aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030. The UN Conference in Spain attracted African and international experts and sustainability actors including from Nigeria, who all discussed how to protect the continent from the harsh effects of climate change. Managing Director of Eko Carbon Exchange, Mr Innocent Azih, disclosed that the initiative, being the first in West Africa, was mobilising to harness the opportunities in low-carbon development across all economic sectors in Nigeria, starting with solid waste and transport sectors. He said this will also serve as a regional vehicle for mobilising finance for low-carbon economic development for West African economies through the Clean Development Mechanism. Azih stated, ""The objective is to mobilise the necessary resource pool and low-carbon finance required for greening all economic sectors."" Head of Climate Change Mitigation in the Ministry of Environment, Hajia Aisha Jibril, revealed the readiness of the ministry to work with the Exchange to enable Nigeria achieve the nationally determined contributions through projects implementation that are fully mainstreamed. She described efforts made by the ministry to include policy incentives, education and awareness of actors through climate change desks at state levels, to development of the Nigerian carbon emission registry. Also speaking at the UN meeting, Chief Executive Officer of Natural Eco Capital, Dr Eugene Itua, in his submission noted that tremendous emission reduction programmes have been on in Lagos State through the replacement of outdated mass transport vehicles with more modern and energy-efficient buses. Stakeholders noted that finance remained a major challenge to scaling green investments but suggested that the best approach was non-monetary strategy in which financing packages for low-carbon consumption comes with credit and insurance.

Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, Ban Ki-Moon, former Secretary-General of the United Nations and Christalina Georgieva, Chief Executive Officer of the World Bank, said in a new report. The three leaders are part of 34 other political, business and science top shots, who came together to form the Global Commission on Adaptation, according to the BBC. ""Climate change doesn't respect borders,"" the BBC quoted Ki-Moon as saying. ""It's an international problem that can only be solved with co-operation and collaboration, across borders and worldwide. It is becoming increasingly clear that in many parts of the world, our climate has already changed and we need to adapt to it."" The global cost-benefit analysis published by the commission, calls on developed economies who are responsible for much of the world's warming, as well as the underdeveloped economies who will be most hit, to adapt five strategies, towards mitigating the impacts of the changing climate. The report noted that countries who are list responsible for the shrinking Arctic Circle and the irregular weather patterns are the most affected. This, the researcher said, made reversing the losses suffered by harsh weather conditions, a 'human imperative.' The five strategies include warning systems, climate adaptive infrastructure, drought-resistant crops, protective mangroves and efficient water management. The report noted that simple apps that help fishermen and women detect changes in the weather could save lives. It said infrastructures like roads, bridges, and buildings, should also be constructed to adapt to weather conditions. The report also advised that crops that are resistant to drought are needed in desert regions like Nigeria's north-west and east territories. It also cautioned against the clearing of mangroves in riverine areas, saying they help to protect the community against storms and flood. The most notable point made by the commission, however, is the need to not waste water in a climate-shifting world. Gates and friends will begin canvassing for the adaptation of its report at a United Nations climate change conference at the end of the month.

The decision was announced at the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) in Madrid yesterday. The first group of companies took a similar decision at the climate summit in New York in September, when 87 companies, employing 4.2 million people with the market capitalisation amounting to $2.5 trillion (R37trillion) expressed commitment to help combat global warming. As part of the ""Business Ambition for 1.5C - Our Only Future"" campaign, 177 more companies participating at COP25 have pledged to keep global warming below 1.5C by the end of the century compared with the pre-industrial era, and also achieve zero carbon dioxide emissions no later than by 2050. These 177 companies from 36 sectors, including Chanel, Decathlon, Carlsberg, Europcar, Henkel, Iberia, Siemens Gamesa, Tesco, employ 5.8 million people, while their market capitalisation amounts to $2.8 trillion. To date, their total annual carbon dioxide emissions are equivalent to the annual emissions of France. A group of investors operating the assets worth about $4.2 trillion joined these companies and pledged to transform their investment portfolios into zero-emission companies by 2050.

On Wednesday, Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said Santiago had decided to cancel the upcoming APEC summit and the COP25 climate forum amid the large-scale anti-government protests in the country. Spain stepped up to host the Conference in Madrid, which was accepted by the international community. ""Dear Greta, it would be great to have you here in #Madrid.

""Nothing good is going to come out of it for Central America, only proposals that are going to make it more vulnerable. The damage is going to become more serious,"" Carolina Amaya, representative of the Salvadoran Ecological Unit, told IPS, pointing out that the region is one of the most exposed to the climate crisis, facing persistent droughts, intense storms, rising sea levels and climate migrants. The social summit is taking place at the public Complutense University, in the west of the Spanish capital, about 15 km from the IFEMA fairgrounds which are hosting COP25 after Chile pulled out on Oct. 30 from holding the event due to massive anti-government protests and social unrest. The alternative activities, which also end on Friday Dec. 13, include a varied menu of issues, such as free trade and its socioenvironmental impacts, oil drilling in indigenous territories, the protection of forests, and opposition to trading reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which cause global warming. They are also discussing the monetisation of environmental services, increased funding for the most vulnerable nations, climate justice and attacks against land rights activists. The Madrid Social Summit is also holding sessions in Santiago de Chile, under the same slogan, ""Beyond COP25 : People for Climate"", although there are fewer representatives of organised civil society than at previous COPs because of the last minute change of venue. Civil society groups are also organising activities at their green pavilion within the official COP25 COP25 is the third consecutive COP held in Europe, this time under the motto ""Time to act"". The deliberations, which enter the crucial phase of the adoption of agreements Tuesday Dec. 10, are focusing on financing national climate policies, rules for emission reduction markets, and the preparation of the update of emissions reductions and funding of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage, designed to assist regions particularly affected by climate change. COP25 is the climate summit that directly precedes the 2020 entrance into effect of the historic Paris Agreement on climate change, adopted in the French capital in 2015, which left key areas to be hashed out at the current conference, such as the controversial emissions market. In their statement to the COP, the organisations criticise the economic model based on the extraction of natural resources and mass consumption, blaming it for the climate crisis, and complaining about the lack of results in the UNFCCC meetings. ""The scientific diagnosis is clear regarding the seriousness and urgency of the moment. Economic growth happens at the expense of the most vulnerable people,"" says the statement, which defends climate justice ""as the backbone of the social fights of our time"" and ""the broadest umbrella that exists to protect all the diversity of struggles for another possible world."" At the social summit, the first ""Latin American Climate Manifesto was presented on Monday Dec. 9, which lashes out at carbon credit trading, the role of corporations in climate change and the increase in production of hydrocarbons, while expressing support for the growth of agroecology, the defence of human rights and the demand for climate justice. In addition, indigenous peoples are holding their own meeting, the ""indigenous Minga"", with the message ""Traditional knowledge at the service of humanity in the face of climate change."" They are demanding respect for their rights, participation in the negotiations and recognition of their role as guardians of ecosystems such as forests. ""We are here to raise our voices and offer our contribution to fight"" against the climate emergency, Jozileia Kaingang, a chief of the Kaingang people and a representative of the non-governmental Articulation of the Indigenous Peoples of Brazil, told IPS. Brazilian indigenous groups are in conflict with the government of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro because of its attempts to undermine their rights and encourage the commercial exploitation of their territories. In fact, the Brazilian government delegation does not include a single indigenous member - unprecedented in the recent history of the COPs. Faced with this dispute and the critical situation of the Amazon jungle, Brazil's indigenous people have sent representatives to Madrid to speak out and seek solidarity. The murder of two leaders of the Guajajara people in northeastern Brazil on Saturday Dec. 7 shook the indigenous delegation. Two murders had already occurred in that native community in the last two months. In 2017, the States Parties to the UNFCCC adopted at COP23 the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform for the exchange of experiences and best practices, thereby ensuring the participation of these groups in the negotiations of the convention. The Platform's facilitative working group, composed of delegates from seven States Parties and seven indigenous peoples, is currently developing its plan for the period 2020-2021. Mart\'edn Vilela, a representative of the Bolivian Platform for Climate Change umbrella group of local organisations, questioned the effectiveness of the climate summits. ""The agreements are only paper. Emissions continue to rise and countries' voluntary targets are insufficient. The countries have to be more ambitious if they really want to avoid major disasters,"" he told IPS. The Agreement sets mandatory emission reduction targets for industrialised countries and voluntary targets for developing countries in the South. ""The countries need to know that we're monitoring them. We, the organisations, must prepare ourselves to demand better action,"" said Amaya from El Salvador. For her part, Brazil's Kaingang argued that the climate struggle would only be effective if it includes indigenous peoples.

We remind you of the dire environmental realities, which require wholehearted actions from our leaders. At a time when our global environment is at risk of collapse, you, together with your international counterparts, hold the most pivotal role and responsibility. This is the time for you to act. South Africa's environment, our communities' health and livelihood are under threat. We are witnessing the worst droughts, floods and storms our region has seen in 100 years. Certain areas in the Karoo are disaster zones. Despairing communities are praying to God to save them because no one else seems to care, and the government does nothing to assist. In South Africa, 37.44% of rural communities are affected by the drought, the 2019/2020 Drought Report by AgriSA states. This affects the livelihood of communities and poses a major threat to food security. The impact on our economy and job security is dramatic. The Western Cape fresh produce export volume decreased by 25%. In the Northern Cape and the Free State 27000 agriculture jobs were lost in a year. A recent report from the Select Committee on Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Water and Sanitation raises urgent concerns over the lack of an adaptation strategy to tackle the drought. Research by the African Climate and Development Initiative at UCT underlines how drought can be expected once every 15 years - rather than every 50 years as previously assumed. Climate change impacts, and will continue to impact, the poor hardest. South Africa is the world's 14th largest emitter of carbon dioxide.Its commitment to reduce GHG emissions has been internationally benchmarked as ""highly insufficient"". If all governments did as little as we do, global warming would result in a temperature increase between 3C and 4C, with the consequence of immeasurable catastrophe with unprecedented human suffering. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's latest report estimates an ultimatum of a little more than a decade to take massive action to reach the Paris climate goals. Yet South Africa's leaders don't give it the necessary urgency. On the contrary: more plans for fossil fuel investments and new coal-fired power stations are on the table. Even you, honourable minister, seem to be ducking behind the inconsistent and flawed argument that GHG mitigation conflicts with economic growth. In fact, expensive and unsustainable polluters like coal, oil and gas have become more expensive than renewables, irrespective of the external costs. The correlation between climate change and negative economic growth should become obvious when reviewing the reports referenced above. In a stakeholder meeting in October in preparation for COP25 , you highlighted the need for educational measures to achieve increased public awareness. We agree and conclude that such measures need to start with you. We demand that you take a stance for your sector and the people of South Africa suffering from climate change and declare a climate emergency. \"

But the area on the outskirts of capital city Santiago is blazing a trail in recycling its waste. Residents like Marina Ortiz listen out for the regular sound of the community recycling truck. Standing by her door, she rushes out into the street, bringing her food waste to the collectors. ""When I cook I separate out the remains of the vegetables. The paper and cardboard I give to the collectors, and the food to the vegetables truck,"" the 58-year-old housewife said. ""The people from the municipality taught us and I've been doing it for years. They tell me that later all the waste is turned into earth."" The municipality of La Pintana now collects 140 tons of plant waste from homes every week, far higher than comparable neighbourhoods. That is despite the area having some of the worst socioeconomic indicators in Chile. There are few medical centres and almost no companies or major employers. The news that comes from the area is almost always related to drug trafficking, delinquency and violence. The poverty rate - at around 42% of the 177,000 inhabitants - is far above the national 17% average, a legacy of the area receiving poor families displaced from other richer parts of the capital during the 1973-1990 military dictatorship. ""The people of La Pintana have been treated harshly by the state, with no services, no health facilities, no education. There are children in the street, crimes, a lot of inequality,"" La Pintana mayor Claudia Pizarro told Reuters. ""But this is one of the good things that exist in the community, and we're a pioneer in this area. We have made efforts to be recognised as a community that takes care of the environment,"" she added. Chile, already an environmental leader in Latin America for its use of renewable energy and creation of national parks, is looking to roll out further initiatives as it gears up to host the major COP25 global conference on climate change in December. These include reducing consumption of single-use plastics, trying to cut emissions and increasing the recycling rate. The environment ministry has recently set targets for the recycling of paper, plastics and glass. ""There is no one who has done this with the level of penetration and perfection that La Pintana has,"" said Gonzalo Muoz, an environmental ""champion"" for the COP25 in Chile. ""It's surprising that other municipalities have not copied it."" The process has an economic as well as an environmental benefit, since it reduces the amount of garbage residents send to the landfill, which charges to receive it. ""We started in 2005 looking for a way to generate savings to reduce our spending on waste management,"" said Felipe Marchant, head of La Pintana's environmental management division. ""It's the biggest financial burden of the municipalities."" Carol Valdebenito, an engineer who has worked as an environmental educator in the area for seven years, said it also brought the community together. ""The neighbours not only talk to us about environmental things, but about social issues, their problems and concerns,"" she told Reuters as she walked alongside the green recycling truck through pot-holed streets roamed by groups of stray dogs. The trucks deposit the waste at a composting and vermiculture plant, where the garbage slowly transforms into piles of dark earth with a musty odour, full of long, pink worms that do a lot of the work processing the waste. This becomes fertiliser for the nearby municipal nursery, where trees are grown for the green areas of the community. The nursery also researches which species adapt best to climate change and dry weather. ""That is the basic concept of what is called the circular economy,"" said Marchant. | Reuters \"

CSA seeks to increase agricultural productivity and incomes, build resilience and adapt to climate change, and where possible reduce or remove greenhouse gas emissions. Qu said innovative solutions can help to optimise CSA for the world's most vulnerable people. He said the use of drones and advanced image data analytics can enable the early identification of pests and diseases, while early warning systems offer information to farmers via their mobile phones that can advise them on when to plant or sell their livestock. ""This reduces their risks and losses and boosts food and livelihood security,"" said Dongyu. FAO has developed an early warning and monitoring system to control the spread of the crop-eating pest, Fall Armyworm and a sterile insect technique to eradicate the Mediterranean fruit fly in the Dominican Republic. Citing FAO's work in developing hydroponics in arid environments such as the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and promoting more inclusive agricultural supply chains that increased the income of coffee growers in Ethiopia, Qu emphasised that FAO intends to accelerate its activities to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals through the Hand-in-Hand Initiative, which is a unique opportunity to create partnerships between donors and recipients across the public and private sectors, and through a new Office for Innovation, which the Director-General has created. - {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell \"

Elba tied the knot with his Canadian model girlfriend, former Miss Vancouver Sabrina Dhowre, at the Ksar Char-Bagh hotel, an exquisite Alhambra-style hotel. Kenyan-Mexican Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o, American actress Jessica Alba, soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo of Portugal and others have all embraced the glamour of the rose-coloured city of Marrakech and its plethora of tourist attractions, including the vibrant Jemaa el-Fnaa square and the picturesque Majorelle Garden. Morocco draws tourists from the far corners of the world. They may be seen strolling along the Corniche in Casablanca - an oceanfront boardwalk lined with restaurants, nightclubs, theatres and hotels - or dining at one of the small caf\'e9s in the quiet city of Azemmour - nha short day trip or overnight jaunt from the big city. Adil El Fakir, director of the Moroccan National Tourist Office (ONMT), says that over 12 million tourists visited Morocco in 2018, of whom 2.4 million headed for Marrakech. Morocco's tourist attractions include the spectacular beaches of Essaouira, an Atlantic coastal town included on the World Heritage List of UNESCO since 2001, and the country's mountains, particularly the Atlas and the Rif. ""Tourism is a terrific land-use tool, and our territory is rich in its activities, its landscape, its heritage, its culture and its gastronomy,"" declares Mohamed Benamour, a former president of the Morocco Tourism Federation. A cultural crossroad The country is also a cultural hub, reflecting the diversity of its inhabitants' national origins: sub-Saharan Africa, Europe and the Middle East. This crossroads attracts fashion designers, artists, filmmakers and other cultural tourists. In 2017, for example, a museum on the international luxury fashion house Yves Saint Laurent opened in Morocco. ""Marrakech taught me colour. Before Marrakech, everything was black,"" Saint Laurent once noted. Over 50 Hollywood motion pictures have been shot in the country, including Alfred Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much; Lawrence of Arabia, directed by David Lean; Orson Welles' Othello; Jesus of Nazareth, directed by the late Franco Zeffirelli; and the latest James Bond movie, Spectre. The country is also becoming a major hub for international conferences due to its proximity to Europe, Middle East, the Americas and the rest of Africa. The country recently hosted the United Nations Climate Change Conference , which brought about 20,000 participants to Marrakech. Last year, the Global Forum for Migration and Development and the conference on the adoption of the Global Compact for Migration were held in Marrakech and attracted representatives from most UN member states and nongovernmental organizations. In March the city hosted the Conference of African Ministers of Finance, Planning and Economic Development on ""fiscal policy, trade and the private sector in the digital era: a strategy for Africa"", which was organized by the UN Economic Commission for Africa. This year, UNESCO's first International Forum on Artificial Intelligence in Africa and the Africa Youth Leadership Summit, among other events, will take place in Marrakech. These international conferences shine a spotlight on the country while contributing to the economy. Tourism revenues account for 11% of total GDP, according to the tourism ministry. Industries in the sector, such as air and land transport, food service and hospitality, generate significant employment opportunities for young people. Morocco was the most visited country in Africa in 2016, with 10.3 million tourist arrivals. Despite the potentials in the tourism sector, climate change effects threaten to put a dampener. In 2015, for example, Morocco's economic growth nosedived to 1.5% due to drought, according to the World Bank. To address the situation, the country is constructing the world's largest desalination plant, which turns seawater into drinking water, in Agadir, near the Atlantic coast. It has also set ambitious goals that focus on, among others, generating 52% of its electricity needs from renewables by 2030 and improving coastal zone management. Regulatory reforms introduced in 2010 are bringing Morocco closer to its goal of making the country one of the world's 20 leading tourist destinations by 2020. Its 10-year plan, dubbed Vision 2020, is aimed at creating eight new tourist destinations and 470,000 new jobs while doubling tourist receipts. That goal is within reach, it seems. The country has set its sights on a good slice of the 1.4 billion global tourists traveling abroad annually, many of whom are Chinese. Following Moroccan king Mohammed VI's visit to Beijing in 2016, the number of Chinese arrivals in Morocco skyrocketed to 180,000 in 2018, up from 42,000 in 2016. By 2020 Morocco hopes to reach the 500,000 mark, according to the Moroccan National Tourist Office, a wing of ONMT. Investing in tourism Massive investments in new infrastructure, such as new airport terminals, roads and railways, and the relaxed visa requirements for citizens of some countries, such as China, are two factors in Morocco's success. Thanks to the new airport terminal in Casablanca that was opened earlier in 2019, the airport can now handle up to 14 million passengers a year, up from 7 million. Another newly built terminal in the Rabat-Sal\'e9 Airport can now handle 4 million passengers a year, up from 1.5 million. Investments in airport infrastructure have had a domino impact on the broader economy. For example, the Rabat airport expansion is transforming the neighbouring city of Kenitra into a fast-growing industrial hub, attracting international companies such as Groupe PSA, the French company that manufactures Peugeot and Citro\'ebn. ""[The economic growth of] Kenitra has exceeded our expectations,"" says Moulay Hafid Elalamy, minister of industry, investment, trade and the digital economy. With improving infrastructure, safety and security, Morocco is on its way to becoming a premier destination for an increasing number of tourists. This article was first published by Africa Renewal.

"COP25","South.Africa","COP25_South.Africa25","Global emissions are way off target: what needs to happen","March 16, 2020 Monday","Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Other industries)","At the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, countries set goals that require halving carbon emissions by 2030. In a new piece in Nature, Professor Harald Winkler, as part of an international team, delivers the bad news that the emissions gap... 1. How much has the emissions gap grown by? How was this established? Our conclusions are based on a synthesis of all 10 editions of the United Nations Environment Programme s gap report. Each year for the past 10 years, this report has examined the difference (the gap ) between what countries have pledged to do individually to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, and what they need to do collectively to meet agreed temperature limits. The 2015 Paris Agreement aims to keep global temperature increase to less than 2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels and possibly 1.5\'b0C. <figure class=""align-center zoomable""> </figure> There are three reasons for the gap: a 14% increase in emissions from 2008 to 2018; global agreement on a lower limit on global temperature; and insufficient commitments by countries. With more stringent global temperature limits now agreed, it s now projected that 25% lower emissions will be needed to meet the goal of 2\'b0C and 55% for 1.5\'b0C. 2. What are the implications? In our study of the gap reports, we found that the required emissions cuts from 2020 to 2030 are now more than 7% per year on average for the 1.5\'b0C temperature limit set in Paris and 3% for 2\'b0C. Had serious climate action begun in 2010, the cuts required to meet the emissions levels for 2\'b0C would have been 2% per year, on average. Instead, among the top seven emitting countries or regions, one has lower emissions (the EU), another slightly lower (India), three show no change (the US, Russia and China) and two are higher (Brazil and Indonesia). Together with other countries, the overall trend of rising emissions has not been reversed over the past 10 years so now there is less time to reach the goal. The time window for halving global emissions has narrowed: in the words of the Nature report, in 2010, the world thought it had 30 years to halve global emissions of greenhouse gases. Today, we know that this must happen in 10 years. In plain language, a decade of insufficient political action on climate change means that nations must now do four times the work or do the same work in one-third of the time to comply with the climate pact they made in Paris. The less action countries take collectively to cut carbon, the higher the temperature increase and the more severe the impacts. The poor, who are least responsible for greenhouse gas emissions, suffer the most from its impacts. 3. What are the urgent steps that need to be taken to reverse the trend? The gap is so huge that governments, the private sector and communities need to switch into crisis mode, and to make their climate pledges more ambitious. Immediate action is needed in a climate emergency - while ensuring equity. Given the delay in action, much more rapid emission reductions will be needed to keep the temperature goals in reach. Instead of developing in a way that involves high consumption and high emissions, countries need to provide people with basic needs through low emissions and sustainable development, tackling socio-economic inequality at the same time. Action is now required from all countries, including those that are still developing to meet basic needs. 4. What good work is being done to control emissions that others can follow? Some countries, regions, cities and businesses have promised to take ambitious climate action. For example, 76 countries or regions and 14 subnational regions or states have set net-zero emissions goals. This means that they have set a year (often around 2050) when their greenhouse gas emissions will be balanced by removal of emissions. The net result will be zero emissions to the atmosphere. Combining this with 20Agenda%20for%20Sustainable%20Development%20web.pdf%sustainable development goals means zero poverty as well as zero emissions. One sign of hope is that the costs of renewable energy are falling fast, globally and in sub-Saharan Africa. In South Africa, President Cyril Ramaphosa presented a proposal to the 2019 climate change summit to fund the faster phasing-out of coal without negative effects on workers and communities that depend on it. International climate finance is a critical ingredient to support a just transition. The comment in Nature also includes examples of what other emerging economies that depend on coal, such as China and India, are doing. They are adjusting the fuel price, capping its consumption, reducing plans for new coal-fired power plants and supporting renewable energy production. Much more must be done, and quickly while addressing poverty, energy access and urbanisation to address both development and climate change. The same is true for South Africa, which still depends on coal for 83% of its electricity and 59% of all energy. The country needs to adopt a vision for a just transition that includes net-zero emissions by 2050 or earlier, and put in place the laws, institutions and practical actions to achieve that goal. South Africa has a Carbon Tax Act and in 2020 the country needs to promulgate a framework Climate Change Act. In 2018, a national jobs summit agreed to establish a presidential climate change coordinating commission as the statutory body to oversee South Africa s just transition. This needs to be designed carefully and set up urgently. To make the transition just, communities and workers who are dependent on coal will have to be integrally involved in the change, ensuring they have sustainable livelihoods.

The purpose of the Bill is to build an effective climate change response and ensure the long-term, just transition to a climate resilient and lower carbon economy and society. This will be done within the context of sustainable development for South Africa, and will provide for all matters related to climate change. ""It is heartening to see that since the adoption of the Paris Agreement in December 2015, many African countries have made significant progress in moving towards the development and implementation of their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs),"" the Minister said. NDCs embody efforts by each country to reduce national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. ""For Africa, addressing and responding to the impacts of Climate Change is critical for the sustainable development of our Continent. Climate Change also presents opportunities for our Continent which we should work on harnessing, in order to realise the aspirations contained in Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want,"" she said. She said despite the progress being made on the continent to implement the NDCs, creating the enabling policy environments to fully harness the opportunities arising from the implementation of NDCs still requires further work on the continent. ""We need to create a conducive environment for this to happen. We have a number of encouraging NDC case studies on the continent which demonstrate that Africa is prepared to make its fair share of the contribution towards the global effort to combat Climate Change. ""We should learn from each other and make further efforts to exchange our experiences in implementing the NDCs, as well as the challenges we are experiencing,"" the Minister said.

"COP25","South.Africa","COP25_South.Africa27","Climate Change and Loss of Species - Our Greatest Challenges","November 19, 2019","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","Mottled and reddish, the Lake Oku puddle frog has made its tragic debut on the Red List, a rapidly expanding roll call of threatened species. It was once abundant in the Kilum-Ijim rainforest of Cameroon but has not been seen since 2010 and is now listed as critically endangered and possibly extinct. Researchers attribute its demise to a deadly fungal disease caused by the chytrid fungus. As noted by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the skin fungus has devastated amphibian populations globally and holds the distinction of being the world's most invasive killer, responsible for the decline of at least 500 amphibian species, including 90 presumed extinctions. The IUCN's Red List has expanded to cover more than 105,000 species of plants and animals, and its most recent update in July found that 27 percent of those assessed were at risk of extinction. No species on the list was deemed to have improved its status enough since 2018 to be placed in a lower threat category. Human exploitation is often responsible, as with the now endangered red-capped mangabey monkey hunted for bushmeat while its forest habitat in West Africa is destroyed for agriculture; or the East African pancake tortoise critically endangered because of the global pet trade. Thousands of tree species now make the list too. In its multi-faceted approach towards combating species loss, the IUCN has launched its First Line of Defence against Illegal Wildlife Trade program in eastern and southern Africa, engaging rural communities as key partners in tackling wildlife crime. But this is just a small part of a much wider challenge. As Grethel Aguilar, IUCN acting director general, noted: ""We must wake up to the fact that conserving nature's diversity is in our interest, and is absolutely fundamental to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. States, businesses and civil society must urgently act to halt the overexploitation of nature, and must respect and support local communities and Indigenous Peoples in strengthening sustainable livelihoods."" Jane Smart, global director of the IUCN Biodiversity Conservation Group, said the Red List update confirms the findings of the recent IPBES Global Biodiversity Assessment: ""Nature is declining globally at rates unprecedented in human history."" More than one million animal and plant species are now threatened with extinction, many within decades, ""unless action is taken to reduce the intensity of drivers of bio-diversity loss"", according to a landmark report by IPBES, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. It bleakly warns that the global rate of species extinction is already at least tens to hundreds of times higher than it has averaged over the past 10 million years, and the rate will accelerate if action is not taken. Frightening statistics detail how 32 million hectares of primary or recovering forest were lost across much of the highly biodiverse tropics between 2010 and 2015 alone. Put in perspective that totals an area nearly the size of all Germany. ""Ecosystems, species, wild populations, local varieties and breeds of domesticated plants and animals are shrinking, deteriorating or vanishing. The essential, interconnected web of life on Earth is getting smaller and increasingly frayed,"" said Professor Josef Settele, co-chair of the report. ""This loss is a direct result of human activity and constitutes a direct threat to human well-being in all regions of the world."" Crucially, for the first time on such a scale of evidence, the report's more than 400 authors rank the five main drivers of this global disaster. In descending order they are listed as: (1) changes in land and sea use; (2) direct exploitation of organisms; (3) climate change; (4) pollution and (5) invasive alien species. Clearly such challenges are interwoven and cannot be tackled in isolation. Some species are affected by all of these main drivers, or a deadly combination. Researchers into the fungal diseases wiping out amphibians like the Lake Oku puddle frog believe the most important factor in the spread of the pathogens is the global trade in wildlife. Some have also suggested that local changes in climate have also enabled the chytrid fungus to flourish in new habitats. That governments are failing to address these warnings comes as little surprise, however. ""Despite 40 years of global climate negotiations, with few exceptions, we have generally conducted business as usual and have largely failed to address this predicament,"" declared 11,258 scientists grouped under the Alliance of World Scientists in a recent report, warning that the climate crisis is accelerating faster than most of them had expected and could reach potential irreversible climate tipping points, making large areas of Earth uninhabitable. The UN Climate Change Conference, COP25 , is to be held in Madrid from 2-13 December amidst severe signs of leadership stress. Brazil was to have hosted the summit but President Jair Bolsonaro ruled that out on his election and in the first nine months under his government over 7,600 sq km of rainforest were felled. The baton was then passed to Chile which pulled out because of ant-government unrest. And then this month President Donald Trump formally launched the process to withdraw the US from the 2015 Paris Agreement. COP25 has unfinished business from COP24, held in Poland's coal-mining area of Katowice, namely negotiating the final elements of the Paris Agreement 'rulebook'. Work must also start on future emissions targets ahead of the crunch 2020 conference next November in Glasgow, in the knowledge that commitments submitted by governments and current greenhouse gas emission trajectories fall far short of what is needed to achieve the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement. ""Loss of species and climate change are the two great challenges facing humanity this century,"" warns Lee Hannah, senior scientist in climate change biology at Conservation International. ""The results are clear, we must act now on both... "" \"
"COP25","South.Africa","COP25_South.Africa28","Climate conferences are male, pale and stale -it's time to bring in women","December 17, 2019 Tuesday","Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Other industries)","The COP25 - Among the aims of the COP, or conference of parties to the Paris Agreement, was working towards ambitious and gender-inclusive climate action . That is, recognising the need to integrate gender considerations into national and international climate action. The first step to achieving this aim would be gender parity at international climate conferences such as the Madrid COP. While we don t yet know how many of the 13,000 registered governmental delegates were women, based on past numbers they are unlikely to make up more than a quarter. This is not the only forum where the experiences of women are ignored. Our research, spanning Kenya, Cambodia and Vanuatu, has found women are working collectively to strengthen their communities in the face of climate change. But their knowledge about climate risk is dismissed by scientists and political leaders. Bridging climate awareness When women are excluded from local and national-level governance, the absence of their voices at regional and global levels, such as COP meetings, is virtually assured. Our work across Africa, Asia and the Pacific found scientists generally male lack awareness of the knowledge women hold about the local consequences of climate change. At the same time, those women had little access to scientific research. In places where the labour is divided by gender, women and men learn different things about the environment. Though the women in our research generally did not know about government policies or programs on climate change and disaster risk reduction, they were very aware of environmental change. In Kenya, the pastoralist women we spoke to are acutely aware of the link between their physical insecurity and extreme drought. As droughts become more intense, pastoral communities who depend on livestock and grazing land are severely impacted. The loss of livestock can trigger communal conflicts and displacements as violence is used in retaliation for cattle rustling. Moreover, given the prevailing practice of bride prices among pastoral households, early marriages for young women and girls are a way to secure cattle. Despite laws against female genital mutilation in Kenya, it is practised to secure higher bride prices, due to beliefs that the practice makes girls more valuable. This everyday knowledge is crucial for identifying the full risk posed by climate change. However, women told us their knowledge was not always recognised within their communities let alone at the national level. They blamed this on discrimination against women taking up decision-making roles, poverty and gender-based violence which dissuades women and girls from participating. Valuing women Even when countries have policies for gender equality in climate change responses, that doesn t mean women are actually given an equal voice. According to female community leaders and women working in government and non-government organisations in Cambodia, Kenya and Vanuatu, gender equality issues in climate change policies tend to be confined to women-only programs . Gender inclusion is primarily addressed in social welfare programs, rather than ministries responsible for energy, meteorology, land and natural resources. To address these gaps, we need to to take women s varied expertise seriously. This begins with supporting their leadership within communities and villages. Women s access to education and careers in climate-relevant sciences is also crucial. Ideally, this will progressively bring in broader groups of women and girls to participate in climate change decision-making. Climate change action Our research found programs for mitigating climate change are also perfect opportunities to support peace, community development and women s rights. In Kenya, for example, one member of a women s network responding to drought and conflict told us: [W]e support each other. We want a collective voice because then we have more power. These networks help women with female-specific issues, such as natural disasters that make women extremely vulnerable to abuse from men. But even in day-to-day life, these forums are valuable for women who would otherwise be barred from political activism. In areas where authoritarian rule or discriminatory customs limit democratic spaces, women s networks for climate response are a rare opportunity for public deliberation on policy-making. Global evidence now shows environmental projects are more effective when gender considerations are taken into account. Our research adds to this knowledge base by documenting how women s networks mobilise in response to climate change. For example, the Women I Tok Tok Tugeta (Women Talk Together) network in Vanuatu has created a Women s Weather Watch that provides early warning of disasters. It also makes clear that relying on scientific knowledge or technological solutions alone will be insufficient in these complex environments, where climate change, gender discrimination and conflict all come together. When we look at COP25 , we can t help but mourn the lack of women s knowledge from the countries most affected by climate change. By supporting women at all levels, from the village to the global stage, this vital perspective can inform the creation of robust, sustainable and effective solutions to our climate crisis.

But as we approached the end of the Esplanade, our joy turned to dismay at the behaviour of pedestrians and drivers.

In a letter to the institutions ahead of the conclusion of climate talks in Madrid, Spain, this week, global environmental lobby groups including Big Shift Global, African Coalition for Sustainable Energy and Access, Pan African Climate Justice Alliance and 350.org, said the multilateral development banks (MDBs) have an urgent responsibility to align their lending with the Paris Agreement. The agreement set global climate change targets in 2015 and sought to intensify the actions and investments needed by countries and all stakeholders for a sustainable, low-carbon future. ""Doing so will require ending support for all fossil fuels by the end of 2020, rapidly scaling up investments in renewables and energy access, and transparent reporting on finance levels and portfolio emissions,"" the groups said. Financial institutions, including banks and insurance houses, are worried about the effect of climate change on their stability. For instance, changing weather patterns, which include frequent storms and droughts, have complicated the insurance industry's risk assessments and led to an increase in premiums, particularly in the agricultural sector. Meanwhile, banks are under pressure not to finance operations seen as contributing to climate change. The groups said in their letter that while MDBs have made commitments to align their financing with the objectives of the Paris Agreement, there has not been enough progress. ""Signs of the unfolding climate crisis have become increasingly evident since the joint MDB pledge was first made, and the MDBs must scale up their ambition at COP25 [climate talks] in Madrid accordingly,"" the lobby groups said. They said the banks must end all assistance for oil, gas and coal projects after 2020, rapidly scale up investment in renewables and energy efficiency, and increase clean energy access finance by public finance institutions by 2020 to help attain universal energy access by 2030. Furthermore, they called on the MDBs to devote at least 40% of finance by 2020 and at least 50% by 2025 to assist countries, especially in Africa, in accelerating their chosen low-carbon development pathways. According to the bank, carbon pricing is an instrument that captures the external costs of greenhouse gas emissions - the costs borne by the public, such as damage to crops, health-care costs from droughts, and loss of property from flooding - and ties them to their sources through a price. Its programme will support the direct implementation of carbon pricing in at least 10 developing countries and help a further 20 countries get ready to do so. phakathib@businesslive.co.za \"

World leaders from 193 countries adopted the broadest-ever set of health commitments globally. The political declaration on universal health coverage aims to ensure that everyone everywhere can access quality healthcare, and that no one is pushed into poverty by health costs. With the World Health Organisation's support, Greece, India, Kenya and the Philippines took decisive steps towards expanding health coverage. The WHO said Egypt is defying worrying global trends relating to Hepatitis C, with 57 million people screened and 1 million treated between October 2018 and April 2019. ""More women and children are surviving childbirth than ever before thanks to improved access to affordable quality health services. Diabetics in low and middle-income countries will soon have better and more affordable access to treatment thanks to the launch of a WHO pilot programme to prequalify insulin. ""WHO has also prequalified its first biosimilar medicine to increase worldwide access to life-saving breast cancer treatment. The fight against polio has achieved a major milestone for humanity with the eradication of the second of three strains of wild poliovirus worldwide,"" the WHO said. Although malaria still kills over 400000 people each year, pregnant women and children in sub-Saharan Africa are better protected. Algeria and Argentina have been officially declared malaria-free, and the world's first malaria vaccine has been piloted in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi. By 2023, the WHO aims to ensure one billion more people benefit from universal health coverage. ""In 2019, substantial gains were made in responding to the world's second largest Ebola epidemic on record in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The spread of Ebola has slowed within the DRC and the virus has not taken root in neighbouring countries. WHO prequalified an Ebola vaccine in record time, and landmark advances were made in care and treatment. WHO also supported vaccination campaigns for children across the country as DRC battled the world's most severe measles outbreak,"" the WHO said. It investigated 440 events and responded to 51 emergencies in 40 countries and territories in 2019, including the Rohingya crisis, cyclone Idai in Mozambique, and conflict and disease outbreaks in Yemen, Syria, Nigeria and South Sudan. It also responded to floods in Iran and an earthquake in Albania. ""We are witnessing a powerful shift in the global tobacco epidemic. WHO projects there will be 5 million fewer male tobacco users globally by 2025. The international food and beverage industry has committed to align with the WHO target to eliminate industrially produced transfat from the global food supply by 2023. ""The UN Climate Conference COP25 marked five key actions to tackle the health risks of climate change.

Ricardo Salles, who declined to set a target for limiting deforestation in the coming year, said at the weekend that his country is committed to reducing illegal activity, but needs the support of developed nations. While participating in the climate conference known as COP25 , Salles is working to assure others of the environmental policies of Brazil's far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro has squabbled with some European leaders this year over his commitment to protecting the Amazon. He has worried environmental activists and others by criticizing Brazil's environment regulator and by calling for more development in the Amazon region. He also accused activists groups, without evidence, of having set fires in that region to undermine his administration. Deforestation in the 12 months through July reached the highest annual rate in 11 years. Brazil's annual deforestation report released in November showed a nearly 30% jump from the prior year in the Amazon, which lost 3,769 square miles (9,760 square kilometers) of forest. Salles said developed nations should help Brazil on the basis of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement signed in 2015 on tackling the effects of climate change. The article says monetary compensation mechanisms must be created to help developing countries. Brazil already receives money from wealthy nations, namely Germany and Norway, to fight deforestation in the vast Amazon rainforest. Norway alone has donated $1.2 billion to Brazil's Amazon Fund since its creation in 2008. However, both European nations have suspended contributions, citing the continued deforestation and questioning whether the government wants to stop it. The Brazilian newspaper O Globo reported this past week that the fund's disbursements this year were the smallest since 2013 and said zero projects were approved despite the fact the fund has 2.2 billion reais ($530 million) available. Salles in the past has questioned the fund's effectiveness. He said in the interview that Brazil is negotiating with the two European countries to restart the program. He said they exchanged draft documents, and he expects them to meet next week to discuss new terms of the fund. Brazil now has ""an appropriate approach on the problem of deforestation,'' Salles said. He said the government is putting a new emphasis on balancing protection with efforts to develop biological resources that can provide livings for people in the Amazon region. ""If we don't solve the economic development for more than 20 million Brazilians who live there and people who need to have this sustainable, from both a financial and environmental perspective, they will be easily co-opted by illegal activities,"" Salles said. ""It is a huge effort to attract the private sector to participate."" ___ Marcelo De Sousa reported from Rio de Janeiro. Load-Date: \~December 9, 2019 \"
"COP25","South.Africa","COP25_South.Africa33","CLIMATE CHANGE - Treasury unveils regulations on carbon offsets","December 4, 2019 Wednesday","Business Day (South Africa)","CLIMATE CHANGETreasury unveils regulations on carbon offsets Offsets provide taxpayers with a cheaper alternative to paying carbon tax and will establish a carbon market in SA Mining & Energy WriterThe Treasury has published the long-awaited regulations that open the way for SA companies to offset their carbon emissions, as part of the government's efforts to mitigate climate change. In response to burgeoning concerns over rising global temperatures, the Treasury implemented the carbon tax in June but has dragged its feet in publishing supporting regulation. The carbon offsets regulations, published on Friday, outline the eligibility criteria for projects and set out the procedure for claiming an offset allowance. It comes as decisionmakers gather in Madrid for the 2019 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, known as COP25 . In SA, the carbon tax adds to the mounting pressure for companies to become more sustainable. At recent annual general meetings of both Sasol and FirstRand, the JSE-listed groups came under fire for not moving fast enough on climate change considerations. According to Roelof van Huyssteen, senior climate change adviser at Promethium Carbon, the offsets provide taxpayers with a cheaper alternative to paying their full carbon tax liability and will help to establish a carbon market in SA. The regulations provide clarity on which projects are eligible for offsets. ""It is now possible to really start planning what your carbon tax liability will be,"" Van Huyssteen said. Carbon offsets will be generated from recognised projects that reduce greenhouse gases, such as renewable energy or reforestation. These offsets can be used to reduce that com-pany's own emissions or can be transferred to another emitter that wants to reduce its carbon tax liability, at which point they become carbon credits. ""The carbon tax was designed as a hybrid mechanism to be coupled with an emissions trading scheme,"" Van Huyssteen said. ""It can't function on its own, this [offsets regulation] is the other part of it."" In the first phase of the carbon tax, which ends in December 2022, firms will receive a basic tax-free allowance of 60% for direct emissions, while various other allowances can allow for a reduction of tax liabilities of up to 95%. The act allows for firms to use offsets for up to 10% of their emissions. The regulations give clarity on which renewable power projects are eligible for offsets, including those that are part of the government's renewable energy procurement programme. They deal with how credits generated before the implementation of the tax will work and tackle the eligibility of electrical efficiency projects. The department of mineral resources & energy has developed a carbon offset administrative system, the registry of which will be outsourced to a credible third party. The regulations specify the duties of the administrator and the procedure to be followed by taxpayers for claiming the offset allowance. The Treasury has published for public comment two sets of draft regulations relating to the allowances provided for in the Carbon Tax Act. Van Huyssteen said companies now have about six months to figure out their tax liability. steynl@businesslive.co.za \"
"COP25","South.Africa","COP25_South.Africa34","Local investors remain cool on global warming","January 20, 2020 Monday","The Mercury (South Africa)","With the recent flood of pledges by investors to ""turn up the heat"" on climate action, one might think that the investment industry was in the midst of a profound shift. If only that were the case. Officially, the majority of the world's institutional investors, with assets under management worth more than $89 trillion, subscribe to the Principles for Responsible Investment. In doing so, these companies have agreed to integrate environmental, social and governance factors into their investment processes. Yet, so far, investors' commitment to responsible investment appears to have exerted little influence on corporate behaviour and short-term investment trends. The funding of the fossil fuel industry continues to rise. Investment giants such as BlackRock and Vanguard keep on voting against key climate resolutions. Major shareholders ignore the growth of social inequalities. Even the PRI (the organisation that governs the Principles for Responsible Investment) acknowledges that action lags behind awareness. Civil society organisations, academics and journalists have begun questioning whether responsible investment can bring about the level and pace of change required to enable an inclusive climate change transition. To better understand whether the financial industry is really shifting, we looked to South Africa, a country with a leading regulatory framework for responsible investment. Since 2011, all pension funds have been required to take a responsible investment approach as part of their fiduciary duty. A Code for Responsible Investment in South Africa was released, and in 2013 it supplied practical recommendations for institutional investors and their service providers. As a result, most South African institutional investors publicly pledged their support for responsible investment. But our study, which tracks implementation from 2013 to 2019, found that the changes to investment practices were mostly superficial. We looked at what South African institutional investors said they were doing on their websites or in their financial and other reports. The changes focused on publishing annual general meeting voting results and creating policies to increase transparency. Sustainability policies were generally rudimentary, using tailor-made definitions. They did not depart from ""business as usual"". And when we spoke to industry insiders, we found that even among responsible investment leaders, core investment practices and incentive structures remain largely unchanged. Portfolio managers talked about environmental, social and governance factors being an irritation. They said these often came at the wrong time in the investment process. Others explained that environmental or social data were still seen as ""fluffy"" and difficult to factor into investment decisions. Our findings are backed up by a recent report concluding that South African investors might be aware of these issues in theory, ""but may not understand what it means in practice"". We believe that part of the problem may lie in the way the concept of responsible investment was introduced. How a concept is initially framed guides how it will be interpreted and implemented. The initial framing defines the core problem and attributes responsibility. It also articulates potential solutions and motivates action. In an effort to bring companies on board, the principles for responsible investment were initially framed using language that was flexible and compatible with investors' priorities around risk and returns. While this framing boosted early adoption, it may have done so at the expense of effective change in the long term. As emissions and inequality continue to rise, responsible investment needs a reframing. The new frame needs to be clear on the core problem. It must attribute responsibility, motivate action and outline solutions. The focus needs to be squarely on reducing inequality and achieving an inclusive climate transition. As emphasised during the 2019 UN climate summit and discussions from COP25 , the next 10 years are crucial to avoid irreversible change to the climate system and the furthering of social inequality that will accompany it. | The Conversation Feront is PhD candidate at the Graduate School of Business, University of Cape Town, and Bertels is an associate professor at the Beedie School of Business, Simon Fraser University \"
"COP25","South.Africa","COP25_South.Africa35","Is It Time to Postpone the 2020 Climate Summit? [opinion]","March 25, 2020","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","With the coronavirus pandemic sweeping the planet and the governments of both wealthy and poorer nations overwhelmed by the demands of managing a response, the scheduling of this year's critical UN Climate Summit is suddenly in doubt. COP26 (formally, the 26th annual Conference of the Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change) is planned for Glasgow, Scotland (UK) from 9-20 November. It will be the culmination of five years of negotiations since the historic 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. More than 100 presidents and prime ministers are expected to present their nations' plans for carrying out the sweeping environmental, economic and energy changes necessary to keep the Earth's warming to survivable levels. In all, over 30,000 government delegates, intergovernmental officials and stakeholder representatives are preparing to attend. The agenda of COP26 is deep and urgent. Besides reporting how they plan to reduce oil, coal and gas production and increase renewable energy to limit global temperature rise to below 2\'b0C (and preferably 1.5\'b0C), governments must agree how to calculate whether each is fulfilling its pledges, what steps to take to deal with those which haven't, and whether the total reductions agreed to are sufficient to avoid catastrophic climate impacts (so far they're not). National leaders will be looking for positive grand visions to pull their people out of pandemic- induced despair. A new American President might be eager to reassert a proactive international role for the US Governments must decide what role private business and the financial sector play in contributing climate funding. And they must approve the so-called 'Paris Rulebook' on implementation guidelines for zero emissions and climate resilience by 2050. Progress on all of these issues is lagging far behind schedule. Last year's COP25 , in Madrid, was expected to agree on a formula to resolve key issues. Instead it became the longest COP conference ever, failed to resolve virtually any issue, and passing them on to an already pressured COP26. Meanwhile, the pace of the climate crisis continues to accelerate, with another year of record temperatures, catastrophic hurricanes, and unanticipated rapidly melting glaciers in Antarctica and Greenland. And the public demand for action to meet the urgency escalated as well, led by a resurgent environmental youth movement inspired by Greta Thunberg. The argument for a November meeting So it would seem more necessary than ever to follow through with the November COP26 schedule. For a world already decades behind the optimal carbon-reduction calendars suggested by environmentalists in the 1990s, the risks of further delay are huge. We may already be on the verge of irreversible feedback loops like runaway deforestation in the Amazon, unstoppable desertification in China and the Sahel, massive shifts in thermal ocean currents that moderate the winters in Europe, and decalcification that could crash the populations of the world's sea life. With major fossil fuel corporations digging in to avoid action, taking the pressure off governments is an opening to fatal procrastination. As the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has calculated and Ms. Thunberg has tirelessly pointed out, the world only has eight years left in its allowable 'carbon budget' if it continues to emit about 42 gigatons of CO2 every year. So drastic reductions are necessary. Now. The argument for postponing COP26 And yet. The world faces a sudden major pandemic that will impact all countries and affect all citizens. Millions will likely become ill and thousands will likely die. The focus of all countries is on containing the COVID 19 virus - as it should be. Governments everywhere are enacting policies that would never have been imagined. Financial markets are crashing. The US Treasury Department has suggested a potential 20 percent unemployment rate. Massive restrictions on public movement are being imposed and trillions of dollars in financial stimulus and subsidies are being spent. Public and private scientific expertise is being marshaled to solve medical emergencies. The responses to the pandemic will impact the negotiations on climate. With only seven weeks to go before a key two week preparatory meeting in Bonn, virtually all flights to Europe are cancelled. It may be only be a matter of weeks before Bonn itself is postponed, or at best conducted virtually - which is a far more cumbersome process. A second preparatory meeting, which could be expanded to take on the added work load, is planned in early October. But it is scheduled to meet in Italy. Is it realistic that the Italian government will be sufficiently back to normal in order to host such a session by October? In this context, it will be extraordinarily difficult for governments to assign the necessary political or economic resources to achieve a successful climate meeting this November. Even before the pandemic, it was already going to require exquisite timing, energy and finesse to achieve any degree of success in Glasgow. Besides the pre-negotiation failures, the willful climate obstructionism and catastrophic incompetence of the US government under Donald Trump, plus the self-imposed chaos of Boris Johnson's Brexit in the UK, have left two of the world's necessary climate nations nearly immobilized. The only positive-case political scenario for a November COP would call for Democrats to sweep the US presidency and Senate on November 3 (one day before it becomes official that Trump has pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Agreement) and barely a week before the November 9 opening at Glasgow. Even if that were to happen, Trump would still be in office until January and his policy would prevail. (Indeed, one could visualize a defeated Trump spitefully trying to wreak havoc through obstructionist interventions by his negotiating team.) And even if everything went well, because of the lack of prepared agreements, the most that could be hoped for from a November COP is another seemingly ambitious and robust, but in reality a very amorphous Conference declaration on principles and promises. How to postpone but increase momentum Many respected voices currently arguing against a postponement are understandably concerned that any delay will take the pressure off governments to keep building on their commitments. It's a valid fear. The answer is to not take the pressure off governments. Yes, postpone the meeting, but instead of a full COP in November in Glasgow, the parties can schedule an additional special high-level Preparatory Meeting, on those same days in November, in Bonn where the UNFCCC is housed. Such a special Preparatory-Meeting could resume negotiations working through the backlog of unfinished business from COP25 and the cancelled meetings in 2020. It would still be energized by any positive results from the US elections. When COP26 does then meet in November 2021 the world will presumably have emerged from the coronavirus crisis. Economies will be re-starting, so Finance Ministries will be able to visualize budgets that address climate needs. National leaders will be looking for positive grand visions to pull their people out of pandemic- induced despair. A new American President might be eager to reassert a proactive international role for the US. It might also turn out that the concerted international action that eventually succeeds in defeating the pandemic - and the widely respected leadership by the UN's WHO - provides a model for global cooperation for taking the unprecedented steps necessary to defeat climate change. Governments and individuals may realize that indeed we can successfully take extensive multilateral action when a crisis calls for it. We're all living in unprecedented times, and nations and people are sailing through uncharted waters. While it's by no means certain that the optimistic scenarios above can guarantee success, they'd seem to provide the greatest hope for it. Nations are now facing two immense and urgent crises. One must and can be dealt with immediately. The second also requires extensive financial resources and exceptional political will, but needs time to produce them.

"COP25","South.Africa","COP25_South.Africa36","No premature death for coal","December 10, 2019 Tuesday","Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Other industries)","With global targets set to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuel combustion by 2030 and to reach a net-zero position by 2050... Under the COP21 agreement, also known as the 2015 Paris Climate Conference, most developed countries globally made the commitment to resort to alternative low-carbon emissive solutions, deemed sustainable for electricity generation, industrial manufacturing, and any other activities that could risk propelling climate change. This agreement has been followed up by annual meetings of the UNFCCC Parties to assess the progress in dealing with climate change. However, a new dynamic has entered the stage with recent written representations and testimony to the United Nations and European Parliament, respectively, by 500 experts arguing that there is no climate emergency. Moreover, with this year s annual Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) taking place in Madrid from 2-13 December 2019, the debate and momentum are moving away from the doomsday scenario propositions being made by socio-political movements. The Paris agreement, however, still poses a predicament for developing and emerging economies that are still heavily dependent on coal. Furthermore, access to funding for applied renewable energy solutions which also require local subsidies to be affordable yet provide little sustainable employment is still very limited within these regions. For these reasons, among others, economies are still using coal as a significant resource. Clean coal technologies The necessity of many developing countries to install the most cost effective and implementable method of power generation is easy enough to understand; the majority of African countries are still starved for electricity, with the World Bank declaring 32 of the 48 nations on the continent to be in a power crisis. Thus, developing countries are still largely dependent on coal for most of their electricity generation. Since the start of the industrial revolution, coal has proven to be a reliable, constant base-load energy resource that today is easily convertible to multiple physical states such as gas or liquid in coal-to-liquid technology (CTL Technology). Therefore, instead of focusing on the elimination of coal, which will leave African countries in the dark, there is a need for developing countries to embrace and attract funding for clean coal technologies (CCTs) that will lessen the negative environmental impact of coal energy generation, in turn helping to mitigate atmospheric pollution and the potential contribution to climate change. This will ensure that the African continent's enormous coal resources can be utilised for future generations without significantly negatively contributing to climate change. Because coal plays a significant role in both the industrial and retail sectors in African countries, eliminating it in the near future in favour of renewables, as is being advocated for by the developed countries, is not technically and economically viable. There is a need to promote a diversified energy mix inclusive of strategically placed renewable sources to cater to the continent s energy needs. International green capital should increase investment in renewable sources of energy, such as solar and wind, as part of a complementary approach in diversifying the energy mix whilst simultaneously continuing to fund clean coal-based energy. Given the requirement for a stable base-load supply, there is typically an upper limit on the amount of renewable energy that can be accommodated in a functional, efficient national grid system, which is dependent on the nature and amount of available energy sources, both renewable and non-renewable. IRP 2019 South Africa recently released the Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) 2019, which brings renewed confidence that coal-based power generation is alive and well on the African continent. Running from 2019 to 2030, the IRP seeks to promote a diversified energy mix that is also inclusive of renewables, nuclear energy, gas, hydropower, nuclear power and coal for South Africa and the SADC region. The plan, based on a lowest-cost electricity supply and demand balance that considers both security of supply and the environment, states that coal will continue to play a significant role in electricity generation for the country and the rest of Africa. South African Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe expressed his views on the coal debate in October, saying, ""We are going to still have a big volume of electricity generation from coal. Therefore, we are cautioning those who are saying coal is coming to an end we have 16 power stations which are coal-fired. That is the reality of today. Coal will continue to play a significant role."" This inclusion of coal in the IRP 2019 energy mix is a clear indication that the end is nowhere in sight for this fossil fuel. The coal industry in the country not only is responsible for electricity generation but also is beneficial to the country s economy. According to Coal Mining Matters, the South African coal mining industry in 2018 employed 81,962 people and paid R24bn in wages and salaries. These jobs created and the salaries earned are then redistributed throughout communities and strengthen local businesses \"

In vulnerable hot spots, such as the arid lands of Kenya and Ethiopia, farming communities are struggling with droughts and water scarcity that kill their cattle and threaten their survival. The glacial-fed river basins of the Himalayan mountains, or the deltas of Bangladesh, India and Ghana, are increasingly prone to floods, landslides and powerful cyclones. As a result, men are often migrating further to keep their families going, looking for casual work in neighbouring towns or villages for a few days or weeks at a time, or to cities further away. Many try to return home when they can, with whatever they have earned. But during their absence, the entire burden of maintaining the family is on women. Researchers are in a race against time to predict how climate change will affect these communities and help them adapt, with drought and flood-resistant crops and cattle breeds for example. But it's often overlooked that climate change will affect one half of humanity significantly more than the other. Long-standing gender inequality means that within regions of the world that are particularly vulnerable to climate change, women are likely to suffer more than men. Isolated and overburdened In a recent study, we found that extreme weather and unpredictable seasons disproportionately weaken the agency of women to find well-paid work and rise above rigid gender roles, even when these appear to be bending after decades of reform and activism. Without support in the form of assured drinking water, energy, childcare or credit, women end up working harder and in poorer conditions for lower wages. Women in poverty are increasingly finding themselves in a vicious cycle of low productivity, indebtedness and food insecurity as crops and livestock fail, as we found particularly in semi-arid parts of Africa and India. Women in northern Kenya complained that they could no longer afford meat, so ate rice and potatoes instead, even when that wasn't enough to satisfy their hunger. As environmental stresses accumulate, community support networks break down. When people are displaced and have to settle elsewhere, men search for work and women are left at home, often in unfamiliar surroundings and lacking support from friends and relatives. But even if they do know people, with all the challenges of running the household in a strange environment, there is little time to help others. With full responsibility for household chores, farming and caring for the children and elderly, women have less time to socialise or take part in community events, including meetings of the elected village government. If the state or charities can help, there's often competition for securing those benefits. In Namibia, people tend to stick with their ethnic groups to guarantee access through collective effort, but this means that ethnic minorities in the region are often excluded. In Mali, heavier burdens are placed on women who are young and less educated. In India or Pakistan, women belonging to a lower social class or marginal caste suffer the most. Gender relations differ in each place and according to each situation - they're often too variable to emerge in broad national and global assessments. We tried to find a way to generalise our findings across 25 diverse locations, in Asia and Africa, without losing the nuance of each woman's experiences. The bare necessities If much of the problem is structural, then short-term solutions like cyclone shelters or drought relief won't address the underlying causes of poverty and precariousness. Social safety nets that can ensure the basic necessities of food and shelter are needed, like the public distribution system for cereals in India, or the pensions and social grants available in Namibia. To ensure that the health of people in these places doesn't irreversibly decline, women need to be supported with child and healthcare services, but also drinking water and cooking fuel. The role of community support is crucial during crises, but there's little women without resources and skills can do to help themselves. Competitive labour markets are also undervaluing the labour of poor women. Ensuring minimum wages and fair working conditions would help, but these are hard to implement across borders. As climate change causes traditional livelihoods to collapse, migrant men are similarly exploited by new employers. Deprived of adequate food and rest, many end up sick and spend their earnings on medical treatment. Tackling the climate emergency and making sure these women and men live meaningful lives will take more than overcoming gender stereotypes. If given support, they can find creative solutions to the disruption that climate change has brought. But this support must mean the guarantee of universal access to food, shelter and basic services. At COP25 , the climate change conference in Madrid, Spain, world leaders should help vulnerable communities to adapt to climate change with re-sources and solidarity, not warm words and rhetoric.

South Africa has slowly been shifting to a better space as a developing country. As GL events South Africa we have been making positive strides in establishing ourselves as international players in the world of events. We have extended our footprint internationally and have been involved in major projects, i.e. the 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta, Palembang and Indonesia, 2018 FIFA World cup in Russia, Special games in Abu Dhabi and Cop 25 to name a few. For our local people who joined the company in its early days, it has been a fulfilling and rewarding journey to be able to witness the growth and be a part of it. GL events have made a significant contribution over the years in upskilling and developing its employees, investing in education and creating sustainable careers. Some of the employees, who started as general workers with little or no qualifications, now occupy supervisory or managerial positions and have developed tremendously. We had an opportunity of speaking with Jeremiah Vilakazi, the Site Operations Manager based in the Johannesburg branch and who has been involved in most of the international projects in the past few years including the ones listed above. During the interview, Jeremiah recalls how he started out as a Stand builder back in 2007, with no dream of ever managing a team of over 30 site workers. He has been with GL events since 2007 and his gradual growth has been so inspiring. We listened to him as he beams with excitement taking us through the events of his career life, the passion for what he does clearly visible on his face. ""I remember the time when I started working in GL events, I had been working in the exhibition industry for a while and had considerable experience in my trade: shell scheme building and electrical. My eagerness to learn repositioned me and placed me at an advantage to grow in my trade within a very short space of time,"" said Jeremiah. ""At the time, my focus was solely on doing my job seamlessly and I must say that I was completely taken by surprise when I was chosen to be part of the team that will be placed on international projects. I had not thought that my manager at the time was noticing me or the effort I put in my work. I knew at that moment that I was doing something right and I would have to keep at it,"" added Jeremiah. Research has proven that investing in your employee's professional growth is not only crucial for business growth but also positively impacts workplace engagement, employee retention and employee empowerment.

"COP25","South.Africa","COP25_South.Africa39","Harness Youth to Change World's Future","March 31, 2020","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","Vanessa Nakate of Uganda may have been cropped out of a photograph taken at the World Economic Forum, but she along with Swedish activist Greta Thunberg have made the climate crisis centre stage. Women Deliver Young Leader Jyotir Nisha discusses with Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado Quesada on how to harness young people to overcome gender inequality and address climate change in a recent wide-ranging interview. Quesada says key strategies to designing policy to fight climate change require unconventional decision-making to address challenges like climate change, biodiversity loss, the fourth industrial revolution, and inequality. ""These are intertwined factors that can hinder development if unattended but, if tackled, they could potentially accelerate progress and wellbeing for all,"" he says. ""And, of course, this is a task that young leaders are able to handle and produce the timely answers that are necessary."" Bringing in her experience in the non-profit sector, Nisha says training girls and women in up-cycling plastic waste to produce handmade goods has assisted them to contribute to their family income and their empowerment in the community. The question is, how can this be broadened. Quesada says women, in particular young women, are leading the way. ""From cooperative seed banks, to early warning networks, from solar engineers to women politicians carving a path of sustainable policymaking. They are at the forefront of forest conservation, sustainable use of resources, and community enhancement, and restoration of landscapes and forest ecosystems,"" he says. However, women's roles are often underestimated, unrecognised, and unpaid. ""Women and girls with access to technology have already begun developing innovative tools to reduce emissions by targeting sustainable consumption and production practices, including food waste, community waste management, energy efficiency, and sustainable fashion."" The solutions exist, but much more is needed. The President suggests that the way investments are made could be fundamental to ensure a flow of finance to the communities, including women, and youth. This will, he believes, provide ""a stable source of funding for businesses and services that contribute to the solution of social or environmental challenges."" The impact of this will be partnerships between traditional sources of finance, like international cooperation and development banks, and new partners, like philanthropy, hedge funds, or pension funds. ""And what better than young people giving the thrust that all this requires?"" Nisha says she was pleased to see the massive mobilisation of young people at the inaugural Climate Action Summit last year. The summit had little good news for climate change with concerns raised that the accelerating rise in sea level, melting ice would have on socio-economic development, health, displacement, food security and ecosystems. However, beyond taking to the streets, they also need to hold decision-makers accountable. ""In the last months we have witnessed the irruption of massive mobilisations in different parts of the world, lead mostly by young people. This would seem surprising for a generation that has been accused several times of passivity, indifference, and individualism,"" Quesada says. ""I truly believe that, as long as these demands are channelled through democratic and pacifist means, they are extremely important to set a bar and a standard of responsibility for us, decision-makers -- who are, by the way, more and more often, young people."" He adds that world leaders owe them explanations of the decisions made. ""We must also have the wisdom to pay attention to these demands and take into account their opinions and proposals to reach agreements that have the legitimacy of consensus-building."" However, Nisha notes, while campaigns like the Deliver for Good campaign is working across sectors reports at COP25 , and the recent World Economic Forum (Davos), ""climate change continues to threaten progress made toward gender equality across every measure of development."" At WEF Global Gender Gap Report 2020 showed that it would take more than a lifetime, 99.5 years in 2019 for gender parity across health, education, work and politics to be achieved. Quesada says the climate catastrophe ""demands that policymakers and practitioners renew commitments to sustainable development -- at the heart of which is, and must continue to be, advancing gender equality and women's empowerment, and realising women's rights as a pre-requisite for sustainable development."" Costa Rica, he says, has been recognised internationally on two significant areas: the respect of human rights and environmental protection. ""The present Administration has taken these objectives a step further by paying particular attention to women's rights, inclusion, and diversity, and including them as part of our core policy principles and our everyday practices,"" he says. ""We expect to increase women's integration into productive processes and achieve women's economic empowerment through specific policies linked to our long-term development strategy -- the Decarbonization Plan -- allowing the transformational changes our society needs. However, the critical question, Nisha says, is: ""What can world leaders and governments do today to ensure young people have a seat at the decision-making table?"" Quesada is confident that young people will be part of the solution. ""The challenges we are facing today are unprecedented precisely because previous generations did not have to face situations such as biodiversity loss, global warming, or the emergence of artificial intelligence and technology. Thus, we need new answers and solutions from Twenty-First Century people, and those should and will be put forward by the youth,"" he says. The importance of youth involvement was recently highlighted too at the meeting of African Leaders for Nutrition in Addis Ababa. African Development Bank (AfDB) President Akinwumi Adesina said Africa should invest in skills development for the youth so the continent's entrepreneurs can leverage emerging technologies to transform Africa's food system to generate new jobs. This is especially urgent as the population on the continent is expected to double to 2.5 billion people in 40 years putting pressure on governments to deliver more food and jobs in addition to better livelihoods. In a recent interview with IPS International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA) Director General, Nteranya Sanginga, explained that this change is neither easy or necessarily something all leadership has taken on board. ""Our legacy is starting a programme to change the mindset of the youth in agriculture. Unfortunately (with) our governments that is where you have to go and change mindsets completely. Most probably 90 per cent of our leaders consider agriculture as a social activity basically for them its (seen as a) pain, penury. They proclaim that agriculture is a priority in resolving our problems, but we are not investing in it. We need that mindset completely changed."" Quesada is unequivocal that this attitude needs to change. ""My advice to world leaders is to have the humility to listen to the people and to allow more inclusive and participatory decision-making. And to the young people, I can only encourage them to own their future, and to act accordingly, with vision, courage, and determination."" Follow @IPSNewsUNBureau \"

"COP25","South.Africa","COP25_South.Africa41","In denial about climate change? Then think again","December 5, 2019 Thursday","Business Day (South Africa)","In denial about climate change? Then think again If there were an SA equivalent of Greta Thunberg, she might have a few things to say to our government, as well as to business leaders. ""Why didn't you protect our rivers from pollution and look after our water systems?"" she might ask. ""Why didn't you help the farmers hit by the terrible drought, and invest massively in solar power? You have stolen my future. How dare you?"" The messages about climate change are becoming more urgent. UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres, opening the COP25 talks in Madrid this week, said important decisions must be taken now to limit emissions that cause the greenhouse effect, adding the planet is close to ""the point of no return"" and urging all countries to cut pollutant emissions to help combat climate change. In SA, with recent heatwaves, the ongoing drought and unseasonal flooding in the Western Cape, our minds have been rudely turned to conservation and, by extension, climate change. There is a curious vacuum of knowledge on the topic in SA, however. The 2018 Afrobarometer survey found that 54% of South Africans had never heard of climate change. But with water-shedding looming, there are surely fewer climate change deniers on the ground today than a mere year ago. Environment minister Barbara Creecy, citing the Afrobarometer survey at the 10th Oppenheimer Research Conference held in September, found that even among South Africans with postsecondary education, as many as 37% said that they had not heard of climate change. The study, remarkable in so many ways, also found a staggering level of apathy among the populace: though the majority (53%) of South Africans who had heard of climate change said it was making life worse, only 52% of those believed ""it needed to be stopped"". A Trumpian mindset seems to be prevalent among South Africans, who seemingly want everything to stay the same to ensure the same old elites keep making their magnificent profits in the face of looming disaster for all forms of life. In her address, Creecy went on to say that an upscaling in environmental literacy is crucial to create a society where ""everyone has the understanding, skills and motivation to make responsible decisions that consider her or his relationship to natural systems, communities and future generations"". If one accepts that sustainable development is possible only when underpinned by an environmentally literate society, she said, then it is not just about ""making scientific evidence more available, accessible, clear, relevant and reliable for policymakers, it's about making it more available, clear, relevant and reliable for everyone"". The warning bells are tolling and we have been roundly rapped on the knuckles, so here is my choice, with the help of Ben Williams from The Reading List, of the top five SA books on climate change. They make for sobering reading. Wild Law: A Manifesto for Earth Justice, by Cormac Cullinan A practising environmental attorney in Cape Town, Cullinan points out in Wild Law how our governance has failed us with regards to the environment. Our laws are based on the myth that humans are separate from nature, says Cullinan, informed by religious and traditional beliefs that have allowed us to behave in an arrogant and superior way regarding the other species that share the planet with us. In SA, the myth of the ""master species"" was reflected in apartheid. A paradigm shift is therefore required for governments to adopt a social governance, an Earth jurisprudence that moves us from a ""homosphere"" to an Earth-centred worldview. Wise About Waste: 150+ Ways to Help the Planet, by Helen Moffett This might be another predictable addition to the recycling debate were it not for Moffett's sparkling writing style and out-of-the-box suggestions. She's clearly thought this issue through, from how to conscientise yourself about where those things come from that we consume, to debunking the dominant climate denial arguments. (No, population explosion isn't the problem; richer societies consume more than poorer ones.) There are chapter headings from ""Saving Electricity"" to ""Plastic Ain't Fantastic"" and ""Clothing and Textiles"", some of them obviously offering hints we've heard before, but this slim book is a great reminder. Look out for the chapter on ""The Radical, Unpopular and Downright Weird Stuff"". It might convince you to stipulate that your body should be composted at your death. See also Moffett's 101 Water Wise Ways (2018). A useful guide for everyone living in SA, this book has a wide scope. If you want facts and figures, as well as details of important reports and conferences, you will find them here. The authors are an environment reporter (Kings) and a science journalist (Wild) with an MSc in bioethics and health law. Their style is hard-hitting as well as wry and anecdotal, so though you are being lectured, you won't feel it as much. They start off saying that survival is likely, acknowledging that much of climate change activism is ""panicked tactics"" to convince people of the gravity of the situation. Reading that the interior of SA is now 2\'b0C hotter than in 1900 is likely to cause you concern, but Kings and Wild also give much solid information of what you can do in your everyday life to help and prepare for the future. There is some useful information on our two biggest cities, Johannesburg and Cape Town, about what is working for them and what plans they have in store to mitigate water scarcity and create alternative energy sources. Boiling Point: People in a Changing Climate, by Leonie Joubert This interesting, unusual book brings climate change right down to the individual, to grass roots level. It's a collection of stories about the people who are, and will be, most affected by the changing weather patterns: poor people, mostly those living in rural areas. Joubert has become a strong voice among SA's climate change activists. In Boiling Point she interrogates the gulf between the sources of pollution - the rich West - and those who are most vulnerable to its effects. But Hesselman's future is uncertain because a process of desertification, originating in Namibia, has his lands in its path. In writerly fashion, with empathy, Joubert tells his story, underpinning it with the science. There is also the story of Ernest Titus, a west coast fisherman who became a victim of the postapartheid transformation within the industry. His livelihood is further threatened as the cold Benguela current, which moves up that coast, shows signs of warming. Joubert traces the story of the Whitfields, third-generation farmers in the Free State, who know the weather patterns intimately. They are faced with the choice of continuing a time-tested method or diversifying to a new crop like biofuels to make a living. Filled with excellent photographs, this book will move as well as inform. The Climate Crisis, by Vishwas Satgar Building on a previous volume in the Democratic Marxism series, Capitalism's Crises: Class Struggles in SA and the World, this new book, The Climate Crisis, regards climate change as a crisis and calls for civilisational transformation. It presents a range of contributors, placing Marxism in dialogue with anti-capitalism while placing nature at its centre. Contributors include Dorothy Grace Guerrero, writing on ""The Limits of Capitalist Solutions to the Climate Crisis""; Devan Pillay on ""Challenging the Growth Paradigm: Marx, Buddha and the Pursuit of 'Happiness'""; and Nnimmo Bassey on ""The Climate Crisis and the Struggle for African Food Sovereignty"". Prof Jacklyn Cock of Wits presents an eco-feminist-socialist perspective in a chapter that examines a ""just transition"". Satgar presents his solutions, including deepening democracy, more values-centred institutions and mass popular education, in the conclusion to this sober, academic exploration of the climate change issue.

"COP25","South.Africa","COP25_South.Africa42","UN's 75th Anniversary Shadowed By Right-Wing Nationalism, Widespread Authoritarianism & Budgetary Cuts","October 17, 2019","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","When the six much-ballyhooed high-level UN meetings concluded late September, there were mixed feelings about the final outcomes. And civil society organizations (CSOs), who were mostly disappointed with the results, are now gearing themselves for two upcoming key climate summit meetings: COP25 in Santiago, Chile in December and COP26 in Glasgow, UK in late 2020, along with the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Women's Conference scheduled to take place in September 2020 in New York. But perhaps the most politically-significant event in 2020 will be the 75th anniversary of the United Nations which will take place amidst continued threats against multilateral institutions, rising right-wing nationalism, growing authoritarianism and widespread disinformation. The anniversary will also take place in the shadow of one of the worst financial crises facing the world body - as Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that ""the situation remains dire. And without immediate action, I can no longer guarantee the smooth functioning of the Organization."" ""I urge you to help put the United Nations on a solid financial footing,"" he pleaded last month before the 134 members of the Group of 77 developing countries, plus China. Sesheeni Joud Selvaratnam, Sustainable Development Goals and Agenda 2030 lead at ActionAid, told IPS the United Nations is marking its 75th anniversary next year against a backdrop of rising global hunger, the climate crisis and an unravelling of progress towards social justice and equality. ""It's not too late to get the Sustainable Development Goals back on track, but the 2020 global summits must see political will and leadership that translates into real action on the ground. ""States turning up and making commitments at the High-Level Political Forum and UN General Assembly isn't enough. Governments must be held accountable to their citizens on implementing and delivering on their promises by 2030, and ensuring the most vulnerable are not left behind,"" said Selvaratnam. Jens Martens, executive director of Global Policy Forum (New York/Bonn), told IPS the summits have put the UN back at the centre of the global debates on future justice. At least, many Heads of State and Government have recognized the climate emergency and the importance of sustainable development by participating in the summits. ""They have launched countless new initiatives to implement the SDGs. This is of course better than the destructive policies of Trump, Brazil's Bolsonaro & Co,"" he noted. But, being present at the summits, making nice speeches, dating Greta Thunberg, and expressing understanding for the concerns of young people is not enough, he added. ""As long as governments do not change fundamentally the framework conditions of sustainable development, this will remain symbolic policy and sometimes pure actionism."" The summits were once again summits of announced actions. But the world does not need more hypocritical promises and announcements, he pointed out. ""It needs political decisions that make fiscal policies fairer, bring global economic and monetary policy into line with SDGs and human rights, and rapidly accelerate the exit from the fossil fuel economy"", said Martens, who has coordinated the international Civil Society Reflection Group on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In an oped piece for IPS last week, Kul Gautam, a former UN Assistant Secretary-General said: Everybody says UN needs reforms. But the kind of reforms that are proposed by Member States are often timid and inadequate, and in the case of those proposed by some, e.g. the Trump administration, they are actually harmful and contrary to the multilateral ethos of the United Nations. Such proposals are unlikely to command broad-based support, he warned. It is time for the Secretary-General himself to take the initiative and commission a high-level panel to propose a more predictable and sustainable funding of the UN, said Gautam. The 75th anniversary of the UN in 2020 is a perfect occasion for the S-G to present a bold proposal for a more sustainable funding mechanism for the UN in keeping with the ambitious Sustainable Development Agenda for 2030 that the UN has championed so boldly, he declared. Teresa Anderson, climate policy coordinator at ActionAid, told IPS 2019 has seen an unprecedented uprising of ordinary citizens around the world, inspired by young people, taking to the streets to demand action on the climate crisis. ""They have exposed the failure of the richest polluting countries at the UN climate action summit to respond with the ambition needed to address the scale of the climate emergency. ""Ahead of the climate summit in Santiago this December, we're demanding meaningful financial support to address the injustice of climate change. Important proposals to support countries dealing with climate-induced 'loss and damage' are on the table"", she added. It's critical that the world does not turn its back on the vulnerable countries left to pick up the pieces after climate disasters, Anderson declared. The September summits covered several issues on the UN agenda, including Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Climate Action, Universal Health Care, Financing for Development (FfD), Nuclear Disarmament and Small Island Developing States (SIDS). Still, what is particularly annoying, Martens told IPS, is that the UN provided an exposed stage at the summits for billionaire Bill Gates and numerous representatives of transnational corporations. The last few decades have shown that the market-based solutions these corporate actors have propagated have not solved the global crises, but rather aggravated them, he noted. Martens said the more than 300 representatives of civil society organizations (CSOs) which met parallel to the SDG Summit at the People's Assembly have rightly stated in their declaration: ""We are saddened by the persisting lack of political will and leadership to even begin to address these issues. This is not good enough. This is failure."" Jesse Griffiths, Head of Programme, Development Strategy and Finance Overseas Development Institute, told IPS ""I did a blog for our website on the Dialogue - available here."" ""My main concern would be that while it was important that the level of attention to the issue was raised - this was a high-level event with heads of state involved - the event itself had been structured so that no concrete outcomes could be made. This has been a problem of the FfD process itself - the FfD Forums that are held every year could in theory agree what needs to be done to put us on track to finance the SDGs, ""but in practice they merely take stock of where we are, and have so far produced no real concrete outcomes"", he added. ""I fear this state of paralysis will continue until we have another high-level summit to follow up from Addis Ababa in 2015,"" said Griffiths. According to Guterres, the summit did produce several positive initiatives. ""Let me be specific about just a few"", he told at the conclusion of the meeting. He said 77 countries - many in the industrialized world - had committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. And they were joined by 10 regions and more than 100 cities - including several of the world's largest. More than 2,000 cities committed to putting climate risk at the centre of decision-making, creating 1,000 bankable, climate-smart urban projects. UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric provided the final figures: a total of 195 speakers participated, including the Holy See, the State of Palestine and the European Union. Uzbekistan was the only country that did not speak. Among the speakers -- 82 Heads of State and 43 [Heads of Government]. There were 16 women speakers, which was 8.2 per cent only of all the speakers, and that is slightly lower than last year, when there were 19 women speakers or about 9.8 per cent. To put matters into perspective, on the first day of the General Debate, he said, there were two female Heads of State and one Head of Government, compared to 29 male Heads of State and five male Heads of Government. ""We also had the Climate Action Summit and six other major meetings at the UN during the time of the General Debate."" In addition, from 23 through 30 September, 1,674 bilateral meetings were held at the UN. And, as of 30 September, 566 other meetings, including those of regional groups [and] UN system entities, were held during the high level debate. And, for our part, said Dujarric, ""we issued 137 readouts from the Secretary General's bilateral meetings."" The writer can be contacted at HYPERLINK \"
"COP25","South.Africa","COP25_South.Africa43","The decade that decides our fate","December 20, 2019","Mail & Guardian","This was the decade of climate negotiations, extreme heat and record-setting carbon emissions. It started with little hope of action to control global warming, flirted with hope and ended with that hope largely squashed. Sipho Kings writes that, by this time next year, we'll know if we're going to do enough to keep this world vaguely habitable. If we don't do enough, in a decade's time there'll be droughts, floods, wildfires and crop failure on an apocalyptic scale, causing deaths, social unrest and mass migrationIf average global temperatures increase at their current rate, the United Nation's climate scientists warn of a world where ecosystems  including coral reefs, wetlands and forests  collapse. Many parts of the world will be too hot to work in. Droughts and floods destroy agricultural systems. People starve. Mass migration occurs and destabilises unprepared recipient countries. In their report, titled ""Global Warming of 1.5\'c2\'b0C"", the scientists warn what this means: ""Poverty levels increase to a very large degree and incidents of starvation increase very significantly."" High levels of public unrest then follow, ""resulting in some countries becoming dysfunctional"". The report came late last year, in the middle of the hottest period in recorded history. Last year also set the record for the most global carbon emissions. This year will probably break that record. In South Africa, there's been unseasonal flooding, record temperatures have been set across the highveld and drought cripples large swathes of the country. Emissions here have only declined because of economic stagnation. Globally, it has been a decade dominated by climate. Extreme weather events, a change in the language we use and mass protests have made the climate crisis a major concern of many voters around the world. The decade included, in Paris in 2015, the adoption of an international climate agreement, but it was bookended with failed negotiations. The decade started with a low point. In late 2009, at climate negotiations in Copenhagen, the promise of an international agreement to do something about carbon emissions was choked out. Nobody was willing to compromise. Getting 200 countries to agree on something is difficult  we can't even all agree that landmines are bad. With no one willing to compromise, a group of leaders led by Barack Obama, then the president of the United States, unilaterally signed off on a plan to reduce emissions. South Africa's president also signed it. The Copenhagen Accord noted that ""strong political will to urgently combat climate change"" was needed. It suggested a goal: ""The increase in global temperature should be below 2\'c2\'b0C."" At this point, the world had already warmed by 0.8\'c2\'b0C. It has now warmed by 1.2\'c2\'b0C. That seems like a fractional increase, but fractions of a degree normally come over the course of centuries and we're on course for a near 4\'c2\'b0C rise in the world's temperature since the start of the industrial revolution in the late 1700s. Copenhagen was the foundation of South Africa's climate plan, which allows emissions to grow by more than 20% until 2025, stay there for a decade and then drop from 2035  but still not to levels that scientists say are needed. This plan is tied to Eskom's coal-fired power plants, with most of the fleet being decommissioned by 2035. But the plan has been roundly criticised. The international organisation, Climate Action Tracker (CAT)  the most authoritative group on collating the sum total of countries' plans  has labelled South Africa's ""highly insufficient"". If every country in the world did as little as South Africa about its carbon emissions, CAT says the world would warm by nearly 4\'c2\'b0C. With goodwill gone after Copenhagen, it took extraordinary negotiating skills  led by South Africans  at international climate negotiations in Durban in 2011 to rescue things. This led to the 2015 Paris Agreement, a necessarily weak plan for tackling climate: to get more countries in, you have to demand less of them. That was the strategy used to put in place the Montreal Protocol on ozone-depleting substances, signed in 1987, which started small but has done so well that it has now done more than any other international agreement to lower carbon emissions. At the heart of the Paris Agreement are nationally determined contributions  what each country says it will do to lower emissions.Nations agreed at the Paris Agreement to limit global warming. (Guillem Sartorio/AFP)South Africa's current plan is basically the same as its 2009 one. The Paris Agreement asks governments to hold ""the increase in global average temperature to well below 2\'c2\'b0C"". That's the number scientists think would do a great deal of damage, but wouldn't collapse the world as we know it. The agreement also asks countries to ""pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\'c2\'b0C"". That's the number African countries, and the island states that are already disappearing under the rising sea, say is the maximum threshold before things start to go seriously wrong. It's a number that will probably be exceeded in the coming decade. In late 2018, the UN's climate agency, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, published the ""Global Warming of 1.5\'c2\'b0C"" report. This looked at what happens if the world warms by more than 1.5\'c2\'b0C. Even the best-case scenario comes with drought, flooding, hunger and mass migration. Each of these cases get worse the longer the world continues to emit high levels of carbon pollution and they all threaten the existence of human society in its current form, with the possibility of tens to hundreds of millions of people dying. Given the stakes, the report said large-scale, ""unprecedented"" action needed to happen to cut global carbon emissions by 45% by 2030 and to net zero by 2050. Countries, mostly in Western Europe, are cutting emissions in line with this scientific warning. South Africa's plan  and the new national energy plan  doesn't follow what science says is needed. Medupi and Kusile, the world's third- and fourth-biggest coal power plants, will still be operating in 2050. As could two private coal plants the government wants to build, despite a court order that government look at those plants' effect on climate change and reconsider its decision. Spurred on by the 1.5\'c2\'b0C report's warning, and following the withdrawal of the US from the Paris Agreement, the UN secretary general, Ant\'c3\'b3nio Guterres, has become more vocal about the need for countries to adopt more ambitious climate change actions. In September, he called a summit where he asked countries to come up with better plans. South Africa wasn't given a speaking slot because its plan wasn't ambitious enough. So, President Cyril Ramaphosa sent the speech he would have delivered. This noted that ""our region is likely to become drier and drastically warmer"", and pointed to Cyclone Idai and the 1000 people who died in Southern Africa as an example of extreme weather events. Local research, he said, points to ""major climate change impacts occurring in the region over the next several decades"". These include ""multiyear droughts that compromise water security and heatwaves impacting on human health, livestock production and crop yield"". At the COP25 The country plans that came out of Paris come into effect next year, or in 2025, and many countries are required to submit more ambitious plans before the climate talks in Glasgow next year. To be more ambitious, South Africa should decommission coal-fired power plants earlier than planned. The national energy plan shows that replacing coal with wind, energy and gas power plants would be cheaper than running an Eskom fleet (which in any event can provide only 70% of its capacity). Closing coal-fired plants breaking air quality laws will prevent the deaths of 333 people a year. That national energy planhas been stalled thanks to corruption, ineptitude, political infighting and competing interests of departments, such as mineral resources and energy, environment and public enterprises. And the unions failed to be proactive and prepare for energy from wind and sun and instead hampered plans to deal with Eskom's crisis. Despite South Africa's promise (and those of other countries) to scale things up, the Madrid talks largely failed. These were meant to iron out technical details left undecided at the Paris Agreement, including carbon trading and who pay for damage already done by the climate crisis. Countries such as the US and Brazil were instrumental in undermining the negotiations. A decade that started with little hope has ended in gloom, despite the optimism of Paris in 2015. The science says carbon emissions have to almost halve by the end of the next decade. Nothing shows that this will happen. But in the spirit of Christmas, South Africa could rewrite its part in this narrative. If the national energy plan is followed, the country will build a mixed grid dominated by wind and solar power. That would save lives and create a whole new economy. \"

Don't do drugs? No means no? Practice safe sex? Take care of your mental health? Stop using plastic? How about: should you have children? It's not a question about population control. While we're heading for 9.7 billion people (by 2050) on the planet, population experts tell us we'll reach a peak of 11 billion in 2100 and then begin to decline. Left to our own devices, we will naturally start to reduce population levels. Rather, the question is one of how messed up a place the world is. Do our youth want to bring children into the kind of world that awaits them? While many generations before this one considered their times to be the most terrible yet faced - think slavery, think plague, think emerging from the ruins of World War 2 - this may just be the first generation that will witness humanity falling off the edge of cliff - a cliff of our own making. In his opening remarks to the United Nations' 25th Conference of Parties ( COP 25 ) on climate change in the first week of December, secretary-general Ant& xF3;nio Guterres was clear: ""At current trends, we are looking at global heating of between 3.4 and 3.9& xBA;C by the end of the century"". Referring to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) latest reports, Guterres didn't pull any punches: ""We are knowingly destroying the very support systems keeping us alive"". This is what we know. Global average levels of carbon dioxide have now reached the same levels of CO& xB2; concentration last seen on the planet 3 to 5 million years ago. The last five years have been the hottest ever recorded, Antarctica is melting three times as fast as a decade ago, permafrost in the Artic is thawing 70 years ahead of projections and our ocean levels are rising quicker than expected. Add to this the pollution of everything, the decimation of other living organisms to the extent it's been dubbed the world's ""sixth extinction event"", the destruction of natural forests and habitats to feed our insatiable desire for meat - is there any doubt that the world is pretty much a messed up place? And by 2050, what then? Unfortunately, this isn't a 21st Century movie write-up of the Grinch who stole Christmas. Even though it may feel that way, it's simply what we can reliably expect - greater weather extremes, drought, water scarcity and rising sea levels. And we're heading off this cliff knowingly. And if by some kindness the Christmas Fairy grants us a wish that allows us to ignore the global reality, the SA picture doesn't get better. Statistics SA have released a number of recent reports that bring no Christmas cheer. It is the unholy trinity of social challenges: poverty, unemployment and inequality. By example, 30.4 million South Africans (our current population is close to 59 million) live on the equivalent of R992 a month or less. Out of our estimated working population of 38.6 million, only 16.4 million are employed. Assume the Christmas Fairy allows us a second wish that enables us to only see our city, to ignore the world, to ignore the state of SA, then the Grinch will have truly arrived. Our mayor's response to being publicly told by the Business Chamber that the city is dysfunctional, is to deflect to race - he's reported to have said it is whites who have stolen the water. Not the drought, not the collapsing infrastructure, not the lack of a municipal Day Zero-type strategy, but people who appear different to himself. It's at this point that a column of this nature is meant to leave the door slightly ajar to allow Father Christmas to sneak in with the gift of hope. But there is no hope, just as there is no Christmas Fairy offering us three wishes. The only gift left in the bag is choice. But what kind of choice? When my generation still qualified as youth, we wanted to go forth, we had seen the Christmas lights, apartheid was over, the world beckoned, there was no Grinch in sight. But that's not how it is seen today. As a young person said to me recently, the ship is going down so either we do nothing or we party hard on the deck until we sink below the waves. The UN's Guterres has a different view. According to him we stand at a critical juncture faced with two paths. One is the ""path of surrender"", whereby we sleepwalk past the point of no return, jeopardising the wellbeing of future generations. Or we choose a ""path of resolve"", a path of sustainable solutions whereby fossil fuel stays in the ground and we achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. But that, according to Guterres, requires a transformational approach, not an incremental one, a ""rapid and deep change in the way we do business, how we generate power, how we build cities, how we move, and how we feed the world."" And therein lies the second part of the conversation with our youth. If their choice is to bring more lives into being on this planet, there is a precondition. We must by then have learnt to see our place in the world differently - that it's not about how much we can extract to optimise our pleasure, but about how we collectively ensure that every creature on the planet has clean air to breathe, non-toxic water to drink or swim in and sufficient food that doesn't poison us. \"

"COP25","South.Africa","COP25_South.Africa47","UN Chief Warns of Rising Misogyny, Xenophobia, Discrimination, Racism & Hate Speech [document]","December 19, 2019","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","Antonio Guterres, United Nations Secretary-General, in an address to the Italian Senate As we prepare to bid farewell to 2019, we must take a clearsighted look at the global situation and the new challenges we face. Our world is undergoing a shift. It is no longer bipolar or unipolar. But it is not yet truly multipolar. Balances of power are changing, creating new and dangerous risks. Around the globe - and just a few hundred kilometres from here - national and regional tensions are spreading. The Sahel, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan - these conflicts are causing terrible suffering and uprooting millions of people. Rather than wars between sovereign States, we now see asymmetric conflicts between States and non-State groups. With the growing interference of third parties, these conflicts rapidly take on a regional dimension and are linked to new forms of global instability and terrorism. The impact of the Libyan conflict on the Sahel and the Lake Chad regions shows how national conflicts can draw in neighbouring states and global powers, creating regional insecurity with implications across continents. In the background to these conflicts is the renewed threat of nuclear proliferation, which is making a worrying comeback. If we hope to make our world more peaceful and secure, we must start by addressing the underlying causes of tension and conflict. Prevention is more essential than ever; and prevention on the scale we need is only possible through multilateralism. That is why all the work of the United Nations is based on crisis prevention and mediation; combating violent extremism and strengthening peace and security; advancing sustainable, inclusive development; and protecting the human rights and dignity of all people, everywhere. We are pursuing all these efforts in cooperation with regional organizations, including the European Union, a long-standing and essential partner. I want to focus on five areas in which we face new risks and widening fault lines - and suggest some ways of solutions. The first area is a failure of global solidarity with the most vulnerable. I arrived in Rome from Geneva, where I attended the Global Refugee Forum. This forum aims to turn the Global Compact on Refugees, agreed by governments last year, into action, by sharing responsibility for refugees between members of the international community. I commend the openness, care and compassion the Italians have shown towards tens of thousands of refugees who have arrived on your shores in recent years. It is deeply troubling that refugees and migrants continue to die as they cross seas and deserts. We must do everything we can to prevent it, by taking action in countries of origin, transit countries and countries of destination. Above all, we need collective responses, including development programmes that target young people with opportunities and jobs in regions of origin. We must investigate and prosecute the human traffickers and criminal networks that profit from people's misery. We must strengthen regular pathways for migration and the resettlement of refugees. And honour the integrity of the international refugee protection regime, not just in words, but in deeds. It is unacceptable that people who fear for their lives are being blamed for societies' problems. We must all support each other. We are seeing a troubling pushback against human rights around the world, including rising misogyny, xenophobia, discrimination, racism and hate speech of all kinds. Populists try to exploit discontent and division to win and keep power. We must challenge them with leadership and political courage, based on reason and facts. That is why I have initiated two new strategies at the United Nations: to safeguard religious sites, and to combat hate speech in all its forms. Diversity is not a threat but an asset. But it requires investment in social cohesion, so that every community feels that its identity is respected, and every person can participate fully in society as a whole. The climate crisis is no longer a long-term problem. It is here. And it is now. It is a dangerous reality for many people, especially those living in some of the poorest and most vulnerable countries in the world. While they contribute the least to greenhouse gas emissions, they are suffering most. I saw this myself last year when I visited the Caribbean and Mozambique in the aftermath of devastating storms. And I have to say, you madame president have spoken about that. My first trip when I got married was to Italy. And I was so deeply shocked when seeing on television the dramatic impact of climate change and that wonderful pearl of European civilization. I want to express my deep solidarity with Venice and with Italy. We have fooled ourselves into thinking we can fool nature. But nature is fighting back, with a vengeance. The last few years have been the hottest ever recorded. Sea levels are the highest in human history. Icecaps are receding and deserts are expanding. Our ecosystems are facing unprecedented threats. Climate-related natural disasters are becoming more frequent, more deadly and more destructive, with growing human and financial costs. Drought in some parts of the world is progressing at alarming rates, endangering food security, triggering conflicts, and forcing people from their homes. Every year, air pollution associated with climate change kills seven million people. The climate crisis is a dramatic threat to human health and human security. And this is just the beginning. If we fail to act now, history will record that we had all the tools needed to change - but we chose not to. Our children and grandchildren will not forgive us if we sacrifice their future for fake short-term profit. I am disappointed, as I said in the aftermath of the meeting, with the results of the climate talks, COP25 , in Madrid. The international community missed an opportunity to show increased ambition in mitigation, adaptation and finance in order to be able to tackle the climate crisis. But as I also said, we will not give up. It was clear at the talks that most countries are still determined to advance more ambitious climate action, and that businesses and financial institutions are moving ahead. The science is clear: we must reduce greenhouse emissions by 45 per cent by 2030; achieve carbon neutrality by 2050; and limit the global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. We are currently on target to produce nearly three times as much coal as is safe for our planet and for our future. But having said so, my message remains one of hope, not of despair. The scientific community tells us that the roadmap to stay below 1.5 degrees is still within reach - if we act now. The technologies needed are already available. And the signs of hope are multiplying. More and more cities, financial institutions and businesses, civil societies entities are committing to the 1.5 degree pathway. The most important sign of hope is that young people are mobilizing and taking the lead everywhere - including in Europe. But we need more political will. It is time to put a price on carbon and stop subsidizing fossil fuels with taxpayers' money. We must stop rewarding pollution that is killing people and tax carbon rather than income. The polluters - not the people - must pay. We must stop building coal power plants in the world from 2020 onwards. And stop digging and drilling and take advantage of the vast possibilities offered by renewable energy and nature-based solutions. The world's largest emitters must pull their weight. Without them, our goal is unreachable. I welcome the EU's recent commitment to become carbon neutral by 2050 and to work on a European Green Deal, including a more ambitious mitigation target for 2030, and funds for a just transition to a green economy. Next year's conference, COP26, hosted by the United Kingdom in partnership with Italy, will be a defining moment. In the 12 months ahead, we must keep climate ambition at the top of the international agenda. We must secure more ambitious national commitments - particularly from the countries with the highest emissions - to start reducing greenhouse gas emissions immediately, consistent with reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. We must also meet the expectations of developing countries for resources and support towards adaptation and mitigation, disaster response and recovery. We cannot ignore the social dimensions of the transition in energy. National commitments must include a just transition for people whose jobs and livelihoods are affected. We have no time to waste and we fully trust italy's leadership in the preparations of COP26. The global solidarity gap and the climate crisis are linked with three other widening fault lines that should concern us all. The two largest economies, the U.S. and China, could create two separate and competing areas of influence, each with its own dominant currency, trade and financial rules, and military strategies. Each would have its own internet and its own forms of artificial intelligence. This would dramatically increase the risk of confrontation. We must do everything possible to avert this Great Fracture and preserve a global system: a universal economy with respect for international law; a multipolar world with solid multilateral institutions. For this, we need a strong Europe, as a fundamental pillar of a multilateral order based on the rule of law and respect for fundamental freedoms. This is not always easy. But successful multilateralism depends on a united and ambitious European Union. At the national level, we see another widening fault line in the social contract. People feel that economies are not working for them. We are witnessing a wave of protests across the world. Each situation is unique, but they have two features in common: a growing deficit of trust between people and political establishments, coupled with the negative effects of globalisation and technological progress. People are suffering and want to be heard. They want equality, social and economic systems that work for everybody. They want their human rights and fundamental freedoms to be respected. And they want to have a say in the decisions that affect their lives. Governments have a duty to listen to their people, and to respect freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. Everyone must exercise restraint and prioritize dialogue in some of the dramatic crises we are facing today in different parts of the world. Many of these protests are being led by young people, in particular young women. They are making the links between climate injustice, inequalities and insecurity; and calling for new ways of organizing our political, economic and social systems. The response to this deep and widespread discontent should be based on a new social contract that is inclusive and fair, for our new age of globalization and hyper-connectivity. All people should be able to live in dignity. Women should have the same prospects for success as men. People with disabilities should have equal opportunities to realise their potential. The sick and the vulnerable should be protected. The 2030 Agenda adopted by the General Assembly, with its 17 Sustainable Development Goals, offers exactly that kind of social contract: sustainable, equitable and inclusive development that works for people and planet. Finally, these inequalities and fault lines are exacerbated by a growing technological divide. New technologies hold enormous promise. They are opening up a new world as tools for peace and sustainable development. But at the same time, they pose risks, and they can be misused for nefarious purposes. The Fourth Industrial Revolution could eradicate entire sectors of the labour market. And while it will also create new opportunities, they might require completely different skills. This could increase divisions and add to exclusion and inequality. Let's not forget that half the world is not even connected to the internet. We must therefore put in place long-term education strategies that integrate lifelong learning of new technologies. It is no longer enough to learn; everyone must learn how to learn to enable people to train for the jobs of the future and that no one is left behind. At the same time, we need a new generation of social protection with innovative safety nets for those facing the bigger risks. Technology must be a tool for peace, for social progress and reducing inequalities. And we must also address the misuse of technology to commit crimes, spread hate speech, manipulate information, oppress people or invade their privacy. We already know the results of these activities. Disinformation campaigns based on lies reach the furthest parts of the globe. Many countries have access to sophisticated cyber capabilities that can paralyze entire nations or companies - but what about those countries and people that cannot defend themselves in cyberspace? Traditional, rigid regulation, it is true, are no longer possible. Digital technology requires new, multi-stakeholder regulation frameworks that are faster and more flexible. And we must also come together to decide on some limits. I believe one of these limits should be a total ban on lethal autonomous weapons with the power and discretion to kill without human intervention. They are politically unacceptable and morally despicable. The United Nations can play the role of a convening platform here. It should be the place where governments, companies, researchers, civil society and others meet, to establish protocols to define red lines and best practices together. Last year, I convened a High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation co-chaired by Melinda Gates and Jack Ma. Its recommendations show how this multi-stakeholder vision can guide our joint efforts to accelerate global internet connectivity, build capacity, and improve digital governance. I am encouraged that this report has won support from technology companies, governments and civil society. The European Union has already set an example through the General Data Protection Regulation, inspiring similar measures elsewhere. I urge the EU and its Member States to continue to lead to shape the digital age and to be at the forefront of technological innovation and regulation. I have set out our response to these five fault lines and gaps, based on strong multilateral institutions, solidarity and mutual respect. But multilateralism itself needs to adapt to the challenges of today and tomorrow. Governments alone cannot achieve the 2030 Agenda or the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. They call for social and economic transformations that will only be brought about with the inclusion and full participation of all those involved: civil society, including young people, the private sector, academia and more. Women must be at the forefront. We cannot reduce poverty and inequality without addressing the world's most pervasive form of discrimination that affects half of humanity: women and girls. Gender inequality is first and foremost a question of power, and let's be frank, we still live in a male-dominated world with a male-dominated culture. We will shift the balance when we truly see women's rights as our common goal. And this is why immediately after assuming the leadership of the United Nations, I put a strategy in place to achieve gender parity well before 2030. That goal has already been reached in the areas directly under my control: the Senior Management Group and the leaders of our teams around the world have full parity. I will not rest until we have reached gender parity at all levels of the United Nations - and full equality for women and girls around the world. Today's multilateralism must be networked and inclusive, closer to the people we serve. We need to work hand in hand with regional organisations, international financial institutions, development banks and specialised agencies. And our cooperation cannot be limited to inter-governmental approaches and official institutions; I am happy to see members of civil society and young people here today. Legislators have a crucial role to play. As a former parliamentarian, first of all, I feel very much at home here. But I also know very much that your contribution is critical in advancing shared progress. Parliaments can be defenders of democracy and agents of accountability, bringing the concerns of ordinary people into the international arena. Today, we need you more than ever as a link between local actions and urgent global priorities. The challenges we face are interlinked and long-term; so must be our response. Fighting the climate crisis means advancing peace and social cohesion. Expanding access to technology means taking action for gender equality. Preventing crises means investing in inclusive and sustainable development. Next year, 2020, we will mark the 75th anniversary of the United Nations by convening a global conversation about the future we want and the UN we need. It will be open to all, to gather ideas and encourage collective action. The results will be presented to world leaders at the seventy-fifth session of the General Assembly next September. I invite all to participate in this dialogue. We want to use this anniversary to shape our future. We have proven in the past that we are able to come together. Let's rise to the occasion and build a better future for all. \"
"COP25","South.Africa","COP25_South.Africa48","UN Plans to Launch a 'Decade of Action' to Deliver Development Goals By 2030","January 23, 2020","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","2020 marks the 75th anniversary of the United Nations. I draw tremendous strength from all that we represent and all that we have achieved together. Yet anniversaries are not about celebrating the past; they are about looking ahead. We must cast our eyes to the future with hope. But we must also do so without illusion. I want to speak to you in stark and simple terms about the challenges we face. I see ""four horsemen"" in our midst -- four looming threats that endanger 21st-century progress and imperil 21st-century possibilities. The first horseman comes in the form of the highest global geostrategic tensions we have witnessed in years. Devastating conflicts continue to cause widespread misery. Terrorist attacks take a merciless toll. The nuclear menace is growing. More people have been forced from their homes by war and persecution than at any time since the Second World War. Tensions over trade and technology remain unresolved. The risk of a Great Fracture is real. Second, we face an existential climate crisis. Rising temperatures continue to melt records. The past decade was the hottest on record. Scientists tell us that ocean temperatures are now rising at the equivalent of five Hiroshima bombs a second. One million species are in near-term danger of extinction. Our planet is burning. Meanwhile, as we saw at COP25 , too many decision-makers continue to fiddle. Our world is edging closer to the point of no return. As one of our own reports revealed just yesterday, two of every three people live in countries where inequality has grown. Confidence in political establishments is going down. Young people are rising up. Women are rightly demanding equality and freedom from violence and discrimination. At the same time, fears and anxieties are spreading. Hostility against refugees and migrants is building. Hatred is growing. The fourth threat is the dark side of the digital world. We are not prepared for the profound impact of the Fourth Industrial Revolution on the labour market and the very structure of society. Artificial intelligence is generating breathtaking capacities and alarming possibilities. Lethal autonomous weapons -- machines with the power to kill on their own, without human judgement and accountability -- are bringing us into unacceptable moral and political territory. These four horsemen - epic geopolitical tensions, the climate crisis, global mistrust and the downsides of technology - can jeopardize every aspect of our shared future. That is why commemorating the 75th anniversary with nice speeches won't do. We must address these four 21st-century challenges with four 21st-century solutions. Let me take each in turn. First, peace and security, that I mentioned. There are some signs of hope. Last year, conflict was prevented in the wake of several critical elections, from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to Madagascar ... from Mali to the Maldives and beyond. Despite hostilities in Yemen, the fragile cease-fire in Hodeidah is holding. A constitutional committee in Syria has taken form, even if it is still facing meaningful obstacles. A peace agreement in the Central African Republic is being implemented. And the recent Berlin conference on Libya brought key players around the peace table at a critical moment, committing to ""refraining from interference in the armed conflict or in the internal affairs of Libya"" and urging ""all international actors to do the same"". All of these efforts require patience and persistence. But they are essential and save lives. As we look ahead, we have our work cut out for us. We see Gordian Knots across the world -- from the Gulf to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, from the Sahel and Lake Chad to Venezuela. Security Council resolutions are being ignored. Outside interference is fueling fires. And we are at risk of losing pillars of the international disarmament and arms control [architecture] without viable alternatives. Yes, the United Nations continues to deliver life-saving aid to millions of people in desperate need. But temporary relief is no substitute for permanent solutions. Prevention must orient all we do as we engage across the peace continuum. We must strengthen our mediation capacity and our tools for sustaining peace, leading to long-term development. Our Action for Peacekeeping initiative is enhancing performance and safety. We are becoming more effective in the protection of civilians, and we have more female peacekeepers than ever before. The 20th anniversary of Security Council resolution 1325 on women, peace and security is also an opportunity to further match words with deeds. At the same time, we know peacekeeping is not enough where there is no peace to keep. We need to create the conditions for effective peace enforcement and counter-terrorism operations by our regional partners, under chapter VII of the Charter and with predictable funding. This is especially true in Africa, from the Sahel to Lake Chad. And we must focus on the roots of crisis and upheaval -- combatting the drivers of violence and extremism - from exclusion to economic despair, from violent misogyny to governance failures. Last year, I launched first-of-its-kind action plans to combat hate speech and to safeguard religious sites. This year, I will convene a conference on the role of education in tackling hate speech. I call on all State Parties to work together at the 2020 Review of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to ensure the NPT remains able to fulfil its fundamental goals - preventing nuclear war and facilitating the elimination of nuclear weapons. The second ""horseman"" is the threat of climate catastrophe. We must respond with the promise of climate action. We are at war with nature. And nature is fighting back hard. One cannot look at the recent fires in Australia - at people fleeing their homes and wildlife consumed by the flames - without profound sadness at today's plight and fear for what the future may bring. Meanwhile, air pollution combined with climate change is killing, according to the World Health Organization, 7 million people every year. Gradual approaches are no longer enough. At the next climate conference -- COP26 in Glasgow - Governments must deliver the transformational change our world needs and that people demand, with much stronger ambition - ambition on mitigation, ambition on adaptation, and ambition on finance. Every city, region, bank, pension fund and industry must completely reimagine how they operate to keep temperature rise to 1.5 degrees. The scientific community is clear. We need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030, and reach net zero emissions by 2050. The main obligation rests on the main emitters. Those countries that contributed most to this crisis must lead the way. If they dither, we are doomed. But I still believe the climate battle is a battle we can win. People get it. Technology is on our side. Scientists tell us it is not too late. Economists and asset managers tell us climate smart investments are the key to competing and winning in the 21st century. All the tools and knowledge to move from the grey economy to the green economy are already available. So let us embrace transformation - let us build on the results of last September's Climate Action Summit -- and let us make the commitments to make Glasgow a success. Together with Glasgow, we have two other opportunities to act decisively this year. First, the Oceans conference in Lisbon in June. The world's oceans are under assault from pollution, overfishing and much else. Plastic waste is tainting not only the fish we eat but also the water we drink and the air we breathe. We must use the Lisbon conference to protect the oceans from further abuse and recognize their fundamental role in the health of people and planet. For example, based on the success of several national initiatives, it is time for a global ban on single-use plastics. Second, the Biodiversity conference in Kunming in October. The rate of species loss is exponentially higher than at any time in the past 10 million years. We must make the most of the Kunming conference to adopt a post-2020 global biodiversity framework. Living in harmony with nature is more important than ever. Everything is interlinked. We have a plan. It's called the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and all of your governments pledged to make it a reality. The good news is that I hear tremendous enthusiasm for the SDGs wherever I go --from political leaders at the national and local levels, to entrepreneurs, investors, civil society and so many others. We see concrete progress - from reducing child mortality to expanding education, from improving access to family planning to increasing access to the internet. But what we see is not enough. Indeed, we are off track. At present course, half a billion people will still be living in extreme poverty by 2030. And the gender gap in economic participation would have to wait more than 250 years! That is unacceptable. For all these reasons, we are launching a Decade of Action to deliver the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. The Decade of Action is central to achieving a fair globalization, boosting economic growth and preventing conflict. We will leverage the reformed United Nations Development System to engage partners from the local to the global: To mobilize a movement for the Sustainable Development Goals. To unlock financing. To generate the ambition, innovation and solutions to deliver for everyone, everywhere. Throughout the Decade of Action, we must invest in the eradication of poverty, social protection, in health and fighting pandemics, in education, energy, water and sanitation, in sustainable transport and infrastructure and in internet access. We must improve governance, tackle illicit financial flows, stamp out corruption and develop effective, common sense and fair taxation systems. We must build economies for the future and ensure decent work for all, especially young people. And we must put a special focus on women and girls because it benefits us all. The 25th anniversary of the Beijing Platform is an opportunity to rethink economic, political and social systems from an equality perspective. It's time to drive women's equal participation in decision-making and end all forms of violence against women and girls. We must dismantle obstacles to women's inclusion and participation in the economy, including through valuing unpaid care work. And we must listen and learn from so many women around the world who have been driving solutions. I will convene, on an annual basis, a platform for driving the Decade of Action. The first SDG Action Forum in September will highlight progress and set the trajectory for success. So let us make the 2020s the Decade of Action and let us make 2020 the year of urgency. And, as we do so, let us spare no effort to rebuild trust. I make a special appeal to all Member States: Listen to people. Open new channels for all to be heard and find common ground. Respect freedom of peaceful assembly and expression. Protect civic space and freedom of the press. And let us harness the ideas and energy and sense of hope of young people --in particular young women -- demanding change and constructive solutions. Fourth, to address the dark side of digital world, we must steer technology for positive change. I see several areas for action -- starting with the global labor market. Automation will displace tens of millions of jobs by 2030. We need to redesign education systems. It's not just about learning but learning how to learn, across a lifetime. We need more innovative approaches to social safety nets and rethinking the concept of work, and the lifelong balance among work, leisure and other activities. We also must usher in order to the Wild West of cyberspace. Next year, cybercrime will cost $6 trillion. Cyberspace itself is at risk of cleaving in two. We must work against digital fragmentation by promoting global digital cooperation. The United Nations is a tailor-made platform for governments, business, civil society and others to come together to formulate new protocols and norms, to define red-lines, and to build agile and flexible regulatory frameworks. Some responses may require legally-binding measures. Others may be based on voluntary cooperation and the exchange of best practices. This includes support for existing processes and institutions like the Open-Ended Working Group on information and telecommunications in the context of security, and the Group of Government Experts on advancing responsible behavior in cyberspace and within the General Assembly. I believe consensus has been built to strengthen the Internet Governance Forum to serve as a central gathering point to discuss and propose effective digital policies. Following up on the Report of the High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation, I will soon present a Roadmap for Digital Cooperation covering internet connectivity, human rights, trust and security in the age of digital interdependence. At the same time, we need a common effort to ensure artificial intelligence is a force for good. Despite last year's important step within the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, we are still lurching toward a world of killer machines acting outside human judgment or control. I have a simple and direct plea to all Member States: Ban lethal autonomous weapons now. These are the four big threats -- and four big solutions I see in the year ahead. Across this work, the promotion and protection of all human rights must be central. I am deeply concerned about the different ways in which respect for human rights is being eroded around the world. As I have repeatedly underscored, the Charter compels us to place people and their rights at the heart of our work. That is why, next month in Geneva, I will launch a call for stepped up global action on human rights and human dignity. In order to meet all these challenges, we must continue to make the United Nations fit for the challenges of our new age. That is why from day one, and with your support, I have pursued wide-ranging reforms rooted in flexibility, transparency and accountability. In 2020, we will build on our progress. Indeed, we already began the year with a major success. On January 1st -- for the first time in UN history -- we achieved gender parity across our senior-most ranks of full-time Under-and Assistant-Secretaries-General taken together. We did it two years ahead of schedule. And I plan to keep going -- ensuring greater inclusion and parity at all levels of the Organization. I appeal for your support in removing out-dated regulations and byzantine procedures that stand in the way. I am equally committed to making 2020 a year of meaningful progress for more equitable geographical distribution and greater regional diversity among staff of the United Nations. We have launched a Secretariat-wide strategy to do so. But, as you know, reaching gender parity and diversity targets also depends on the ability to fill vacant posts -- and that largely depends on resources. A specialized investigation team in the Office of Internal Oversight Service is already up and running. A new sexual harassment policy is being incorporated into respective frameworks across the wider UN family. A centralized, system-wide screening database is in place to deny the ability of sexual harassers to sneak back into the system. Our strategy to combat sexual exploitation and abuse is also advancing, including through greater assistance and support to victims. In the broadest sense, I am determined to make the United Nations a workplace leader in ensuring all staff are respected, all have a voice, and all are enabled to do their best. We are making progress on our new disability inclusion strategy. And I am strongly committed to ensuring equality and non-discrimination for LGBTI staff in the UN system and our peacekeeping operations. The year ahead will be pivotal for our common future. I want people around the world to be a part of it. Too often, governments and international institutions are viewed as places that talk --not places that listen. I want the United Nations to listen. In this 75th anniversary year, I want to provide as many people as possible the chance to have a conversation with the United Nations. To share their hopes and fears. To learn from their experiences. To spark ideas for building the future we want and the United Nations we need. We are launching surveys and dialogues around the world to do so. And we are giving a priority to the voices of young people. Together, we need to listen. And together, we need to act. At this 75th anniversary milestone, let us make the difficult yet vital decisions across our agenda that will secure a peaceful future for all. \"

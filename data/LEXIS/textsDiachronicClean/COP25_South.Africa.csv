"COP25","South.Africa","COP25_South.Africa3","Under Pressure. Can COP25 Deliver? [analysis]","December 02, 2019","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","Mass public pressure backed by the weight of scientific reports is starting to bring governments to their senses as the annual UN climate summit kicks off in Madrid today.But despite warnings that the planet is reaching critical tipping points, the two weeks of talks with nearly 30,000 participants and dozens of heads of government attending may still end in that familiar sense of disappointment and an opportunity missed.The annual Conference of the Parties, this year being COP25, was to have been a highly arcane if crucial process of finding agreement on carbon markets, known in the jargon as Article 6 of the 'rulebook' to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement on stopping the planet from overheating.Highly contentious, and in part pitting developing countries like Brazil, China and India against others, the Article 6 debate could not be resolved at last year's summit - COP24 in Katowice, Poland - nor at meetings in Bonn in June and hence was left for COP25 to try and fix. The other big elephant in the room - setting more ambitious national targets to reduce carbon emissions - was conveniently going to be left to be settled at next year's COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland.But action is needed now, and senior officials representing nearly 200 countries have been put on notice that the climate emergency in all its forms is dominating the public sphere across the world. Just last week we saw student-led demonstrations and strikes in many places that appropriately fell on Black Friday, delivering a broadside against rampant consumerism as well as government inaction.""Striking is not a choice we relish; we do it because we see no other options,"" youth leaders Greta Thunberg of Sweden, Luisa Neubauer of Germany and Angela Valenzuela of Chile declared in a joint statement.""We have watched a string of United Nations climate conferences unfold. Countless negotiations have produced much-hyped but ultimately empty commitments from the world's governments--the same governments that allow fossil fuel companies to drill for ever-more oil and gas, and burn away our futures for their profit.""UN Secretary General Ant\'f3nio Guterres has told COP25 that ""the point of no return is no longer over the horizon"".""In the crucial 12 months ahead, it is essential that we secure more ambitious national commitments - particularly from the main emitters - to immediately start reducing greenhouse gas emissions at a pace consistent to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. We simply have to stop digging and drilling and take advantage of the vast possibilities offered by renewable energy and nature-based solutions,"" Guterres said.Just last month the UN Environment Programme's annual Emissions Gap Report warned that the Paris Agreement ambition of keeping average temperatures within 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times was ""on the brink of becoming impossible"".Global greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 would have to be under 25 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent to reach that target but, at current rates of growth, emissions are projected to reach more than double that level. Clearly drastic action is needed.Reinforcing the sense of emergency, the World Meteorological Organization reported that atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases reached new record highs in 2018. China is the world's largest emitter.Spain stepped in to offer Madrid as a venue for COP25 after Chile withdrew as host because of mass anti-government unrest. However Chile is still leading the conference and together with Spain will be pushing countries to act quickly to raise the ambition of their carbon emission reduction targets. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez says the goal is for ""the largest number of countries"" to commit to net zero emissions by 2050.From 2020 to 2030, emissions must be cut 7.6% a year to meet the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal, the UNEP says.However the main negotiation process in Madrid is expected to focus on the unfinished business of the market-based mechanisms to create and manage new carbon markets under the Paris Agreement. This would allow countries and industries to earn credits for above-target emission reductions that can then be traded. Big developing countries have already accumulated huge amounts of carbon credits under the previous but now largely discredited carbon credit scheme. It is a highly complex tangle of interests.Carbon Brief, a UK-based climate website, says the Article 6 debate has the potential to ""make or break"" implementation of the Paris Agreement which comes into force next year.""To its proponents, Article 6 offers a path to significantly raising climate ambition or lowering costs, while engaging the private sector and spreading finance, technology and expertise into new areas. To its critics, it risks fatally undermining the ambition of the Paris Agreement at a time when there is clear evidence of the need to go further and faster to avoid the worst effects of climate change,"" Carbon Brief explains.While Article 6 is a highly technical area, the underlying issues are political, with some countries forming unofficial alliances to defend their own interests rather than the common good of the planet. But politicians have been put on notice that this time the world's public is watching closely. Horse-trading cannot be allowed to put our futures at risk.\l"

"COP25","South.Africa","COP25_South.Africa5","COP25 climate summit: what's happened?","December 13, 2019","Mail & Guardian","Envoys from almost 200 countries gathered in Madrid on December 2 for two weeks of talks on climate change organised by the United Nations (UN), as the 25th summit of the UN's Conference of the Parties (COP25) climate talks got under way. Earlier that week, a report on the world's carbon budget revealed how far we are from meeting the goals of the Paris climate agreement signed five years ago. It showed that greenhouse gas emissions rose by 0.6% last year  less than in recent years, but still not enough to reverse climate change. Delegates and activists suggest the world must alter the trajectory to an outright reduction in carbon emissions.What is COP - and how does it help?For almost three decades, representatives of world governments have met every year to forge a global response to the climate emergency. Under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC), every country on earth is treaty-bound to ""avoid dangerous climate change"", and find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally in an equitable way. COP's annual meetings have been interspersed with occasional triumph (the Paris agreement in 2015) and disaster (Copenhagen in 2009). Spain hosts the 25th Summit for Climate ChangeThis conference in turn has been dogged by controversy: everything was set for a December COP in Santiago, Chile, but rioting in the capital and a political crisis forced the COP to be moved to Madrid, where this year's talks took place. This abrupt change of venue caused many headaches, not least for the young activist Greta Thunberg, who had been targeting the talks. Activists and protesters hurriedly re-crossed the Atlantic to gear up to make public pressure felt. In many respects the conference has been overshadowed by Thunberg, who arrived to join a 500 000-strong march through the centre of Madrid, demanding that world leaders listen.The young activist slammed the COP meetings for achieving nothing, noting that greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise. Scientists, campaigners and some politicians have similarly called for the injection of a sense of urgency. Early in the proceedings, negotiators put out a text on the future of carbon markets  the so-called article 6 talks, named after the section of the Paris agreement. There are still major disagreements over how carbon credits should be counted and no guarantee of any resolution to the dispute. If this issue is not resolved, this technical question will hang over next year's talks in Glasgow too, getting in the way of substantive issues such as further cuts in emission targets to align with scientific advice on staying within 2\'c2\'b0C of global heating above pre-industrial levels. Ocean campaigners have so far struggled to have a voice at these talks, which were meant to highlight the state of the oceans and the often-overlooked part they play in Earth's climate. On Tuesday and Wednesday in week two, environment and finance ministers arrived to give directions to the ""high-level"" part of the talks and actual decision-making. These aim at a concrete outcome in the form of resolutions on the key issues. The EU was expected to give context to the talks with its new green deal proposals from the European commission on Wednesday. The UK delegation should have played a central role in preparation for next year's COP in Glasgow but its delegation was hamstrung by that country's general election, which means officials and the next COP president could not speak ""on the record"".What is special about the meetings?World leaders were not expected to turn up, so environmental ministers and their civil servants instead led the negotiations, aided by UN officials. Almost every country is expected to send a voting representative at the level of environment secretary or equivalent.The annual COPs are the only forum on the climate crisis and the opinions and concerns of developing countries carry as much weight as those of the biggest economies. COP decisions carry global authority because agreement is by consensus, though this also means reluctant countries can hold back more ambitious action. Each of the 196 nations on Earth, bar a few exceptions, is a signatory to the UNFCCC foundation treaty and no country has yet opted to withdraw from it. That includes the US, though it is in the process of withdrawing from the Paris accord.Under the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement, nations committed to holding global heating to no more than 2\'c2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels. The vast majority of nations  185 countries  have now ratified the deal, which is legally binding. Nonetheless, the commitments that countries made to cut their national emission levels to the best-case scenario were not part of the binding Paris deal, but contained in non-binding additions, which will have to be ratcheted up next year if the aims of Paris are to be met.Not all countries are wholeheartedly behind the Paris Agreement: the US has played a low-key role in the UN climate process under Donald Trump; while other potential objectors include big oil powers such as Saudi Arabia, Russia and Venezuela, as well as Brazil and Bolivia. Key to progress at COP are China, the world's biggest emitter, and India, where emissions are rapidly rising.Carbon markets to be decided this year?The primary subject of discussion at COP25 is a provision in the Paris Agreement known as article 6, which allows for the use of a global market in carbon to help countries cut emissions and to fund measures that reduce emissions in developing countries. Carbon markets have existed since the first 1997 Kyoto Protocol. The general idea is for developed countries to meet their targets by buying carbon credits awarded to projects reducing emissions in developing countries. In this way, rich nations could buy themselves time, while poorer nations got money to ease them on the road to a green future. But too many easy credits devalued the system, and the financial crisis of 2008 led to the outright collapse of the carbon market. Today, resuscitating the article 6 carbon market is back on the agenda. Activists see the markets as an easy way out for developed countries to get away with continuing to burn fossil fuels, while buying off poor countries to clean up. What activists want is not talk of carbon ""offsets"", but absolute emission cuts  now.This set the scene for a conflict over article 6, which might threaten the delicate consensus achieved at Paris. That consensus must be preserved if countries are to fulfil the aims of Paris by ratcheting up their commitments to bring down emissions next year.There are many other issues hanging over COP25, but these will not be decided until next year. Emissions are increasing once again; temperatures are higher than ever; and countries are not mandated by law to act. The IPCC has concluded that at current rates we are running out of time, with little over a decade to halt emissions growth and bring down carbon rapidly to keep warming within the 1.5\'c2\'b0C threshold.Existing commitments made by each government under the Paris accord fall short of what is required. According to the UN's latest ""emissions gap"" report, published a few days before the start of COP25, countries must further reduce their greenhouse gases by 7.6% per year for the next 10 years to stay within the 1.5\'c2\'b0C Paris limit.Crunch timeTo meet the Paris objectives national targets must be revised upwards by next year  which is also when previous targets, set at Copenhagen, expire for many countries. That makes 2020 a critical year for climate action.Consequently, the most important focus of this year's COP is to smooth the way for the crunch summit next year. The Glasgow meeting will be the most important on climate change since the 2015 Paris Agreement itself. The past five years have been spent spelling out the ""rules of engagement"", which have not addressed the core issues of emission reductions that governments are prepared to accept.COP26 will require coaxing countries into the commitments necessary  something that could not be achieved in Paris five years ago. In the years since Paris, many argue matters have gone backwards: developing countries have accelerated their infrastructure roll-out of roads, coal-fired power plants and automobiles; new oil and gas fields have opened up; and some countries elected governments that have become openly hostile to climate action: the US, Brazil and Australia.\l"

Poorly resourced developing countries that contribute minimally to the causes of climate change are left to their own devices to deal with this weather phenomenon's impact. Such is the impact of climate change on South Africa that it cannot be labelled just ""water stress"". It is firmly in the throes of a crisis, ranking as one of the 30 driest countries in the world.This dire situation has gone beyond paying lip service. It requires world leaders to prioritise assistance to developing countries. On top of a raft of legislative measures, developing countries have to deploy their limited resources to fend off the effects of climate change.The result has been a lack of progress in developing countries, including the inability to invest sufficiently in the maintenance of ageing infrastructure and developing new ones.In most instances, this happens amid a myriad of challenges ranging from stagnating economies to inequality and poverty. Investment in other priorities - education, health care and communication - have to be put on hold as funds have to be directed to climate change projects.The stark reality was illustrated by the floods in Mozambique where the devastation bears testimony to how developing countries are affected.The UN estimates that more than 11million people now face crisis levels of food security in Zimbabwe and Mozambique, a situation that looks set to continue into the foreseeable future.In South Africa, large parts are in the grip of a devastating drought moving at an alarming rate, with the farming community the hardest hit.So great is the impact of climate change that Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu had to announce a strategic response. She said the recent drought - the worst in many decades - has had a very negative impact on the economy, especially the agricultural sector, affecting food security and exports. She said: ""The drought that devastated most parts of the country has highlighted the need for a more elaborate facility to guide management of water supply and as mitigation against risks.""No economy or community can thrive without good, toxic-free, reliable and secure water services, she said.Following through with concrete actions on promises made at the COP 25 by committing to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and investing in climate change counter-measures will go a long way. They must act on their climate commitments, allowing developing countries like South Africa - which has one of the lowest rainfall averages in the world - to use its limited water resources for economic development and job creation.Sithole is a communicator at the Department of Water and Sanitation\l"

Environment Programme (UNEP) released a report warning that unless global greenhouse gas emissions fall by 7.6 percent each year between 2020 and 2030, the world will miss the opportunity to get on track towards the 1.5\'b0C temperature goal of the Paris Agreement.The Paris Agreement is an agreement reached at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP 21) in Paris, France, where the world's nations undertook a determined course to reduce climate change. Among the commitments was to reduce the increase in global temperatures.The annual Emissions Gap Report, which was released on Nov. 26 warns that even if all current unconditional commitments under the Paris Agreement are implemented, temperatures are expected to rise by 3.2\'b0C, bringing even wider-ranging and more destructive climate impacts.""Any slight change in global temperatures can have a devastating effect on millions of livelihoods, and could expose people to life-threatening heat waves, water shortages and coastal flooding,"" said Dr Mohammed Said, a climate change research scientist based in Kenya.According to his research in Kenya's Arid and Semi Arid regions, people in counties that experienced increased temperatures in the past 50 years have suffered significant loss of livelihoods with some having to change their lifestyles altogether.""In Turkana County for example, the temperatures increased by 1.8\'b0C, and as a result, the cattle population decl"

Also speaking at the UN meeting, Chief Executive Officer of Natural Eco Capital, Dr Eugene Itua, in his submission noted that tremendous emission reduction programmes have been on in Lagos State through the replacement of outdated mass transport vehicles with more modern and energy-efficient buses.Stakeholders noted that finance remained a major challenge to scaling green investments but suggested that the best approach was non-monetary strategy in which financing packages for low-carbon consumption comes with credit and insurance.

Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, Ban Ki-Moon, former Secretary-General of the United Nations and Christalina Georgieva, Chief Executive Officer of the World Bank, said in a new report. The three leaders are part of 34 other political, business and science top shots, who came together to form the Global Commission on Adaptation, according to the BBC.""Climate change doesn't respect borders,"" the BBC quoted Ki-Moon as saying. ""It's an international problem that can only be solved with co-operation and collaboration, across borders and worldwide. It is becoming increasingly clear that in many parts of the world, our climate has already changed and we need to adapt to it."" The global cost-benefit analysis published by the commission, calls on developed economies who are responsible for much of the world's warming, as well as the underdeveloped economies who will be most hit, to adapt five strategies, towards mitigating the impacts of the changing climate. The report noted that countries who are list responsible for the shrinking Arctic Circle and the irregular weather patterns are the most affected. This, the researcher said, made reversing the losses suffered by harsh weather conditions, a 'human imperative.' The five strategies include warning systems, climate adaptive infrastructure, drought-resistant crops, protective mangroves and efficient water management. The report noted that simple apps that help fishermen and women detect changes in the weather could save lives. It said infrastructures like roads, bridges, and buildings, should also be constructed to adapt to weather conditions. The report also advised that crops that are resistant to drought are needed in desert regions like Nigeria's north-west and east territories. It also cautioned against the clearing of mangroves in riverine areas, saying they help to protect the community against storms and flood. The most notable point made by the commission, however, is the need to not waste water in a climate-shifting world. Gates and friends will begin canvassing for the adaptation of its report at a United Nations climate change conference at the end of the month.

The damage is going to become more serious,"" Carolina Amaya, representative of the Salvadoran Ecological Unit, told IPS, pointing out that the region is one of the most exposed to the climate crisis, facing persistent droughts, intense storms, rising sea levels and climate migrants.The social summit is taking place at the public Complutense University, in the west of the Spanish capital, about 15 km from the IFEMA fairgrounds which are hosting COP25 after Chile pulled out on Oct. 30 from holding the event due to massive anti-government protests and social unrest.The alternative activities, which also end on Friday Dec. 13, include a varied menu of issues, such as free trade and its socioenvironmental impacts, oil drilling in indigenous territories, the protection of forests, and opposition to trading reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which cause global warming.They are also discussing the monetisation of environmental services, increased funding for the most vulnerable nations, climate justice and attacks against land rights activists.The Madrid Social Summit is also holding sessions in Santiago de Chile, under the same slogan, ""Beyond COP25: People for Climate"", although there are fewer representatives of organised civil society than at previous COPs because of the last minute change of venue.Civil society groups are also organising activities at their green pavilion within the official COP25 is the third consecutive COP held in Europe, this time under the motto ""Time to act"".The deliberations, which enter the crucial phase of the adoption of agreements Tuesday Dec. 10, are focusing on financing national climate policies, rules for emission reduction markets, and the preparation of the update of emissions reductions and funding of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage, designed to assist regions particularly affected by climate change.COP25 is the climate summit that directly precedes the 2020 entrance into effect of the historic Paris Agreement on climate change, adopted in the French capital in 2015, which left key areas to be hashed out at the current conference, such as the controversial emissions market.In their statement to the COP, the organisations criticise the economic model based on the extraction of natural resources and mass consumption, blaming it for the climate crisis, and complaining about the lack of results in the UNFCCC meetings.""The scientific diagnosis is clear regarding the seriousness and urgency of the moment. Economic growth happens at the expense of the most vulnerable people,"" says the statement, which defends climate justice ""as the backbone of the social fights of our time"" and ""the broadest umbrella that exists to protect all the diversity of struggles for another possible world.""At the social summit, the first ""Latin American Climate Manifesto was presented on Monday Dec. 9, which lashes out at carbon credit trading, the role of corporations in climate change and the increase in production of hydrocarbons, while expressing support for the growth of agroecology, the defence of human rights and the demand for climate justice.In addition, indigenous peoples are holding their own meeting, the ""indigenous Minga"", with the message ""Traditional knowledge at the service of humanity in the face of climate change.""

In fact, the Brazilian government delegation does not include a single indigenous member - unprecedented in the recent history of the COPs.Faced with this dispute and the critical situation of the Amazon jungle, Brazil's indigenous people have sent representatives to Madrid to speak out and seek solidarity.The murder of two leaders of the Guajajara people in northeastern Brazil on Saturday Dec. 7 shook the indigenous delegation. Two murders had already occurred in that native community in the last two months.In 2017, the States Parties to the UNFCCC adopted at COP23 the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform for the exchange of experiences and best practices, thereby ensuring the participation of these groups in the negotiations of the convention.The Platform's facilitative working group, composed of delegates from seven States Parties and seven indigenous peoples, is currently developing its plan for the period 2020-2021.Mart\'edn Vilela, a representative of the Bolivian Platform for Climate Change umbrella group of local organisations, questioned the effectiveness of the climate summits.""The agreements are only paper. Emissions continue to rise and countries' voluntary targets are insufficient. The countries have to be more ambitious if they really want to avoid major disasters,"" he told IPS.The Agreement sets mandatory emission reduction targets for industrialised countries and voluntary targets for developing countries in the South.""The countries need to know that we're monitoring them. We, the organisations, must prepare ourselves to demand better action,"" said Amaya from El Salvador.For her part, Brazil's Kaingang argued that the climate struggle would only be effective if it includes indigenous peoples.COP26 will be hosted by Glasgow, Scotland in November 2020, after pre-conference meetings in Germany and Italy.This article was supported by the COP25 Latin American Journalistic Coverage Programme.Load-Date:\~December 11, 2019\l"

At a time when our global environment is at risk of collapse, you, together with your international counterparts, hold the most pivotal role and responsibility. This is the time for you to act.South Africa's environment, our communities' health and livelihood are under threat. We are witnessing the worst droughts, floods and storms our region has seen in 100 years. Certain areas in the Karoo are disaster zones. Despairing communities are praying to God to save them because no one else seems to care, and the government does nothing to assist.In South Africa, 37.44% of rural communities are affected by the drought, the 2019/2020 Drought Report by AgriSA states. This affects the livelihood of communities and poses a major threat to food security. The impact on our economy and job security is dramatic.

But the area on the outskirts of capital city Santiago is blazing a trail in recycling its waste.Residents like Marina Ortiz listen out for the regular sound of the community recycling truck. Standing by her door, she rushes out into the street, bringing her food waste to the collectors.""When I cook I separate out the remains of the vegetables. The paper and cardboard I give to the collectors, and the food to the vegetables truck,"" the 58-year-old housewife said.""The people from the municipality taught us and I've been doing it for years. They tell me that later all the waste is turned into earth.""The municipality of La Pintana now collects 140 tons of plant waste from homes every week, far higher than comparable neighbourhoods.That is despite the area having some of the worst socioeconomic indicators in Chile. There are few medical centres and almost no companies or major employers. The news that comes from the area is almost always related to drug trafficking, delinquency and violence.The poverty rate - at around 42% of the 177,000 inhabitants - is far above the national 17% average, a legacy of the area receiving poor families displaced from other richer parts of the capital during the 1973-1990 military dictatorship.""The people of La Pintana have been treated harshly by the state, with no services, no health facilities, no education. There are children in the street, crimes, a lot of inequality,"" La Pintana mayor Claudia Pizarro told Reuters.""But this is one of the good things that exist in the community, and we're a pioneer in this area.

The nursery also researches which species adapt best to climate change and dry weather. ""That is the basic concept of what is called the circular economy,"" said Marchant. | Reuters\l"

In a new piece in Nature, Professor Harald Winkler, as part of an international team, delivers the bad news that the emissions gap...1. How much has the emissions gap grown by? How was this established?Our conclusions are based on a synthesis of all 10 editions of the United Nations Environment Programme s gap report. Each year for the past 10 years, this report has examined the difference (the gap ) between what countries have pledged to do individually to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, and what they need to do collectively to meet agreed temperature limits. The 2015 Paris Agreement aims to keep global temperature increase to less than 2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels and possibly 1.5\'b0C.<figure class=""align-center zoomable""> </figure>There are three reasons for the gap: a 14% increase in emissions from 2008 to 2018; global agreement on a lower limit on global temperature; and insufficient commitments by countries. With more stringent global temperature limits now agreed, it s now projected that 25% lower emissions will be needed to meet the goal of 2\'b0C and 55% for 1.5\'b0C.2. What are the implications?In our study of the gap reports, we found that the required emissions cuts from 2020 to 2030 are now more than 7% per year on average for the 1.5\'b0C temperature limit set in Paris and 3% for 2\'b0C. Had serious climate action begun in 2010, the cuts required to meet the emissions levels for 2\'b0C would have been 2% per year, on average.Instead, among the top seven emitting countries or regions, one has lower emissions (the EU), another slightly lower (India), three show no change (the US, Russia and China) and two are higher (Brazil and Indonesia). Together with other countries, the overall trend of rising emissions has not been reversed over the past 10 years so now there is less time to reach the goal. The time window for halving global emissions has narrowed: in the words of the Nature report, in 2010, the world thought it had 30 years to halve global emissions of greenhouse gases. Today, we know that this must happen in 10 years.In plain language, a decade of insufficient political action on climate change means that nations must now do four times the work or do the same work in one-third of the time to comply with the climate pact they made in Paris. The less action countries take collectively to cut carbon, the higher the temperature increase and the more severe the impacts. The poor, who are least responsible for greenhouse gas emissions, suffer the most from its impacts.3. What are the urgent steps that need to be taken to reverse the trend?The gap is so huge that governments, the private sector and communities need to switch into crisis mode, and to make their climate pledges more ambitious. Immediate action is needed in a climate emergency - while ensuring equity. Given the delay in action, much more rapid emission reductions will be needed to keep the temperature goals in reach. Instead of developing in a way that involves high consumption and high emissions, countries need to provide people with basic needs through low emissions and sustainable development, tackling socio-economic inequality at the same time.Action is now required from all countries, including those that are still developing to meet basic needs.4. What good work is being done to control emissions that others can follow?Some countries, regions, cities and businesses have promised to take ambitious climate action. For example, 76 countries or regions and 14 subnational regions or states have set net-zero emissions goals. This means that they have set a year (often around 2050) when their greenhouse gas emissions will be balanced by removal of emissions. The net result will be zero emissions to the atmosphere. Combining this with 20Agenda%20for%20Sustainable%20Development%20web.pdf%sustainable development goals means zero poverty as well as zero emissions.One sign of hope is that the costs of renewable energy are falling fast, globally and in sub-Saharan Africa. In South Africa, President Cyril Ramaphosa presented a proposal to the 2019 climate change summit to fund the faster phasing-out of coal without negative effects on workers and communities that depend on it. International climate finance is a critical ingredient to support a just transition. The comment in Nature also includes examples of what other emerging economies that depend on coal, such as China and India, are doing. They are adjusting the fuel price, capping its consumption, reducing plans for new coal-fired power plants and supporting renewable energy production. Much more must be done, and quickly while addressing poverty, energy access and urbanisation to address both development and climate change.The same is true for South Africa, which still depends on coal for 83% of its electricity and 59% of all energy. The country needs to adopt a vision for a just transition that includes net-zero emissions by 2050 or earlier, and put in place the laws, institutions and practical actions to achieve that goal.South Africa has a Carbon Tax Act and in 2020 the country needs to promulgate a framework Climate Change Act. In 2018, a national jobs summit agreed to establish a presidential climate change coordinating commission as the statutory body to oversee South Africa s just transition. This needs to be designed carefully and set up urgently. To make the transition just, communities and workers who are dependent on coal will have to be integrally involved in the change, ensuring they have sustainable livelihoods.This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

The purpose of the Bill is to build an effective climate change response and ensure the long-term, just transition to a climate resilient and lower carbon economy and society. This will be done within the context of sustainable development for South Africa, and will provide for all matters related to climate change. ""It is heartening to see that since the adoption of the Paris Agreement in December 2015, many African countries have made significant progress in moving towards the development and implementation of their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs),"" the Minister said. NDCs embody efforts by each country to reduce national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. ""For Africa, addressing and responding to the impacts of Climate Change is critical for the sustainable development of our Continent. Climate Change also presents opportunities for our Continent which we should work on harnessing, in order to realise the aspirations contained in Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want,"" she said. She said despite the progress being made on the continent to implement the NDCs, creating the enabling policy environments to fully harness the opportunities arising from the implementation of NDCs still requires further work on the continent. ""We need to create a conducive environment for this to happen. We have a number of encouraging NDC case studies on the continent which demonstrate that Africa is prepared to make its fair share of the contribution towards the global effort to combat Climate Change.

That is, recognising the need to integrate gender considerations into national and international climate action.The first step to achieving this aim would be gender parity at international climate conferences such as the Madrid COP. While we don t yet know how many of the 13,000 registered governmental delegates were women, based on past numbers they are unlikely to make up more than a quarter. This is not the only forum where the experiences of women are ignored. Our research, spanning Kenya, Cambodia and Vanuatu, has found women are working collectively to strengthen their communities in the face of climate change. But their knowledge about climate risk is dismissed by scientists and political leaders.Bridging climate awarenessWhen women are excluded from local and national-level governance, the absence of their voices at regional and global levels, such as COP meetings, is virtually assured. Our work across Africa, Asia and the Pacific found scientists generally male lack awareness of the knowledge women hold about the local consequences of climate change. At the same time, those women had little access to scientific research.In places where the labour is divided by gender, women and men learn different things about the environment. Though the women in our research generally did not know about government policies or programs on climate change and disaster risk reduction, they were very aware of environmental change. In Kenya, the pastoralist women we spoke to are acutely aware of the link between their physical insecurity and extreme drought. As droughts become more intense, pastoral communities who depend on livestock and grazing land are severely impacted. The loss of livestock can trigger communal conflicts and displacements as violence is used in retaliation for cattle rustling. Moreover, given the prevailing practice of bride prices among pastoral households, early marriages for young women and girls are a way to secure cattle. Despite laws against female genital mutilation in Kenya, it is practised to secure higher bride prices, due to beliefs that the practice makes girls more valuable.This everyday knowledge is crucial for identifying the full risk posed by climate change. However, women told us their knowledge was not always recognised within their communities let alone at the national level. They blamed this on discrimination against women taking up decision-making roles, poverty and gender-based violence which dissuades women and girls from participating. Valuing womenEven when countries have policies for gender equality in climate change responses, that doesn t mean women are actually given an equal voice. According to female community leaders and women working in government and non-government organisations in Cambodia, Kenya and Vanuatu, gender equality issues in climate change policies tend to be confined to women-only programs . Gender inclusion is primarily addressed in social welfare programs, rather than ministries responsible for energy, meteorology, land and natural resources. To address these gaps, we need to to take women s varied expertise seriously. This begins with supporting their leadership within communities and villages.Women s access to education and careers in climate-relevant sciences is also crucial. Ideally, this will progressively bring in broader groups of women and girls to participate in climate change decision-making.Climate change actionOur research found programs for mitigating climate change are also perfect opportunities to support peace, community development and women s rights. In Kenya, for example, one member of a women s network responding to drought and conflict told us: [W]e support each other. We want a collective voice because then we have more power. These networks help women with female-specific issues, such as natural disasters that make women extremely vulnerable to abuse from men. But even in day-to-day life, these forums are valuable for women who would otherwise be barred from political activism. In areas where authoritarian rule or discriminatory customs limit democratic spaces, women s networks for climate response are a rare opportunity for public deliberation on policy-making.Global evidence now shows environmental projects are more effective when gender considerations are taken into account. Our research adds to this knowledge base by documenting how women s networks mobilise in response to climate change.For example, the Women I Tok Tok Tugeta (Women Talk Together) network in Vanuatu has created a Women s Weather Watch that provides early warning of disasters. It also makes clear that relying on scientific knowledge or technological solutions alone will be insufficient in these complex environments, where climate change, gender discrimination and conflict all come together.When we look at COP25, we can t help but mourn the lack of women s knowledge from the countries most affected by climate change. By supporting women at all levels, from the village to the global stage, this vital perspective can inform the creation of robust, sustainable and effective solutions to our climate crisis.The authors would like to acknowledge the contributions of Melissa Bungcaras and Michelle Higelin, and ActionAid Australia.This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Delegates from around the world could not agree on a way forward to tackling the climate crisis. Earlier this year US president Donald Trump announced the withdrawal of the US from the Paris climate accord. He claimed it was unfair on America. America under Donald Trump is unprepared to listen to scientists. It is ironic that most research on climate change is conducted in and by the US, yet it is where the information about climate change receives the most resistance. The effects of climate change don't discriminate, but the consequences will be felt most by developing countries. Will the Trump administration derive economic benefit by pulling out of it? Will the US gain an advantage over other countries? Does Trump want to accelerate industrial activities that pollute? The world needs to take drastic action on climate change, with or without the US's participation. Dependence on the US is hampering efforts to take decisive action that will lead to us curbing our carbon emissions and decreasing temperatures. - Samkelo Latakisa, via e-mail All about respect, BCM I am a disappointed East London resident and business manager. I took a drive with my family along the Esplanade at 7pm on December 16 to witness the lights. I think they're great and thousands had the same idea. But as we approached the end of the Esplanade, our joy turned to dismay at the behaviour of pedestrians and drivers. Conspicuous consumption of alcohol, littering, urinating anywhere and drinking while driving was staggering. Such a throng of people and cars is to be expected at this time of the year, yet not a single law enforcement officer to be seen. BCM spends millions welcoming people to the city via concerts, horse-racing events etc, (lining the pockets of a few connected individuals), yet it fails to ensure law and order. We read in the papers how traffic authorities are at their wits end about road fatalities. Well, a start could be made by arresting those driving and drinking, in full view of all. BCM has billboards boasting how it is the first to do all sorts of fancy things but the very basics - waste disposal and traffic law enforcement - are dismal. Please try and make us proud of the city. If the citizens are proud they will exude the positivity we need to attract more businesses to the city, which in turn will assist in alleviating unemployment. It's the only way to create a better life for all. Let us all practice respect: for ourselves, others, animals, finances, authorities and the environment - and, in the case of BCM, visitors. - TH Sheard, via e-mail\l"

""Doing so will require ending support for all fossil fuels by the end of 2020, rapidly scaling up investments in renewables and energy access, and transparent reporting on finance levels and portfolio emissions,"" the groups said.Financial institutions, including banks and insurance houses, are worried about the effect of climate change on their stability.For instance, changing weather patterns, which include frequent storms and droughts, have complicated the insurance industry's risk assessments and led to an increase in premiums, particularly in the agricultural sector. Meanwhile, banks are under pressure not to finance operations seen as contributing to climate change.The groups said in their letter that while MDBs have made commitments to align their financing with the objectives of the Paris Agreement, there has not been enough progress.""Signs of the unfolding climate crisis have become increasingly evident since the joint MDB pledge was first made, and the MDBs must scale up their ambition at COP25 [climate talks] in Madrid accordingly,"" the lobby groups said.They said the banks must end all assistance for oil, gas and coal projects after 2020, rapidly scale up investment in renewables and energy efficiency, and increase clean energy access finance by public finance institutions by 2020 to help attain universal energy access by 2030.Furthermore, they called on the MDBs to devote at least 40% of finance by 2020 and at least 50% by 2025 to assist countries, especially in Africa, in accelerating their chosen low-carbon development pathways.According to the bank, carbon pricing is an instrument that captures the external costs of greenhouse gas emissions - the costs borne by the public, such as damage to crops, health-care costs from droughts, and loss of property from flooding - and ties them to their sources through a price.Its programme will support the direct implementation of carbon pricing in at least 10 developing countries and help a further 20 countries get ready to do so.phakathib@businesslive.co.za\l"

"COP25","South.Africa","COP25_South.Africa34","Local investors remain cool on global warming","January 20, 2020 Monday","The Mercury (South Africa)","With the recent flood of pledges by investors to ""turn up the heat"" on climate action, one might think that the investment industry was in the midst of a profound shift. If only that were the case.Officially, the majority of the world's institutional investors, with assets under management worth more than $89 trillion, subscribe to the Principles for Responsible Investment. In doing so, these companies have agreed to integrate environmental, social and governance factors into their investment processes.Yet, so far, investors' commitment to responsible investment appears to have exerted little influence on corporate behaviour and short-term investment trends. The funding of the fossil fuel industry continues to rise. Investment giants such as BlackRock and Vanguard keep on voting against key climate resolutions. Major shareholders ignore the growth of social inequalities.Even the PRI (the organisation that governs the Principles for Responsible Investment) acknowledges that action lags behind awareness.Civil society organisations, academics and journalists have begun questioning whether responsible investment can bring about the level and pace of change required to enable an inclusive climate change transition.To better understand whether the financial industry is really shifting, we looked to South Africa, a country with a leading regulatory framework for responsible investment.Since 2011, all pension funds have been required to take a responsible investment approach as part of their fiduciary duty. A Code for Responsible Investment in South Africa was released, and in 2013 it supplied practical recommendations for institutional investors and their service providers. As a result, most South African institutional investors publicly pledged their support for responsible investment.But our study, which tracks implementation from 2013 to 2019, found that the changes to investment practices were mostly superficial.We looked at what South African institutional investors said they were doing on their websites or in their financial and other reports. The changes focused on publishing annual general meeting voting results and creating policies to increase transparency. Sustainability policies were generally rudimentary, using tailor-made definitions. They did not depart from ""business as usual"".And when we spoke to industry insiders, we found that even among responsible investment leaders, core investment practices and incentive structures remain largely unchanged.Portfolio managers talked about environmental, social and governance factors being an irritation. They said these often came at the wrong time in the investment process. Others explained that environmental or social data were still seen as ""fluffy"" and difficult to factor into investment decisions.Our findings are backed up by a recent report concluding that South African investors might be aware of these issues in theory, ""but may not understand what it means in practice"".We believe that part of the problem may lie in the way the concept of responsible investment was introduced. How a concept is initially framed guides how it will be interpreted and implemented. The initial framing defines the core problem and attributes responsibility. It also articulates potential solutions and motivates action.In an effort to bring companies on board, the principles for responsible investment were initially framed using language that was flexible and compatible with investors' priorities around risk and returns. While this framing boosted early adoption, it may have done so at the expense of effective change in the long term.As emissions and inequality continue to rise, responsible investment needs a reframing. The new frame needs to be clear on the core problem. It must attribute responsibility, motivate action and outl"

It will be the culmination of five years of negotiations since the historic 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.More than 100 presidents and prime ministers are expected to present their nations' plans for carrying out the sweeping environmental, economic and energy changes necessary to keep the Earth's warming to survivable levels.In all, over 30,000 government delegates, intergovernmental officials and stakeholder representatives are preparing to attend.The agenda of COP26 is deep and urgent. Besides reporting how they plan to reduce oil, coal and gas production and increase renewable energy to limit global temperature rise to below 2\'b0C (and preferably 1.5\'b0C), governments must agree how to calculate whether each is fulfilling its pledges, what steps to take to deal with those which haven't, and whether the total reductions agreed to are sufficient to avoid catastrophic climate impacts (so far they're not).National leaders will be looking for positive grand visions to pull their people out of pandemic- induced despair.

"COP25","South.Africa","COP25_South.Africa36","No premature death for coal","December 10, 2019 Tuesday","Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Other industries)","With global targets set to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuel combustion by 2030 and to reach a net-zero position by 2050...Under the COP21 agreement, also known as the 2015 Paris Climate Conference, most developed countries globally made the commitment to resort to alternative low-carbon emissive solutions, deemed sustainable for electricity generation, industrial manufacturing, and any other activities that could risk propelling climate change. This agreement has been followed up by annual meetings of the UNFCCC Parties to assess the progress in dealing with climate change.However, a new dynamic has entered the stage with recent written representations and testimony to the United Nations and European Parliament, respectively, by 500 experts arguing that there is no climate emergency. Moreover, with this year s annual Climate Change Conference (COP25) taking place in Madrid from 2-13 December 2019, the debate and momentum are moving away from the doomsday scenario propositions being made by socio-political movements. The Paris agreement, however, still poses a predicament for developing and emerging economies that are still heavily dependent on coal. Furthermore, access to funding for applied renewable energy solutions which also require local subsidies to be affordable yet provide little sustainable employment is still very limited within these regions. For these reasons, among others, economies are still using coal as a significant resource. Clean coal technologiesThe necessity of many developing countries to install the most cost effective and implementable method of power generation is easy enough to understand; the majority of African countries are still starved for electricity, with the World Bank declaring 32 of the 48 nations on the continent to be in a power crisis. Thus, developing countries are still largely dependent on coal for most of their electricity generation. Since the start of the industrial revolution, coal has proven to be a reliable, constant base-load energy resource that today is easily convertible to multiple physical states such as gas or liquid in coal-to-liquid technology (CTL Technology).Therefore, instead of focusing on the elimination of coal, which will leave African countries in the dark, there is a need for developing countries to embrace and attract funding for clean coal technologies (CCTs) that will lessen the negative environmental impact of coal energy generation, in turn helping to mitigate atmospheric pollution and the potential contribution to climate change. This will ensure that the African continent's enormous coal resources can be utilised for future generations without significantly negatively contributing to climate change.Because coal plays a significant role in both the industrial and retail sectors in African countries, eliminating it in the near future in favour of renewables, as is being advocated for by the developed countries, is not technically and economically viable. There is a need to promote a diversified energy mix inclusive of strategically placed renewable sources to cater to the continent s energy needs. International green capital should increase investment in renewable sources of energy, such as solar and wind, as part of a complementary approach in diversifying the energy mix whilst simultaneously continuing to fund clean coal-based energy. Given the requirement for a stable base-load supply, there is typically an upper limit on the amount of renewable energy that can be accommodated in a functional, efficient national grid system, which is dependent on the nature and amount of available energy sources, both renewable and non-renewable.IRP 2019South Africa recently released the Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) 2019, which brings renewed confidence that coal-based power generation is alive and well on the African continent. Running from 2019 to 2030, the IRP seeks to promote a diversified energy mix that is also inclusive of renewables, nuclear energy, gas, hydropower, nuclear power and coal for South Africa and the SADC region. The plan, based on a lowest-cost electricity supply and demand balance that considers both security of supply and the environment, states that coal will continue to play a significant role in electricity generation for the country and the rest of Africa.South African Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe expressed his views on the coal debate in October, saying, ""We are going to still have a big volume of electricity generation from coal. Therefore, we are cautioning those who are saying coal is coming to an end we have 16 power stations which are coal-fired. That is the reality of today. Coal will continue to play a significant role."" This inclusion of coal in the IRP 2019 energy mix is a clear indication that the end is nowhere in sight for this fossil fuel.The coal industry in the country not only is responsible for electricity generation but also is beneficial to the country s economy. According to Coal Mining Matters, the South African coal mining industry in 2018 employed 81,962 people and paid R24bn in wages and salaries. These jobs created and the salaries earned are then redistributed throughout communities and strengthen local businesses\l"

Many try to return home when they can, with whatever they have earned. But during their absence, the entire burden of maintaining the family is on women.Researchers are in a race against time to predict how climate change will affect these communities and help them adapt, with drought and flood-resistant crops and cattle breeds for example.But it's often overlooked that climate change will affect one half of humanity significantly more than the other. Long-standing gender inequality means that within regions of the world that are particularly vulnerable to climate change, women are likely to suffer more than men.Isolated and overburdenedIn a recent study, we found that extreme weather and unpredictable seasons disproportionately weaken the agency of women to find well-paid work and rise above rigid gender roles, even when these appear to be bending after decades of reform and activism.Without support in the form of assured drinking water, energy, childcare or credit, women end up working harder and in poorer conditions for lower wages.Women in poverty are increasingly finding themselves in a vicious cycle of low productivity, indebtedness and food insecurity as crops and livestock fail, as we found particularly in semi-arid parts of Africa and India.Women in northern Kenya complained that they could no longer afford meat, so ate rice and potatoes instead, even when that wasn't enough to satisfy their hunger.As environmental stresses accumulate, community support networks break down. When people are displaced and have to settle elsewhere, men search for work and women are left at home, often in unfamiliar surroundings and lacking support from friends and relatives.But even if they do know people, with all the challenges of running the household in a strange environment, there is little time to help others.With full responsibility for household chores, farming and caring for the children and elderly, women have less time to socialise or take part in community events, including meetings of the elected village government.If the state or charities can help, there's often competition for securing those benefits. In Namibia, people tend to stick with their ethnic groups to guarantee access through collective effort, but this means that ethnic minorities in the region are often excluded.In Mali, heavier burdens are placed on women who are young and less educated. In India or Pakistan, women belonging to a lower social class or marginal caste suffer the most.Gender relations differ in each place and according to each situation - they're often too variable to emerge in broad national and global assessments.We tried to find a way to generalise our findings across 25 diverse locations, in Asia and Africa, without losing the nuance of each woman's experiences.The bare necessitiesIf much of the problem is structural, then short-term solutions like cyclone shelters or drought relief won't address the underlying causes of poverty and precariousness.Social safety nets that can ensure the basic necessities of food and shelter are needed, like the public distribution system for cereals in India, or the pensions and social grants available in Namibia.To ensure that the health of people in these places doesn't irreversibly decl"

South Africa has slowly been shifting to a better space as a developing country. As GL events South Africa we have been making positive strides in establishing ourselves as international players in the world of events. We have extended our footprint internationally and have been involved in major projects, i.e. the 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta, Palembang and Indonesia, 2018 FIFA World cup in Russia, Special games in Abu Dhabi and Cop 25 to name a few. For our local people who joined the company in its early days, it has been a fulfilling and rewarding journey to be able to witness the growth and be a part of it. GL events have made a significant contribution over the years in upskilling and developing its employees, investing in education and creating sustainable careers. Some of the employees, who started as general workers with little or no qualifications, now occupy supervisory or managerial positions and have developed tremendously. We had an opportunity of speaking with Jeremiah Vilakazi, the Site Operations Manager based in the Johannesburg branch and who has been involved in most of the international projects in the past few years including the ones listed above. During the interview, Jeremiah recalls how he started out as a Stand builder back in 2007, with no dream of ever managing a team of over 30 site workers. He has been with GL events since 2007 and his gradual growth has been so inspiring. We listened to him as he beams with excitement taking us through the events of his career life, the passion for what he does clearly visible on his face. ""I remember the time when I started working in GL events, I had been working in the exhibition industry for a while and had considerable experience in my trade: shell scheme building and electrical. My eagerness to learn repositioned me and placed me at an advantage to grow in my trade within a very short space of time,"" said Jeremiah. ""At the time, my focus was solely on doing my job seamlessly and I must say that I was completely taken by surprise when I was chosen to be part of the team that will be placed on international projects. I had not thought that my manager at the time was noticing me or the effort I put in my work. I knew at that moment that I was doing something right and I would have to keep at it,"" added Jeremiah.Research has proven that investing in your employee's professional growth is not only crucial for business growth but also positively impacts workplace engagement, employee retention and employee empowerment. Overall business performance is improved 10 times when employees feel taken care of by their employer.GL events also recognise that to remain relevant with our ever-more demanding customers and within the industry - employee development is crucial to the success of the business. It is through such advances that we continue to stay committed to our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) mandate ""Think People"" by promoting mobility, employee training, career development and diversity.We commend Jeremiah and all the team members who worked with him on our international projects for their hard work and encourage them to maintain their spirit of hard work, dedication and commitment they have all shown to the business over the years. As an organisation, we are taking positive steps towards empowering and developing our employees and inspiring them to yearn for a more positive and bright future. -{\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell\l"

The question is, how can this be broadened.Quesada says women, in particular young women, are leading the way.""From cooperative seed banks, to early warning networks, from solar engineers to women politicians carving a path of sustainable policymaking. They are at the forefront of forest conservation, sustainable use of resources, and community enhancement, and restoration of landscapes and forest ecosystems,"" he says.However, women's roles are often underestimated, unrecognised, and unpaid.""Women and girls with access to technology have already begun developing innovative tools to reduce emissions by targeting sustainable consumption and production practices, including food waste, community waste management, energy efficiency, and sustainable fashion.""The solutions exist, but much more is needed.The President suggests that the way investments are made could be fundamental to ensure a flow of finance to the communities, including women, and youth. This will, he believes, provide ""a stable source of funding for businesses and services that contribute to the solution of social or environmental challenges.""The impact of this will be partnerships between traditional sources of finance, like international cooperation and development banks, and new partners, like philanthropy, hedge funds, or pension funds.""And what better than young people giving the thrust that all this requires?""Nisha says she was pleased to see the massive mobilisation of young people at the inaugural Climate Action Summit last year. The summit had little good news for climate change with concerns raised that the accelerating rise in sea level, melting ice would have on socio-economic development, health, displacement, food security and ecosystems. However, beyond taking to the streets, they also need to hold decision-makers accountable.""In the last months we have witnessed the irruption of massive mobilisations in different parts of the world, lead mostly by young people. This would seem surprising for a generation that has been accused several times of passivity, indifference, and individualism,"" Quesada says. ""I truly believe that, as long as these demands are channelled through democratic and pacifist means, they are extremely important to set a bar and a standard of responsibility for us, decision-makers -- who are, by the way, more and more often, young people.""He adds that world leaders owe them explanations of the decisions made.""We must also have the wisdom to pay attention to these demands and take into account their opinions and proposals to reach agreements that have the legitimacy of consensus-building.""However, Nisha notes, while campaigns like the Deliver for Good campaign is working across sectors reports at COP25, and the recent World Economic Forum (Davos), ""climate change continues to threaten progress made toward gender equality across every measure of development.""At WEF Global Gender Gap Report 2020 showed that it would take more than a lifetime, 99.5 years in 2019 for gender parity across health, education, work and politics to be achieved.Quesada says the climate catastrophe ""demands that policymakers and practitioners renew commitments to sustainable development -- at the heart of which is, and must continue to be, advancing gender equality and women's empowerment, and realising women's rights as a pre-requisite for sustainable development.""Costa Rica, he says, has been recognised internationally on two significant areas: the respect of human rights and environmental protection.""The present Administration has taken these objectives a step further by paying particular attention to women's rights, inclusion, and diversity, and including them as part of our core policy principles and our everyday practices,"" he says. ""We expect to increase women's integration into productive processes and achieve women's economic empowerment through specific policies linked to our long-term development strategy -- the Decarbonization Plan -- allowing the transformational changes our society needs.However, the critical question, Nisha says, is: ""What can world leaders and governments do today to ensure young people have a seat at the decision-making table?""Quesada is confident that young people will be part of the solution.""The challenges we are facing today are unprecedented precisely because previous generations did not have to face situations such as biodiversity loss, global warming, or the emergence of artificial intelligence and technology. Thus, we need new answers and solutions from Twenty-First Century people, and those should and will be put forward by the youth,"" he says.The importance of youth involvement was recently highlighted too at the meeting of African Leaders for Nutrition in Addis Ababa. African Development Bank (AfDB) President Akinwumi Adesina said Africa should invest in skills development for the youth so the continent's entrepreneurs can leverage emerging technologies to transform Africa's food system to generate new jobs. This is especially urgent as the population on the continent is expected to double to 2.5 billion people in 40 years putting pressure on governments to deliver more food and jobs in addition to better livelihoods.In a recent interview with IPS International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA) Director General, Nteranya Sanginga, explained that this change is neither easy or necessarily something all leadership has taken on board.""Our legacy is starting a programme to change the mindset of the youth in agriculture. Unfortunately (with) our governments that is where you have to go and change mindsets completely. Most probably 90 per cent of our leaders consider agriculture as a social activity basically for them its (seen as a) pain, penury. They proclaim that agriculture is a priority in resolving our problems, but we are not investing in it. We need that mindset completely changed.""Quesada is unequivocal that this attitude needs to change.""My advice to world leaders is to have the humility to listen to the people and to allow more inclusive and participatory decision-making. And to the young people, I can only encourage them to own their future, and to act accordingly, with vision, courage, and determination.""Follow @IPSNewsUNBureau\l"

"COP25","South.Africa","COP25_South.Africa41","In denial about climate change? Then think again","December 5, 2019 Thursday","Business Day (South Africa)","In denial about climate change? Then think againIf there were an SA equivalent of Greta Thunberg, she might have a few things to say to our government, as well as to business leaders.""Why didn't you protect our rivers from pollution and look after our water systems?"" she might ask. ""Why didn't you help the farmers hit by the terrible drought, and invest massively in solar power? You have stolen my future. How dare you?""The messages about climate change are becoming more urgent. UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres, opening the COP25 talks in Madrid this week, said important decisions must be taken now to limit emissions that cause the greenhouse effect, adding the planet is close to ""the point of no return"" and urging all countries to cut pollutant emissions to help combat climate change.In SA, with recent heatwaves, the ongoing drought and unseasonal flooding in the Western Cape, our minds have been rudely turned to conservation and, by extension, climate change. There is a curious vacuum of knowledge on the topic in SA, however.The 2018 Afrobarometer survey found that 54% of South Africans had never heard of climate change. But with water-shedding looming, there are surely fewer climate change deniers on the ground today than a mere year ago.Environment minister Barbara Creecy, citing the Afrobarometer survey at the 10th Oppenheimer Research Conference held in September, found that even among South Africans with postsecondary education, as many as 37% said that they had not heard of climate change.The study, remarkable in so many ways, also found a staggering level of apathy among the populace: though the majority (53%) of South Africans who had heard of climate change said it was making life worse, only 52% of those believed ""it needed to be stopped"".A Trumpian mindset seems to be prevalent among South Africans, who seemingly want everything to stay the same to ensure the same old elites keep making their magnificent profits in the face of looming disaster for all forms of life.In her address, Creecy went on to say that an upscaling in environmental literacy is crucial to create a society where ""everyone has the understanding, skills and motivation to make responsible decisions that consider her or his relationship to natural systems, communities and future generations"".If one accepts that sustainable development is possible only when underpinned by an environmentally literate society, she said, then it is not just about ""making scientific evidence more available, accessible, clear, relevant and reliable for policymakers, it's about making it more available, clear, relevant and reliable for everyone"".The warning bells are tolling and we have been roundly rapped on the knuckles, so here is my choice, with the help of Ben Williams from The Reading List, of the top five SA books on climate change. They make for sobering reading.Wild Law: A Manifesto for Earth Justice, by Cormac CullinanA practising environmental attorney in Cape Town, Cullinan points out in Wild Law how our governance has failed us with regards to the environment.Our laws are based on the myth that humans are separate from nature, says Cullinan, informed by religious and traditional beliefs that have allowed us to behave in an arrogant and superior way regarding the other species that share the planet with us. In SA, the myth of the ""master species"" was reflected in apartheid.A paradigm shift is therefore required for governments to adopt a social governance, an Earth jurisprudence that moves us from a ""homosphere"" to an Earth-centred worldview.Wise About Waste: 150+ Ways to Help the Planet, by Helen MoffettThis might be another predictable addition to the recycling debate were it not for Moffett's sparkling writing style and out-of-the-box suggestions.She's clearly thought this issue through, from how to conscientise yourself about where those things come from that we consume, to debunking the dominant climate denial arguments. (No, population explosion isn't the problem; richer societies consume more than poorer ones.)There are chapter headings from ""Saving Electricity"" to ""Plastic Ain't Fantastic"" and ""Clothing and Textiles"", some of them obviously offering hints we've heard before, but this slim book is a great reminder. Look out for the chapter on ""The Radical, Unpopular and Downright Weird Stuff"". It might convince you to stipulate that your body should be composted at your death.See also Moffett's 101 Water Wise Ways (2018).A useful guide for everyone living in SA, this book has a wide scope. If you want facts and figures, as well as details of important reports and conferences, you will find them here. The authors are an environment reporter (Kings) and a science journalist (Wild) with an MSc in bioethics and health law. Their style is hard-hitting as well as wry and anecdotal, so though you are being lectured, you won't feel it as much.They start off saying that survival is likely, acknowledging that much of climate change activism is ""panicked tactics"" to convince people of the gravity of the situation. Reading that the interior of SA is now 2\'b0C hotter than in 1900 is likely to cause you concern, but Kings and Wild also give much solid information of what you can do in your everyday life to help and prepare for the future.There is some useful information on our two biggest cities, Johannesburg and Cape Town, about what is working for them and what plans they have in store to mitigate water scarcity and create alternative energy sources. Boiling Point: People in a Changing Climate, by Leonie JoubertThis interesting, unusual book brings climate change right down to the individual, to grass roots level. It's a collection of stories about the people who are, and will be, most affected by the changing weather patterns: poor people, mostly those living in rural areas.Joubert has become a strong voice among SA's climate change activists. In Boiling Point she interrogates the gulf between the sources of pollution - the rich West - and those who are most vulnerable to its effects.But Hesselman's future is uncertain because a process of desertification, originating in Namibia, has his lands in its path. In writerly fashion, with empathy, Joubert tells his story, underpinning it with the science.There is also the story of Ernest Titus, a west coast fisherman who became a victim of the postapartheid transformation within the industry. His livelihood is further threatened as the cold Benguela current, which moves up that coast, shows signs of warming.Joubert traces the story of the Whitfields, third-generation farmers in the Free State, who know the weather patterns intimately. They are faced with the choice of continuing a time-tested method or diversifying to a new crop like biofuels to make a living.Filled with excellent photographs, this book will move as well as inform.The Climate Crisis, by Vishwas SatgarBuilding on a previous volume in the Democratic Marxism series, Capitalism's Crises: Class Struggles in SA and the World, this new book, The Climate Crisis, regards climate change as a crisis and calls for civilisational transformation. It presents a range of contributors, placing Marxism in dialogue with anti-capitalism while placing nature at its centre.Contributors include Dorothy Grace Guerrero, writing on ""The Limits of Capitalist Solutions to the Climate Crisis""; Devan Pillay on ""Challenging the Growth Paradigm: Marx, Buddha and the Pursuit of 'Happiness'""; and Nnimmo Bassey on ""The Climate Crisis and the Struggle for African Food Sovereignty"".Prof Jacklyn Cock of Wits presents an eco-feminist-socialist perspective in a chapter that examines a ""just transition"".Satgar presents his solutions, including deepening democracy, more values-centred institutions and mass popular education, in the conclusion to this sober, academic exploration of the climate change issue.Start lowercase: please relate to story 123RF/Inkdrop\l"

And without immediate action, I can no longer guarantee the smooth functioning of the Organization.""""I urge you to help put the United Nations on a solid financial footing,"" he pleaded last month before the 134 members of the Group of 77 developing countries, plus China.Sesheeni Joud Selvaratnam, Sustainable Development Goals and Agenda 2030 lead at ActionAid, told IPS the United Nations is marking its 75th anniversary next year against a backdrop of rising global hunger, the climate crisis and an unravelling of progress towards social justice and equality.""It's not too late to get the Sustainable Development Goals back on track, but the 2020 global summits must see political will and leadership that translates into real action on the ground.""States turning up and making commitments at the High-Level Political Forum and UN General Assembly isn't enough. Governments must be held accountable to their citizens on implementing and delivering on their promises by 2030, and ensuring the most vulnerable are not left behind,"" said Selvaratnam.Jens Martens, executive director of Global Policy Forum (New York/Bonn), told IPS the summits have put the UN back at the centre of the global debates on future justice.At least, many Heads of State and Government have recognized the climate emergency and the importance of sustainable development by participating in the summits.""They have launched countless new initiatives to implement the SDGs. This is of course better than the destructive policies of Trump, Brazil's Bolsonaro & Co,"" he noted.But, being present at the summits, making nice speeches, dating Greta Thunberg, and expressing understanding for the concerns of young people is not enough, he added.""As long as governments do not change fundamentally the framework conditions of sustainable development, this will remain symbolic policy and sometimes pure actionism.""The summits were once again summits of announced actions. But the world does not need more hypocritical promises and announcements, he pointed out.""It needs political decisions that make fiscal policies fairer, bring global economic and monetary policy into l"

It started with little hope of action to control global warming, flirted with hope and ended with that hope largely squashed. Sipho Kings writes that, by this time next year, we'll know if we're going to do enough to keep this world vaguely habitable. If we don't do enough, in a decade's time there'll be droughts, floods, wildfires and crop failure on an apocalyptic scale, causing deaths, social unrest and mass migrationIf average global temperatures increase at their current rate, the United Nation's climate scientists warn of a world where ecosystems  including coral reefs, wetlands and forests  collapse. Many parts of the world will be too hot to work in. Droughts and floods destroy agricultural systems. People starve. Mass migration occurs and destabilises unprepared recipient countries.In their report, titled ""Global Warming of 1.5\'c2\'b0C"", the scientists warn what this means: ""Poverty levels increase to a very large degree and incidents of starvation increase very significantly."" High levels of public unrest then follow, ""resulting in some countries becoming dysfunctional"".The report came late last year, in the middle of the hottest period in recorded history. Last year also set the record for the most global carbon emissions. This year will probably break that record. In South Africa, there's been unseasonal flooding, record temperatures have been set across the highveld and drought cripples large swathes of the country. Emissions here have only decl"

It is no longer bipolar or unipolar. But it is not yet truly multipolar. Balances of power are changing, creating new and dangerous risks.Around the globe - and just a few hundred kilometres from here - national and regional tensions are spreading.The Sahel, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan - these conflicts are causing terrible suffering and uprooting millions of people.Rather than wars between sovereign States, we now see asymmetric conflicts between States and non-State groups. With the growing interference of third parties, these conflicts rapidly take on a regional dimension and are linked to new forms of global instability and terrorism.The impact of the Libyan conflict on the Sahel and the Lake Chad regions shows how national conflicts can draw in neighbouring states and global powers, creating regional insecurity with implications across continents.In the background to these conflicts is the renewed threat of nuclear proliferation, which is making a worrying comeback.If we hope to make our world more peaceful and secure, we must start by addressing the underlying causes of tension and conflict.Prevention is more essential than ever; and prevention on the scale we need is only possible through multilateralism.That is why all the work of the United Nations is based on crisis prevention and mediation; combating violent extremism and strengthening peace and security; advancing sustainable, inclusive development; and protecting the human rights and dignity of all people, everywhere.We are pursuing all these efforts in cooperation with regional organizations, including the European Union, a long-standing and essential partner.I want to focus on five areas in which we face new risks and widening fault l"
"COP25","South.Africa","COP25_South.Africa48","UN Plans to Launch a 'Decade of Action' to Deliver Development Goals By 2030","January 23, 2020","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","2020 marks the 75th anniversary of the United Nations. I draw tremendous strength from all that we represent and all that we have achieved together.Yet anniversaries are not about celebrating the past; they are about looking ahead. We must cast our eyes to the future with hope. But we must also do so without illusion.I want to speak to you in stark and simple terms about the challenges we face. I see ""four horsemen"" in our midst -- four looming threats that endanger 21st-century progress and imperil 21st-century possibilities.The first horseman comes in the form of the highest global geostrategic tensions we have witnessed in years.Devastating conflicts continue to cause widespread misery. Terrorist attacks take a merciless toll. The nuclear menace is growing. More people have been forced from their homes by war and persecution than at any time since the Second World War. Tensions over trade and technology remain unresolved. The risk of a Great Fracture is real.Second, we face an existential climate crisis. Rising temperatures continue to melt records. The past decade was the hottest on record. Scientists tell us that ocean temperatures are now rising at the equivalent of five Hiroshima bombs a second.One million species are in near-term danger of extinction. Our planet is burning.Meanwhile, as we saw at , too many decision-makers continue to fiddle. Our world is edging closer to the point of no return.As one of our own reports revealed just yesterday, two of every three people live in countries where inequality has grown. Confidence in political establishments is going down.Young people are rising up. Women are rightly demanding equality and freedom from violence and discrimination.At the same time, fears and anxieties are spreading. Hostility against refugees and migrants is building. Hatred is growing.The fourth threat is the dark side of the digital world.We are not prepared for the profound impact of the Fourth Industrial Revolution on the labour market and the very structure of society. Artificial intelligence is generating breathtaking capacities and alarming possibilities.Lethal autonomous weapons -- machines with the power to kill on their own, without human judgement and accountability -- are bringing us into unacceptable moral and political territory.These four horsemen - epic geopolitical tensions, the climate crisis, global mistrust and the downsides of technology - can jeopardize every aspect of our shared future.That is why commemorating the 75th anniversary with nice speeches won't do.We must address these four 21st-century challenges with four 21st-century solutions. Let me take each in turn. First, peace and security, that I mentioned. There are some signs of hope.Last year, conflict was prevented in the wake of several critical elections, from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to Madagascar ... from Mali to the Maldives and beyond.Despite hostilities in Yemen, the fragile cease-fire in Hodeidah is holding. A constitutional committee in Syria has taken form, even if it is still facing meaningful obstacles.A peace agreement in the Central African Republic is being implemented. And the recent Berlin conference on Libya brought key players around the peace table at a critical moment, committing to ""refraining from interference in the armed conflict or in the internal affairs of Libya"" and urging ""all international actors to do the same"".All of these efforts require patience and persistence. But they are essential and save lives. As we look ahead, we have our work cut out for us.We see Gordian Knots across the world -- from the Gulf to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, from the Sahel and Lake Chad to Venezuela.Security Council resolutions are being ignored. Outside interference is fueling fires.And we are at risk of losing pillars of the international disarmament and arms control [architecture] without viable alternatives.Yes, the United Nations continues to deliver life-saving aid to millions of people in desperate need. But temporary relief is no substitute for permanent solutions.Prevention must orient all we do as we engage across the peace continuum. We must strengthen our mediation capacity and our tools for sustaining peace, leading to long-term development.Our Action for Peacekeeping initiative is enhancing performance and safety. We are becoming more effective in the protection of civilians, and we have more female peacekeepers than ever before. The 20th anniversary of Security Council resolution 1325 on women, peace and security is also an opportunity to further match words with deeds.At the same time, we know peacekeeping is not enough where there is no peace to keep. We need to create the conditions for effective peace enforcement and counter-terrorism operations by our regional partners, under chapter VII of the Charter and with predictable funding.This is especially true in Africa, from the Sahel to Lake Chad. And we must focus on the roots of crisis and upheaval -- combatting the drivers of violence and extremism - from exclusion to economic despair, from violent misogyny to governance failures.Last year, I launched first-of-its-kind action plans to combat hate speech and to safeguard religious sites.This year, I will convene a conference on the role of education in tackling hate speech.I call on all State Parties to work together at the 2020 Review of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to ensure the NPT remains able to fulfil its fundamental goals - preventing nuclear war and facilitating the elimination of nuclear weapons.The second ""horseman"" is the threat of climate catastrophe. We must respond with the promise of climate action.We are at war with nature. And nature is fighting back hard. One cannot look at the recent fires in Australia - at people fleeing their homes and wildlife consumed by the flames - without profound sadness at today's plight and fear for what the future may bring.Meanwhile, air pollution combined with climate change is killing, according to the World Health Organization, 7 million people every year.Gradual approaches are no longer enough. At the next climate conference -- COP26 in Glasgow - Governments must deliver the transformational change our world needs and that people demand, with much stronger ambition - ambition on mitigation, ambition on adaptation, and ambition on finance.Every city, region, bank, pension fund and industry must completely reimagine how they operate to keep temperature rise to 1.5 degrees. The scientific community is clear. We need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030, and reach net zero emissions by 2050.The main obligation rests on the main emitters. Those countries that contributed most to this crisis must lead the way.If they dither, we are doomed. But I still believe the climate battle is a battle we can win.People get it. Technology is on our side. Scientists tell us it is not too late.Economists and asset managers tell us climate smart investments are the key to competing and winning in the 21st century.All the tools and knowledge to move from the grey economy to the green economy are already available. So let us embrace transformation - let us build on the results of last September's Climate Action Summit -- and let us make the commitments to make Glasgow a success.Together with Glasgow, we have two other opportunities to act decisively this year.First, the Oceans conference in Lisbon in June.The world's oceans are under assault from pollution, overfishing and much else.Plastic waste is tainting not only the fish we eat but also the water we drink and the air we breathe.We must use the Lisbon conference to protect the oceans from further abuse and recognize their fundamental role in the health of people and planet.For example, based on the success of several national initiatives, it is time for a global ban on single-use plastics.Second, the Biodiversity conference in Kunming in October. The rate of species loss is exponentially higher than at any time in the past 10 million years.We must make the most of the Kunming conference to adopt a post-2020 global biodiversity framework.Living in harmony with nature is more important than ever. Everything is interlinked.We have a plan. It's called the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and all of your governments pledged to make it a reality.The good news is that I hear tremendous enthusiasm for the SDGs wherever I go --from political leaders at the national and local levels, to entrepreneurs, investors, civil society and so many others.We see concrete progress - from reducing child mortality to expanding education, from improving access to family planning to increasing access to the internet.But what we see is not enough. Indeed, we are off track. At present course, half a billion people will still be living in extreme poverty by 2030.And the gender gap in economic participation would have to wait more than 250 years!That is unacceptable.For all these reasons, we are launching a Decade of Action to deliver the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. The Decade of Action is central to achieving a fair globalization, boosting economic growth and preventing conflict.We will leverage the reformed United Nations Development System to engage partners from the local to the global: To mobilize a movement for the Sustainable Development Goals.To unlock financing. To generate the ambition, innovation and solutions to deliver for everyone, everywhere.Throughout the Decade of Action, we must invest in the eradication of poverty, social protection, in health and fighting pandemics, in education, energy, water and sanitation, in sustainable transport and infrastructure and in internet access.We must improve governance, tackle illicit financial flows, stamp out corruption and develop effective, common sense and fair taxation systems.We must build economies for the future and ensure decent work for all, especially young people. And we must put a special focus on women and girls because it benefits us all.The 25th anniversary of the Beijing Platform is an opportunity to rethink economic, political and social systems from an equality perspective.It's time to drive women's equal participation in decision-making and end all forms of violence against women and girls. We must dismantle obstacles to women's inclusion and participation in the economy, including through valuing unpaid care work.And we must listen and learn from so many women around the world who have been driving solutions.I will convene, on an annual basis, a platform for driving the Decade of Action. The first SDG Action Forum in September will highlight progress and set the trajectory for success.So let us make the 2020s the Decade of Action and let us make 2020 the year of urgency. And, as we do so, let us spare no effort to rebuild trust.I make a special appeal to all Member States: Listen to people. Open new channels for all to be heard and find common ground.Respect freedom of peaceful assembly and expression. Protect civic space and freedom of the press.And let us harness the ideas and energy and sense of hope of young people --in particular young women -- demanding change and constructive solutions.Fourth, to address the dark side of digital world, we must steer technology for positive change.I see several areas for action -- starting with the global labor market. Automation will displace tens of millions of jobs by 2030. We need to redesign education systems. It's not just about learning but learning how to learn, across a lifetime.We need more innovative approaches to social safety nets and rethinking the concept of work, and the lifelong balance among work, leisure and other activities. We also must usher in order to the Wild West of cyberspace.Next year, cybercrime will cost $6 trillion. Cyberspace itself is at risk of cleaving in two.We must work against digital fragmentation by promoting global digital cooperation.The United Nations is a tailor-made platform for governments, business, civil society and others to come together to formulate new protocols and norms, to define red-l"

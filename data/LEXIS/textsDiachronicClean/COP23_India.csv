This global gathering advanced the work of the Paris Agreement so that climate action can be guaranteed for generations to come. COP23 brought together people from all parts of society to highlight both the challenges and solutions related to climate change, including opportunities to invest in clean growth, and the transition to a clean energy economy. Canadas diverse delegation to COP 23 included: Indigenous leaders; representatives from the provinces, territories and municipalities; youth; business leaders; civil society, opposition members; and Government of Canada negotiators and experts. Canada played a leadership role in helping advance the guidelines for the Paris Agreement. Canada is pleased that countries came together to launch the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform; providing a space to share knowledge and amplify their voice. In addition, the adoption of a gender action plan that will help build capacity and support gender representation in future international climate change negotiations and decision-making was a significant achievement for Canadian negotiators. An important highlight from COP 23 was the launch of the new Powering Past Coal Alliance by Minister McKenna and her UK counterpart, Claire Perry. This initiative generated broad interest and support from over 20 countries, cities and states and Minister McKenna is looking forward to continuing this momentum given the numerous health and climate benefits of reducing coal-fired electricity. Canada also announced the formation of a North American Climate Leadership Dialogue with Mexico and the US Climate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of 15 U.S. governors committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Minister McKenna praised Fiji for its role in presiding over COP23 . She reiterated Canadas commitment to protect our oceans and advance global climate action by building the resilience of coastal communities, including Small Island Developing States (SIDS). I was honoured to lead an inclusive delegation from Canada to COP 23 which demonstrated Canadas steadfast commitment to implement the Paris Agreement and take global climate action. Canada is pleased to have worked with the UK in launching the Powering Past Coal Alliance. The world has moved on; coal fired electricity isnt coming back. We are also pleased to have moved ahead in helping give a greater voice to Indigenous People in our international engagement and advancing a gender action plan.

"COP23","India","COP23_India2","Canada : Canada heads to Bonn, Germany, to advance the implementation of the Paris Agreement at the United Nations Climate Change Conference negotiation tables","November 11, 2017 Saturday","TendersInfo","Canada will continue driving global momentum on climate action at the 23rd Conference of the Parties ( COP23 ) presided over by Fiji, in Bonn, Germany. Our delegation will include all levels of government, Indigenous leaders, businesses, and environmental groups, working together to seize the opportunities of the transition to a clean-growth economy. At COP23 , Canada will continue to work with other countries to advance the implementation of the Paris Agreement. In Bonn, all international partners will need to commit to further invest in solutions that build climate resilience and lower emissions. And parties will continue to advance key aspects of the Paris Agreement, related to mitigation, adaptation, transparency, and carbon markets. Working with partners at COP23 , Canada will push for global efforts to phase out coal-fired electricity. This action not only reduces emissions and smog, which choke many cities, but also reduces the number of premature deaths, cases of asthma, and emergency-room visits. We will also continue to support the engagement of Indigenous Peoples in climate policy and encourage the development of a gender-action plan. Earlier this week, Canada became one of the first countries to ratify the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which will phase down powerful greenhouse gases called hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Each year, HFC sources emit the carbon-dioxide equivalent that is released by 300 coal-fired power plantsand by reducing these emissions, we make significant progress toward the Paris Agreement and help limit the future impacts of climate change. This years conference is the first ever to be led by one of the small island developing statesa group of countries particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels and other impacts of climate change. Canada strongly supports Fijis leadership as COP23 president, and it has provided $1.4 million to help the country carry out this important role. \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India3","United States : Jacobs Presents Sea Level Rise Strategy at United Nations Climate Change Conference","February 1, 2018 Thursday","TendersInfo","Preliminary strategies, developed by Jacobs to address challenges posed by sea level rise on the South Pacific nation of Kiribati, were showcased at the recent United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ) held in Bonn, Germany. The Government of Kiribati (GoK) presented an animated visualization of a concept land and urban development plan, which was created after the Jacobs-facilitated workshops in Kiribati. The workshops, which involved government departments, were designed to ensure that the project vision was being developed by the stakeholders with an understanding and agreement of the key issues and design principles critical to the success of the plan. The workshop format proved to be highly effective, with everyone participating, and wrapped with a sense of common aspiration and concern being recognized during a close out session, said to Jacobs Project Manager Simon Liddell. Jacobs was appointed by the New Zealand Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT), in partnership with the GoK, to assess the feasibility of undertaking a land and urban development project on the Temaiku Bight in the Kiribati capital of Tarawa. This project comes at an extremely critical time in the history of Kiribati, as the South Pacific nation faces economic, urbanization and environmental challenges, said Jacobs Buildings and Infrastructure Asia Pacific Senior Vice President Patrick Hill. Jacobs has a wealth of adaption, geotechnical engineering and sustainable land use planning experience that we will leverage to assist Kiribati in this effort. The multi-disciplinary study involves assessing the feasibility of increasing the height of a 330-hectare area of land on the Temaiku Bight to approximately two meters above the highest measured sea level. Kiribati, an atoll in the South Pacific, is one of the worlds most economically and physically vulnerable countries. Home to more than 110,000 people, Kiribati is made up of 33 low-lying atolls which, at their highest elevation, average 6 feet (1.8 meters) above sea level. Over the next eight decades, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC) projects a 3 feet (0.9 meter) increase in global sea levels. Kiribatis surrounding sea levels are predicted to rise by up to 0.6 feet (0.17 metres) by 2030. In addition to the feasibility study, Jacobs is developing an accompanying conceptual land use plan that addresses resilience issues impacting the atoll, including rapid urbanization, limited water supply, ecosystem services and an increasing risk of land inundation from king tides. The project is scheduled for completion in March 2018 when the feasibility of the land and urban development design, engineering and environmental and social impacts will be presented to the GoK for a decision on whether to proceed with the ambitious and transformational project. The Jacobs team is comprised of urban planners, social impact and stakeholder engagement specialists, terrestrial and marine environmental subject matter specialists, along with geotechnical, coastal, water, wastewater, power, civil and transport engineers. \"

At a press conference on Sunday, President of COP23 and Prime Minister of Fiji, Frank Bainimarama, announced that the States Parties had finalised the plan. ""This recognises the role of women in climate action,"" he said. ""It is about integration of gender into all the work around climate policy - both nationally and internationally,"" added Nazhat Shameen Khan, the Chief Negotiator for the COP23 Presidency. Heads of State and Government, Ministers, and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will be attending the high-level segment of COP 23 , on 15-16 November. Also on Sunday, countries and corporations announced new initiatives to cut emissions from forest use and establish sustainable forestry management programmes. The efforts include an Ecuadorean initiative to reduce 15 million tons of CO2 emissions in the forest sector; a commitment to deforestation-free commodities by Walmart; Mars Inc.'s new policy to reduce their carbon footprint 27 per cent by 2025 and 67 per cent by 2050 through addressing deforestation throughout their corporate value chain; and Gabon's National Park Service efforts to combat illegal logging. ""The forests have this incredible ability to store carbon and we have under-invested in that,"" said Inger Andersen, Director-General of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), at a press conference. Also today the industry sector said it is set to deliver much of the emissions reductions needed to achieve the Paris Agreement goal but added that closer national and international policy and implementation strategy partnerships together with governments will help business take further, faster action. ""Industry is taking action on climate change like no other period in history,"" said Peter Bakker, President and CEO of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD, a global, business leaders-led organisation of over 200 leading businesses working on sustainable development). ""The transition to the low-carbon economy is inevitable, and business will continue to implement the solutions necessary for fulfilling the Paris Agreement,"" he added. Since 2015, over 600 companies with combined revenues of more than $15 trillion have made over 1,000 commitments to climate action through 'We Mean Business,' a global non-profit coalition. Many are going 100 percent renewable, are implementing science-based targets and are collaborating across sectors through the Low Carbon Technology Partnership initiative (LCTPi). Local and regional leaders from around the world signed the Bonn-Fiji Commitment Sunday, pledging action to deliver on the Paris Agreement. Cities are responsible for as much as 70 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels used for energy and transport, and with more than half the global population living in urban centres and this figure expected to approach two-thirds by 2050, the Bonn-Fiji Commitment pushes efforts to advance sustainable urban development. The Commitment encompasses 19 initiatives, including The European Covenant of Mayors and Compact of Mayors joining forces to create the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy - the largest coalition of over 7,400 cities from six continents and 121 countries to reduce emissions and make societies and economies resilient to climate change. Similarly, the UN World Health Organisation (WHO), in collaboration with the UN Climate Change secretariat (UNFCCC) and in partnership with the Fijian Presidency launched an initiative to protect people living in small island developing States from the health impacts of climate change. The vision is that, by 2030, all small island developing States will have health systems that are resilient to climate change.

"COP23","India","COP23_India5","COP23: Congo Basin youth protecting fragile forest ecosystem","November 10, 2017 Friday","UNI (United News of India)","Bonn, Nov. 10 -- Youth groups working in Africa's Congo Basin countries are supporting economic progress in isolated rural communities while protecting the forest, and it is high time their voices were heard, a young woman at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ) in Bonn, Germany, has said. ""Young people in the Congo Basin have been doing things on the ground that often go ignored,"" on Thursday explained Marie Tamoifo, President of the Cameroon Green Youth Association (Association de la Jeunesse verte du Cameroun - AJVC) and Regional Coordinator of the Youth Network for sustainable management of forest ecosystems in Central Africa (Reseau des jeunes pour la gestion durable des ecosystemes forestiers d'Afrique centrale - REJEFAC) in an interview with UN News. REJEFAC brings together youth organisations from 10 Congo Basin countries - Burundi, Cameroon, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe and Chad. Its aim is to promote the effective participation of young environmental actors in decision-making in the Congo Basin and ""to contribute to the emergence in the region of a new type of leadership, more sensitive and open to the requirements of sustainable development."" ""[As for] actions on the ground, there are reforestation, awareness and education programmes for young people. It's about strengthening the work that is done by governments,"" said Ms Tamoifo. For several years, AJVC has been developing a programme in Cameroon for the electrification of isolated rural areas with solar panels. The programme started in 15 pilot communities in the east, in the center and in the far north of the country with the installation of solar panels in homes and schools. A contribution is made by the community itself, representing 25 to 30 per cent of the cost. ""In these 15 communities, we trained 85 young people in solar installation techniques but also in psycho-socio-organisational methodology,"" explained Ms Tamoifo. ""When we arrive in a community, we first hold a discussion with that community. We try to see with [them] what the glaring problems are."" The youth participating in this programme are from the community. They are trained and they provide maintenance for the solar panels that have already been installed. ""For now, they are not really paid. They receive a small allowance,"" added MsTamoifo. The association needs more financial support to maintain and expand this programme. ""We have received more than 100 requests from villages and we cannot answer them given [our] modest means. And young people who are trained today also need to make a living to be able to continue this work,"" she said. Among other actions carried out by young people in the Congo Basin region, the REJEFAC Coordinator mentioned a tree planting initiative by volunteers in the Republic of Congo, and a programme focusing on handicrafts and conservation of natural resources in Rwanda. Before coming to COP 23 , the network organized a 'climate caravan' in Cameroon with the participation of young people from the ten countries of the Congo Basin to show what youth organisations are doing in terms of sustainable development and protection of the planet. ""We organised this caravan which was named 'the COP at home,'"" said the Coordinator of REJEFAC. Young people have been designated as climate ambassadors. The 'climate caravan' travelled in the Douala region, coastal areas and went to Equatorial Guinea. ""It showed how we could talk about the theoretical aspect and go on the ground to experience the realities of conservation parks and conflicts between humans and elephants,"" concluded Ms Tamoifo.

"COP23","India","COP23_India6","COP23: New efforts announced for faster climate action","November 12, 2017 Sunday","UNI (United News of India)","Bonn, Nov. 12 -- Cities, the transport sector and ocean advocates have announced a number of new initiatives to push for further, faster climate action, at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 23 ) here in Germany.These announcements were made under the auspices of the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action, created last year to spur action by state and non-state sectors to help implement the Paris Agreement on climate change.In a major new partnership, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Costa Rica and the Paris Process on Mobility and Climate (PPMC) launched the Transport Decarbonisation Alliance to stimulate greater political leadership in the sector.Transport contributes about one quarter of all energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and about 15-17 per cent of the entire spread of human CO2 emissions.""More ambitious and coordinated action on transport is required to deliver on the Paris Agreement,"" said Jose Mendes, Deputy Minister for Environment of Portugal.Six new voluntary sector initiatives were also introduced in Bonn to address specific aspects of transport and climate change. These include: the 'below50' (expanding the global market for the world's most sustainable fuels); the EcoMobility Alliance (cities committed to sustainable transport); EV100 (accelerating the transition to electro-mobility); Walk 21 (valuing and delivering more walkable communities); the Global Strategy for Cleaner Fuels and Vehicles; and the Transforming Urban Mobility Initiative (accelerating implementation of sustainable urban transport development and mitigation of climate change).Similarly, global cities and communities also announced new efforts on Saturday to coordinate their climate action commitments to deliver bigger and faster results together.""Local and regional governments are making commitments that will help national Governments close the gap between current national commitments and the emissions reductions needed to achieve the Paris Agreement targets"", said Gino Van Begin, Secretary General of ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability, a global network of more than 1,500 cities, towns and regions working together for sustainable development.Urban areas account for around two-thirds of the world's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from global energy use. Their overall contribution to total greenhouse gas emissions is estimated at between 37 and 49 per cent globally, depending on base assumptions of data used.Also at a press conference at COP 23 , the Mayor of city of Pittsburgh of the United States, William Peduto, announced that 367 American mayors have agreed to be ""part of the Paris Agreement no matter what our Federal Government did"".""It's going to happen at the local level"", he said.The new initiatives announced include efforts ICLEI and the global NDC Partnership (a coalition of countries and institutions working to mobilise support for climate goals and enhancing sustainable development) to design, implement and align climate action strategies across all levels of governments.Similarly, the Cities Climate Finance Leadership Alliance (a group of some 40 organizations working to mobilise investment in low-carbon and climate-resilient infrastructure in cities and urban areas internationally) is mapping available finance to match known infrastructure projects - a critical requirement to help local governments identify funding.Also Saturday at COP 23 , a new declaration was signed to strengthen global response to climate change impacts on oceans and coastal zones.Oceans are the planet's largest carbon sink, a major regulating force of global climate, and fundamental to the survival and well-being of humanity.""Oceans have featured little in the UN climate negotiations to date, and yet they are not only important for planetary survival but also offer great opportunities for innovation towards a low-carbon blue economy"", said Biliana Cicin-Sain, President of the Global Ocean Forum.Isabel Torres de Noronha, Executive Secretary of the Future Ocean Alliance, a non-governmental organization, in an interview with UN News, underscored that ocean acidification ""might put at risk not only ecosystems but also many economic activities and food security of coastal populations.""Among initiatives at national level, she highlighted one from Viet Nam about strengthening the coastline by planting forests of mangroves.

In 2017, extreme weather events are estimated to have caused more than $200 billion worth of damage worldwide, as hurricanes, droughts and rising sea levels devastated vulnerable communities with increased frequency and intensity. In the face of skyrocketing costs, new forms of financial protection have become an increasingly urgent part of the climate change discussion, the UN News said. The InsuResilience Global Partnership is a major scaling-up of an initiative started by the G7 in 2015 under the German Presidency. It aims at meeting the pledge of providing cover and support to an extra 400 million vulnerable people by 2020. The Global Partnership now brings together G20 countries in partnership with the so called 'V20' nations, a group of 49 of the most vulnerable countries including small islands like Fiji, which holds the Presidency of COP23 . ""The Global Partnership is a practical response to the needs of those who suffer loss because of climate change,"" said the COP23 President and Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama. This announcement on climate risk insurance was made a day before the high-level segment of COP23 , which Heads of State and Government, Ministers, and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres are expected to attend. Thomas Silberhorn, Parliamentary State Secretary to the German Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development, announced support of 125 million dollar for the new Global Partnership as part of the launch. This follows the &#163;30 million commitment to the initiative made by the British Government in July 2017. ""Climate risk insurance is a response to the simple fact that extreme weather events are constantly increasing in number and intensity, and also a response to our experience that the international community and the countries affected by extreme weather events tend to really act after those incidents occurred and they tend to come too late and to intervene not significantly enough,"" Mr. Silberhorn told a press conference. ""So our intention is to act more preemptively, to act in time, and to act decisively in order to reduce the impact of extreme weather events. Insurance is one tool to address this challenge,"" he added. The Global Partnership supports data and risk analysis, technical assistance and capacity building according to countries needs and priorities, solutions design of concrete risk finance and insurance solutions, smart support for the implementation for such schemes and monitoring and evaluation efforts. ""This new and higher-ambition initiative represents one shining example of what can be delivered when progressive governments, civil society and the private sector join hands with creativity and determination to provide solutions,"" said Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the UN Climate Change secretariat (UNFCCC). The Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF), for example, is being supported with the help of 'InsuResilience.' The most recent example of support was in September 2017, when more than $55 million was paid out to 10 Caribbean countries within 14 days of hurricanes Irma and Maria, which left an arc of destruction across the region. The money was used in various ways, for example, to quickly buy urgently needed medicines and to build emergency shelters for the people affected by the storms. In Zambia, InsuResilience supports the NWK Agri-Services cotton company, which offers direct weather and life insurance to small contract farmers. In 2015, some 52,000 farmers decided to buy insurance. Following a major drought in 2016, more than 23,000 farmers received payments.

"COP23","India","COP23_India10","COP23: Climate engineering is risky, experts say","November 17, 2017 Friday","UNI (United News of India)","Bonn, Nov. 17 -- Climate engineering, or climate intervention, is risky but needs to be explored as a supplement - not as a 'Plan B' - to greenhouse gas emissions reduction, said experts at the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP23 ) here. Climate engineering, also referred to as geoengineering, is the deliberate and large-scale intervention in the climate system with measures including carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere or solar radiation management, the UN News reported on Thursday. ""We can do a lot, we have to do a lot, we have to try much harder at cutting our emissions, but there will remain certain emissions, especially in the land use sector, which are not going away. So we actually need to start talking about this removal of greenhouse gases inevitably,"" said Matthias Honegger, research scientist with the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies, at a press conference. Different approaches are being discussed. Some already exist, like planting trees. Other ideas include dispersing certain minerals in the oceans to enhance the growth of algae, which then as they sink to the ocean floor, would create a net flux of carbon from the atmosphere into the oceans. ""Business as usual is a little worrying,"" said Dr. Hugh Hunt, from the Department of Engineering at Cambridge University. ""The concept of not doing anything is full of danger. Now the concept of cooling the planet is full of danger as well."" ""We need to have full-on public engagement, full-on societal involvement. The reason is that the risks of climate change are huge, the risks of doing nothing are huge; but the risks of geoengineering are huge as well. We've got to explore those risks, because who knows, we may end up entering a very risky world without understanding it,"" he added. ""Geoengineering risks are not well understood and need to be explored."" Due to the great uncertainties over effectiveness and side effects of climate engineering - including the risk of disrupting natural systems - experts think that there is a need to discuss climate engineering governance, especially as it relates to stratospheric aerosol injection. Stratospheric aerosol injection consists of injecting sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere with aircraft or balloons to create a global dimming effect. ""This technology is absolutely terrifying. We may actually need it, but then, who do we want to decide. That's where this society-wide discussion has to take place,"" said Janos Pasztor, Executive Director of the Carnegie Climate Geoengineering Governance Initiative (C2G2), and former UN senior climate advisor. ""It would require a level of international cooperation that we have not yet seen."" ""Who will decide whether we should make use of stratospheric aerosol injection and when that decision should take place? [.] Who will make that decision on behalf of the world? And then how far do we turn the thermostat of the global air conditioning system [.] to cool the planet?"" he said. ""There are issues: the more temperature you want to reduce the higher the chance there will be negative impact and the higher the chance that some of these impacts will not be the same across different geographical zones. You might end up in a situation where some people benefit from the reduced temperature but some people would have negative impacts. What do you do with those people? How do you compensate them? How do you take care of them?"" he added. Mr Pasztor concluded that the highest priority should remain the gas emission reduction. ""But we have to consider these other options, as supplements, not as a 'Plan B,'"" he warned. UNi XC-SNU 0938 Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from United News of India.

Climate risk insurance is a response to the simple fact that extreme weather events are constantly increasing in number and intensity, and also a response to our experience that the international community and the countries affected by extreme weather events tend to really act after those incidents occurred and they tend to come too late and to intervene not significantly enough, Silberhorn told a press conference. So our intention is to act more preemptively, to act in time, and to act decisively in order to reduce the impact of extreme weather events. Insurance is one tool to address this challenge, he added. A partnership for climate and disaster risk finance and insurance solutions The Global Partnership supports data and risk analysis, technical assistance and capacity building according to countries needs and priorities, solutions design of concrete risk finance and insurance solutions, smart support for the implementation for such schemes and monitoring and evaluation efforts. This new and higher ambition initiative represents one shining example of what can be delivered when progressive governments, civil society and the private sector join hands with creativity and determination to provide solutions, said Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the UN Climate Change secretariat (UNFCCC). The Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF), for example, is being supported with the help of InsuResilience. The most recent example of support was in September 2017, when more than $55 million was paid out to 10 Caribbean countries within 14 days of hurricanes Irma and Maria, which left an arc of destruction across the region. The money was used in various ways, for example, to quickly buy urgently needed medicines and to build emergency shelters for the people affected by the storms. In Zambia, InsuResilience supports the NWK Agri-Services cotton company, which offers direct weather and life insurance to small contract farmers. In 2015, some 52,000 farmers decided to buy insurance. Following a major drought in 2016, more than 23,000 farmers received payments. Photo: Jose M.

"COP23","India","COP23_India13","South Africa : Minister Edna Molewa attends Pre-Cop23 International Climate Change Talks in FIJI","October 18, 2017 Wednesday","TendersInfo","The Minister of Environmental Affairs, Dr Edna Molewa, has arrived in Fiji for a Pre- COP23 meeting of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change on 17 and 18 October 2017. The Pre- COP 23 COP 23 ) and the 13th Session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP 13), to be held in Bonn, Germany, from 06 to 17 November 2017 under the Fijian Presidency. The pre-COP agenda seeks to advance the work programme under the Paris Agreement as well as climate action agenda during the pre-2020 period. The objectives of the meeting include enhancing mutual understanding of political priorities and views by countries through enabling High-Level political discussion on key issues. The meeting will also provide an opportunity for the informal exchange of view on the expected outcomes for COP23 . COP23 will be crucial for technical teams to continue the good work that they have been doing to ensure that clear elements of the Paris Agreement Work Programme are agreed to that can be converted into text early in 2018. At COP22 in Marrakech, Morocco, countries had set a target of completing the Paris Work Programme during COP24 in 2018 and to clarifying the modalities for the 2018 Facilitative Dialogue aimed at increasing ambition in the pre-2020 and post-2020 years through the revisions on Nationally Determined Contributions where possible. It is important that there is agreement of the contents of, and accounting for, Nationally Determined Contributions; how parties should communicate and report on action related to their adaptation and mitigation efforts, said the Minister. South Africa is hopeful that the Bonn Climate Change Conference will not only take stock of work required to fully implement the Paris Agreement, but provide assurances that the political balance of the Paris Agreement is upheld, and that all issues of importance to developing countries (including adaptation and means of implementation) will be addressed in the rule-book to be adopted before 2020. It is our fervent hope that COP23 will not only focus on ensuring that commitments by developed countries in the pre-2020 period, including the provision of US$100 billion per annum in climate finance to developing countries by 2020, are honored but also that the efforts of developing countries to ensure that the Adaptation Fund serves the Paris Agreement are advanced. Despite opposition from developed countries and a diminishing revenue stream, Parties have agreed that the Adaptation Fund, created under the Kyoto Protocol, should also serve the Paris Agreement after 2020, said the Minister. With regard to limits to adaptation, otherwise known as loss and damage, Dr Molewa expressed concern about the increasing devastating events associated with the adverse effects of climate change on the African continent. We have therefore called for the enhancement of institutional arrangements and support, in terms of finance, technology and capacity-building, in order for the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with climate change impacts to achieve its mandate and fulfil its functions, said Minister Molewa. Dr Molewa added that developed countries should provide full support to developing countries for the formulation, updating and implementation of adaptation communications, including as a component of nationally determined contributions, in a manner that takes into account information on developing countries needs and associated costs, including the support needed to implement adaptation action through grants. South Africa cannot stress enough the importance of the Adaptation Fund to provide adaptation finance to developing country Parties. At COP23 we will urge Parties to develop the governance and institutional arrangements, safeguards and operating modalities of the Adaptation Fund to be adopted by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement, with the view of ensuring that the Fund serves this Agreement; through a clear decision in COP 23 that Adaptation Fund shall serve the Paris Agreement, said the Minister. \"

India has also decided to conduct 'Yoga' session every evening in the country's pavilion here to showcase its age-old tradition of sustainable lifestyle. The mega meet took off amid alarming report of the World Meteorological Organisation's (WMO) which says the year 2017 is very likely to be one of the three hottest years on record. The State of the Climate report of the WMO, released on the inaugural day of the Conference ( COP23 ), says the average global temperature from January to September 2017 was approximately 1.1\\xB0C above the pre-industrial era. ""As a result of a powerful El Ni\\xF1o, 2016 is likely to remain the warmest year on record, with 2017 and 2015 being second and/or third"", it says while noting that 2013-2017 is set to be the warmest five-year period on record.Delegates make pictures in front of a photo of an island at the COP 23 Fiji UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany on Nov. 6, 2017. () Though the Paris Agreement is meant for post-2020 climate actions to keep the average global temperature rise within 2 degree Celsius by the end of this century, India's pitch for discussing pre-2020 actions assumes significance considering the recent 'emission gap' report of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). The report, released last week, said that the national pledges on emission reduction, made by countries from across the globe under the Paris deal, would only bring a third of what is needed to avoid worst impact of climate change. ""India's demand to put pre-2020 actions on the agenda of the COP23 will hopefully be accepted"", the country's negotiator said. Under pre-2020 actions, only developed countries - the historical polluters (developed countries) - are mandated to cut their emissions of greenhouse gases. The Paris Agreement, on the other hand, says that all nations should take voluntary climate actions (as they had promised) under this global deal in December 2015.Delegates and visitors walk inside the German pavilion at the World Climate Conference in Bonn, Germany. Clearly articulating India's position, the country's environment minister Harsh Vardhan said, ""India has been ambitious in its climate change actions.""Speaking after inaugurating India's pavilion at sidelines of the climate change conference, the minister also noted that India's per capita emission is only one-third of the global average and shared what all the country has been doing to fulfill its Paris Agreement commitment. The Conference ( COP23 ) was kicked off with strong and unified calls to walk on the path of the Paris Agreement - especially when the US decision to withdraw from the global deal has already sent a negative signal to the world. Negotiators strongly believe that it would be practically impossible to meet the Paris goal without the US - the biggest historical polluter and the second largest current carbon emitter after China. ""All over the world, huge number of people are suffering. Our job as leaders is to respond to the suffering with all means available to us,"" said newly elected COP23 president and Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama. Whilst Fiji has the Presidency of COP23 , Germany is providing logistic resources to the island nation in Bonn to hold the key climate conference. The participating countries' concerns and need for raising their emission cut ambition got reflected in what the WMO said in its report on global temperature rise. Referring to warmest years in record, the WMO secretary-general Petteri Taalas, said, ""The past three years have been in the top three years in terms of temperature records. This is part of a long term warming trend. We have witnessed extraordinary weather, including temperatures topping 50 degrees Celsius in Asia, record-breaking hurricanes in rapid succession in the Caribbean and Atlantic reaching as far as Ireland, devastating monsoon flooding affecting many millions of people and a relentless drought in East Africa. ""Many of these events - and detailed scientific studies will determine exactly how many - bear the tell-tale sign of climate change caused by increased greenhouse gas concentrations from human activities.""

From Stuttgart, Germany, the Governor traveled to Brussels, Belgium, where he joined dozens of members of the European Parliament's top climate and environmental committee and the leaders of the Parliament's political parties for more than three hours of debate and discussion on climate change, its impacts, and opportunities for further collaboration. During the final hour of the exchange, the Governor confronted several members that used their remarks to openly question the science of climate change. ""The truth is that any kind of catalogue of the scientific community indicates that climate change is real, it's having impacts. Even the Trump administration couldn't, with a straight face, curb a report that underscores the very opposite of what you denialists have expressed here,"" said Governor Brown during the discussion with the European Parliament Conference of Presidents.

On November 14, on the margins of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ), the Bank was announced as one of the newest members of the NDC Partnership. Admission to the Partnership comes as CDB intensifies its effort to scale up climate action in its Borrowing Member Countries. Speaking at the event, Champions for Climate Action: The NDC Partnership, President of the Bank, Dr. Wm. Warren Smith, said that CDBs decision to join was a no-brainer. The principles that underpin this Partnership coincide very nicely with the approach of the Caribbean Development Bank. We, as a small institution, have learnt over the years that there is very little that we can do on our own. We have to work with several different countries and institutions in order for us to mobilise the resources that we need for our borrowing member countries. And we also need to gather the information and the experiences of our larger partners, in particular, for us to be able to get it right, said Smith. The NDC Partnership is a platform for the implementation of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) the targets countries around the world are working to achieve, to stop global temperatures from rising 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The Partnership promotes long-term climate action; advancing adaptation and mitigation; and aligning development and climate change. Partners work together to identify the capacity needs of developing countries and determine the appropriate means to address those needs. The NDC Partnership was launched at the United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Marrakesh, Morocco last year. Since then, it has grown to almost 80 members that are engaging jointly to help 15 developing countries and emerging economies reach their NDC targets under the Paris Agreement and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Brazil; Canada; Colombia; Germany; Haiti; Italy; Mexico; Saint Lucia; and the United Kingdom are CDB member countries that have joined the NDC Partnership. \"

I have set out to the international community our new governments plans to reduce climate pollution at home and remain actively engaged with the international effort, said Mr Shaw. Our goals and plans for forestry, energy, transport, and agriculture are getting a good reception. People seem really pleased to see the new New Zealand government planning to lead by example. We know that the future of our electricity system is in renewables, not coal, so I was delighted we could recognise that formally at this important international meeting. New Zealand is a small country and our emissions are less than one percent of global emissions, but size is not an excuse for inaction. If you add up all the countries who contribute less than one percent, we collectively contribute almost a quarter of global climate pollution. New Zealand officials have been working hard at this COP to get outcomes that are good for us, good for our Pacific neighbours, and good for the world, said Mr Shaw. Fijis leadership of the COP23 meeting has put the global spotlight on the vulnerability of low-lying Pacific Island nations to increased storms, droughts, and sea level rise caused by climate change. Mr Shaw said New Zealand is a Pacific country that stands beside its neighbours and will support them. The most effective thing we can do for the Pacific is to reduce our climate pollution as much as we can and encourage other countries to do the same. We are also committed to supporting our Pacific neighbours to adapt their infrastructure to the changing climate. \"

This collaborative work will include the launch of a Circular Economy initiative in the waste sector. In determining the climate action during the pre-2020 period, COP23 is crucial in determining what is required of all Parties to continue the good work that we have been doing to ensure that clear elements of action are agreed to that can be converted into text early in 2018, said Dr Molewa. At COP22 in Morocco in 2016, countries had set a target of completing the Paris Work Programme during COP24 in 2018 and to clarifying the modalities for the 2018 Facilitative Dialogue aimed at increasing ambition in the pre-2020 and post-2020 years through the revisions on Nationally Determined Contributions where possible. Minister Molewa said it is important that there is agreement this year of the contents of, and accounting for, Nationally Determined Contributions submitted by Parties to the UNFCCC and how parties should communicate and report on action related to their adaptation efforts and needs. Dr Molewa said there also needs to be agreement on the Adaptation Fund and how compliance with the Paris Agreement will be monitored. South Africa is hopeful that the Bonn Climate Change Conference will not only take stock of what is required to implement the Paris Agreement, but that it will provide assurances that the political balance of the Paris Agreement is upheld. We are hopeful that all issues of importance to developing countries, such as adaptation and means of implementation, will be addressed in the rule-book to be adopted before 2020, the Minister said.

Brown Jr., the conference's Special Advisor for States and Regions, joined Michael R. Bloomberg, the United Nations Secretary-Generals Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change, to reaffirm the commitment of America's states, cities and businesses to the Paris Agreement and later welcomed Virginia to the Under2 Coalition at a signing ceremony with Governor Terry McAuliffe. ""When cities and states combine together and then join with powerful corporations, that's how we get stuff done,"" said Governor Brown at today's event at the U.S. Climate Action Pavilion, a purpose-built exhibition space sponsored by U.S. non-federal leaders at COP23 . ""We're here, we're in and we're not going away."" Governor Brown and Bloomberg joined forces to launch America's Pledge on climate change in July to help compile and quantify the actions of states, cities and businesses to drive down their greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Ahead of today's event, the America's Pledge report was submitted to the United Nations detailing, for the first time to the international community, the scope and scale of non-federal climate action in the United States following the Trump administrations decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. Cities, states and businesses representing more than half the U.S. economy and population have declared their support for the Paris Agreement, including more than 2,300 signatories to the We Are Still In declaration. The group of American cities, states, and businesses who remain committed to the Paris Agreement represents a bigger economy than any nation outside the U.S. and China, said Bloomberg. Together they are helping deliver on the promise of the agreement and ensuring the U.S. remains a global leader in the fight against climate change. In Paris, the U.S. pledged to measure and report our progress reducing emissions alongside every other nation. Through Americas Pledge, were doing just that, and were going to continue to uphold our end of the deal, with or without Washington. Today's event also featured remarks from United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa, COP23 President Prime Minister of Fiji Frank Bainimarama, as well as Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland, Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto, Walmart Senior Vice President of Sustainability Laura Phillips and Californias Secretary for Environmental Protection Matt Rodriquez. If the challenge of climate change is to be solved and the opportunities of a low carbon transition harvested we need all sectors of society in all nations fully on board, said UNFCCC Executive Secretary Espinosa. Cities, states, regions and territories have, along with business and civil society, been an inspiration before, during, at and following Paris. Here I want to pay tribute to Jerry Brown, Californias Governor, UN Special Envoy Michael Bloomberg and all the states and cities of the USA who have been aligning their pledges and actions with the Paris Climate Change Agreement. You are part of an unstoppable movement that is stretching North and South, East and West. With greater speed, ever higher ambition and by joining hands with all actors world-wide, we can together reach our shared goals. ""To achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, we are helping to build a Grand Coalition to accelerate climate action across all nations and at every level of society, said COP23 President Prime Minister Bainimarama. So I am delighted to welcome the commitments that have been made through Americas Pledge from members of that coalition in the US among the non-state actors such as governors and mayors. This imaginative initiative by Governor Brown and Michael Bloomberg shows that the campaign for climate action in America remains strong. I also hope that it is a model that can be followed elsewhere in the world as we bring everyone together to pursue a more ambitious response to the challenge of climate change"" Later in the day, Governor Brown joined Virginia Governor McAuliffe at an Under2 Coalition signing ceremony. With the addition of Virginia, the Under2 Coalition now includes 189 cities, states and countries collectively representing more than 1.2 billion people and $29.4 trillion GDP equivalent to over 17 percent of the global population and 39 percent of the global economy. Virginia is driving clean energy investment and carbon reduction despite the Presidents decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, said Governor McAuliffe. In the absence of leadership in Washington, Virginia is stepping up to sign the Under2 Memorandum of Understanding. Virginia will meet the challenge of climate change head on, and we will do so in a way that grows our clean energy sector and supports our new Virginia economy. Today's signing ceremony followed a meeting organized by The Climate Group the Secretariat of the Under2 Coalition featuring leaders representing dozens of member governments. The signing ceremony was witnessed by Oregon Governor Kate Brown; Baden-Wrttemberg Minister-President Winfried Kretschmann and Minister of the Environment, Climate Protection and the Energy Sector Franz Untersteller; Quebec Minister of Sustainable Development, the Environment and the Fight Against Climate Change Isabelle Melanon; North Rhine-Westphalia Minister for Economic Affairs, Innovation, Digitization and Energy Andreas Pinkwart; and KwaZulu-Natal Member of the Executive Council (MEC) for Social Development Weziwe Thusi. \"

The enthusiasm over a possibility of hammering out the technical details of the 2015 Paris Agreement was partly marred by discussions on pre-2020 climate actions. While bringing pre-2020 action into focus can be listed as one of the breakthroughs steered by the developing countries, with India leading from the front, meaningful progress on global stocktake, accounting, transparency framework and loss and damage remained elusive. No financial commitments were being agreed upon on the critical issue of loss and damage. Environmental groups are not happy with the outcome of the negotiations, whose broad objective was to get clarity on complex operational issues pertaining to Paris climate agreement. Just like the last year's COP in Marakkech, the COP 23 in Bonn almost turned out to be an ""under-ambitious conference"". Despite the impasse over a large number of issues, small steps were certainly the highlights of this year's climate talks. Parties agreed that there will be two stocktakes to discuss pre-2020 commitments- in 2018 and 2019-before the Paris Agreement becomes operative in 2020. After a long wait, the Parties decided to report on climate actions in agriculture and on socio-economic and food security dimensions. A stocktake has been planned for COP 26 in 2020. Several decisions on the rule-book and guidelines to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement, which could have been taken at COP 23 , have now been deferred till next year. The responsibility now lies on the developing countries to ensure that the rulebook remains fair, equitable and ambitious, notwithstanding the fact that the developed world would play truant.

Chair Nilza Sena (Portugal) said that the pledges made by countries in Bonn including the launching of the Talanoa Dialogue for strengthening national climate action plans are an encouraging sign that the international community is continuing to move forward in addressing the threat posed by human-induced climate change. Sena welcomed UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterress remarks at the conference stressing greater focus on five action areas: emissions, adaptation, finance, partnerships and leadership. Sena noted that the outcomes from Bonn are especially important in showing continued international commitment to climate progress in light of the decision announced by United States President Donald Trump last June to pull the U.S. out of the landmark 2015 Paris climate accord. Despite the disappointing decision by President Trump earlier this year to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, it is reassuring that so many world leaders and also leaders on the state and local levels in the U.S. are committed to continuing the pursuit of carbon reduction strategies, Sena said. I welcome the outcomes of the COP23 and I strongly urge all OSCE participating States to continue moving forward in addressing climate change, which must be seen as not only an environmental challenge but a security threat as well. She applauded the COP23 initiative of more than 20 countries including the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Finland, and Austria who joined the Powering Past Coal alliance, promising to phase out traditional coal power plants and cease all investment in coal domestically or abroad. Two U.S. states Washington and Oregon also joined the accord, Sena noted. She also said that it was encouraging to see participation at the COP23 by a coalition of more than 2,500 mayors, governors and others from across the United States who on 11 November released the Americas Pledge report, outlining the scope of non-federal climate action in the U.S. following the Trump administrations decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. Considering the dire situation we face in terms of rising sea levels, intensified heat waves, droughts, forest fires, and stronger storms, it is clear that we need an all-hands-on-deck approach that utilizes innovation and creative thinking to move towards a more sustainable, low-carbon economy, Sena said. At the OSCE PA Annual Session last July, parliamentarians adopted the Minsk Declaration, which urges all OSCE participating States to recognize the urgency of the climate crisis and its related challenges and calls on all OSCE countries to ratify the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change and to fulfill their obligations under the agreement.Nilza Sena was elected Chair of the OSCE PAs Committee on Economic Affairs, Science, Technology and Environment at the 2016 Annual Session in Tbilisi and was reelected in Minsk. \"

The challenge, which was launched earlier this year, is an unprecedented open-innovation competition to harness data science and big data to accelerate climate solutions. The challenge was organized by UN Global Pulse with the support of the Skoll Global Threats Fund and Western Digital. The growing volume, velocity, variety and value of data tells a story of unlimited possibilities, said Dave Tang, senior vice president, corporate marketing and communications, Western Digital. This challenge is just one example of how we can capture, preserve, access and transform all types of data to unlock solutions to help our communities and our planet to thrive. The D4CA challenge demonstrates what is possible when public and private sector organizations partner for social good. Access to large amounts of data - anonymized and aggregated to protect privacy - accelerates the ability to derive insights and develop predictive algorithms that provide more precise solutions. According to Robert Kirkpatrick, director of UN Global Pulse, The inspiring innovations that resulted from this challenge are proof of how much we can achieve in enabling climate solutions when climate experts, data scientists and companies work together. UN Global Pulse and Western Digital recently announced the winners of D4CA at an event on Data Innovation: Generating Climate Solutions, held during COP23 in Bonn, Germany. The innovation event celebrated the winning projects and brought together business leaders, data scientists, and climate experts for interactive talks, discussions, and demonstrations of data visualizations and innovations. The success of this challenge is a testament to the tireless efforts and commitment of the companies we worked with, and even more so, the champions within each of them. If public and private sectors can work to replicate these efforts at larger scale, there is tremendous potential for innovation across all of the Sustainable Development Goals, added Kirkpatrick. More than 450 teams of specialized data scientists and researchers from 67 countries applied to participate in the challenge. Of these, 97 semi-finalists worked to develop innovation projects using datasets and tools from 11 different companies. \"

And climate finance is on top. The Climate Chance Summit is the annual meeting point for non-state actors to define the most pressing issues to be addressed at UN's COP negotiations. Marco Dus (IT/PES) has been the CoR representative at the Climate Chance Summit in Agadir (11-13 September 2017), the largest gathering of climate actors before COP23 . The 23rd United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bonn will take place from 6 to 17 November 2017. Marco Dus, member of the Vittorio Veneto Municipal Council presented his upcoming opinion on financing climate action. Dus stressed the urgency to develop innovating financing schemes to facilitate cities and regions access to funding. The rapporteur recalled that 'it is essential to mobilise sufficient financial resources to turn the Paris commitments into practice'. About his upcoming opinion on climate finance, Dus said 'The opinion addresses the key strengths and limitations of the existing financing instruments. It formulates proposals on how to make the financing system more solid and more easily accessible to cities and regions. This opinion will represent the CoR's position on climate finance and will be defended at the upcoming COP23 in Bonn'. The event 'Enhancing the potential of climate action partnerships' has been organised by the International Climate Governance Coalition, a joint venture of the European Committee of the Regions, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and Comit 21 the French Committee for Sustainable Development . Their ultimate objective goal is the development of a new multi-level and multi-stakeholder governance for the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Brenda King , member of the EESC and President of the Sustainable Development Observatory joined Dus in Agadir. King said: 'Policy-makers are still unaware of the potential of civil society in climate action. The EESC has the priority to demonstrate the potential of non-state actors to significantly contribute to meeting the objectives of the Paris Agreement, as well as to point to the obstacles and conditions for success of effective multi-stakeholder and multi-level governance cooperation'. These objectives are gathered in the EESC opinion ' coalition to deliver the commitments of the Paris Agreement ' adopted in July 2016. Marco Dus also presented the provisional findings of the Coalition's mapping report of multi-level and multi-stakeholders governance of climate change. The following factors proved to be particularly important: political commitment as a key to make public funds available and facilitate access to it; clear legal frameworks that reduce uncertainty and build trust between partners; adaptive and flexible management approaches; and public awareness and community involvement. Dus called the audience in Agadir to provide comments and contributions to the report which final version will be available for COP23 in Bonn. The International Climate Governance Coalition is to deliver practical solutions to boost climate action: a toolbox for climate partnerships, recommendations on climate finance, examples for scaling, replicating and extending adaptation and mitigation projects and support for the creation of new multi-stakeholder platforms dedicated to climate and sustainable development. \"

Noting that we should ""not be discouraged by the challenges ahead,"" the FAO Director-General stressed that achieving Zero Hunger by 2030 is still possible. ""Agriculture is where the fight against hunger and climate change come together to unlock solutions."" ""It is not enough to only transform the way we produce food. Climate change mitigation and adaptation must be integrated into the entire food system: from production to transportation, from processing to food consumption, and in both rural and urban areas,"" Graziano da Silva said. Climate change, hunger and poverty can and must be tackled together FAO recently announced that the number of undernourished people has increased for the first time again in a decade with 815 million people going hungry every day. This spike is due mainly to conflict and economic downturns, but also the impact of climate change, particularly prolonged droughts in Africa. And estimates by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change show that climate change might increase the risk of hunger and malnutrition by up to 20 percent by 2050. Graziano da Silva pointed to the fundamental role of food systems and agriculture which are heavily affected by climate change, but at the same time are also major drivers of climate change. Adopting climate-smart agricultural practices At least one fifth of total greenhouse gas emission can be attributed to the agriculture sectors, Graziano da Silva noted. Much more needs to be done to reduce these emissions and to simultaneously improve yields and build resilience, the FAO Director-General said. This means adopting approaches such as agroecology and sustainable, climate-smart intensification, among others. ""We cannot expect that smallholders, family farmers and pastoralists ...can tackle these challenges on their own,"" and they will need national and international support, he added. ""Reducing deforestation; restoring degraded lands and forests; eliminating food loss and waste; enhancing soil carbon sequestration; low-carbon livestock - these are only a few known solutions to address hunger, poverty and sustainability at the same time,"" Graziano da Silva explained. He noted in particular, that while livestock emits more greenhouse gas than other food sources, ""low carbon livestock is possible,"" - for example, FAO estimates that readily available improved husbandry practices can reduce emissions by 20 to 30 percent. FAO's work includes supporting countries in sustainably improving their agricultural sectors; in adapting and building resilience, and in mitigating global warming through agriculture. It also assists countries monitor their Nationally Determined Contributions in terms of climate change and delivers the technical and financial support needed to turn these commitments into reality.

Fiji, currently presiding over the presidency of the United Nations climate change conference , COP23 , will play host to a climate-centred 20CCEM, the theme of which is Sustainability and Resilience: Can Education Deliver? Fiji is incredibly proud to stand as a leader among the Commonwealth as the first Pacific Island nation to host this important gathering, said Fijian Prime Minister and COP23 President Frank Bainimarama. We offer a fitting location for 20CCEM, and not just because of our global climate leadership. Fiji is in the midst of an education revolution; providing free schooling, textbooks, and transportation to many of our young people for the first time in our countrys history, restructuring a merit-based compensation system for teachers, increasing access to higher degrees through an affordable Tertiary Education Loan Scheme, and rebuilding schools that were struck by Cyclone Winston-- and all done through a lens of resilience and sustainability. We look forward to continuing this progress, sharing our learnings, and gaining new perspectives through collaboration with our fellow Commonwealth nations at this years event. Nearly 500 attendees are expected throughout the week at 20CCEM, where education ministers from 32 Commonwealth nations and their delegations will be joined by world-renowned politicians and speakers, teachers, students, NGO representatives, and other partners. Here in Fiji over the coming days, we have an early opportunity to influence outcomes of that meeting. We can help plan for a common future that is fairer, more prosperous, more sustainable and more secure that will meet the needs of all, particularly our young people, said Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland. Our 53 Commonwealth member countries have a combined population of some 2.4 billion. More than 60 per cent are under 30 years of age, and in some countries, that rises to over 70 per cent. These young people drive long-term economic growth, competitiveness, prosperity and social justice, if given the fair chance and opportunities to fulfil their potential.

Two weeks ago, the IEA launched the Clean Energy Transitions Programme, a multi-year 30 million EUR initiative scaling up engagement with major emerging economies. The IEA also took the opportunity at COP23 to meet with officials, policymakers and key stakeholders from the growing IEA family. The IEA was present in the pavilions of key Member and Association countries, including China, India, Indonesia, Germany, France, Japan, as well as the EU and Nordic pavilions.

"COP23","India","COP23_India38","UN climate change conference acknowledges agriculture's critical role","November 18, 2017 6:30 AM EST","Rural Marketing","The United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ), organised in Bonn, Germany, recognised the importance of agriculture for the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Discussions at COP23 have focused on ways to minimise climate change while also increasing efforts to assist developing countries, in particular, adapt to changing weather patterns. The closing plenary requested that the two subsidiary bodies of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change work together on addressing issues related to agriculture, taking into consideration the vulnerabilities of agriculture to climate change and approaches towards food security. These include areas of action on soil, livestock, nutrient and water management, adaptation and on the food security and socio-economic impacts of climate change across the agriculture sectors. ""Climate change is already affecting agriculture and food security and it disproportionately affects the poorest of the poor, most of whom rely on the agricultural sectors for their livelihoods. Without urgent action to adapt agriculture and meet a growing global demand for food, there will be more hungry people in the world. Today's decision is a major step to address this problem, and to enable the agricultural sectors to also engage in worldwide efforts to limit global warming,"" said FAO Director-General Jose Graziano da Silva. ""It will help create an enabling environment for countries and non-state actors to conduct activities in the agricultural sectors that are key to achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement,"" the FAO Director-General added. He noted that FAO would continue to provide its full support to this important process by providing technical input and support to the two subsidiary bodies. Earlier this week, Graziano da Silva speaking at COP23 called for an increase in efforts to reduce agricultural emissions and to simultaneously improve yields and build resilience. He stressed that this means adopting approaches such as agro-ecology and sustainable, climate-smart intensification, among others, and that smallholders, family farmers and pastoralists cannot be expected to tackle these challenges on their own. As things stand, the pledges made thus far under the Paris Agreement are not enough to meet the target of limiting global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius this century. Even full implementation of current unconditional and conditional Nationally Determined Contributions makes a temperature increase of at least 3 degrees Celsius by 2100 very likely. Agriculture can make a massive difference to this shortfall. No other sector holds as much potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For example, best practices and technologies in livestock feeding and manure management could help the global livestock sector cut is outputs of global warming gases by up to 30 percent. FAO's work in support of Paris Agreement FAO believes that hunger, poverty and climate change can be tackled together by recognising the links between rural poverty alleviation, sustainable agriculture and strategies that boost resource-use efficiency, conserve and restore biodiversity and natural resources, and combat the impacts of climate change. Around 90 percent of countries' climate commitments, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), include the agricultural sectors - clearly demonstrating the fundamental contribution the sectors can bring. FAO already supports countries to better integrate the agriculture sectors in their National Adaptation Plans and in the implementation of their NDCs. \"

Young people in the Congo Basin have been doing things on the ground that often go ignored, explained Marie Tamoifo, President of the Cameroon Green Youth Association (Association de la Jeunesse verte du Cameroun AJVC) and Regional Coordinator of the Youth Network for sustainable management of forest ecosystems in Central Africa (Rseau des jeunes pour la gestion durable des cosystmes forestiers dAfrique centrale - REJEFAC) in an interview with UN News. REJEFAC brings together youth organizations from 10 Congo Basin countries Burundi, Cameroon, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe and Chad). Its aim is to promote the effective participation of young environmental actors in decision-making in the Congo Basin and to contribute to the emergence in the region of a new type of leadership, more sensitive and open to the requirements of sustainable development. [As for] actions on the ground, there are reforestation, awareness and education programmes for young people. Its about strengthening the work that is done by governments, said Tamoifo. A solar panel programme in isolated communities For several years, AJVC has been developing a programme in Cameroon for the electrification of isolated rural areas with solar panels. The programme started in 15 pilot communities in the east, in the center and in the far north of the country with the installation of solar panels in homes and schools. A contribution is made by the community itself, representing 25 to 30 per cent of the cost. In these 15 communities, we trained 85 young people in solar installation techniques but also in psycho-socio-organizational methodology, explained Ms Tamoifo. When we arrive in a community, we first hold a discussion with that community. We try to see with [them] what the glaring problems are. The youth participating in this programme are from the community. They are trained and they provide maintenance for the solar panels that have already been installed. For now, they are not really paid. They receive a small allowance, added Tamoifo. The association needs more financial support to maintain and expand this programme. We have received more than 100 requests from villages and we cannot answer them given [our] modest means. And young people who are trained on Thursday also need to make a living to be able to continue this work, she said. A climate caravan in Cameroon Among other actions carried out by young people in the Congo Basin region, the REJEFAC Coordinator mentioned a tree planting initiative by volunteers in the Republic of Congo, and a programme focusing on handicrafts and conservation of natural resources in Rwanda. Before coming to COP 23 , the network organized a climate caravan in Cameroon with the participation of young people from the ten countries of the Congo Basin to show what youth organizations are doing in terms of sustainable development and protection of the planet. We organized this caravan which was named the COP at home, said the Coordinator of REJEFAC. Young people have been designated as climate ambassadors. The climate caravan travelled in the Douala region, coastal areas and went to Equatorial Guinea. It showed how we could talk about the theoretical aspect and go on the ground to experience the realities of conservation parks and conflicts between humans and elephants, concluded Tamoifo.

The Prime Minister described it as a vision that is inclusive and very much focuses on maintaining the momentum for the implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. It also accelerates climate action for all vulnerable societies, drawing on Fijis own experiences as a Small Island Developing State in the Pacific. The formal text is as follows: Acknowledging the important leadership roles of past COP Presidencies in laying the foundation for a robust COP23 , Fiji's vision for COP23 is: To advance the work of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and preserve the multilateral consensus for decisive action to address the underlying causes of climate change, respecting climate science. To uphold and advance the Paris Agreement, ensure progress on the implementation guidelines and undertake consultations together with the Moroccan COP22 Presidency to design the process for the Facilitative Dialogue in 2018. To build greater resilience for all vulnerable nations to the impacts of climate change, including extreme weather events and rising sea levels; to enable access to climate adaptation finance, renewable energy, clean water and affordable climate risk and disaster insurance; and to promote sustainable agriculture. To forge a grand coalition to accelerate climate action before 2020 and beyond between civil society, the scientific community, the private sector and all levels of government, including cities and regions. I repeat: We are all vulnerable and we all need to act. To harness innovation, enterprise and investment to fast track the development and deployment of climate solutions that will build future economies with net zero greenhouse gas emissions, in an effort to limit the rise of global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. To draw a stronger link between the health of the worlds oceans and seas and the impacts of, and solutions to, climate change as part of a holistic approach to the protection of our planet. To infuse COP23 with the Fijian Bula Spirit of inclusiveness, friendliness and solidarity and promote the Pacific concept of talanoa. This is a process of inclusive, participatory and transparent dialogue that builds empathy and leads to decision making for the collective good. It is not about finger pointing and laying blame but is about listening to each other, learning from each other, sharing stories, skills and experiences. By focusing on the benefits of action, this process will move the global climate agenda forward. The Prime Minister said that while his role as COP president was to be impartial and act in the collective interests of all nations, he would certainly bring his own perspective to the negotiations in Bonn in November. We who are most vulnerable must be heard, whether we come from the Pacific or other Small Island Developing States, other low lying nations and states or threatened cities in the developed world like Miami, New York, Venice or Rotterdam. But together we must speak out for the whole world - every global citizen - because no-one, no matter who they are or where they live, will ultimately escape the impact of climate change, the Prime Minister said. \"

As part of the agreement reached at the Conference of parties ( COP23 ) in Bonn, developed countries, except the United States, on Wednesday agreed to discuss the issue at the next two climate conferences in subsequent two years. Fiji, which is presiding over COP23 , has been asked to send letters to all the countries which are yet to ratify the Doha amendments to the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 to do so ""as soon as possible"". The developed countries have also been asked to give information by 1 May 2018 on the progress they have made on pre-2020 actions that relates to their obligations under the Kyoto Protocol that includes reduction of emissions and transfer of technology and finance. The issue, which entails revisiting of greenhouse gas mitigation targets by developed countries and provision of finance, technology and capacity building support to developing countries, has now found a place in the draft decision text of the COP23 . It is expected that the 2018 facilitative dialogue, called Talanoa dialogue, will discuss pre-2020 actions of rich nations apart from looking at the climate actions of all nations under the Paris Agreement. ""The lost agenda in climate change negotiations at COP23 on ambitious pre-2020 mitigation action by developed countries was redeemed with efforts by India, China and other developing countries"", said India's environment secretary C K Mishra. ""Many of the proposals floated by India as part of the Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDC) group were agreed upon by the COP Presidency and found a place in the draft decision text,"" he added. However, this was a compromise reached during joint consultations where all the countries agreed to discuss the critical issue of pre-2020 action as part of ""Talanoa Dialogue"" next year and not as part of the COP23 agenda which was originally demanded by the developing countries. Developing countries have been demanding forward movement on pre-2020 actions, which they said are part of the Paris Agreement and cannot be divorced from the commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol, which refers to obligations of rich nations to take mitigation action, was adopted in 1997 and was since amended in Doha in 2012 where the developed countries had agreed to undertake their aggregate emission cuts by at least 18 per cent by 2020 below the 1990 levels. However, most of them, including the EU, have, so far, not even ratified the decision. So far, only 84 of the total 191 signatories have ratified it. It'll become operational only after being ratified by minimum 144 countries. ""Strong voices of concern by developing countries prompted the COP presidency to recognise their concerns and call for early ratification of the KP-II and consult United Nations Secretary General to encourage it. The draft text address the key demand from India on a mid-2018 deadline for this process,"" said Mishra. Ministers of BASIC countries - Brazil, South Africa, India and China - on Wednesday spoke at length on the importance of pre-2020 actions by rich nations under KP for driving the post-2020 commitments forward under the Paris Agreement. ""While we are doing our bit, our strong commitment must be met by the leadership that the developed countries are supposed to provide in taking actions regarding mitigation and support in terms of finance and technologies,"" India's environment minister Harsh Vardhan said. The Talanoa dialogue process is a Fijian concept of negotiations and discussions to arrive at an acceptable solution. Talanoa is a traditional word used in Fiji and the Pacific to reflect a process of inclusive, participatory and transparent dialogue. The purpose of Talanoa is to share stories, build trust and to make wise decisions, which are for the collective good. The process of Talanoa involves the sharing of ideas, skills and experience through storytelling. The president of the COP23 , Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, named the 2018 facilitative dialogue (FD) as the 'Talanoa' dialogue. The FD will take stock of the countries' collective efforts in relation to progress towards their long-term climate goal under the Paris Agreement.

The conference, which takes place between November 6 and November 17, is a follow up to the groundbreaking Paris climate talks in 2015, and brings together government representatives and activists from around the world, including some indigenous people, to discuss environmental issues, a press release issued by the Survival International said on Friday. Survival has been leading the global call for a conservation model that respects tribal peoples' rights. This has been increasingly acknowledged by key international figures, including the United Nations Special Rapporteur for Indigenous Peoples, Victoria Tauli-Corpuz. Davi Kopenawa, a Yanomami shaman known as the Dalai Lama of the rainforest, said: ""The rains come late. The sun behaves in a strange way. The world is ill. The lungs of the sky are polluted. We know it is happening. You cannot go on destroying nature."" Evidence proves that tribal territories are the best barrier to deforestation. Robust land protection measures and recognition of tribal land rights protect vast areas of forest, aiding biodiversity and reducing global CO2 levels. But despite this, some of the big conservation organizations are partnering with industry and tourism and destroying the environment's best allies. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) have both partnered with logging companies in the Congo Basin, none of which is logging at sustainable rates, and both have contributed to gross violations of the rights of tribal peoples like the Baka and Bayaka. Although some indigenous activists like Sonia Guajajara from Brazil will be present at the talks, tribal peoples' voices will not be at the center of the conference. This is despite the fact that tribal peoples are the best conservationists and guardians of the natural world, and should be at the forefront of the environmental movement. Survival's Director Stephen Corry said: ""It's dangerous to sideline tribal people in discussions on how best to protect our planet. They have far greater insight into how to look after the environment than anyone and we ignore their knowledge at our peril. For decades, industrialized society has ravaged the planet and destroyed indigenous peoples along the way. It's time we started listening to them before it's too late.""

"COP23","India","COP23_India48","COP23: UN chief urges leadership on climate action","November 16, 2017 Thursday","UNI (United News of India)","Germany, Nov. 16 -- Addressing the United Nations Climate Conference ( COP23 ) here, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for more ambition, more leadership and more partnerships to tackle climate change. ""Our duty - to each other and to future generations - is to raise ambition,"" said Mr Guterres at the opening of the high-level segment of COP23 on Wednesday, which was also attended by Heads of State and Government, including President of Germany Frank-Walter Steinmeier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron, and Prime Minister of Fiji, Frank Bainimarana, who is also the President of COP23 . The Bonn Conference, which opened on 6 November 2017, is taking place one year after the entry into force of the Paris Climate Agreement. The Agreement, which was adopted by the 196 Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in December 2015, calls on countries to combat climate change by limiting the rise of global temperature below 2 degrees Celsius and strive not to exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius. Today, 170 Parties have ratified the treaty. Regarding emissions reductions, the UN chief urged countries ""to use the 2020 revision of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to close the 2030 emissions gap."" He also stressed how essential climate mitigation is, calling for adaptation measures and strengthening resilience. The Green Climate Fund can play a catalytic role in this regard. He appealed to its members, especially donor nations, to reinvigorate engagement with that vital finance mechanism. As greater ambition on emissions, adaptation and resilience ""is inextricably linked to funding,"" the Secretary-General stressed the need ""to mobilise the agreed $100 billion annually for developing countries."" ""The world should adopt a simple rule: If big infrastructure projects aren't green, they shouldn't be given the green light. Otherwise we will be locked into bad choices for decades to come. Investing in climate-friendly development is where the smart money is needed,"" Mr Guterres said. The Secretary-General stressed that more ambition required action coalitions across all key sectors and by all actors. ""We must engage all actors - national, regional and local governments, philanthropists and investors and consumers - in the transformation to a low-emission economy,"" he said. As for political leadership, Mr Guterres encouraged countries to be bold in their deliberations and decisions in Bonn and at home. ""Show wisdom in investing in the opportunities of the future. Show compassion in caring what kind of world we build for our children,"" he stated. Also addressing the COP23 High-Level segment, the President of the UN General Assembly, Miroslav Lajak, reminded participants that ""the decisions we make today will affect not only us - but also those who come after."" He added: ""If we hand over a planet with an uncertain future, history will not forgive us."" For his part, Mr Guterres welcomed a series of summits and conferences on climate change which are scheduled ahead of the UN Climate Summit in September 2019, including the 'One Planet summit' to be convened by France next month and focusing on financing, a gathering in California, bringing together non-State actors, and the COP24 in Katowice, Poland, in December 2018.

"COP23","India","COP23_India49","Stalemate over inclusion of pre-2020 issues in COP23 agenda continues","November 13, 2017 Monday","The Economic Times","BONN (GERMANY): Stalemate over inclusion of pre-2020 actions in the agenda of the ongoing UN climate conference ( COP23 ) continues as the rich nations have, so far, not agreed to the demand of developing countries. The president of the COP23 (23rd Conference of Parties) Fijian Prime Minister Bainimarama on Sunday said the consultation on the issue was still going on under Morocco's foreign minister and the decision was expected on Monday. Developing countries, including India and China, had jointly demanded inclusion of the pre-2020 issue in the agenda of the COP23 on day one of the Conference on November 6. The developed countries had, however, opposed it saying the matter can be discussed at some other forum. The pre-2020 actions refer to existing obligations under the Kyoto Protocol where only rich nations are obliged to take mitigation (emission cut) actions. Though the developed countries had in 2012 agreed to undertake their aggregate emission cuts by at least 18% below the 1990 levels, most of them, including the EU, have, so far, not even ratified the decision. Ratification of the Protocol is important for global climate action for the years leading up to 2020. So far, only 84 of the total 191 signatories have ratified it. It has not yet become operational as it still falls short of required number. As the developed countries had opposed the developing countries demand, the Morocco's Foreign Minister, Salaheddine Mezouar, who was COP22 President, had convened informal consultations among countries on November 8 to consider the proposal. Though the decision was supposed to be taken on Saturday, the differences over the issue continued to remain unresolved.

This was communicated to Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama by the EU Council president Donald Tusk when the two held bilateral talks this morning at the margins of 62nd Session of the UN General Assembly. In thanking the EU for its support to Fiji, Prime Minister Bainimarama also updated Mr Tusk on the progressive steps currently being taken in the lead up to COP23 . He highlighted Fiji's role in showcasing best practices for transformative climate action, which includes helping to build and mobilise a grand coalition for climate action amongst every level of government, the private sector, civil society and ordinary citizens. He also discussed how to design the facilitative dialogue in order to resolve problems and to build and maintain relationships. ""These two pillars will help to showcase best practices for transformative action to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication. This would require holding the rise in the global average temperature to well below 2C and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels,"" the Prime Minister told Mr Tusk. A key area discussed today was the vulnerability of small island developing states to the severe effects of climate change. Pointing to recent climate related events, including Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in the Caribbean and southern United States, the PM urged for greater cooperation amongst nations to address climate change. ""As I have said previously, with climate change we are all in the same boat. To deal with the climate crisis, it is obvious that we need to cooperate, to learn from each other and to do whatever we can with our considerable resources to advance our collective prosperity and wellbeing. If we view this as some sort of negotiation where the goal is to preserve the narrow national interests of each country, we will all be powerless to protect our own people from the consequences of climate change. Instead, it is only through cooperation and collective action that we will be able to achieve our national objectives and preserve the wellbeing of our people. While the PM is in New York leading Fiji's delegation to this year's General Assembly, he will also officiate at several climate-related events as incoming President of COP23 . \"

Bula vinaka! [boo-lah vee-nah-kah, meaning 'warm hello']. It is such an honour to represent the United Kingdom at COP 23 , and I want to thank the Fijian Presidency for its excellent leadership and the people of Germany for their great hospitality. As our Prime Minister highlighted in New York in September, the Paris Agreement is a brilliant example of effective global cooperation. Every country in the world has now signed the Agreement, and I am proud that the UK is part of this. It has never been more important to accelerate our momentum. Recent extreme weather events have devastated the lives of many across the world. I would like to extend my deepest sympathy to all those affected and emphasise that we are taking our commitments under the Paris Agreement very seriously and we are taking action. 1. Firstly, for the UK we launched a Clean Growth Strategy for the UK just last month - a critical set of measures to meet our domestic carbon budgets and help our global CO2 reduction process. 2. I was also proud that the UK recently announced plans to phase out unabated coal fired electricity generation by 2025 our intent to end the sale of conventional petrol and diesel cars by 2040 and to establish our Green Finance Taskforce 3. Earlier today the UK, Canada, and over twenty five other parties committed to forming the Powering Past Coal Alliance - a new alliance committed to phasing out unabated coal from power generation. 4. We have also kept our promises in supporting poorer nations to accelerate the transition to a more resilient and low carbon future and play our role in meeting our collective goal of mobilising $100bn in climate finance per year by 2020. Last year, we showed international leadership by successfully balancing our climate finance across mitigation and adaptation and so far we have mobilised 2.2 billion public and 500 million private finance for climate change purposes in developing countries. This has helped over 34 million people deal with the impacts of climate change. and I am very proud of the over three hundred million pounds of UK funding announcements at this COP on protecting forests, encouraging private sector investment in sustainable infrastructure, and helping countries finance their existing emissions reduction plans. Plus we have recently committed to double our 2017 funding to IPCC and make multi-year pledges to be sure that this important institution can continue to play a crucial role in providing independent, rigorous and balances scientific information on climate change. The UK also continues to be a global leader in protecting oceans and marine life:  We are on track to protect 4 million square kilometres of ocean across Overseas Territories by 2020. We see pre-2020 action as extremely important - on Tuesday we ratified the Kigali amendment to the Montreal Protocol on phasing down HFCs. and I am pleased to say that our Foreign Secretary signed the Doha Amendment yesterday. We are not resting on our laurels. In the New Year we are looking forward to hosting the Commonwealth summit in London which will help to provide a springboard for future collective action We see it as crucial that over the next few years we achieve: Agreement on the rules that underpin the Paris Agreement an increase in ambition as technology and innovation makes the transition a win win for the planet and our economy. but of course the action that really matters is in the real world where businesses and organisations are taking the signals from these negotiations to transform our future There is much we can - and must - achieve together.

Though an alternative has been put forward to make some progress, the developing countries on Monday refused to go for it and insisted to include pre-2020 issues in the agenda of COP23 .It is learnt that the Morocco's foreign minister, Salaheddine Mezouar, who convened informal consultations among countries on the issue for two consecutive days last week, suggested that the countries could alternatively consider including pre-2020 as part of the facilitative dialogue in 2018.Besides, it was also suggested that the countries may consider an annual high level dialogue to take stock of collective progress on pre-2020 implementation from 2018-2020 and opt for an online submission of their pre-2020 actions.Sources said that the consultations on the alternative was still going on and it appeared that the developing countries could agree to it, provided the developed countries accepted for a definite timeline to ratify an existing amendment on second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (KP-II) during its 20th anniversary year.The Protocol, which was adopted in 1997, refer to existing obligations of rich nations to take mitigation (emission cut) actions. Though the developed countries had in Doha in 2012 amended it and agreed to undertake their aggregate emission cuts by at least 18% below the 1990 levels, most of them, including the EU, have, so far, not even ratified the decision. Its ratification is important for global climate action for the years leading up to 2020. So far, only 84 of the total 191 signatories have ratified it.

It is expected that the the Moroccan foreign minister Mezouar, who was the COP22 president, would try to reach at a consensus over the issue on behalf of the Fijian presidency of the COP23 before beginning of the high-level segment on Wednesday.

"COP23","India","COP23_India54","Philippines : PHL at COP23 Renews Strong Call for Climate Justice","November 21, 2017 Tuesday","TendersInfo","The Philippines stands firmly on its call for climate justice as parties to the 23rd Conference of the Parties ( COP23 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) come up with the mechanisms to implement the Paris Agreement. This was expressed by Senator Loren Legarda, Head of the Philippine Delegation to the COP23 in Bonn Germany, as she delivered the Philippine Statement. ""We come to COP23 with a strong call for climate justice: that those who are most vulnerable, who suffer the most from the adverse effects of climate change and who have contributed the least to climate change are empowered and enabled, in terms of capacity and finance, to fight back,"" said Legarda. ""We are tasked here at COP23 to advance the implementation of the Paris Agreement. To this end, we welcome the Talanoa Dialogue and urge completion of work on the residuals of the basic minimums of the Paris Agreement. Loss and damage need to be addressed. And commitments on climate finance must be fulfilled and scaled up,"" she added. The Talanoa Dialogue maintains that inclusivity and transparency should characterize the facilitative dialogue towards providing clarity on means and modalities for implementing the Paris Agreement. Legarda, UNISDR Global Champion for Resilience and UNFCCC Adaptation Champion, said that despite challenges and limited resources, the Philippines is accomplishing what it can to confront the climate crisis and promote sustainable development. ""We ratified and became party to the Paris Agreement. We have mainstreamed climate and geo-tagging into our budget processes. We have set up a People's Survival Fund, which provides over a billion pesos each year for local government and community initiatives to fight climate change. We have enacted a Renewable Energy law and a Green Jobs Act. We are developing policies on carbon pricing and green banking. We intend to impose a tax on coal. And we are greening our hospitals,"" she said. But being a developing nation, the Philippines needs the technical and financial support to pursue more ambitious climate action as indicated in its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC). It is, thus, vital to show serious and effective scaled-up financial delivery under the Convention and Agreement mechanisms, particularly the Green Climate Fund. The Adaptation Fund is also a key instrument for the vulnerable countries. Legarda said that the Philippines is deeply concerned that Loss and Damage has not positively advanced in terms of enhanced action and support of relevant parties, noting that some developed nations have argued that there is no sufficient statistical evidence that extreme weather events such as typhoons are singularly caused by climate change. ""Vulnerable countries will need a robust loss and damage mechanism to answer to those impacts of climate change that cannot anymore be managed through mitigation and adaptation. It is our urgent call that ""climate justice"" be done through the inclusion of the Loss and Damage in the Subsidiary Bodies agenda as well as for the Operating Entities of the Financial Mechanism, with a focus on identifying ways and means for the mobilization of support for actions, at the regional, national and sub-national levels,"" Legarda said. She further stressed that climate finance delivery will help unlock greater adaptation and mitigation ambition while fulfilling core principles under the Convention. ""The window of opportunity on achieving the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal of the Paris Agreement is fast closing and any delay will result in the irreversible,"" Legarda said. ""We have all heard the saying that what is 'difficult is done at once' but that 'the impossible takes a little longer.' But we are running out of time. We have to do both the difficult and the impossible at once. Only then can we truly say that we have fulfilled our obligations to future generations, because only then can we leave a world where life can continue to exist,"" Legarda concluded. \"

The vision is that, by 2030, all Small Island Developing States will have health systems that are resilient to climate change and countries around the world will be reducing their carbon emissions both to protect the most vulnerable from climate risks and deliver large health benefits in carbon-emitting countries. The initiative has 4 main goals. First, to amplify the voices of health leaders in Small Island Developing States, so they have more impact at home and internationally. Second, to gather the evidence to support the business case for investment in climate change and health. Third, to promote policies that improve preparedness and prevention, including ""climate proof"" health systems. Fourth, to triple the levels of international financial support to climate and health in small island developing states.

I'm delighted that we are launching this initiative - in partnership with the WHO and UNFCCC - to better equip small island states like ours with the knowledge, resources and technology to increase the resilience of their health systems, as part of larger efforts to adapt to climate change,"" said Fijian Prime Minister and COP23 President Frank Bainimarama. Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of UN Climate Change, said: Climate change will increasingly impact the health and well-being of people everywhere unless nations fully implement the Paris Agreement. ""Small islands are in the frontline from extreme weather events that can contaminate drinking water to health-hazardous heatwaves and the spread of infectious diseases. This initiative can strengthen the response of small islands to the rising risks as the world works to ensure that together we keep a global temperature rise well below 2 degrees C and better, no higher than 1.5 degrees,"" she said. Small Island Developing States have long been recognized as especially vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. Their situation is highlighted in the UNFCCC, by Ministers of Health at the 2008 World Health Assembly, and in the 2015 Paris Agreement. They have also pioneered innovative approaches to improve the resilience of their health systems to climate change. As well as emitting a small proportion of the greenhouse gases that are driving climate change, many are further reducing their already low carbon emissions. ""Small Island Developing States are ready to take leadership towards green, resilient and health-promoting national development but the support of the international community is essential, said Dr Joy St John, recently appointed Assistant Director-General for Climate and Other Determinants of Health at WHO. ""Less than 1.5% of international finance for climate change adaptation is allocated to projects which ensure that the health of all people is preserved, and only a fraction of this supports small island developing states. The recent severe weather events in the Caribbean demonstrate that targeted interventions are important. We need to do much more and we need to act very quickly."" Country ownership is a central principle of this initiative. Ministers of health from some of the most affected countries have already started to provide input through consultation with WHO's Director-General and at WHO Regional Committee meetings, and this process will continue. Since 2015, WHO has been working with the UNFCCC secretariat to develop detailed country profiles to assess risks, and provide tailored advice on how these countries can adapt to, and mitigate, the health effects of climate change. More than 45 country profiles have already been completed and, as part of this initiative, WHO commits to publishing a country profile for all small island developing states by the end of 2018. Many national health actors, development and United Nations agencies are already making important contributions to protect health in small island developing states. WHOs initiative aims to bring together existing and new efforts and scale them up so they achieve maximum impact. ""The vision is that, by 2030, all health systems in small island developing states will be able to withstand climate variability and change,"" adds Dr St John. ""And, of course, that countries around the world will have substantially reduced carbon emissions."" \"

At the COP23 It will also hold a series of technical sessions, outlining practical approaches based on its broad range of projects in climate change mitigation and adaptation. The EBRD is a major investor in climate finance in many of the 38 emerging economies where it works, a driving force in energy efficiency projects, a pioneer in the development of renewable energy sources and an increasingly important player in adaptation to climate change. Josu Tanaka, EBRD Managing Director, Energy Efficiency and Climate Change, outlined the urgency of achieving the climate action objectives developed by the EBRD and other multilateral development banks in the context of the COP21 Paris meeting. We are taking decisive steps to ensure we meet these objectives, he said. Under its Green Economy Transition (GET) approach, the EBRD aims to dedicate 40 per cent of its annual investment to green finance by 2020 and is well on the way to achieving this objective. Mr Tanaka added that in addition to the EBRDs focus on energy efficiency, renewables and green cities, the Bank was now putting an additional focus on climate adaptation. This years talks with be chaired by Fiji, he noted, a country particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change. The COP23 will bring together over 25,000 environment and climate change specialists, including representatives from governments, observer organisations, multilateral development banks such as the EBRD, and business delegates and media. In Bonn, the EBRD sessions will focus on a number of key climate issues: Achieving the Paris Agreement through a Green Economy Transition: Fiscal risks and opportunities EBRD Green Cities Framework: Accelerating financing for urban action on climate change From early movers to critical mass: How to build a market for climate technologies Measuring climate resilience: Emerging work of financial institutions on metrics for climate resilience and adaptation Bank representatives will also take part in several events focused on driving climate action on finance, research and innovation and legal and institutional developments that support the implementation of the Paris Agreement and the Nationally Determined Contributions. Since 2006, the EBRD has invested over 24 billion in around 1,400 projects leading to reductions in CO2 emission of 87 million tonnes per year. \"

Over the past few months, the European Beyond Coal Campaign launched, the largest-ever climate march in Germany kicked off the beginning of the climate negotiations, and we delivered more than 1.1 million signatures from Americans declaring that they are #StillIn the Paris Agreement. Perhaps the most visible setbacks for coal have been the U.S. passing the halfway mark of retiring its coal plants back in October, and just yesterday, 27 governments joining the Powering Past Coal Alliance to call for an end to coal worldwide. In response, Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune released the following statement: Even in the face of the climate-denying Trump administration, it is the unstoppable power of the people across the United States and the world that has continued to drive progress beyond coal -- from retiring half of the U.S. coal fleet to pushing governments to form the new Powering Past Coal Alliance. Coal and other fossil fuels have no place in our future, and the world will continue to move toward a clean and just energy economy. The Sierra Club is committed to doing our part to drive that progress and ensure this transition to clean energy leaves no one behind until the goal is met. The Sierra Club applauds the government of Fiji for their leadership during these negotiations, and we challenge all governments to continue to step up to meet the ever-growing challenge of tackling the climate crisis. Following a year of devastating hurricanes, wildfires, floods, and storms, its never been more evident that the world needs to make serious and swift strides to curb carbon emissions for the sake of families, communities, and the planet. Now is the time to act. \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India64","COP23: Financing for climate-resilient future takes centre-stage","November 14, 2017 Tuesday","UNI (United News of India)","Bonn, Nov. 14 -- The urgent need to raise the finances to meet the funding goals of the Paris Agreement, especially to support action by developing countries, takes centre-stage at the UN Climate Conference ( COP23 ) in Bonn, Germany. ""We need all financial players - public, private, domestic, international - and including markets and regulators, to work together effectively to mobilise at least $1.5 trillion in climate finance that is needed every year,"" said Eric Usher, Head of Finance Initiative at the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) on Monday. As part of 'Finance for Climate Day' at COP23 , high-level representatives from across the sector highlighted their efforts to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement of keeping the average global temperature rise well below 2 degrees Celsius and as close as possible to 1.5 Celsius. They stressed that every dollar invested in cutting greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate change gets double the bang for the buck because it directly supports the international community's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. According to the UN Climate Change (UNFCCC) Secretariat, finance for climate is flowing at a greater pace than ever, with vibrant and growing markets for renewable energy, electric vehicles, green buildings and climate-smart agriculture seeing aggressive growth, backed by exponential advances in innovative green financial instruments, indices and markets. Equally, the finance sector is recognising to a much greater degree where and how climate change presents risks to its existing investments and the need to adjust their portfolios away from carbon-intensive assets to reduce that risk. However, much more is needed to secure finance and investment at the scale required to deliver a fully de-carbonised and climate-resilient global economy by 2050. ""The potential for climate friendly investment in areas such as clean energy and climate-smart agriculture is enormous,"" said Laura Tuck, Vice-President Sustainable Development at the World Bank. ""The key is to get the funding to flow so that everyone everywhere can benefit from low-carbon and climate resilient investments."" Peter Damgaard Jensen, CEO of the Danish Pension provider PKA and Chair of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) said at a press conference that ""it is extremely important that there is a significant increase of investor awareness and action with regards to supporting the transition [.] to a low carbon economy."" ""Strong investment signals from policy makers across carbon trading, energy, transport and buildings, are essential to unlock the necessary capital,"" he added. Members of African civil society and members of Parliament spoke Monday on the urgency of climate finance as a prerequisite to ambitious action in African countries. ""Africa is the continent that pollutes the least,"" but ""it is Africa which suffers the effect of climate change,"" said at a press conference Roger Nkodo Dang, President of the Pan-African Parliament, which is the legislative body of the African Union. In an interview with UN News, he added that developed countries have a duty to provide additional support to Africans for their green development.

"COP23","India","COP23_India65","Italy : Biomimic Tree - Pushing Agriculture Up the Agenda @COP23","November 7, 2017 Tuesday","TendersInfo","Drawing attention to the impact that climate change is having on rural communities in developing countries, British artist Silas Birtwistle unveiled his Biomimic Tree at the United Nations' Climate Summit (UNFCCC COP23 ) in Bonn, Germany. Sponsored by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), a UN agency that is helping smallholder farmers adapt to and mitigate climate change, the installation uses recycled plastic to depict a tree which only fully comes alive when water runs through it. ""At the bottom of the tree there is a small pump which takes water through a series of clear pipes to fruit and birds, which all gently move, turn, spin and chatter in response,"" said Silas Birtwistle. ""Every five minutes, the pump will activate and the tree will come to life, water will trickle, the birds will sing and the leaves will flutter."" This sculpture highlights the dependence of all living things on a functioning healthy ecosystem. The tree provides food and a home to animals and birds. It also offers shelter from wind and shade from sun, allowing crops to thrive and feed families. Trees also stop topsoil erosion in arid areas and can act as extremely effective carbon sinks. ""The water running through the tree highlights the increasing importance of this critical resource due to climate change,"" said IFAD's Environment and Climate Division Director, Margarita Astralaga. ""When the water is running the tree comes to life, when the water stops the tree comes to a stop, or dies."" She added, ""Right now climate change issues such as water scarcity and erratic weather patterns are adversely affecting smallholder farmers in the developing world. But IFAD-led solutions are empowering them to combat and overcome these issues. "" In its new Strategic Framework IFAD has renewed its commitment to enhancing biodiversity alongside increasing agricultural productivity and lowering greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture while contributing to poverty reduction. ""The sculpture highlights IFAD's restoration efforts which focuses on planting trees on degraded lands to stop soil erosion, form a barrier to desertification and provide shelter to crops,"" added Birtwistle. In the Sahel region of Africa IFAD has already rehabilitated almost 300,000 hectares. For example, in Niger IFAD regenerated 100,000 hectares by protecting land from overgrazing and deforestation and replanting trees. Once barren land now has approximately 50 trees per hectare. In total IFAD's agroforestry and related activities have contributed to the removal of over 58,000 tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. ""We wanted negotiators at UNFCCC COP23 to see for themselves the beauty of sustainable climate resilient agriculture and the crucial role this plays in the wellbeing of rural communities, said Birtwistle. Farmers have to work with nature to create a truly sustainable food secure future, said Astralaga. Working with Silas, exhibiting this amazing Biomimic Tree, we show the very real challenge of climate change and environmental sustainability for smallholder farmers in developing countries.' IFADs investments, including the Adaptation for Smallholder Agriculture Programme (ASAP), help farmers in a variety of ways, from installing weather forecast systems, to introducing new drought resistant crop varieties, as well as setting up farmer field schools where knowledge and new climate smart agriculture techniques can be demonstrated and disseminated. \"

Jay Inslee will depart Washington state next week for an 11-day trip to Switzerland, Germany and Italy. Inslee will depart Nov. 6 for the first leg of his trip a four-day study mission to Switzerland to learn more about the countrys highly-successful apprenticeship system. The Swiss model is considered to be the gold standard for apprenticeship and contributes to the countrys consistently low rate of youth unemployment. Approximately 45 delegates are participating in the study mission, representing some of Washingtons most innovative and successful businesses and philanthropic, academic and government organizations. Inslee first announced the study mission at the launch of his Career Connect Washington initiative earlier this year. More than 740,000 job openings are expected in Washington state in the next five years and most will require some sort of postsecondary degree, certificate or credential. Inslee sees apprenticeships as an enormous opportunity to help high school students find a pathway to these good-paying jobs while also providing employers a flexible, well-trained workforce. Beyond the traditional apprenticeship programs many associate with construction trades, Washington state is home to a growing number of innovative programs such as the registered aerospace youth apprenticeship program in Tacoma and a tech apprenticeship program in Seattle. Inslees vision is to create a cohesive system that gives students opportunities to train for jobs in industries such as health care, advanced manufacturing and IT. The study mission was developed with the support of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, Washington STEM, and former United States Ambassador to Switzerland and Liechtenstein Suzi LeVine and her husband, Eric LeVine. The delegation will hear from international experts, students and parents, and visit several companies and organizations to learn about their much sought-after apprenticeship programs. Inslee will then travel to Bonn, Germany for COP 23 , the annual United Nations climate change conference . Inslee, who earlier this year joined California Gov. Jerry Brown and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in launching the U.S. Climate Alliance, is attending COP 23 at the invitation of Fiji Prime Minister Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama, president of this years COP. Bainimarama extended the invitation to Alliance states in June. Inslee will attend meetings in Bonn from Nov. 11-14. The Alliance as well as the Pacific Coast Collaborative are hosting panel discussions, and the governor will be part of several events highlighting the importance of subnational leadership on climate and ocean acidification and states roles in fulfilling U.S. commitments to the Paris climate agreement.

The ""Powering Past Coal"" alliance was initiated by the UK, Canada and Marshall Islands and joined by Denmark, Finland, Italy, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Belgium, Switzerland, New Zealand, Ethiopia and Mexico. Major coal users like China, the US, Russia, and Germany have not joined. However, another big user of coal, India initiated the International Solar Alliance in 2015, of which China is also a part. This announcement comes days after an event organised by the USA government to promote fossil fuels was disrupted by anti-coal protesters staging a walkout. As the alliance was initiated by two close allies of USA, Canada and UK, it intends to rebuke President Trump, that his obsession with dirty coal will not spread, Mohamed Adow, international climate lead at Christian Aid, was quoted as saying by Reuters. Delegates from the US have argued that coal would be used for some time to come and the way to go was to explore clean coal, which includes a system of technologies to clean up the emissions from coal, including Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), and the potential of small nuclear plants. The arguments were supported with reports published by energy think tanks, including the International Energy Agency (IEA).

In this blog, Damian Ryan, Director, Strategy & Impact, The Climate Group, looks at the key issues that will be addressed, as well as the expected challenges and opportunities. Two years on from the adoption of the historic Paris Climate Agreement, the COP23 meeting is an important waypoint in developing the rules to govern the agreement, as well beginning the process to raise climate action ambition before 2020. A COP OF FIRSTS The conference will be characterized by a number of firsts. It will be first to be hosted by a small island developing state in this case Fiji and the first COP for the Trump administration. Fijis Presidency will ensure a focus on key issues important for small, vulnerable countries, such as Loss & Damage and means-of-implementation (finance, capacity building etc). The role of the US will be a major talking point for many, but it remains unclear what disruption if any the new administration will have on the proceedings. A large, pro-climate US observer contingent, comprising state, city and business leaders is expected to act as a powerful counterbalance to the views of Trump officials at COP. THE PARIS RULEBOOK Following the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015, the focus of negotiators shifted to a large program of work generated by various articles and requests in the agreement and supporting COP decision. The purpose of this work program is to ensure the effective implementation of the agreement, not least by laying down the rules that govern key aspects of the deal such as guidance on Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), reporting, finance etc. This work on the Paris Rulebook, which began in earnest at COP22 in Marrakech, has been divided between the different bodies and committees of the UNFCCC, including the Ad-hoc Working Group on the Paris Agreement (the APA), which has overall responsibility for the work program. The Paris Agreement calls for the completion of this work program by the time of the first conference of the agreement (known as the CMA), which was expected to be in 2020. However, the rapid entry-into-force of the Paris deal in November 2016 meant that the first CMA was opened in Marrakech. Rather than close CMA1 in Morocco, negotiators chose instead to suspend the meeting and continue it in a second session in Bonn. CMA1 is expected to continue under this arrangement until negotiators have completed their post-Paris work program. Parties are currently aiming to do this by COP24 in 2018. \"

Cut to 2017. The number of participants attending climate talks underway at Bonn has halved to just over 19,000, including 6,176 representing UN bodies, specialised agencies, and intergovernmental (IGOs) and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). The number of delegates representing UN bodies, specialised agencies, and IGOs and NGOs were 6,458 at COP 22 in Marrakech and 9,411 at COP21 in Paris. According to the UNFCCC's provisional list, the strength of US delegation for COP23 has also dwindled to just 48. It is a huge dip from 124 in 2015. Ahead of Bonn climate talks, there were speculations about the US role in negotiations, with the country itself giving an indication that it would work towards ""securing its economic interests"". Its neighbour, Canada, has also scaled down the number of delegates from 225 during COP21 to 161 this year. Not surprisingly, the largest party delegations have come from Africa, with the top 5 highest participation coming from African countries: Cote d'Ivoire (492), Guinea (355), Democratic Republic of Congo (340), Congo (308) and Morocco (253). Germany, which had sent 114 delegates to COP21, has the highest representation from Europe this year with 230 participants. While France (177), Poland (77) and the European Union (76) have sent sizeable delegations, the number of UK delegates has dropped from 96 in 2015 to just 45 this year. Scaling down of delegation strength is visible among some of the members of BRICS grouping. Brazil (128), China (82) and Russia (71) have seen sharp reduction in delegation strength as compared to COP21 when their delegation size was 319, 326 and 315 respectively.

According to an European Parliament press release here yesterday, the Environment Committee agreed yesterday on a series of recommendations to EU institutions and countries ahead of the COP23 meeting next November in Bonn. They call on EU leaders to implement the agreement with EU legislation and ratchet up the EU's goals and policy instruments. As all UNFCCC parties have to communicate their long-term targets by 2020, MEPs also call on the Commission to prepare by 2018 a mid-century zero emissions strategy for the EU, with the aim of keeping the temperature rise well below 2degC and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature rise to 1,5degC. The process should begin as soon as possible, they say. MEPs express their disappointment at US President Trump's announcement of his intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. ""This decision represents a step backwards"", they noted, but they welcome the strong responses from governments around the world in favour of the full implementation of the Paris Agreement. MEPs are calling for concrete EU and international commitments to deliver additional financing sources. Lending and investment practices should be in line with the well below 2degC target, including divesting from fossil fuels and phasing out export credits (i. e. financial incentives) for fossil fuel investments, they say. MEPs welcome the development of emissions trading systems globally, as 18 of them are in operation across four continents. They encourage the Commission to promote links between the EU ETS and other carbon markets, so as to increase climate ambition and at the same time help to reduce the risk of carbon leakage. The goal of the Bonn Conference is to achieve ""clarity on the design of the 2018 Facilitative Dialogue"", which will aim to take stock of governments' efforts towards the long-term goal, MEPs say. A Parliament delegation will attend the conference. The draft resolution was adopted with 54 votes in favour, none against and 6 abstentions. It will be put to a vote by the full House during the 2-5 October plenary session in Strasbourg. The European Parliament is currently working on three pieces of legislation implementing the Paris Agreement: the post-2020 carbon market (EU ETS) reform (rapporteur Julie Girling), the 2030 targets effort-sharing regulation (rapporteur Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy) and the regulation on greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land-use, land-use change and forestry (rapporteur Norbert Lins), the European Parliament press release said.

"COP23","India","COP23_India74","South Africa : Deputy Minister Mrs Barbara Thomson: Welcomes delegates to the UNFCCC Cop23 at South Africa pavillion","November 14, 2017 Tuesday","TendersInfo","I would like to extend a warm and hearty welcome to all of you to the South African Pavillion and to Fiji COP23 . Tonight we celebrate the partnership between government, business and civil society in working towards the development of a low carbon and climate resilient, future for our country. As we begin the second, and most important week, of the international climate change talks here in Bonn, it is crucial that South Africa, as a member of the Africa Group, BASIC, the G77 and as a developing nation, we able to achieve the goals we have set ourselves. Some of these are ambitious, while others are contentious. The Paris Agreement is not just about climate, it is about social and developmental issues and ensuring that by the end of COP23 there is at least a draft text in place in preparation for COP24 in Poland next year 2018, in which developed nations commit to further reducing their emission gaps in the pre-2020 period, and the developing world is able to access the much-needed finance to assist with adaptation to, and mitigation of, climate change in other words, the implementation of our Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). An overriding political objective of the Bonn Climate Conference is to sustain the momentum behind the multilateral approach to addressing Climate Change with the United Nations at the forefront, given that Climate Change is a global challenge that requires that no one be left behind. Adaptation is key in delivering basic developmental objectives. South Africas Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emission reduction system framework is being implemented. Phase Two will be finalised for implementation in the post-2020 period. The National Treasury is working on the finalisation of the Carbon Tax Legislation and the carbon offset regulations, which will also contribute to South Africas GreenHouse Gas Emission reduction outcome. With regards to the Energy front, Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (REIPPPP) have been successful in contributing to the countrys emission reduction, and with the countrys significant solar and wind resources will continue to grow Renewable Energy in the energy mix. In the past five years, the Industrial Energy Efficiency Project (IEE Project) has assisted industry to achieve energy savings worth over R1.54 billion. Phase 1 of the SA IEE Project has contributed to a reduction of Carbon emissions. These reductions were achieved across industrial sectors. This Programme has also trained 2600 more energy efficiency practitioners. In conclusion, I would like to express the hope of the Government, and all of you present here this evening that the Bonn Climate Talks are successful and that COP23 will lay the groundwork for a successful international climate change implementation phase to be finalised in Poland in 2018. \"

Morocco's participation in the annual UN climate conference back up the tangible results achieved during Moroccos presidency of the COP22, she told MAP, adding that Morocco acted as the mouthpiece of Africa in climate negotiations at this conference. This participation is part of the guideline set out by the COP22, which is centred on the African role and the African identity', El Ouafi pointed out, noting that at the initiative of HM King Mohammed VI, three important committees were set up: one for the Sahel region, a second for the island states and a third one for the region of the Congo Basin. ""Morocco has an offer, a project and advocacy skills that will strengthen this dynamic,"" she added. ""Today there is no time to lose. We must prepare for the post-2020 period and have plans based on nationally determined contributions for African countries,"" she noted. At the Bonn Conference, El Ouafi said that countries will seek to advance efforts to operationalize the Paris Agreement in terms of fund-raising, capacity-building and support, particularly for vulnerable and developing countries. The Paris Agreement, which was adopted by the 196 Parties to the UNFCCC in December 2015 in the French capital after which it is named, calls on countries to combat climate change by limiting the rise of global temperature below 2 degrees Celsius and strive not to exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius. A year ago, the Marrakech Climate Conference concluded with the Marrakech Action Proclamation, for our climate and sustainable development, in which the UNFCCC States Parties affirmed their commitment to the full implementation of the Paris Agreement. Today, 169 Parties have ratified the Agreement. \"

As Special Envoy, Governor Brown will work intimately with the Fijian Presidency of COP23 to rally sub-national governments to align their policies and programs with the objectives of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The ceremony was also attended by the governors of Oregon, Kate Brown, and Washington State, Jay Inslee, and Leader of the California State Senate, Kevin de Len, along with other senior state officials and representatives from the private sector. The Prime Minister pointed to Governor Browns long track record of advocacy on climate change as the basis for his decision to appoint the Governor as Special Envoy. ""When I thought about the one leader I needed to help mobilise the states and regions as a critical pillar of our Grand Coalition, the choice was obvious. That is why I am particularly pleased to announce that I am today appointing Governor Brown as Special Envoy for States and Regions for the COP23 Presidency. In this role, I will lean on Governor Brown to continue the great leadership he has demonstrated time and time again, and to mobilise a strong contingent of like-minded leaders from around the world -- to show the world that we mean business, he said. At the ceremony, the Prime Minister also signed the Under 2 Coalition Memorandum of Understanding, a commitment by sub-national governments to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions towards net-zero by 2050. Fiji has joined 175 jurisdictions representing 35 countries as part of the coalition, which seeks commitments from all signatories to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 80-95 per cent compared to 1990 levels by 2050. The Prime Minister described the ceremony as a big step forward for the United States, given the disappointing decision by the US President to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. ""If there is one thing we have all learned over the last two weeks, for every action -- there is a reaction. And, my friends, the leadership represented in this room, and people of all walks of life from across America, have spoken very loudly -- telling the world that America will continue to tackle climate change, continue the clean energy revolution, continue to create jobs and grow its economy so that it can thrive in the 21st Century, he said. \"

A climate expert told IANS that this a first-of-its-kind attempt to phase out the traditional coal power on such a massive scale after the 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement that aims to keep global warming within 1.5 degrees Celsius by cutting greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels. Phasing out coal is a necessary first step for many climate action strategies, including the decarbonisation of transportation and the electrification of industrial activities, which will depend on access to growing amounts of electricity generated from non-emitting renewable sources, the expert said. ""The energy transition we need to meet the ambition of the Paris Agreement is already underway, but we need to move with greater speed and scale. Moving away from coal, the most polluting of traditional energy sources, has to be a priority in the energy plans of those who have joined the Paris Agreement,"" Rachel Kyte, CEO of advocacy group Sustainable Energy for All, said. ""In this way we can achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on time."" With 40 per cent of the world's electricity still generated from coal, phasing this out is one of the most important steps countries can take to meet their Paris Agreement commitments. The partners in the Powering Past Coal Alliance are working together to accelerate clean growth and climate protection through the rapid phase-out of traditional coal power, the Canadian government said in a statement. United Nations Climate Change conference . ""Coal is literally choking our cities, with close to a million people dying every year from coal pollution. I'm thrilled to see so much global momentum for the transition to clean energy and this is only the beginning,"" an official statement quoted Canadian Minister of Environment and Climate Change Catherine McKenna as saying. Describing the global alliance as an important step toward building a coal-free future, Manuel Pulgar Vidal, leader of WWF's global climate and energy programme, said: ""Phasing out coal is as much about stronger climate action as it is about ushering in better public health and well-being for the people."" British charity Christian Aid's International Climate Lead Mohamed Adow said: ""It is powerful to see not just rich countries such as the UK and Canada but also Angola, Chile and Mexico making the promise that coal has no future in their countries."" Saying this global alliance a rebuke to US President Donald Trump, he said: ""People were worried that this summit would see Trump assaulting the Paris Agreement with his coal lobbyists."" ""But his actions have actually galvanised other nations into action, with a new alliance making it clear that coal's climate change threat must be taken seriously,"" he added. Meanwhile, anti-coal demonstrators are protesting at the UN Climate Change conference venue and at a nearby mining site, asking Merkel to ""stop dirty mining in Germany"". ""The biggest coal mine in Europe is located just outside Bonn, visible from the UN tower. Germany could shut down the lignite mine immediately as much of the coal electricity gets exported and storage is still hardly used,"" a leaflet said. A giant black mark on Germany's environmental record is scarred on the land an hour's drive from the venue of the Bonn talks, The Guardian said. Stretching across 85 sq km and around 370 metres deep, the opencast coalmine near Hambach forest is the biggest hole in Europe and one of the biggest single sources of carbon on the continent.

The non-federal players, led by California governor Jerry Brown and former mayor of New York city Michael Bloomberg, have even set up an exhibition space - US Climate Action Pavilion - showing what all the states (mostly those under democrats) and cities have been doing to fight the challenge of climate change despite Trump's decision to move away from the Paris pledges. Brown and Bloomberg on Saturday released America's Pledge report at the Pavilion amid 'We Are Still In' slogans by supporters of the Paris Agreement. Its focus is to flag how the US is taking climate action without Trump.Though the COP (Conference of Parties) under the UNFCCC has a history of side-events by NGOs, industries and other stakeholders at earmarked space at the venue, it had never been in sync with political divide of any country - the way it is visible here in the case of the US.Interestingly, the US Climate Action Pavilion - sponsored by non-federal leaders - has come up at the venue as a distinct landmark of the COP23 as it is neither in the Bula Zone (space for delegation office, media and meeting rooms) nor in the Bonn Zone (countries' pavilions and exhibition space for industries and NGOs). It lies somewhere in between the two zones right at the venue with ""We Are Still In"" written all over. The America's pledge report carries details of actions taken by cities, states and businesses representing more than half the US economy and population. It claims that if these ""non-federal actors were a country, their economy would be the third largest in the world, bigger than all but two national parties (US and China) to the Paris Agreement"".The report finds that a total of 20 US states, 110 US cities, and over 1,400 businesses with US operations representing $25 trillion in market capitalization and nearly one gigatons of GHG emissions per year have adopted quantified emissions reduction targets. The most ambitious of these targets, such as those adopted by California, mirror the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) of national governments.""The group of American cities, states, and businesses who remain committed to the Paris Agreement represents a bigger economy than any nation outside the US and China,"" said Bloomberg who is also the UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change.He said, ""Together they are helping deliver on the promise of the agreement and ensuring the US remains a global leader in the fight against climate change. In Paris, the US pledged to measure and report our progress reducing emissions alongside every other nation. Through America's Pledge, we're doing just that, and we're going to continue to uphold our end of the deal, with or without Washington.""The report was released at an event featuring UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa, President of COP23 Prime Minister Bainimarama of Fiji and a number US democrat senators. ""California strongly supports the United Nations' unstoppable move to decarbonize the world economy,"" said Jerry Brown who is also the COP23 Special Advisor for States and Regions. He said, ""We join with states and cities across America-and around the world-that will continue aggressive and creative action to curb greenhouse gas emissions.""The America's Pledge report examines current and potential future opportunities for non-federal actors in the US to strengthen their role in meeting the American commitment under the Paris Agreement to reduce emissions by 26-28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.

The agenda, heralded by developing countries, especially the Like-Minded Group of Countries (LMGC)-of which India and China are members-aims to bring clarity to what has been done vis-a-vis commitments made for the period running up to 2020 when the Paris Agreement becomes operational and guides future actions. Over the past two weeks, negotiators of member states have been holding consultations on how to approach pre-2020 actions in the three remaining years before the Paris Agreement becomes implementable. Developing countries have pointed to the emissions and adaptation gaps that persist to underline the failures of developed countries in meeting their commitments towards climate action and mobilising finance as per the Cancun pledges, the Kyoto Protocol and its Doha Amendment. Although the amendment is yet to be ratified, and requires 60 more national ratifications, the agenda document has urged the President of the current COP, Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama of Fiji and UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinoza to persuade parties of the Kyoto Protocol and the Doha Amendment to submit their instruments of ratification. Interestingly, no date for the same has been mentioned contrary to an earlier press conference by LMDC nations where a deadline of May-June 2018 was floated. While the escalation of the Pre-2020 agenda at COP23 was objected to initially by the developed nations, over the past week, negotiators from developing nations pushing for inclusions have managed to overturn the objections and achieve consensus on the matter. Decisions taken Parties have now decided to take stock of what has been achieved and implementations of actions during COP24 in Poland in December 2018. The submissions in the 'stocktake' would include details of the mitigation actions that have been taken in the pre-2020 period, the provision of support of developing and vulnerable countries during the period, and summaries for policymakers (providing policy options and recommendations to accelerate action) that have come as a result of the Marrakesh Partnership for Global Climate Action initiated during COP22 in Marrakesh last year to mobilise immediate climate action. It has also been decided that during COP25 in 2019, further submissions, including the inputs of all meetings that have been held on the matter till then, outcomes of 2018 ministerial dialogues on finance, the 'stocktake' from 2018 and the outcomes of the Marrakesh Partnership for Global Climate Action. The decision document opens with recognition of $100 billion committed annually by developed nations towards climate action in the developing world.

"COP23","India","COP23_India83","WCA's Engagement at COP23 in Bonn, Germany","November 6, 2017 Monday 6:30 AM EST","Contify Energy News","Nov. 6 -- The World coal Association (WCA) has been involved in international climate discussions since their inception more than two decades ago. As the WCA prepares to attend another important meeting - the 23rd Conference of the Parties ( COP23 ) - we look at priorities for the event in Bonn and how the conference plans to engage with the 24 countries that have included low emissions coal technologies in their climate pledges. More than 20,000 people are expected at this year's COP, which starts today. Some people ask why the WCA attends climate talks. WCA believes that for many countries that use coal, especially in emerging Asia, the only realistic pathway is to make sure that they use the most modern coal technologies available today, with enhanced ambition on CCS. Many countries have identified high efficiency low emissions (HELE) technologies as part of their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) as part of the Paris Agreement. Developing and emerging economies have to meet their energy needs, tackle energy poverty, and reduce emissions. They cannot do all three things without utilising all low emission technologies. China is a remarkable example of the role that affordable coal can play in improving access to energy and supporting economic development. Over the last three decades, according to the World Bank, China has achieved universal access to electricity - 600 million people have been lifted out of poverty and connected to the electricity grid. The link between access to affordable power from coal, economic growth and prosperity is clear. China is also working towards having the world's cleanest coal power system by 2020 by utilising advanced cleaner coal technologies. Another example is India which has made significant deployments of solar power but continues to rely on coal for baseload electricity. The 24 countries that have included HELE in their agreements don't want to sacrifice economic development or their climate obligations. They want to achieve both. Energy security and climate objectives are competing, but integrated priorities. WCA will also be supporting greater action on CCS as well as policy parity with other low emission technologies. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has made it clear that it is almost impossible, and far more expensive, to reach the below 2 degrees target without significantly scaling up CCS technologies worldwide. WCA would like to see practical solutions to reduce global emissions. Solutions that recognise countries' individual circumstances. Developing economies should be heard at these talks. They are at a point where economic growth is imperative, alongside climate objectives. They need a solution that enables them to achieve both. A solution the WCA believes lies in technology. So at the Bonn talks, WCA will continue to call for policy parity for all low-emissions technologies and also ask for technology neutrality in the Paris Agreement's 'rulebook'. Countries must also be supported in implementing all aspects of their Paris Agreement commitments, including those relating to low emissions coal technologies. This is the only practical approach to reaching our common climate goals. Source: World Coal Association \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India84","UN Climate Change Conference COP23: Slowly Moving Into the Right Direction","November 24, 2017 Friday 6:30 AM EST","Contify Energy News","Nov. 24 -- This year's climate change conference was full of good intentions on how communities, organizations and businesses are aligning their efforts to reduce temperature increase. However, while COP23 delegates from all over the world just finalized their discussions on the framework of how to achieve the Paris Agreement targets, the goals become more challenging to reach. In its study ""Climate Change: Closing the COP21 Gap by Going Solar"" REC Group, the leading European brand of solar panels, already highlighted right after the Paris Agreement, how solar can be a key pillar in mitigating emissions and supporting in abating climate change. However, there is a shortfall between the emissions gap to limit temperature increase to below 2C. To be on track by 2025 to close the emissions gap of the 1.5C target and avoid further accelerating climate change impacts, the potential solar capacity ramp-up has to be up to 4,800 gigawatts (GW) larger than industry analysts have been forecasting before the Paris Agreement. To put this in perspective: by end of 2016, 303 GW of solar PV capacity has been installed globally. As one of the first organizations, REC demonstrated in its study how huge exactly the capacity ramp ups need to be on a global scale, and detailed views at the US, India, Japan, Germany, The Netherlands and Belgium. It is clear that postponing installations will require an even greater total capacity by 2025. These key outlooks are still valid and have meanwhile been supported by further studies from different respected research organizations:  If the emissions gap is not closed by 2030, it is extremely unlikely that the goal of holding global warming to well below 2C can still be reached: The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) has recently published a report about the emissions gap. Avoiding building new coal-fired power plants and phasing out existing ones is crucial to closing the emissions gap. The solar energy sector has an annual emission reduction potential of 3 to 6 Gt of CO2 equivalents in 2030. Solar power capacity can reach 3,725 GW in 2030. This potential would require a growth of the installed solar PV capacity of 14 to 20% per year.  Closing the emissions gap will require a sharp ramp up of investment into lower- and zero-carbon sources: As outlined by Bloomberg New Energy Finance and CERES, forecasted investment into renewable energy power generation will increase by 75% compared to a Business As Usual (BAU) scenario over the next 25 years. This represents a Capex of USD 12.1 trillion (USD 484 billion on average annually). REC's calculated capacity ramp-up of solar PV will require an annual investment of up to USD 157 billion in 2025. The global annual fossil fuel subsidies of around USD 500 billion are much higher. Universal Ecological Fund is claiming in a recent analysis that climate change will cost the US around USD 360 billion per year.  Solar PV technology is the key pillar in transforming global energy: Considering higher future electrification rates which are also part of climate policy strategy and REC's forecast for the 1.5C target, this will result in around 20% of solar's share in the global electricity mix. This seems to be in line with a recent study by Energy Watch Group, presented during COP23 , in which a transition to 100% renewable energy is feasible as early as 2050. In this scenario, solar PV will make up 69% of the global energy mix standing out as the most important energy technology. REC's calculations on required capacities can be seen as a further step in planning a global power transition and implementing country specific targets and mechanisms. Many countries have started moving into the right direction and have already created success stories for renewable energy. The international community, however, still has a long way to go.

A CSE team had been stationed in Bonn through the duration of the conference to follow the negotiations. ""The US' rogue and obstructionist attitude in the COP process ensured that progress was extremely slow and hampered on several occasions and the old divide between developed and developing nations remained,"" says the CSE analysis. Ahead of the COP, the US had signalled that it would engage in the negotiations process to secure its interests and had talked of a possible re-negotiation of the Paris Agreement to enable it to rejoin the Agreement. As per the provisions of the Paris Agreement, the US withdrawal will only take effect in late 2020. ""Instead of working together and standing united against the US intransigence, the old bickering between developed and developing nations continued at Bonn,"" remarked Chandra Bhushan, deputy director general, CSE. ""This meant that the US continued with its business-as-usual obstructionist agenda in the negotiations and hampered meaningful progress on equity and finance issues across a range of agenda items including stocktake, accounting, enhanced transparency framework, adaptation, technology transfer,"" he added. ""The US announcement is only a political decision with no legal bearing on the Paris Agreement and Paris Agreement has almost no legal options to contain the US. Ideally, the US, having made its anti-climate agenda clear,should not have been allowed under any circumstances to determine the course of negotiations.

The new long-term EIB loan to support investment by the Water Authority of Fiji signed at COP 23 earlier today represents the EIB's largest ever loan in the Pacific and largest ever support for water investment in a small island state by the world's largest water financier. The European Investment Bank, the European Union's long-term lending institution, will provide USD 75 million for a new USD 405 million investment programme by the Water Authority of Fiji. The scheme will strengthen resilience of water distribution and wastewater treatment following Cyclone Winston, the world's second strongest storm ever recorded, that hit Fiji in February 2016. In the presence of Prime Minister Bainimarama, and climate leaders from around the world, the 20 year EIB loan was formally signed at the EIB Pavilion at COP23 by the Hon. Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, Attorney-General and Minister for Economy, Public Enterprises, Civil Service and Communications of the Republic of Fiji and Ambroise Fayolle, Vice President of the European Investment Bank responsible for development and lending operations in the Pacific. ""This welcome financing will be used with funding from the Green Climate Fund, the Asian Development Bank and the Fijian Government. A great many people in Fiji will benefit from this project, which will cost a total of approximately USD 400 million, and I am grateful to the EIB for its support and its foresight. Financing of projects to build resiliency in developing countries is critical, and I sincerely hope that this project can serve as a model for other developing countries that wish to access blended financing on behalf of their own people,"" said Frank Bainimarama Prime Minister of Fiji and President of COP23 . The scheme includes construction of a new water-treatment plant and upgrading existing wastewater treatment facilities, as well as improving and expanding water networks. Once complete, the scheme is expected to support a number of sustainable development goals including health, economic development and sustainable urban growth. The new water investment is also financed by the Government of Fiji, Asian Development Bank and Green Climate Fund. It follows extensive due diligence by the Asian Development Bank and represents the first EIB co-financing with the Green Climate Fund. Ahead of the signing ceremony the EIB hosted a workshop to outline practical experience gained from three water projects around the world to enhance climate resilience. Priyaraj Lakmal Munasinghe, CEO of the Water Authority of Fiji and representatives of the Lilongwe Water Board in Malawi and the EUR 5 billion Emscher River renovation project highlighted key issues to consider and discussed how to overcome practical challenges with climate experts at COP 23 .

"COP23","India","COP23_India87","Bonn: UN climate conference set to recognize the role of women in climate action","November 13, 2017 Monday 6:30 AM EST","IBNS","New York, Nov 13(Just Earth News): With the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 23 ), in Bonn, Germany, entering its final week of negotiations, the Fiji Presidency on Monday announced an agreement on a Gender Action Plan, highlighting the role of women in climate action. At a press conference, President of COP 23 and Prime Minister of Fiji, Frank Bainimarama, announced that the Parties had finalized the plan, which still has to be adopted. This recognizes the role of women in climate action, he said. It is about integration of gender into all the work around climate policy both nationally and internationally, added Nazhat Shameen Khan, the Chief Negotiator for the COP 23 Presidency. Heads of State and Government, Ministers, and UN Secretary-General Antnio Guterres will be attending the high-level segment of COP 23 , on 15-16 November. New national and corporate climate action on forests Also Sunday, countries and corporations announced new initiatives to cut emissions from forest use and establish sustainable forestry management programmes. The efforts include an Ecuadorean initiative to reduce 15 million tons of CO2 emissions in the forest sector; a commitment to deforestation-free commodities by Walmart; Mars Inc.s new policy to reduce their carbon footprint 27 per cent by 2025 and 67 per cent by 2050 through addressing deforestation throughout their corporate value chain; and Gabons National Park Service efforts to combat illegal logging. The forests have this incredible ability to store carbon and we have underinvested in that, said Inger Andersen, Director-General of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), at a press conference. Protecting and restoring the forests is absolutely key to achieving the Paris Agreement [as well as] the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Hundreds of companies commit to climate action Also on Monday in Boon, the industry sector said that it is set to deliver much of the emissions reductions needed to achieve the Paris Agreement goal but added that closer national and international policy and implementation strategy partnerships together with governments will help business take further, faster action. Industry is taking action on climate change like no other period in history, said Peter Bakker, President and CEO of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD, a global, business leaders-led organization of over 200 leading businesses working on sustainable development). The transition to the low-carbon economy is inevitable, and business will continue to implement the solutions necessary for fulfilling the Paris Agreement, he added. Since 2015, over 600 companies with combined revenues of more than $15 trillion have made over 1,000 commitments to climate action through We Mean Business, a global non-profit coalition. Many are going 100 percent renewable, are implementing science-based targets and are collaborating across sectors through the Low Carbon Technology Partnership initiative (LCTPi). Local, regional leaders sign Commitment for faster climate action Local and regional leaders from around the world signed the Bonn-Fiji Commitment Sunday, pledging action to deliver on the Paris Agreement. Cities are responsible for as much as 70 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels used for energy and transport, and with more than half the global population living in urban centres and this figure expected to approach two-thirds by 2050, the Bonn-Fiji Commitment pushes efforts to advance sustainable urban development. The Commitment encompasses 19 initiatives, including The European Covenant of Mayors and Compact of Mayors joining forces to create the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy the largest coalition of over 7,400 cities from six continents and 121 countries to reduce emissions and make societies and economies resilient to climate change. Similarly, the UN World Health Organization (WHO), in collaboration with the UN Climate Change secretariat (UNFCCC) and in partnership with the Fijian Presidency launched an initiative to protect people living in small island developing States from the health impacts of climate change. The vision is that, by 2030, all small island developing States will have health systems that are resilient to climate change.

The call comes at an official UN side event in Bonn co-organised by the European Investment Bank (EIB), the Development Bank of Latin America (CAF) and I4CE - Institute for Climate Economics (Secretariat of the Initiative). Representatives of the institutions supporting the initiative also called on business and industry to join them in implementing the 5 Voluntary Principles for Mainstreaming Climate Action. These principles, agreed at COP21 in Paris by around 20 public and private financial institutions are: Principle 1: COMMIT to Climate Strategies Principle 2: MANAGE Climate Risks Principle 3: PROMOTE Climate Smart Objectives Principle 5: ACCOUNT for your Climate Action The Paris Agreement has set a significant challenge for governments and the financial community: aligning all financial flows with a below 2degC-coherent economy and society. The Climate Action in Financial Institutions initiative has significant potential to support this commitment and develop and share practice to the benefit of the entire financial community to help implement the Paris Agreement. 31 Institutions are now part of the Initiative and today they announced the launch of a new online and publically accessible Climate Mainstreaming Practices Database, shared the progress made by the initiative, and specifically how it can support the implementation of the Paris Agreement in the financial sector.

"COP23","India","COP23_India89","Technology push at COP 23: platform to promote low carbon fuels launched","November 14, 2017 Tuesday","Down To Earth","India, Nov. 14 -- The new technology industrial revolution will provide a major boost to speed up climate action but only if business commits to it and governments back it with stable policy and new incentives, delegates at the COP23 Innovation Day said on November 14. In an example that embodies all these essential components of successful innovation, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) today launched below50 initiative hubs in North America, South America and Australia to create much bigger demand and markets for sustainable fuels. Getting ideas into action is a major theme of this Global Climate Action day where representatives from business, government and civil society are delving into technological and policy innovation and new ways of collaborating to get the world on track to achieve the goals of the 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement. ""Faced with the growing problem of climate change, the instinct of companies is not to be passive but to take action and find solutions. Global climate policy must provide the framework necessary to encourage the private sector to increase investment and spur innovation to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement,"" said John Danilovich, Secretary General of the International Chamber of Commerce. The central goal of the Paris Agreement is to keep the average global temperature rise well below 2 degrees Celsius and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees. About one degree of that rise has already happened, underlining the urgency to progress much further and faster with the global clean energy transformation. Meeting the Paris goal is also inextricably linked to the success of the 2030 Agenda's 17 Sustainable Development Goals, in this case particularly Goal 9-to build resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialisation and foster innovation. Launching below50 The below50 initiative is a global collaboration that brings together the entire value-chain for sustainable fuels - that is, fuels that produce at least 50% less CO2 emissions than conventional fossil fuels. The goal is to create the demand and market for these fuels to scale up deployment. The below50 hubs allow companies to engage with the below50 global campaign at the local level. Each hub works on solutions tailored for their regions - including local policy, awareness raising and financing. Every hub is led by a below50 partner and welcomes companies with an interest in the regional low-carbon fuel market. Transport accounts for nearly 18% of all emissions worldwide, and over 90% of the sector is still dependent on carbon intensive fossil-fuels. To date, only 3% of transport fuels are low-carbon. According to the International Energy Agency, if we are to satisfy economic growth and limit global warming to below 2degC, 10% of all transport fuels must be low carbon by 2030 and 30% by 2050. ""We are standing at the cusp of a new industrial revolution. Forward-looking businesses are exceeding their climate targets by using innovation to help them reduce their carbon footprint. This is happening now as carbon smart technologies are disrupting the fuels and chemicals supply chain, and initiatives like below50 are turning this approach into a global movement,"" said Freya Burton, Chief Sustainability and People Officer at LanzaTech. This kind of innovation, partnership and united drive towards low-carbon must be replicated across the globe. ""We need innovation across policies, technologies and methods of collaboration,"" said Rasmus Valanko, Director of Climate and Energy at WBCSD. ""We're not going to solve the climate challenge with existing technology only. We need to invest in the technologies and the partnerships we'll need when decarbonization gets even harder."" Moving towards low-carbon requires identifying clearly which policies work and where they can be replicated in other parts of the globe. For example, through below50, WBCSD is working with the Brazilian government to adopt low-carbon fuel policies from California. The idea is to create systems that reward and encourage sustainable investment. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Down to Earth.

"COP23","India","COP23_India91","Austria : IAEA-led COP23 Event Zooms in on Country Examples for How Nuclear Power Can Contribute to Climate Change Mitigation","November 18, 2017 Saturday","TendersInfo","The challenges and opportunities for nuclear power to continue to provide low carbon energy in the future was the focus of a side event held at the COP23 Bonn Climate Change Conference. Hosted and moderated by the IAEA, the side event How Nuclear Power Can Contribute to Climate Change Mitigation? underscored the global role that nuclear energy plays in addressing climate change and featured specific initiatives underway in France, Hungary, and the United Kingdom. Senior government officials and experts at the side event described country actions and drivers behind future nuclear power development. Nuclear power is expected to be an indispensable part of the reliable, low cost and low carbon power supply needed to meet the Paris Agreement goal of keeping the rise of global temperature below 2C. Nuclear power today provides a third of global low carbon electricity generation. However, for nuclear power to step up to the Paris Agreement goals, construction rates of new nuclear reactors will need to double by 2030 from the rate seen in 2015-2016, according to Peter Janoska, an analyst with the International Energy Agency (IEA). Low carbon electricity is key, said Jean-Yves Caneill, a Climate Policy Consultant in France. Electricity will help to decarbonize many sectors of the economy. It is crucial that all low carbon technologies including nuclear are used appropriately depending on national circumstances. Some countries already use a significant share of nuclear power and plan to build more. Hungarys four nuclear reactors generate over one third of the countrys electricity, with two new units planned. Pal Kovacs, Head of Cabinet of Hungarys Minister responsible of the Paks Nuclear Power Plant expansion, said that nuclear power generation was a more mature option for Hungary. Technologically, it has a strong potential in the future, he said. New, safer and more economical nuclear reactors could lead us to a clean and sustainable future. Nuclear power is among the lowest cost electricity generation technologies, once in operation. However, the cost of the ultimate price of electricity depends on market structure and competition. New financing mechanisms, such as Contracts for Difference used for the UK Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, guarantee returns while sharing project risks. I believe nuclear power has an important and continuing role to play in reducing carbon intensity in the power generation sector in the UK, while contributing to security of supply, said Anurag Gupta, Director of KPMG in the United Kingdom. The key challenge facing the sector in achieving this goal is ensuring the delivery of cost competitive projects, on time and on budget. The experts emphasized that with the right support nuclear power can provide affordable, reliable and low carbon electricity for development. The IAEA led a series of side events at the COP23 , held from 6 to 17 November in Bonn, Germany. \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India92","Fiji : Statement by the Fijian Prime Minister and Incoming President of Cop23","June 6, 2017 Tuesday","TendersInfo","The decision by the Trump Administration to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change is deeply disappointing, especially for the citizens of vulnerable nations throughout the world. It is also a grave disappointment for millions of people living in those areas of the United States that are threatened by the effects of climate change, whether it is the flooding that threatens cities like New York and Miami, or the periods of drought and deluge that have plagued California and other states, or the temperature rise that is affecting cities, wildlife and natural areas across the United States. As incoming President of COP23 , I did what I could - along with many leaders around the world - to try to persuade President Trump to remain standing shoulder-to-shoulder with us as, together, we tackle the greatest challenge our planet has ever faced. While the loss of Americas leadership is unfortunate, this is a struggle that is far from over. That is because the world has reached the consensus that all nations must meet this challenge together, and we need not forgo economic growth to do so. On the contrary, solving the climate crisis through cooperation, innovation, new technologies and improved access to capital around the world will create real, sustainable economic growth for those who have the vision to make this moment of challenge a moment of opportunity. The rest of the world remains fully committed to the implementation of the Paris Agreement. I am especially encouraged by the commitment being shown by China, India, the European Union, Canada, Mexico and the vast majority of other nations. They will continue to lead this process, with or without the support of the Trump Administration, but with the knowledge and assurance that many ordinary Americans support participation in the Paris Agreement, and that many American states, cities and businesses will continue to pursue the ambitious climate action the Agreement entails. As incoming COP President, I reaffirm that I will do everything possible to continue to forge a grand coalition that will accelerate the momentum that has continued since the Paris Agreement, embracing governments, civil society, the private sector and millions of ordinary men and women around the world. I am also convinced that the United States Government will eventually rejoin our struggle because the scientific evidence of man-made climate change is well understood. The issue is settled, and the impacts are obvious, and humankind ignores these facts at its peril. \"

"COP23","India","COP23_India94","World can achieve 100% renewable and full decarbonization by 2050","November 9, 2017 Thursday","Greentechlead.com","New Delhi, Nov. 09 -- A global transition to 100 percent renewable electricity is a tangible reality and more cost-effective than the current systems, which largely is based on fossil fuels and nuclear energy, says a new research. The study by Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT) and the Energy Watch Group (EWG) was presented on November 8, 2017 during the Global Renewable Energy Solutions Showcase event (GRESS) on the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP23 in Bonn. Existing renewable energy potential and technologies, including storage can generate sufficient and secure power to cover the entire global electricity demand by 2050. Total levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) on a global average for 100 percent renewable electricity in 2050 is (EURO)52/MWh (including curtailment, storage and some grid costs), compared to (EURO)70/MWh in 2015. ""A full decarbonization of the electricity system by 2050 is possible for lower system cost than today based on available technology. Energy transition is no longer a question of technical feasibility or economic viability, but of political will,"" Christian Breyer, lead author of the study, LUT Professor of Solar Economy and Chairman of the EWG Scientific Board said. A transition to 100 percent renewables would bring greenhouse gas emissions in the electricity sector down to zero and drastically reduce total losses in power generation. It would create 36 million jobs by 2050, 17 million more than today. Total levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) on a global average for 100 percent renewable electricity in 2050 is (EURO)52/MWh (including curtailment, storage and some grid costs), compared to (EURO)70/MWh in 2015. Wind energy increases to 32 percent by 2030. Beyond 2030 solar PV becomes more competitive. The solar PV supply share increases from 37 percent in 2030 to about 69 percent in 2050. Batteries are the key supporting technology for solar PV. The storage output covers 31 percent of the total demand in 2050, 95 percent of which is covered by batteries alone. Battery storage provides mainly diurnal storage, and renewable energy based gas provides seasonal storage. Global greenhouse gas emissions significantly reduce from about 11 GtCO2eq in 2015 to zero emissions by 2050 or earlier, as the total LCOE of the power system declines. The global energy transition to a 100 percent renewable electricity system creates 36 million jobs by 2050 in comparison to 19 million jobs in the 2015 electricity system. The total losses in a 100 percent renewable electricity system are around 26 percent of the total electricity demand, compared to the current system in which about 58 percent of the primary energy input is lost. ""There is no reason to invest one more Dollar in fossil or nuclear power production,"" EWG president Hans-Josef Fell said. ""Renewable energy provides cost-effective power supply. All plans for a further expansion of coal, nuclear, gas and oil have to be ceased."" The research calls for more investments to be channeled in renewable energies and the necessary infrastructure for storage and grids. ""Everything else will lead to unnecessary costs and increasing global warming,"" Fell said. \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India95","Bonn: Climate engineering is risky, but should be explored, experts say at UN conference","November 17, 2017 Friday 6:30 AM EST","IBNS","New York, Nov 17 (Just Earth News): Climate engineering, or climate intervention, is risky but needs to be explored as a supplement - not as a 'Plan B' - to greenhouse gas emissions reduction, said experts at the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP23 ), in Bonn, Germany. Climate engineering, also referred to as geoengineering, is the deliberate and large-scale intervention in the climate system with measures including carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere or solar radiation management. We can do a lot, we have to do a lot, we have to try much harder at cutting our emissions, but there will remain certain emissions, especially in the land use sector, which are not going away. So we actually need to start talking about this removal of greenhouse gases inevitably, said Matthias Honegger, research scientist with the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies, at a press conference. Different approaches are being discussed. Some already exist, like planting trees. Other ideas include dispersing certain minerals in the oceans to enhance the growth of algae, which then as they sink to the ocean floor, would create a net flux of carbon from the atmosphere into the oceans. Business as usual is a little worrying, said Dr. Hugh Hunt, from the Department of Engineering at Cambridge University. The concept of not doing anything is full of danger. Now the concept of cooling the planet is full of danger as well. We need to have full-on public engagement, full-on societal involvement. The reason is that the risks of climate change are huge, the risks of doing nothing are huge; but the risks of geoengineering are huge as well. Weve got to explore those risks, because who knows, we may end up entering a very risky world without understanding it, he added. Geoengineering risks are not well understood and need to be explored. Stratospheric aerosol injection Due to the great uncertainties over effectiveness and side effects of climate engineering including the risk of disrupting natural systems experts think that there is a need to discuss climate engineering governance, especially as it relates to stratospheric aerosol injection. Stratospheric aerosol injection consists of injecting sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere with aircraft or balloons to create a global dimming effect. This technology is absolutely terrifying. We may actually need it, but then, who do we want to decide. Thats where this society-wide discussion has to take place, said Janos Pasztor, Executive Director of the Carnegie Climate Geoengineering Governance Initiative (C2G2), and former UN senior climate advisor. It would require a level of international cooperation that we have not yet seen. Who will decide whether we should make use of stratospheric aerosol injection and when that decision should take place? [] Who will make that decision on behalf of the world? And then how far do we turn the thermostat of the global air conditioning system [] to cool the planet? he said. There are issues: the more temperature you want to reduce the higher the chance there will be negative impact and the higher the chance that some of these impacts will not be the same across different geographical zones. You might end up in a situation where some people benefit from the reduced temperature but some people would have negative impacts. What do you do with those people? How do you compensate them? How do you take care of them? he added. Pasztor concluded that the highest priority should remain the gas emission reduction. But we have to consider these other options, as supplements, not as a Plan B, he warned.

"COP23","India","COP23_India96","COP23: Study of human mobility in era of CC","November 9, 2017 Thursday","UNI (United News of India)","Bonn, Nov. 9 -- As the number of people displaced worldwide due to climate change-related events continues to grow, the United Nations and its partners are focusing on regional approaches, framed by existing practice, to respond to the issue of 'climate refugees.' The number of disaster displacements on annual average between 2008 and 2016 amounted to 25.3 million, according to figures released by the Norwegian Refugee Council. The five countries globally that have the highest proportion of their population affected by displacements are all island States: Cuba, Fiji, Philippines, Tonga and Sri Lanka. ""During this hurricane season alone for example, we saw the displacement of 1.7 million people in Cuba - that's the equivalent of 15 per cent of its population,"" said Camila Minerva, Humanitarian Programme Manager with Oxfam in the Dominican Republic, during a press conference on 'human mobility and climate change' at the UN Climate Conference ( COP23 ), in Bonn, Germany, The UN News said. ""The poorest and the most marginalised are five times more likely to be displaced and to remain so for longer time than people in higher income countries, and [this number] is increasing with climate change,"" she added. ""In a country like Bangladesh, we did a survey last year and 40 per cent of the households we interviewed told us that climate change contributed directly to their decision to migrate,"" she explained. In this context, some have suggested the creation of a 'climate refugee' status, protecting those forced to leave their country because of the impacts of climate change. ""The legals status for refugees is provided by the 1951 Refugee Convention, which is very clear on what [basis such status is conferred], which is basically persecution,"" said Marine Franck, Programme Officer (climate change), Division of International Protection, in the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). ""In the context of climate change displacement, there might be cases where there is persecution involved where this refugee status could apply but in most cases, it doesn't,"" she added. She recalled that in 2011, States had suggested that UNHCR create a new status of refugee for people displaced because of climate change. ""But some States were not at all ready for that,"" she stated. Ms Franck stressed that this issue of broadening the scope of refugee protection ""is not necessarily desirable, because there is a risk of undermining the refugees fleeing persecution and violent conflict."" Moreover, she explained: ""We would need also to renegotiate the Convention and there is no appetite for that from States and it might not be the most effective protection tool."" UNHCR thinks it is better to look at what exists at the regional level and try to have a bottom-up approach with broadening at the regional level using practices that are effective. She mentioned humanitarian protection visas, temporary protection and stay arrangements, as well as migration laws that can provide real protection. ""It is much more effective because States are going to look at what their neighbours are doing and may adopt the same kind of procedures, rather than if we adopt a global convention or a new category [.] it might not be easy to negotiate and it is not also sure that States will then implement it properly,"" Ms Franck said.

"COP23","India","COP23_India97","Bonn: new efforts announced at UN climate conference to push for further, faster climate action","November 12, 2017 Sunday 6:30 AM EST","IBNS","New York, Nov 12 (Just Earth News): Cities, the transport sector and ocean advocates today announced a number of new initiatives to push for further, faster climate action, at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 23 ) in Bonn, Germany. These announcements were made under the auspices of the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action, created last year to spur action by state and non-state sectors to help implement the Paris Agreement on climate change. New Transport Decarbonisation Alliance In a major new partnership, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Costa Rica and the Paris Process on Mobility and Climate (PPMC) launched the Transport Decarbonisation Alliance to stimulate greater political leadership in the sector. Transport contributes about one quarter of all energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and about 15-17 per cent of the entire spread of human CO2 emissions. More ambitious and coordinated action on transport is required to deliver on the Paris Agreement, said Jos Mendes, Deputy Minister for Environment of Portugal. Six new voluntary sector initiatives were also introduced in Bonn to address specific aspects of transport and climate change. These include: the below50 (expanding the global market for the worlds most sustainable fuels); the EcoMobility Alliance (cities committed to sustainable transport); EV100 (accelerating the transition to electro-mobility); Walk 21 (valuing and delivering more walkable communities); the Global Strategy for Cleaner Fuels and Vehicles; and the Transforming Urban Mobility Initiative (accelerating implementation of sustainable urban transport development and mitigation of climate change). Cities and communities speed coordinated climate action Similarly, global cities and communities also announced new efforts Saturday to coordinate their climate action commitments to deliver bigger and faster results together. Local and regional governments are making commitments that will help national Governments close the gap between current national commitments and the emissions reductions needed to achieve the Paris Agreement targets, said Gino Van Begin, Secretary General of ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability, a global network of more than 1,500 cities, towns and regions working together for sustainable development. Urban areas account for around two-thirds of the worlds greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from global energy use. Their overall contribution to total greenhouse gas emissions is estimated at between 37 and 49 per cent globally, depending on base assumptions of data used. Also at a press conference at COP 23 , the Mayor of city of Pittsburgh (in the United States), William Peduto, announced that 367 American mayors have agreed to be part of the Paris Agreement no matter what our Federal Government did. Its going to happen at the local level, he said. The new initiatives announced include efforts ICLEI and the global NDC Partnership (a coalition of countries and institutions working to mobilize support for climate goals and enhancing sustainable development) to design, implement and align climate action strategies across all levels of governments. Similarly, the Cities Climate Finance Leadership Alliance (a group of some 40 organizations working to mobilize investment in low-carbon and climate-resilient infrastructure in cities and urban areas internationally) is mapping available finance to match known infrastructure projects a critical requirement to help local governments identify funding. Threat of ocean warming and ocean acidification Also Saturday at COP 23 , a new declaration was signed to strengthen global response to climate change impacts on oceans and coastal zones. Oceans are the planets largest carbon sink, a major regulating force of global climate, and fundamental to the survival and well-being of humanity. Oceans have featured little in the UN climate negotiations to date, and yet they are not only important for planetary survival but also offer great opportunities for innovation towards a low-carbon blue economy, said Biliana Cicin-Sain, President of the Global Ocean Forum. Isabel Torres de Noronha, Executive Secretary of the Future Ocean Alliance, a non-governmental organization, in an interview with UN News, underscored that ocean acidification might put at risk not only ecosystems but also many economic activities and food security of coastal populations. Among initiatives at national level, she highlighted one from Viet Nam about strengthening the coastline by planting forests of mangroves.

Markey (D-Mass.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) led their colleagues in introducing a Senate Resolution expressing U.S. support for the Paris climate agreement. The resolution highlights that fact that, despite President Donald Trumps intention to withdraw from the historic climate accord, the United States has experienced emissions reductions during a period of economic growth, and that state and local governments are committing to clean energy deployment that will help ensure the United States can meet its climate goals. The resolution also points to the massive job growth potential from clean energy, with more than 2.5 million people in the United States already working in industries such as wind, solar and energy efficiency in all 50 States. As recently as this week, Virginia and New Jersey have taken steps or signaled their intention to join the Northeast Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), the successful market-based system that sets a cap on carbon emissions from the electric sector. We will not allow President Trumps intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement to turn America from leader to laggard on climate action, said Senator Markey. In the face of the Trump administrations climate denial, state and local leaders, the business community, and the American people are taking action to address global warming and spur clean energy deployment. At COP23 , our delegation delivered the message that COP really stands for Cant Obstruct Progress and that we are still in and we will win. Denying climate change doesnt stop the climate from changing, said Senator Whitehouse. And President Trump reneging on the Paris agreement cant erase Americas commitment to meeting our climate goals. Rhode Island is still in. And so are states and cities across the country, leading corporations, and millions of Americans. We won't turn back. President Trump can try to stop climate progress, but his denialism is no match for the incredible efforts of states, cities, businesses, and more all over the U.S. who are stepping up in his place, said Senator Merkley. By working together toward a bold vision of 100% clean and renewable energy, grassroots America can and will keep the U.S. on track to meet or even exceed our Paris commitment. \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India99","United Kingdom : COP23 and the transfer of climate technology","November 4, 2017 Saturday","TendersInfo","Ever since the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015, climate finance has been very high up on the agenda of the international community. Paris was a crucial breakthrough delivering the near-universal consensus behind the urgent need to tackle climate change and to slow the pace of global warming. But it was only the beginning of the efforts to put in place the financing and the technology that is needed to support the Paris vision. Multilateral development banks (MDBs) such as the EBRD have all agreed to scale up their financing for green investments, putting in their own funds but also playing a key role in galvanising the resources and the expertise of the private sector. The EBRD is also making an important contribution to the process of climate technology transfer, a topic that will be in focus at this years global climate talks, the COP23 conference, that will be taking place in Bonn, Germany from 6 to 17 November. The MDBs are supporting technology transfer with the development of Regional Technology Transfer Centres using initial funding from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) under its Long-Term Program on Technology Transfer. These centres facilitate the transfer of know-how, experience and equipment all aimed at mitigating and adapting to climate change. For the EBRD it is crucially important to promote such transfers to many of the 38 emerging economies where it works to promote the development of sustainable market economies. Many of the EBRDs countries of operations are still struggling with a legacy of energy waste and pollution. The EBRDs Regional Technology Transfer Centre is called the Finance and Technology Transfer Centre for Climate Change or FINTECC. It has a vital role in supporting climate technology transfer, across different regions and sectors by helping businesses implement climate technologies. The programme offers technical assistance provided by the EBRD and international consultants, as well as incentive grants for companies to introduce eligible technologies. Grants are available to the companies as a complement to EBRD financing. Since its beginning in 2014 and until now, FINTECC has helped more than 25 companies up their game by improving energy efficiency and implementing new technologies in their production and operating processes. In Morocco, a leading confectionery producer and exporter is using an EBRD loan of 4.6 million to finance the construction and operation of a new facility in Casablanca powered by a 1.4 MW solar plant on its rooftop. The project will implement additional energy efficiency measures, such as an ice-based energy storage system, energy recovery from a furnace chimney and high-grade thermal insulation. The project is expected to result in annual fuel savings of 600 tonnes of oil equivalent and emission reductions of 2,200 tonnes of CO2 per year. The EBRD will present its successful FINTECC programme at this years COP with a dedicated event. The main purpose of this event is to showcase the FINTECCs business model and the reasoning behind its achievements, to present trends in the region and lessons learned by the Bank while implementing the programme. Alongside FINTECC, the event will also cover another EBRD programme-The GCF-EBRD Renewable Energy Financing Framework- with a focus on two country examples: Egypt and Kazakhstan. \"

A great many people in Fiji will benefit from this project, which will cost a total of approximately USD 400 million, and I am grateful to the EIB for its support and its foresight. Financing of projects to build resiliency in developing countries is critical, and I sincerely hope that this project can serve as a model for other developing countries that wish to access blended financing on behalf of their own people, said Frank Bainimarama Prime Minister of Fiji and President of COP23 . More than 275,000 people living around the capital city of Suva will benefit from the new EIB-financed water investment that will both help to improve current service levels and reduce leakages and enable quicker resumption of water supply following cyclones. The scheme includes construction of a new water-treatment plant and upgrading existing wastewater treatment facilities, as well as improving and expanding water networks. Once complete, the scheme is expected to support a number of sustainable development goals including health, economic development and sustainable urban growth. The new water investment is also financed by the Government of Fiji, Asian Development Bank and Green Climate Fund. It follows extensive due diligence by the Asian Development Bank and represents the first EIB co-financing with the Green Climate Fund. Ahead of the signing ceremony the EIB hosted a workshop to outline practical experience gained from three water projects around the world to enhance climate resilience. Priyaraj Lakmal Munasinghe, CEO of the Water Authority of Fiji and representatives of the Lilongwe Water Board in Malawi and the EUR 5 billion Emscher River renovation project highlighted key issues to consider and discussed how to overcome practical challenges with climate experts at COP 23 .

"COP23","India","COP23_India102","Climate Change Minister Claire Perry Launches Powering Past Coal Alliance at COP23","November 16, 2017 Thursday 6:30 AM EST","Contify Energy News","Nov. 16 -- Global alliance, launched by UK and Canada, to lead the rest of the world in committing to an end to the use of unabated coal power. An alliance of nations and states committed to moving the world from burning coal to cleaner power sources was launched today (16 November 2017) by more than 20 partners at COP23 , the United Nations climate change talks. The UK was one of the first countries to commit to ending unabated coal power generation by 2025. In July 2012, our generation profile still included 40% coal. In July this year, this fell to 2% and in April, the UK had its first full day when no coal was used for 135 years. The Powering Past Coal Alliance plans to grow to 50 or more members by this time next year. Its ambition is to lead the rest of the world in committing to an end to unabated coal power. The members of the alliance commit to taking action such as setting coal phase out targets, committing to no further investments in coal-fired electricity in their jurisdictions or abroad. Unabated coal is the generation of electricity from a coal plant without any treatment to reduce substantially the emissions of carbon dioxide. It emits twice as much CO2 as gas per unit of electricity. The announcement comes as the UK government prepares to launch its flagship Industrial Strategy to get the economy firing while building on its strengths like clean growth and embracing the opportunities of technological change. Claire Perry, Minister for Climate Change and Industry, said: Reducing global coal consumption should be a vital and urgent priority for all countries and states. Unabated coal is the dirtiest, most polluting way of generating electricity. The Powering Past Coal Alliance will signal to the world that the time of coal has passed. The UK is committed to completely phasing out unabated coal-fire power generation no later than 2025 and we hope to inspire others to follow suit. Catherine McKenna, Canada's Minister of Environment and Climate Change, said: Phasing out coal power is good news for the climate, for our health, and for our kids. Coal is literally choking our cities, with close to a million people dying every year from coal pollution. I'm thrilled to see so much global momentum for the transition to clean energy - and this is only the beginning. The new coalition will work with businesses, civil society and governments to offer technical and practical help to accelerate the transition away from coal. However, it recognises that not all countries can completely phase out the use of unabated coal at the same rate. To stay below the 2C target agreed as part of the Paris accord 2 years ago, OECD countries across the world need to phase out coal by 2030 and global use will need to reduce by two-thirds by 2040. Today's launch of the alliance comes after British Prime Minister Theresa May reiterated the UK's commitment to phase out unabated coal by 2025 in a joint press conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in September. In its first meeting, the alliance agreed that transitioning away from coal-fired electricity is one of the most important steps the international community can take to meet the aims of the historic Paris agreement - at which the UK played a leading role 2 years ago. The UK has already begun its transition away from coal, in part as a result of renewable energy sources becoming cost effective. Offshore wind, for example, is now half the cost it was 2 years ago. Since 1990, the UK has reduced its emissions by 42%, while growing our economy by 67%. This is in no small part due to the 85% reduction in coal use we've seen in that time. However, domestic action alone is not enough. It is important that we restrict financing for coal projects abroad. The UK government announced in 2014 that it would end support for public financing of new coal-fired power plants overseas, except in rare circumstances. UK Export Finance has not supported a coal project since 2002. Source: Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, Government of U.K. \"

Phasing out coal is one of many climate actions that will transition Canada to a clean growth economy. The Powering Past Coal Alliance includes Canada alongside more than 20 partners, as well as the provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec, the State of Washington and the City of Vancouver. With 40 percent of the worlds electricity still generated from coal, phasing out coal power is one of the most important steps countries can take to meet their Paris Agreement commitments. Coal phase-out will also reduce a major source of air pollution that harms the health of millions of people every year. Global investments in new renewable power now significantly surpass those in new coal-fired electricity, and clean growth represents an opportunity worth trillions of dollars. The partners in the Powering Past Coal Alliance are working together to accelerate clean growth and climate protection through the rapid phase-out of traditional coal power. Partners also commit to supporting clean power through their policies and investments and to restricting financing for traditional coal power without carbon capture and storage. The partners commit to making this transition in an economically inclusive way, with a just transition for workers and communities. Canada will work with partners to expand the alliance to 50 partners by next falls United Nations Climate Change Conference .

Brown and United Nations Secretary-General's Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change Michael R. Bloomberg released the America's Pledge report on Saturday at the UN climate change conference in this German city The report is the first communication to the international community specifically addressing the scope and scale of non-federal climate action in the US following the Trump administration's decision to withdraw from the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. It captures and quantifies the outpouring of public support for the agreement since the withdrawal announcement, finding that cities, states and businesses representing more than half the US economy and population have declared their support for the Paris Agreement. The report comprises more than 2,300 signatories to the ""We Are Still In"" declaration. If these non-federal actors were a country, their economy would be the third largest in the world, bigger than all but two national parties to the Paris Agreement. In addition, the report finds that a total of 20 US states, 110 cities, and over 1,400 businesses with US operations representing $25 trillion in market capitalisation and nearly one gigatons of GHG emissions per year have adopted quantified emissions reduction targets. The most ambitious of these targets, such as those adopted by California, mirror the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) of national governments. ""The group of American cities, states, and businesses who remain committed to the Paris Agreement represents a bigger economy than any nation outside the US and China,"" an official statement quoting Bloomberg said. ""Together, they are helping deliver on the promise of the agreement and ensuring the US remains a global leader in the fight against climate change. In Paris, the US pledged to measure and report our progress reducing emissions alongside every other nation."" The report was released at an event featuring UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa and Fijian President Frank Bainimarama, who is chairing the COP-23 , besides others. ""California strongly supports the United Nations' unstoppable move to decarbonise the world economy,"" said California Governor and COP 23 Special Advisor for States and Regions Brown. ""We join with states and cities across America and around the world that will continue aggressive and creative action to curb greenhouse gas emissions."" ""If the challenge of climate change is to be solved and the opportunities of a low carbon transition harvested we need all sectors of society in all nations fully on board,"" Espinosa said in a statement. The Fijian Prime Minister said: ""To achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, we are helping to build a grand coalition to accelerate climate action across all nations and at every level of society."" The America's Pledge report examines current and potential future opportunities for non-federal actors in the US to deepen and strengthen their role in meeting the US commitment under the Paris Agreement to reduce emissions by 26-28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2025. The 23rd annual UN climate change talks of the parties or COP23 , coming just two years after the landmark adoption of the Paris Climate Change Agreement, will also further fuel momentum among cities, states, regions, territories, business and civil society in support of national climate action plans. In June, US President Donald Trump announced his administration's intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, throwing into doubt its role at UN climate talks and related bodies like the Green Climate Fund. COP23 , attention will turn to whether the US and its allies will continue to advance an agenda focused mainly on mitigation, carbon markets and transparency of action, while neglecting or foot-dragging on other key issues such as adaptation, loss and damage, finance, technology transfer, capacity building, transparency of support and compliance. --IANS vg/vm \"

Peter Thomson, the first UN Special Envoy for the Oceans, appointed in September 2017, provided remarks and stressed that we have to talk of ocean change like we talk of climate change"". During the session, Mr Deon Terblanche from the World Meteorological Organization presented its latest Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, according to which carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in the atmosphere have increased by 145% as compared to pre-industrial (before 1750) levels. This is causing changes in the world we live in with knock-on effects on the oceans and marine ecosystems. About a quarter of the CO2 emitted through human activities is taken up by the ocean. This is causing a change in the oceans chemistry, a process known as ocean acidification. Since the beginning of the industrial revolution, ocean acidity has increased by 26% and the current rate of acidification is over 10 times faster than any time in the last 55 million years. Peter Swarzenski, from the IAEA Environment Laboratories stressed that we all have an important role to play in ocean action. IAEA research provides insight into ocean processes and can be used by Member States to make informed decisions and take action. He added that it is not too late. We can avoid irreversible consequences for the oceans and the communities that depend on them. Recent research, including that done by the IAEA, shows that ocean acidification effects on fisheries, aquaculture and coral reefs are expanding, both in terms of geographical location and intensity. Some effects are direct such as on species physiology: growth, reproduction and calcification, while others may be indirect: impact on food sources, habitat degradation, changes in the food chain structure, for example. Nuclear and isotopic techniques are powerful tools to study ocean acidification and have contributed widely to investigating past changes in ocean acidity and potential impacts on marine organisms. Researchers at the IAEA Environment Laboratories use calcium-45 to examine the growth rates in calcifying organisms such as corals, mussels and other molluscs, whose skeletons and shells are composed of calcium carbonate. Tracers are also used to determine how ocean acidification is affecting the physiology of marine organisms, as well as the impact of multiple combined stressors, such as ocean acidification and increases in temperature and contaminants. The IAEA laboratories in Monaco also host the Ocean Acidification International Coordination Centre (OA-ICC), which works with many international partners to advance ocean acidification monitoring, research and capacity-building around the world. Vladimir Ryabinin, Executive Secretary of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO highlighted how IOC-UNESCO and the IAEA OA-ICC are collaborating closely to support the Global Ocean Acidification Observing Network (GOA-ON), a global platform launched in 2012, which brings together researchers working on ocean acidification monitoring. Oxygen in the ocean decreases, sea water is acidifying, and sea level is rising. We know this, and can make projections for the future, because of systematic ocean observations and science, argued Mr Ryabinin. The side-event was coordinated by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO and the IAEA with representatives from UN Environment, FAO, IMO, the UNESCO World Heritage Centre and the WMO. \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India108","India must up its game at COP 23","November 7, 2017 Tuesday","Hindustan Times","Mumbai, Nov. 7 -- As the Conference of Parties ( COP 23 ) gets underway in Bonn, the focus is once again on emission targets for the developing world and the importance of bringing the US back to the negotiating table. The Paris accord was seen as a landmark agreement since it was negotiated by representatives of 196 parties at COP 21. As of October 2017, 195 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) members have signed the agreement. COP 23 at Bonn is the second one after Donald Trump's withdrawal of the US (which will come into effect in 2020. It is here that the rules for implementing the Paris agreement (which is not binding) will be negotiated. Developing countries fear that developed countries might shift more of the emission reduction burden on to them without facilitating a transfer of technologies in the manner that enables the achievement of even existing targets. The pledges from developed countries in Paris remain unclear and the specifics are expected to become clearer at Bonn. Countries such as India and China continue to resist the imposition of steeper emission targets, on the principle that those responsible for emissions historically must pay a price for it. India must use the opportunity at Bonn to take the lead in convincing developed countries to invest in technology transfer exercises more efficiently. Currently, India is set to achieve its emission reduction targets with no changes in policies, in spite of being the only one on the list of most polluting countries to have increased its emissions by almost 5% in 2016. India's energy requirements will only grow: large parts of the country remain off the electricity grid, and it continues to witness one of the world's largest rural to urban migrations. India also has a large coastline, and anthropogenic climate change and the resultant rise in sea levels will directly affect its citizens. Thus an important issue at Bonn is adaptation. While most negotiations focus on mitigation, countries likely to face the brunt of climate change must be concerned with the issue of long-term finance to strengthen adaptation strategies in order to cope with the impact of climate change.

"COP23","India","COP23_India110","The world must come together at COP23 to raise ambition despite the US pullout, says India-based think tank","November 2, 2017 Thursday 6:30 AM EST","IBNS","New Delhi, Nov 2 (IBNS): The twenty-third meeting of the Conference of Parties (COP) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is scheduled to begin in Bonn, Germany, from November 6. The upcoming climate summit marks the 25th year of the signing of UNFCCC. However, the Bonn meeting will be the first COP after the Trump administration-effected US pullout from the Paris Agreement. Even after the pullout, the US would continue to participate in the climate talks till 2020. New Delhi-based think tank Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said the US withdrawal should be seen as an opportunity for action, and not inaction. The US withdrawal should be taken as an opportunity and a call for greater and more ambitious action, and not a call for inaction. The rest of the world must come together to make sure the US does not obstruct or dilute the Agreement any further, said Chandra Bhushan, deputy director general of CSE and the head of its climate change programme. Bhushan was speaking at a pre- COP23 media briefing organised by CSE at New Delhi recently. At Bonn, Parties would negotiate the rules and guidelines for many provisions under the Paris Agreement, namely transparency framework, New Market Mechanism, facilitative dialogue (FD) and global stocktake (GST). While transparency framework (monitoring and reporting of climate actions and support) and New Market Mechanism (carbon markets) are expected to be built on and/or take the learnings of similar mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol, FD and GST are meant to assess the progress of climate actions. Other key agenda actions include loss and damage, adaptation and finance. Finance has always been a bone of contention between developed and developing countries, with the rich countries failing to fulfill their mandate of providing finance and technology to the developing countries to address climate change. The Green Climate Fund (GCF), to support developing countries, needs to fulfill the mandate of US $100 billion by 2020. Parties also need to come up with clearly defined guidelines on how to report on adaptation actions domestically. At the end of the Summit, Parties must come up with a draft rule book to be finalised by 2018, as per the mandate. It is crucial that the rule book for implementation of Paris Agreement be fair, effective, strong and equitable and under no circumstances should the global community allow the US to dilute the Paris Agreement further, said Vijeta Rattani, climate analyst, CSE. According to recently published research, in 2016, CO2 concentration in the earths atmosphere was 403 parts per million (ppm), the highest ever. 2016 was also the warmest year on record. The developing world has been the worst hit. In the list of top 10 countries representing the global vulnerability index, nine were from the developing world, indicating their limited capability and capacity to withstand climate fury. This year, India had a below-normal monsoon, with central India facing severe droughts. On an average, climate impacts cause a loss of about 1.5 per cent every year in the GDP in India. The South Asian floods in August this year in India, Nepal and Bangladesh left 1,200 dead. Developed countries have not been immune either -- in the US alone, 15 weather and climate disaster events in 2017 caused losses exceeding US $1 billion each. The UN Emissions Gap Report 2017, which was released recently, warns that the emissions gap needs to be closed by 2030. If the world fails to do that, limiting the temperature rise to the 2 degree Celsius target, as endorsed in the Paris Agreement, seems highly unlikely. Considering that the poor are the biggest sufferers of the impacts of climate change, it is ironical that issues central to developing countries such as adaptation, loss and damage and agriculture are highly marginalised at COP and fails to draw finance from developed countries. India, itself a victim of climate impacts, must shift its negotiating strategy to focus on real issues that affect its own people, said Rattani. Even though climate change requires global efforts, the burden of addressing climate change cannot continue to be on developing countries. Urgent and ambitious climate action is needed but it needs to be equitable and other developed countries of G-20 must come forward and set a positive tone, said Chandra Bhushan.

"COP23","India","COP23_India111","Norway : Worlds eyes on Norway as historic climate trial begins","November 14, 2017 Tuesday","TendersInfo","Tomorrow, environmental organisations Greenpeace Nordic and Nature and Youth take on the Norwegian government in court for opening up new areas in the Arctic to oil drilling. They are arguing that drilling for oil violates the Paris Agreement as well as the Norwegian constitution. Winning the case could set a precedent for future climate cases around the world. Norways Grandparents Climate Campaign has also joined the case, as intervenors against the government and in support of the environmental groups. Truls Gulowsen, Head of Greenpeace Norway said: This is a big day for all of us fighting climate change and greedy governments around the world. By allowing new oil drilling in the Arctic the Norwegian government puts homes, health and families everywhere at risk, and should be held accountable. It is clear to us that this new search for oil is in violation of the Paris Agreement and the Norwegian Constitution, and we look forward to raising these arguments in court. In the trial, set for 14-23 November, the plaintiffs will argue that the Norwegian government has violated the right to a healthy and safe environment for future generations granted by the Norwegian Constitution. This will be the first time this right is used in court. Around the world some 90 countries have a Constitutionally protected right to a healthy environment, and this lawsuit can have a ripple effect helping guide other jurisdictions on how to interpret these rights in their legal systems, and inspiring more people to hold their governments to account. Ingrid Skjoldvr, Head of Nature and Youth, added: The Norwegian government, like every government, has an obligation to protect people's right to a healthy environment. It is us in the younger generation, and our children, who will feel the worst effects of this oil being burned. This court case is giving us a critical opportunity to protect our futures and, we hope, providing a valuable tool for others to do the same. At the same time as the climate trial starts in Norway, Fiji is hosting the United Nations climate change conference COP 23 in Bonn, and attending the first day of the trial in Oslo are two young Pacific Islanders representatives from Fiji. Alisi Nacewa, Pacific Island Represent activist said: ""We are here in Norway because our home is on the frontline of climate change. Our way of life is being impacted by extreme weather and rising sea levels right now. There is no way the continuation of oil and gas extraction, can deliver a world below 1.5 degrees. No way. No matter how politicians try to spin it. The Norwegian government has signed the Paris Agreement but they continue to drill for oil and supply the world with more fossil fuels. The two are in complete contradiction. Its time to hold countries accountable for breaking their Paris commitments."" The Norwegian government will defend their decision to, for the first time in 20 years, open up a new oil drilling area in the Barents Sea, allowing 13 oil companies to start new exploration campaigns in the Arctic. Norwegian state-owned Statoil has already begun their drilling operations in the Arctic this summer. The 13 oil companies that have new license blocks in the Barents Sea are: Statoil (Norway), Capricorn, Tullow and Centrica (UK), Chevron and ConocoPhillips (USA), DEA (Germany), Aker BP (Norway), Idemitsu (Japan), Lukoil (Russia), Lundin Petroleum (Sweden), OMV (Austria), PGNiG (Norway/Poland). \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India112","Here's why the latest push for pre-2020 action at COP23 is likely to fall flat","November 7, 2017 Tuesday","Down To Earth","India, Nov. 7 -- The 23rd session of the Conference of Parties ( CoP23 ) commenced on Monday (November 6) in the German city of Bonn. While the world focuses on preparing the rule book for implementation of the Paris Agreement, due in 2018, members from the umbrella group of Like-Minded Developing Countries (LMDC), including India, China and Iran took the floor at the opening plenary to raise the issue of vast inadequacy of climate actions in the run up to 2020 when the Paris Agreement becomes operative. Little progress on pre-2020 actions India's key negotiator at the talks, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad stressed on the importance of meeting commitments made for the period until 2020 on which there has so far been little progress. India's stance was met with enthusiastic support by negotiators from other developing countries. ""While action on post-2020 period under the Paris Agreement has gained momentum, the discussions on pre-2020 actions have lagged behind,"" he said. Although Switzerland, representing the a few developed nations under the Environmental Integrity Group, also supported the LMDC in pushing for greater pre-2020 actions, the demand was met with silence from other developed nations. The commitments being referred to by developing nations are the ones made by parties of the UNFCCC before the Paris Agreement took form, when discussions revolved around the path to be taken until 2020. The first wide-ambit agreement reached under the UNFCCC in 1997 was the Kyoto Protocol which had a total of 192 signatories. The agreement during the first commitment period, in effect until 2012, was for developed nations to reduce their carbon emissions while developing nations were to switch to low-carbon technologies and climate change mitigation strategies. In 2010, at COP16 in Cancun, close to 80 developed and developing countries announced their intentions to cut down emissions and reduce emission intensities respectively. This moment probably represents the last collaborative effort towards arriving at a mechanism of addressing climate change before 2020. Following the articulations at Cancun, the Kyoto Protocol was extended in 2012 under the Doha Amendment which was put in place to ratchet up commitments on emissions reductions and close the already widening emissions gap. Immediate actions kept on backburner Beyond this, the world shifted its attention to what must be done beyond 2020, leaving deliberations on more immediate actions on the backburner. The Paris Agreement no longer differentiated between developed and developing countries on the basis of historical responsibility, effectively putting the entire world on a single platform, with each country deciding domestic actions it intended to take up to reduce the emissions gap required to keep the global warming ideally under 1.5 degrees Celsius and under 2degC at the very least. The Doha Amendment, meanwhile, has been relegated to little more than quickly dissipating intentions. ""It is high time now for developed countries to keep their word on pre-2020 actions. If not now, when? Before we can address what needs to happen beyond 2020, this is an urgent matter at hand that has a bearing on how the world can move forward in achieving its goals stated in the Paris Agreement,"" Prasad told Down To Earth at COP. Doha Amendment in a limbo So, the outpouring of support for scaling up these actions is understandable and evidently needed. As 2017 draws to a close, one can't help wondering if this is too little too late, especially since the Doha Amendment seems to be going nowhere. Less than 60 per cent of the 144 required ratifications of the amendment have been reached so far-five years after the agreement was tabled. In fact, the demand for augmenting this agenda seems to fall flat, considering that even among LMDC countries, only around half of the 20-odd members have ratified the treaty. Even India, a vocal proponent of pre-2020 action over the past couple of COPs, ratified the amendment only in August this year. Similarly, Venezuela and Iran, both the countries that argued for immediate action, are yet to submit their instruments of ratification. When this is the state of affairs among developing nations which do not have to take up any emission reductions, one can only guess the level of seriousness with which developed countries view the commitments made under the agreement, making it an unlikely subject on which any progress will be made at this year's summit, three years from the end of the amendment's timeframe. Only about a dozen of the 70-odd developed countries have ratified the agreement so far with the EU being a notable absentee in the list of developed countries that have ratified the agreement. Unsurprisingly, the result has been a failure to meet the target related to finance, technology transfer and monitoring of climate actions. While the US did not sign the Doha Amendment, it is entirely plausible that the escalation of the issue this time round is fuelled by its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement announced earlier this year by President Donald Trump. Although members across various negotiating groups and representatives of the UNFCCC secretariat have almost desperately maintained that the withdrawal will have no impact on the future of climate negotiations, sources close to the negotiations have claimed that members are actively mulling over options for moving forward without one of the largest emitters on board, especially in light of the emissions gap report, which pointed out that even if all the pledges made as part of the national climate action plans under the Paris Agreement were implemented, the world would still be set for a 3degC rise in temperature. The US pull out of the agreement has brought into focus some pertinent issues: can countries be trusted to keep their commitments? How to hold them accountable to non-legally binding agreements? While it may be too late to expect any meaningful pre-2020 measures, a failure to recognise its importance in the context of the current geopolitical environment could spell doom for negotiations moving into the Paris Agreement era. On November 11, it will be clear whether or not pre-2020 action will be included in the agenda for the high-level negotiations at COP23 beginning next week Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Down to Earth.

"COP23","India","COP23_India113","United Kingdom : Climate Change Minister Claire Perry launches Powering Past Coal Alliance at COP23","November 18, 2017 Saturday","TendersInfo","An alliance of nations and states committed to moving the world from burning coal to cleaner power sources was launched today (16 November 2017) by more than 20 partners at COP23 , the United Nations climate change talks. The UK was one of the first countries to commit to ending unabated coal power generation by 2025. In July 2012, our generation profile still included 40% coal. In July this year, this fell to 2% and in April, the UK had its first full day when no coal was used for 135 years. The Powering Past Coal Alliance plans to grow to 50 or more members by this time next year. Its ambition is to lead the rest of the world in committing to an end to unabated coal power. The members of the alliance commit to taking action such as setting coal phase out targets, committing to no further investments in coal-fired electricity in their jurisdictions or abroad. Unabated coal is the generation of electricity from a coal plant without any treatment to reduce substantially the emissions of carbon dioxide. It emits twice as much CO2 as gas per unit of electricity. The announcement comes as the UK government prepares to launch its flagship Industrial Strategy to get the economy firing while building on its strengths like clean growth and embracing the opportunities of technological change. Claire Perry, Minister for Climate Change and Industry, said: Reducing global coal consumption should be a vital and urgent priority for all countries and states. Unabated coal is the dirtiest, most polluting way of generating electricity. The Powering Past Coal Alliance will signal to the world that the time of coal has passed. The UK is committed to completely phasing out unabated coal-fire power generation no later than 2025 and we hope to inspire others to follow suit. Catherine McKenna, Canadas Minister of Environment and Climate Change, said: Phasing out coal power is good news for the climate, for our health, and for our kids. Coal is literally choking our cities, with close to a million people dying every year from coal pollution. Im thrilled to see so much global momentum for the transition to clean energy and this is only the beginning. The new coalition will work with businesses, civil society and governments to offer technical and practical help to accelerate the transition away from coal. However, it recognises that not all countries can completely phase out the use of unabated coal at the same rate. To stay below the 2C target agreed as part of the Paris accord 2 years ago, OECD countries across the world need to phase out coal by 2030 and global use will need to reduce by two-thirds by 2040. Todays launch of the alliance comes after British Prime Minister Theresa May reiterated the UKs commitment to phase out unabated coal by 2025 in a joint press conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in September. In its first meeting, the alliance agreed that transitioning away from coal-fired electricity is one of the most important steps the international community can take to meet the aims of the historic Paris agreement at which the UK played a leading role 2 years ago. The UK has already begun its transition away from coal, in part as a result of renewable energy sources becoming cost effective. Offshore wind, for example, is now half the cost it was 2 years ago. Since 1990, the UK has reduced its emissions by 42%, while growing our economy by 67%. This is in no small part due to the 85% reduction in coal use weve seen in that time. However, domestic action alone is not enough. It is important that we restrict financing for coal projects abroad. The UK government announced in 2014 that it would end support for public financing of new coal-fired power plants overseas, except in rare circumstances. UK Export Finance has not supported a coal project since 2002. \"

Yet, we must confront the harsh reality: we are not doing enough to deal with this immense threat,"" da Silva said on Tuesday at the ongoing UN Climate Change Conference or COP 23 here. He stressed that least developed countries and small island developing states were ""particularly vulnerable"" to climate change. ""Noting that we should not be discouraged by the challenges ahead,"" the Food and Agriculture Organisation Director General stressed that achieving zero hunger by 2030 was still possible. ""Agriculture is where the fight against hunger and climate change come together to unlock solutions."" ""It is not enough to only transform the way we produce food. Climate change mitigation and adaptation must be integrated into the entire food system: from production to transportation, from processing to food consumption, and in both rural and urban areas,"" da Silva said. Climate change, hunger and poverty can and must be tackled together. The FAO recently announced that the number of undernourished people has increased for the first time again in a decade with 815 million people going hungry every day. This spike is mainly due to conflict and economic downturns, but also the impact of climate change, particularly prolonged droughts in Africa. Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change estimates show climate change might increase the risk of hunger and malnutrition by up to 20 per cent by 2050. Da Silva pointed to the fundamental role of food systems and agriculture which are heavily affected by climate change, but at the same time were also major drivers of climate change. Adopting climate-smart agricultural practices is the best option for sustainable agriculture. At least one-fifth of total greenhouse gas emission can be attributed to the agriculture sectors, da Silva said. Much more needs to be done to reduce these emissions and to simultaneously improve yields and build resilience, he said. This means adopting approaches such as agroecology and sustainable food systems, climate-smart intensification, among others. FAO's work includes supporting countries in improving their agricultural sectors; in adapting and building resilience, and in mitigating global warming through agriculture. It also assists countries monitor their Nationally Determined Contributions in terms of climate change and delivers the technical and financial support needed to turn these commitments into reality. At COP23 , the FAO launched a report, ""Tracking Adaptation in Agricultural Sectors"", that provides a framework and methodology to support to track climate change adaptation measures in the agricultural sectors.

The Teijin stand (number 6) will present environmental-value solutions that combine enhanced ecological and financial methods based on Teijins high-tenacity, lightweight and high-performance materials for reduced CO2 emissions and energy savings, including the following: Carbon Concrete is a sustainable solution for green-construction that can substitute for traditional steel-reinforced concrete. Carbon Concrete is used in prefabricated parts and for restoring buildings, streets and bridges. TENAX carbon fiber is an exceptionally versatile construction material offering excellent tenacity and five times the strength of steel. Carbon Concrete slabs made with TENAX can be relatively thin because they do not require a steel core to protect the composites from corrosion. Carbon Concrete dramatically reduces the quantity of concrete required, lowers logistics costs, speeds up construction, and shortens drying times. Twaron is a high-tensile-strength para-aramid fiber used in tires for automotive and aerospace applications.

"COP23","India","COP23_India120","Contemplating Coal's Controversy at COP23","November 29, 2017 Wednesday 6:30 AM EST","Contify Energy News","Nov. 29 -- Representing the coal industry at climate talks is never going to be an easy proposition. For many people, coal and climate action are incompatible'coal should be kept in the ground'. For many years we've been arguing that it's the emissions that need to be kept out of the air. This is a distinction that doesn't usually get a lot of traction at the annual climate talksuntil Bonn. The annual UN talks are incredibly important in working out how we're going to tackle climate change, alongside equally important challenges such as economic development, social equity and energy security. However, somewhere along the way the talks became much more polarised. Around the time of the Copenhagen talks back in 2009, when the ante was upped to such a degree that it felt as if we had two weeks to save the world, other considerations started to fall by the wayside. But not for everyone. Many countries have been trying to make it clear year-after-year that as much as they take the threat of climate change incredibly seriously; they take the economic development of their countries and the welfare of their people equally as seriously. Even after the landmark COP21 in Paris two years ago, when many people would ask me if this now meant the end for coal, 24 countries had actually outlined a role for coal and specifically low emission coal technologies, in meeting their Paris Agreement targets. This year's talks in Bonn have been interesting. Not necessarily for the content of the negotiations themselves, which have been very technical and detailed, as the 'rulebook' for the Paris Agreement is worked out, but because for the first time in many years it seems as if a little of the rhetoric has been balanced by a healthy dose of reality. I was interested to read a story this morning with the opening line ""Coal emerged as the surprise winner from two weeks of international climate talks in Germany"". While I don't think talking about 'winners and losers' in this context is particularly helpful, I did leave the talks last week feeling that reality had been more evident in Bonn. The much-reported US event on the role of fossil fuels and nuclear energy naturally became a focal point for noisy protests. However, it was also an event, as one observer commented, which broke ""into the echo chamber that conferences like this often foster"". As White House adviser David Banks said during the event: ""This panel is only controversial if we choose to bury our heads in the sand and ignore the realities of the global energy system"". In fact, the way in which the announcement of the UK-Canada-led 'Powering Past Coal Alliance' has been reported makes me think many people are thinking more realistically about solutions for coal. On the surface, a powerful anti-coal statement. In reality, a pledge that covers only 2% of global coal use. Understanding the reality of the huge role of coal in many parts of the world is not about turning our backs on climate change. It's about saying if this is what countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nigeria, India, China, Japan, the Philippines(the list goes on), are telling us about how they're going to meet their future energy needs, then we need to make sure this use is compatible with our climate targets. This includes low emission coal technologies but ultimately has to include a massive push on carbon capture and storage. The role of coal in our global energy system - and, just as importantly, in industries such as steel, cement, aluminium - is an inconvenient truth. In twenty years' time, the International Energy Agency says coal will still be the largest single source of electricity. Until we face up to this reality, we're going to find it very difficult to meet the Paris Agreement targets. In Bonn it seemed that this message is finally starting to get through.

"COP23","India","COP23_India121","India must take the lead in negotiations at COP 23 in Bonn","November 7, 2017 Tuesday","South Asia Monitor","New Delhi, Nov. 7 -- As the latest Conference of Parties ( COP 23 ) gets underway in Bonn, the focus is once again on emission targets for the developing world and the importance of bringing the US back to the negotiating table. The Paris accord was seen as a landmark agreement since it was negotiated by representatives of 196 parties at COP 21. As of October 2017, 195 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) members have signed the agreement. COP 23 at Bonn is the second one after Donald Trump's withdrawal of the US (which will come into effect in 2020. It is here that the rules for implementing the Paris agreement (which is not binding) will be negotiated. Developing countries fear that developed countries might shift more of the emission reduction burden on to them without having facilitated a transfer of technologies in the manner that enables the achievement of even existing targets. The pledges from developed countries in Paris remain unclear and the specifics are expected to become clearer at Bonn. Countries such as India and China continue to resist the imposition of steeper emission targets on developing nations, on the principle that those responsible for emissions historically must pay a price for it. Their position is that nations without the wherewithal to invest heavily in mitigation measures must not be penalised. India must use the opportunity at Bonn to take the lead in convincing developed countries to invest in technology transfer exercises more efficiently. Currently, India is set to achieve its emission reduction targets with no changes in policies, in spite of being the only one on the list of most polluting countries to have increased its emissions by almost 5% in 2016. India's energy requirements will only grow: large parts of the country remain off the electricity grid, and it continues to witness one of the world's largest rural to urban migrations. India also has a large coastline, and anthropogenic climate change and the resultant rise in sea levels will directly affect its citizens. Thus another important point to keep in mind at Bonn is adaptation. While most targets and negotiations focus on mitigation of climate change, countries likely to face the brunt of climate change must be concerned with the important issue of long-term finance to strengthen adaptation strategies in order to cope with the impact of climate change.

"COP23","India","COP23_India123","Christoph Frei Explores Decarbonising the Energy Sector Ahead of COP23","November 29, 2017 Wednesday 6:30 AM EST","Contify Energy News","Nov. 29 -- Is there a model for how national governments can create the right set of sustainable energy policies? There is no doubt that the energy sector worldwide is undergoing a dramatic transition in which governments are playing their part. Many attribute this transition to the need to prevent, or at least plan for the potential impact of, climate change whilst enabling access for billions more, new energy users and this in a context of dramatic innovation fuelled by electrification of final demand, decentralisation and digitalisation. The drive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions has certainly been a critical stimulus to the development of new technologies such as solar and wind, which are becoming increasingly competitive with traditional energy systems based on fossil fuels and nuclear. Focused, innovative, well designed energy policies are the key to tackling continued uncertainty and dynamic changes, if the goal of a sustainable energy future is to be achieved, as identified in our 2016 World Energy Council Energy Trilemma report presented at last year's Clean Energy Ministerial. The quest to finance the transition to a more sustainable energy system remains an issue that keeps energy leaders and policymakers busy at work, while there is a growing acknowledgement that adaptation to new resilience challenges, new digital solutions and smart innovation as well as regional interconnection will be key parts of the solution. If we are to successfully meet the Trilemma goals of security, sustainability and equity, leaders need to come up with innovative policies and look beyond the energy sector, which will require changes to the economy, to our transportation, manufacturing, construction and agricultural sectors. The forecasts for growth in the renewable energy sector have confounded many expectations. Do you think the current high levels of capacity can continue? We have seen a dramatic increase of unconventional resources and no less dramatic technology improvement in the renewables space over the past decade, in particular, driven by wind and solar. In 2015, the share of renewable energies in total global power generation was 23 %, exactly the same figure as in 1970. That is going to change within the next 45 years. In our latest World Energy Scenarios report, which sets out three potential pathways for the energy sector to 2060, we see a strong increase in the share of renewable energies. The share being up to two third by 2060 - depending on the respective scenario. In other words, most of the new power generation will be covered by renewables, with the use of coal as a prime energy source in decline. What are the main issues renewable energy will face once it becomes a mainstream energy source? Renewables such as solar, wind and hydropower now account for about 30% of the total installed power generating capacity and 23% of total global electricity production and will continue to grow. However, more progress is urgently needed to scale up action on energy efficiency. Given the intermittency of energy from renewable sources, we have to rethink the system from one where supply follows demand to one where demand follows supply. This will be enabled by progress in demand response, sector coupling, smart grids and ultimately an internet of things in energy, all different features of the digitalisation in energy. With a less concentrated, more materiel intense and more decentralised nature of the system issues such as recycling of (scarce) materials will also become more important. Are there any sectors in particular which are facing real challenges in being able to make the transition to a low-carbon future? Transitioning global transport currently forms one of the hardest obstacles to overcome in an effort to decarbonise future energy systems. Let's take Germany for example: Between 1990 and 2016, a reduction in CO2 emissions of 24 % was achieved, but the transport sector contributed 0 % to this development. However, according to our Scenarios work, globally, we will see an increase in the electric vehicle share of the light-duty vehicle fleet from 2.5 to 2.7 times by 2060. Oil's share in transport will decrease from 92 % today to 60 % in Unfinished Symphony, 67 % in Modern Jazz, and 78 % in Hard Rock. Advances in second and third generation biofuels make substantial headway in all three scenarios, ranging from 10 % in total transport fuel in 2060 in Hard Rock, 16 % in Modern Jazz, and 21 % in Unfinished Symphony. Modern Jazz and Unfinished Symphony see rapid penetration of electric and hybrid plug-in vehicles globally, which reflects 26 to 32 % of the light-duty vehicle fleet in 2060. We have recently seen France and the UK announcing the end of diesel and gasoline by 2040, the German parliament having discussed a similar measure possibly before that. Most importantly, China's government is considering such measure and if this happens it would be a game changer for transport as the world's largest vehicle market would then march to a tipping point and pull others to follow. The World Energy Council has just finished its world Energy Week and Executive Assembly. Were there any clear themes on sustainability which emerged from the discussions? Decarbonisation is only part of the transition story. Electrification of final demand combined with decentralisation and digitalisation define an incredible space of innovation in terms of technology and business models. Our 2017 World Energy Trilemma report assesses decentralisation and its potential impact on backbone infrastructure and discussions at the World Energy Week highlighted the related uncertainties and raise questions about solidarity, cyber security, and competition between incumbents and new players. The research behind our Energy Trilemma report this year, has attempted to gauge the potential impact of the energy transition, and in particular, decentralisation, on the wide range of energy systems that exist in different countries around the world. Renewables and digital innovation open-up opportunities for new entrants who can compete to provide prosumers with an array of new services, act as aggregators, deliver new form of supply and system support products, and compete with existing assets. Implications and opportunities differ greatly in developed countries with established transmission infrastructures, compared with developing and emerging countries where access to energy is still a major obstacle to be overcome and where rural entrepreneurs offer solutions in a space that previously was simply left in the dark. What is the World Energy Council's role in promoting responsive and responsible leadership? The Council is the largest global network of energy leaders and practitioners dedicated to delivering a sustainable energy system for the greatest benefit of all. Originally intended as an organisation to manage a gathering of energy experts, we have evolved into one of the world's most influential energy organisations with our leadership dialogue focused on the energy transition. We continue to deliver on our original goal by organising the world's largest all-energy event, the World Energy Congress, in addition to global and regional Energy Leaders Summits and Ministerial Roundtables as well as national dialogues aimed at supporting policymakers, experts and industry leaders as they seek solutions to shape and successfully master the transition. The Council also publishes authoritative studies - our World Energy Scenarios, Trilemma, Issues Monitor and innovation work - to help further the vision of a sustainable energy future and promote responsive and responsible leadership. As the UN-accredited global energy body, we work with governments, agencies and companies to help inform policy development and strategic decision-making and planning. Are there any new technologies or innovations in energy which are exciting you, or could be transformative in the future? If the Grand Transition is driven by a combination of factors including decarbonisation, electrification of final demand, decentralisation, digitalisation and resilience to new physical risks such as extreme weather, cyber or the energy water food nexus, a number of specific innovation areas capture particular attention. The one thing above everything else that is keeping energy leaders awake at night is the impact of digitalisation on the future of the energy system. New business models and digitalisation will define momentum on a path of innovation which will change the way we produce and use energy in industrialised and developing worlds; and how the resulting transformation will drive new realities and priorities in global energy governance. We see a world where big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence enable automated system analytics and instant demand response is very different from the analogue world where many leaders started their careers. Predictive maintenance and supply chain management can dramatically decrease outage times and offers entirely new opportunities in traffic and congestion management. We also see a world in which the internet of things and blockchains will enable direct and low-cost transactions between parties and between appliances is fast approaching, with at its core precisely recorded transactions in unfalsifiable ledgers that also open new possibilities for supply chain tracing and product labelling by fabrication origin, materials used or emissions caused. Blockchain is an issue that is currently on the top of Energy Leaders list of critical uncertainties. Other areas of critical interest are storage and e-mobility as these have great potential to accelerate decarbonisation in transport or new platform business models as these have the potential to leverage existing assets in new utilisation areas - think of fridges or electric boilers aggregated to electric storage services. Last but not least, mobile banking supported by cloud technology is already today enabling micro-leasing schemes for rural household in the developing world and revolutionising opportunities also in the energy access space. These new technologies and business models will not only change the way we operate the energy system but will revolutionise the potential for a sharing and leasing economy in energy. Do you have any aspirations for what COP23 can, or should, achieve? Do you have a key message to attendees? The UN Climate Change Conference ( COP23 Fiji) in Bonn comes at a time when it is no longer sufficient to maintain the momentum. In the past 45 years, the average rate of decarbonisation has been around 1% per year. To keep temperature rises below 2C, this needs to be 6% per year. This requires a revolution, not an evolution. Another way of trying to put a value on the rate of decarbonisation is to look at fossil reserves. We currently have an equivalent of 2,800 Gt CO2 in proven reserves of coal, oil and gas, but to not exceed the 2C target, we could only emit 1,000 Gt of CO2. Behind these figures hides potential for geopolitical tension, which has to be overcome. The Paris climate change deal got us one third of the way to meeting the temperature change target and we see many countries introducing concrete steps post Paris. We now need to take the next leap in closing the ambition gap, delivering on implementation and accelerating on innovation. The world is now on a trajectory where only a climate of innovation will allow us to navigate the way to a truly sustainable energy future for the greatest benefit of all.

"COP23","India","COP23_India125","COP23 at Bonn: ""US still in"", say dissenting senators, but sense of crisis still palpable","November 12, 2017 Sunday","Down To Earth","India, Nov. 12 -- ""As far as we are concerned, COP stands for Climate outlasts Presidents,"" said US Senator Ed Markey as he addressed a press conference on the sidelines of the climate change summit being held in Bonn. Five Democratic senators from the US came out in a show of support for the Paris Agreement here today. They are part of a parallel delegation of the US under the aegis of ""Still In"" made up of dissenting senators, governors, mayors and members of the civil society, which, over the past week, has been trying to reassure the rest of the world assembled in Germany for CoP23 that the American people still support the Paris accord to limit global warming to well under two degrees Celsius. ""We are still in. There is no question about it. One person does not speak for the entire federal government. We believe President Trump's statement to be detrimental to American and global interests and security. We are here to reassure the world that we will live up to our commitments,"" emphasised Senator Cardin, kicking off the press interaction in Bonn. ""Trump is isolated in the world and in the US and American law obligates work on climate change to safeguard American futures,"" said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island hinting at legal action against the current administration in the event of failure to act on environmental protection and climate change. The senators harped on grassroots actions in the US in the wake of Trump's announcement of the intention to pull the US out of the historic accord. ""Grassroots America is committed to fulfilling the obligations and several states across the country are leading by example. The local action in all sectors from energy to infrastructure and transport has been overwhelming,"" said senator Markey. Hawaiian senator Brian Schatz asserted that climate action riding on dropping prices of renewables was the ""future"" and was ""unstoppable"". Progress on transition to cleaner energy has slowed down By the senators' own admission during the presser, fossil fuel interests in the country had slowed down the transition to low-emission alternatives in energy through front groups that had been lobbying for policies and decisions favourable to fossil fuel industry. ""We have seen that the fossil fuel industry has deployed front groups and lobbyists to push through policies that run completely antithetical to the stance made in public regarding climate change and the contribution of fossil fuels to it,"" exclaimed Whitehouse. Despite the confidence portrayed by the senators, it is fairly clear that dissenters in the US face an uphill battle in meeting all the obligations made by previous administrations without the support of the current one. One of the key areas where it would be evident is the financial commitment made by the Obama administration. Donald Trump mentioned Green Climate Fund as a drain on the American economy in his withdrawal speech on June 1 and has proposed deep cuts in the budget for aid to be sent overseas to help tackle climate change in vulnerable countries. ""Financing is a problem but we have been exploring other avenues to step up soft loans and lines of credit overseas,"" said Senator Cardin. Senator Schatz admitted that financial commitments were not likely to be met on time in light of Trump's cuts. Up against an uphill challenge While the group claimed that it had bipartisan support on several issues, including transition to renewables, the panel had no Republican representatives to back this claim. The parallel delegation is separate from the 48-member official delegation from the US, which has been at the table at key meetings and negotiations on the Paris Agreement despite the announcement of withdrawal made by Trump. While the involvement of the official delegation has been cautiously viewed as something that cannot be compromised on to ensure the possibility of the US rejoining at a later date, reports have also emerged that American delegates have been working behind the scenes to object to the push for pre-2020 actions and obstructing the advancement of the agenda for repatriations to developing and vulnerable countries for Loss and Damages due to climate change. The senators, for their part, refused to comment specifically on the negotiating team present in Bonn, claiming no knowledge of the same and downplaying any obstructionist role that the negotiating team was pursuing. In fact, the senators expressed belief that the continuance of a negotiating role for the US was good for the country and the world despite negotiators representing precisely the same things that the senators seem to be up against. ""I can't claim to know anything about any obstructionism by American negotiators but we do believe that maintaining trust and working with the world now is a greater challenge in light of the President's comments,"" said senator Cardin. Questions to American negotiators about the US' stance on climate change have been met with almost adversarial silence. Although the senators seem to have made the right noises, it remains to be seen whether there is any substance behind the noise or whether the senators are simply using the stage to politick against their President.

At the conference, the UK and Canada launched the 'Powering Past Coal Alliance', a global coalition to phase out traditional coal power. Sweden and more than 20 other countries have already joined the alliance. ""Coal accounts for a large share of global emissions, and a rapid phase-out of coal power is essential to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. Sweden therefore wholeheartedly supports the alliance,"" says Ms Lvin. A two-year gender action plan (GAP) for gender-responsive implementation of the Paris Agreement was also adopted at the conference. The GAP will ensure women's participation in negotiations and decision-making processes. It is also gratifying that the £ction agenda', which gathers civil society actors, is larger than ever and has contributed positive momentum to the negotiations. The first Yearbook of Climate Action, capturing climate actions taken since 2016, was launched at the conference. The Yearbook shows that 70 per cent of the initiatives have launched new commitments since 2016 and that around half of these have set emissions reduction targets. The participation of civil society in reducing emissions will play a vital role in achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. \"

The platform includes youth, indigenous people, frontline communities, advocates and policymakers who have come to Bonn with organisations from across the United States. They have come together to show what climate leadership should look like during the 23rd annual climate change talks of the parties or COP23 at the UN Climate Change Conference. The People's Delegation and the organisations involved are taking action to protect communities and isolate the US administration by demanding a fossil-free future and real climate action at the local level. Other prominent demands include a just and equitable transition to 100 per cent renewable energy in all cities and states. ""I have seen climate change-fuelled floods destroy lives and livelihoods where my family is from India. In southern India, thousands of farmers have committed suicide because of drought,"" Varshini Prakash of SustainUS and Sunrise Movement said. ""Within my lifetime, my home in the States could be underwater if we do nothing to stop climate change. No one should have to live in fear of losing the people that they love or the places that they come from,"" Prakash added. In his inaugural remarks, Fiji President Frank Bainimarama, who is chairing the COP23 , said there was a need to keep the climate action commitments in full and not back away from them. COP23 , coming just two years after the landmark adoption of the Paris Climate Change Agreement, will also further fuel momentum among cities, states, regions, territories, business and civil society in support of national climate action plans. In June, US President Donald Trump announced his administration's intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, throwing into doubt its role at UN climate talks and related bodies like the Green Climate Fund. COP23 , attention will turn to whether the US and its allies will continue to advance an agenda focused mainly on mitigation, carbon markets and transparency of action, while neglecting or foot-dragging on other key issues such as adaptation, loss and damage, finance, technology transfer, capacity building, transparency of support and compliance. --IANS vg/nir/bg \"

""That is why Fiji has been so determined to help build a grand coalition of governments at every level -- civil society, private sector and faith-based organisations -- and to connect this effort to as many of the 7.5 billion citizens of the planet as possible,"" he said. Bainimarama opened the 23rd annual climate change talks of the parties or COP23 that is held under the presidency of Fiji. Pleading for the world to collectively hold the climate action course set in 2015, he said he was representing one of the most climate-vulnerable regions on earth. ""The need for urgency is obvious. Our world is in distress from the extreme weather events caused by climate change -- destructive hurricanes, fires, floods, droughts, melting ice and changes to agriculture that threaten our food security. All consistent with the science that now tells us that 2016 was a record year for carbon emissions,"" he said.

COP 23 in Bonn till November 17 in the backdrop of the US decision in June to pull out of the climate agreement. India should defend the essence and spirit of the Paris Agreement, said New Delhi-headquartered policy research institute Council on Energy, Environment and Water. India has already and must reiterate not only its own commitment to the Paris Agreement but also continue to demand greater action by the largest historical polluters, its Chief Executive Officer Arunabha Ghosh told IANS. ""India will have to ensure that the design of the enhanced transparency mechanism retains sufficient flexibility for developing countries to build the capacity for more frequent and detailed reporting and review,"" he added. ""For me, there are two aspects that make this progress very important. Firstly, there is a technical dimension: the shift taking place in China has helped bring the technology such as solar and energy storage to scale. This has helped drive down prices and make renewable energy solutions incredibly competitive. ""Secondly, there is an important moral dimension. Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi has described climate action as an article of faith, saying that inaction would be a crime against future generations. While the conference ( COP23 ) is grounded in practicalities and technicalities, it's important to never lose sight of this moral dimension,"" Solheim told IANS a day ahead of the onset of the climate talks. The UNEP head foresees the US playing a big role at the Bonn talks on shaping the Paris Agreement. ""We certainly hope that will be the case. There's been a season of devastating wildfires and hurricanes, and this highlights the importance of the climate change issue to the US. We sincerely hope that will change and, therefore, continued constructive US involvement in the process is welcome,"" an optimistic Solheim added. Representing 12 Pacific Island nations, the Pacific Climate Warriors reminded the world leaders of the urgency for action. ""We are here to push world leaders to show real climate leadership: end the era of fossil fuels, and build a just, renewable future for all,"" said George Nacewa, one of the Pacific Climate Warriors. Interestingly, a new analysis from Carbon Brief published on Monday showed that if Trump withdraws the US from its climate finance commitments then Britain would be the world's leading contributor of funding to climate projects around the world. The analysis shows that India is the biggest recipient of climate finance. ""As Britain forges a new role for itself on the world stage post Brexit, it has the potential to become a true green leader,"" an official statement quoting British charity Christian Aid's International Climate lead Mohamed Adow said. Allies like Commonwealth countries ""are very vulnerable to extreme weather and rising sea levels"", so British investment in climate response must show it was taking the needs of developing countries seriously, he added.

""Additional and early pre-2020 actions by developed countries under the Kyoto Protocol and provision of finance, technology transfer and capacity building support to developing countries are critical for limiting the global temperature rise to two degrees Celsius by end of the century,"" he said. Saying this Conference of Parties ( COP 23 ) is crucial as it would set the stage for the 2018 Facilitative Dialogue, accelerate pre-2020 action and firm up the modalities for implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement, the Minister said India has undertaken ambitious mitigation and adaptation actions. The actions are in the field of clean energy, especially renewable energy, enhancement of energy efficiency, development of less carbon intensive and resilient urban centers and promotion of waste to wealth and efforts to enhance carbon sink through creation of forest and tree cover. Planned actions and economic reforms, he said, have contributed positively to the rapidly declining growth rate of energy intensity in India. ""India has taken ambitious targets in its Nationally Determined Contributions and is on path for achieving those."" Tracing India's historical ties with Fiji, under whose presidency this summit is being held, Vardhan said: ""We appreciate the initiative by the Fijian Presidency for adopting the Bula spirit of inclusiveness for guiding climate change discussions and action."" ""India supports an inclusive approach and believes that citizens are important stakeholders and must also be included in this process. I think if all global citizens contribute to 'green good deeds', the challenge of combating climate change shall become more manageable."" Going forward, he said: ""We expect the COP 23 outcomes are balanced and reached upon through a party-driven process. They should not result in reinterpretation of the Paris Agreement and equal progress should be made on all pillars."" Complimenting the world leaders for their resolution to uphold the Paris Agreement, the Minister said: ""This is only the beginning. The task ahead is its effective operationalization in accordance with the agreed principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.""

The more important is time. When,"" a negotiator representing a developing nation told IANS. He said these are the fundamental questions with which negotiators from 197 governments were grappling with as the conference is close to its scheduled culmination. At Bonn, India reiterated provisions for finance -- both for adaptation and mitigation, technology transfer for climate actions from the developed nations. A day after a major victory for India and developing countries on climate action before 2020 that the developed world agreed to discuss in subsequent two years, India's Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Harsh Vardhan said provisions for finance, technology transfer and capacity building support to developing nations are critical. Stressing that this Conference of Parties ( COP23 ) is crucial as it would set the stage for the 2018 Facilitative Dialogue, accelerate pre-2020 action and firm up the modalities for implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement, he said India has undertaken ambitious mitigation and adaptation action. The action is in the fields of clean energy, especially renewable energy; enhancement of energy efficiency; development of less carbon-intensive and resilient urban centers; and promotion of waste-to-wealth and efforts to enhance carbon sink through creation of forest and tree cover. On the demand of BASIC countries (Brazil, South Africa, India and China), Fiji, which is presiding over the conference, has also been asked to send letters to all the countries which are yet to ratify the Doha amendments to the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 to do so ""as soon as possible"". The developed countries have also been asked to give information by May 1 next year on the progress they have made on pre-2020 action that relates to their obligations under the Kyoto Protocol that includes reduction of emissions and transfer of technology and finance. India had been demanding since the start of the climate summit on November 6 that pre-2020 climate action be included in the formal agenda of the negotiations. The developed world had so far been resisting this. The BASIC countries also emphasised the need for openness, transparency and the country-driven nature of negotiations at the annual summit. In addition to the commitment to discuss how to scale up climate action, countries made modest progress in developing a negotiating text for ""the Paris Rulebook"" comprising the guidelines needed for the implementation of the Paris Agreement. In reaction to progress of the talks, Director of Climate Action Network (CAN) Europe, Wendel Trio, said: ""Limited progress has been made on the tangible issues related to climate finance and how to deal with the catastrophic impacts of climate change, such as those that a number of vulnerable countries have witnessed in the previous months."" ""Agreements only cover the process to further discuss these issues and adequate action has again been delayed. ""The Talanoa Dialogue roadmap should help countries bridge the gap between what they have committed to do and what is needed to keep temperature rise to safe levels. We need to go much further and faster, the current snail's pace of the talks does not match the urgency of climate action nor the speed of the renewable energy transition on the ground,"" Trio added. Talanoa is the Pacific tradition of decision-making based on respect and understanding to a negotiating process that has often lacked both. Christian Aid's International Climate Lead, Mohamed Adow, said this year's meeting showed an encouraging appetite for action on emissions before 2020. He said despite that progress, COP23 still failed to deliver the financial support needed to accelerate the efforts of developing countries wanting to follow a clean energy path.

"COP23","India","COP23_India135","India needs a strong narrative at COP23 to push its climate goals","November 13, 2017 Monday","Down To Earth","India, Nov. 13 -- The first week of negotiations saw negligible progress on critical issues such as finance, adaptation and loss and damage. An adaptation-centric draft text submitted by the G77 and China group for the evolution of a work plan on issues related to agriculture was accepted during the last session of discussions, signalling progress from the point of view of developing nations. On technical issues such as global stocktake and enhanced transparency framework, negotiations are evolving with no real breakthrough till now. India's efforts for aligning with other Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDC) to push for inclusion of pre-2020 actions in the COP agenda has failed even after one week of negotiations on the issue. Further discussions are now slated to take place during the second week of COP, following which a decision on negotiations during 2018 will be arrived at. There has been no progress on finance, which is pre-requisite to implement Paris Agreement. Same has been the case with other agenda items. India did not quite articulate its success with regard to 2020 commitments India's position on pre-2020 actions could have been strengthened by showcasing its fulfillment of its 2020 commitments. The 2020 commitments are under the Cancun Pledges (2010), under which India promised to reduce its emission intensity by 20-25 per cent against 2005 levels by 2020. Several reports suggest that India is well on way to surpass its targets. Climate Action Tracker shows India is on track for a 36 per cent reduction by 2020. The 2015 report by PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency shows that India is on track for a 28 per cent reduction by 2020. The same reports say that China is also on its way to meet its 2020 targets. Indian negotiators brought up the success in achieving its targets late into the discussions, just a day before the closing plenary of the first week of negotiations, at the press conference held by LMDC nations. Stressing on its success with regard to 2020 commitments would have positioned India as sincere player, making serious efforts to address climate change. It would also have placed it in a better bargaining position to demand enhanced action and efforts from other developed countries. Unfortunately, in the deliberations, India has failed to articulate its position along such lines. The result is repeating of rhetoric, which has not resulted in substantive outcomes. India's stand on climate-induced loss and damage not yet clear On climate-induced loss and damage, which impacts developing countries most, owing to their vulnerability, there has been no clear Indian position on loss and damage. It would be in Indian interest to push for substantial fund on the table regarding loss and damage, in alignment with other developing countries. India has made submission on adaptation communications, which is meant to gain clarity on assessing adaptation needs and countries' efforts towards adaptation. The submission points need to reflect equity and support in adaptation. Issues of enhanced transparency framework, global stocktake and accounting require experts with strong knowledge base to make technical deliberations which the current delegation lacks. While EU and China have been eager to take up the leadership role after the US announced its decision to pull out of the Paris climate pact, India has shown reluctance.

COP23 , coming just two years after the landmark adoption of the Paris Climate Change Agreement, will also further fuel momentum among cities, states, regions, territories, business and civil society in support of national climate action plans. Close to 20 country leaders are expected to attend, including President Emmanuel Macron of France and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. --IANS vg/in/vm \"

"COP23","India","COP23_India139","Canada : Governor Brown Welcomes Norway to Under2 Climate Coalition","August 3, 2017 Thursday","TendersInfo","Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today welcomed Norway to the Under2 Coalition - the global pact of cities, states and countries committed to limiting the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius, the level of potentially catastrophic consequences. ""In the face of irreversible climate change, the world's cities, states and countries must decarbonize and get on a sustainable path,"" said Governor Brown. ""California is proud to partner with Norway in this fight."" ""I am very grateful for Governor Brown's leadership on climate change over the last decades. Norway and California are both dedicated to the low-emission future we need. The Governor's decision to host a major climate summit in September 2018 will show the world that the U.S. is making progress regardless of federal policies. Norway is very pleased to join the coalition of forward leaning states and countries in the Under2 Coalition, and is prepared to contribute financially and otherwise to the implementation of this important initiative,"" said Minister Helgesen. With the addition of Norway's endorsement, the Under2 Coalition now includes 177 jurisdictions on six continents that collectively represent more than 1.2 billion people and $28.8 trillion GDP - equivalent to over 16 percent of the global population and 39 percent of the global economy. Norway is the 16th country to endorse the Under2 Coalition. The Under2 Coalition, the collective of governments who have signed or endorsed the Under2 MOU, was formed in 2015 by the states of California and Baden-Wrttemberg, Germany to mobilize and galvanize bold climate action from like-minded city, state and regional governments around the globe. Coalition members pledge to limit greenhouse gas emissions to 2 tons per capita or 80-95 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. In addition to the Under2 Coalition, Governor Brown is leading a number of initiatives to strengthen the collaboration between governments, businesses and other partners committed to curbing carbon pollution. In June, Governor Brown was named Special Advisor for States and Regions ahead of this year's United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 23 ) by the Prime Minister of Fiji Frank Bainimarama - incoming president of COP 23 . This followed meetings with Germany's top environmental official, Minister Barbara Hendricks, in San Francisco, and with China's President Xi Jinping during the Governor's week-long trip to China. Last week, Governor Brown signed landmark legislation that extends and improves the state's world-leading cap-and-trade program and establishes a groundbreaking program to measure and combat air pollution at the neighborhood level. In recent years, Governor Brown has signed landmark climate legislation to establish the most ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in North America; set the nation's toughest restrictions on destructive super pollutants; direct cap-and-trade funds to greenhouse gas reducing programs which benefit disadvantaged communities, support clean transportation and protect natural ecosystems; and require the state to generate half of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and double the rate of energy efficiency savings in buildings. The Governor has also traveled to the United Nations' 2015 Climate Conference (COP 21) in Paris, the United Nations headquarters in New York, the Vatican and the Climate Summit of the Americas in Toronto, Canada to call on other leaders to join California in the fight against climate change. These efforts build on a number of other international climate change agreements with leaders from the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Mexico, China, North America, Japan, Israel, Peru, Chile, Australia, Scotland, Sweden, Germany and Fiji as well as Governor Brown's efforts to gather hundreds of researchers and scientists around a groundbreaking call to action called the consensus statement, which translates key scientific climate findings from disparate fields into one unified document. California, the sixth-largest economy in the world, continues to advance its nation-leading climate goals while also growing its economy faster than the rest of the United States. In the past seven years, California has created more than 2.5 million new jobs, cut its unemployment rate in half, eliminated a $27 billion budget deficit and boosted its credit rating to the highest level in more than a decade. \"

Brown Jr., New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Washington State Governor Jay Inslee today announced the formation of the United States Climate Alliance, a coalition that will convene U.S. states committed to upholding the Paris Climate Agreement and taking aggressive action on climate change. ""The President has already said climate change is a hoax, which is the exact opposite of virtually all scientific and worldwide opinion,"" said Governor Brown. ""I don't believe fighting reality is a good strategy - not for America, not for anybody. If the President is going to be AWOL in this profoundly important human endeavor, then California and other states will step up."" California, New York and Washington, representing over one-fifth of U.S. Gross Domestic Product, are committed to achieving the U.S. goal of reducing emissions 26-28 percent from 2005 levels and meeting or exceeding the targets of the federal Clean Power Plan. ""The White House's reckless decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement has devastating repercussions not only for the United States, but for our planet. This administration is abdicating its leadership and taking a backseat to other countries in the global fight against climate change,"" said Governor Cuomo. ""New York State is committed to meeting the standards set forth in the Paris Accord regardless of Washington's irresponsible actions. We will not ignore the science and reality of climate change which is why I am also signing an Executive Order confirming New York's leadership role in protecting our citizens, our environment, and our planet."" ""I am proud to stand with other governors as we make sure that the inaction in D.C. is met by an equal force of action from the states,"" said Governor Inslee. ""Today's announcement by the president leaves the full responsibility of climate action on states and cities throughout our nation. While the president's actions are a shameful rebuke to the work needed to protect our planet for our children and grandchildren, states have been and will continue to step up."" Together, California, New York and Washington represent approximately 68 million people - nearly one-in-five Americans - and the states account for at least 10 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. California will continue to work closely together with other states to help fill the void left by the federal government. With input from all participants, the U.S. Climate Alliance will also act as a forum to sustain and strengthen existing climate programs, promote the sharing of information and best practices, and implement new programs to reduce carbon emissions from all sectors of the economy. Today's announcement complements the Under2 Coalition - an international pact among cities, states and countries to limit the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius, the level of potentially catastrophic consequences - formed in 2015 by California and Baden-Wrttemberg, Germany in the lead up to COP21. The growing coalition now includes 170 jurisdictions on six continents that collectively represent more than 1.18 billion people and $27.5 trillion GDP - equivalent to 16 percent of the global population and 37 percent of the global economy. Eighteen U.S. jurisdictions, including climate alliance co-chairs New York and Washington State, have joined the Under2 Coalition, representing 89 million people and 28 percent of the U.S. population. The Governor's upcoming trip to China includes meetings in Sichuan and Jiangsu, the first Chinese provinces to join the Under2 Coalition. Building on the global momentum to combat climate change and continuing California's leading role in broadening collaboration amongst subnational leaders, Governor Brown will travel to China tomorrow to strengthen California's long-standing climate, clean energy and economic ties with the nation. The Governor will also attend the 2017 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ) in Bonn, Germany to represent subnational jurisdictions that remain committed to climate action. Earlier today, Governor Brown issued a statement reaffirming California's ongoing commitment to aggressive action on climate change and last month called on the administration to keep the United States in the Paris Climate Agreement. California, the sixth-largest economy in the world, has advanced its nation-leading climate goals while also growing the economy. In the last seven years, California has created 2.3 million new jobs - outpacing most of the United States - cut its unemployment rate in half, eliminated a $27 billion budget deficit and has seen its credit rating rise to the highest level in more than a decade. In March, Governor Brown reaffirmed California's commitment to exceed the targets of the Clean Power Plan and the state's efforts to curb carbon pollution, which include establishing the most ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in North America and the nation's toughest restrictions on destructive super pollutants. The Governor has also signed legislation that directs cap-and-trade funds to greenhouse gas reducing programs which benefit disadvantaged communities, support clean transportation and protect natural ecosystems. This action builds on landmark legislation the Governor signed in October 2015 to generate half of the state's electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and double the rate of energy efficiency savings in California buildings. Governor Brown has also committed to reducing today's petroleum use in cars and trucks by up to 50 percent within the next 15 years; make heating fuels cleaner; and manage farm and rangelands, forests and wetlands so they can store carbon. \"

The Bonn Conference of the State Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNTCC), informally known as COP 23 and which runs until 17 November, is chaired by Fiji, an island State particularly affected by the impacts of our warming climate. The need for urgency is obvious. Our world is in distress from the extreme weather events caused by climate change destructive hurricanes, fires, floods, droughts, melting ice, and changes to agriculture that threaten our food security, said COP 23 President and Prime Minister of Fiji Frank Bainimarama, at the opening of the conference. Our job as leaders is to respond to that suffering with all means available to us. [We] must not fail our people. That means using the next two weeks and the year ahead to do everything we can to make the Paris Agreement work and to advance ambition and support for climate action before 2020. The Paris Agreement, which was adopted by the 196 Parties to the UNFCCC in December 2015 in the French capital after which it is named, calls on countries to combat climate change by limiting the rise of global temperature below 2 degrees Celsius and strive not to exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius. A year ago, the Marrakech Climate Conference concluded with the Marrakech Action Proclamation, for our climate and sustainable development, in which the UNFCCC States Parties affirmed their commitment to the full implementation of the Paris Agreement. On Monday, 169 Parties have ratified the Agreement. UN weather agency warns 2017 to be among hottest years ever As this years Conference got under way, the UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO), released its provisional statement on the State of the Climate. It is very likely that 2017 will be one of the three hottest years on record, with many high-impact events including catastrophic hurricanes and floods, debilitating heatwaves and drought, said the agency. For his part, WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas told delegates in Bonn that the past three years have all been in the top three years in terms of temperature records. This is part of a long term warming trend, pointing to recent extraordinary weather, including temperatures topping 50 degrees Celsius in Asia, record-breaking hurricanes in rapid succession in the Caribbean and Atlantic reaching as far as Ireland, devastating monsoon flooding affecting many millions of people and a relentless drought in East Africa. Wherever we live, we are all vulnerable and need to act, Bainimarama told delegates, explaining that Fiji is helping build a Grand Coalition for decisive, coordinated action by governments at every level, by civil society, the private sector and all citizens on earth. Thats why we installed an ocean-going Fijian drua canoe in the entrance here to remind everyone of the need to fill its sail with collective determination to make COP23 a success and confront the biggest challenge humanity has faced, he said. Patricia Espinosa, UNFCCC Executive Secretary, reminded the participants that: We have some very specific goals we must achieve while we are here in Bonn. We expect these negotiations to be the next essential step that ensures that the Paris Agreements structure is completed, its impacts are strengthened, and its goals achieved. We also need to move forward to fulfil the commitments that are due in 2020. In this regard, finance and mitigation pledges are essential. The Bonn Conference will feature a series of meetings and events, including the high-level segment, on 15 November and 16 November, attended by Heads of State and Government, Ministers, and UN Secretary-General Antnio Guterres. Guterres has invited leaders to consider championing six high-impact areas at a special Climate Summit in 2019. These areas are investment in clean technology, maturing carbon pricing, enabling the energy transition, risk mitigation and building resilience, augmenting the contribution of sub-national actors and business and mobilizing climate finance. Among the side events scheduled at COP 23 , several will be organized under the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action, to show how cities, regions, private sector companies and investors are trying to implement the Paris Agreement in the areas of energy, water, agriculture, oceans and coastal areas, human settlements, transportation, industry, and forests.

COP23 , the PIPA team hosted a side event in cooperation with Asian partners from a eco village development project. The side event had the slogan promote local climate solutions to end poverty. The key messages of the side event were that there is an urgent need for stronger NDCs that include low emission solutions to increase energy access and improve livelihoods to reduce poverty. Already at this stage of the project, there are indications of tangible results from all 3 countries. This is especially seen in relation to an increase in inclusion of civil society in the political processes of the NDC adjustments and Paris Agreement implementation. An example is TaTEDO which now has been recognised as a key player when it comes to climate change by the Vice Presidents Office - Department of Environment. In addition, NGOs are increasingly invited as resource persons in climate change related issues. TaTEDO for instance, has been invited to participate in a team of experts to review the ongoing NDC assessment. In Kenya, the relations with the Climate Change Directorate has improved. This is evidenced by a significant increase in invitations for SusWatch-Kenya and its members for government meetings including climate finance, revision of national plans and pre- COP23 planning meetings. From March to May 2018, an external evaluation is planned to assess the impacts of the PIPA project. The main emphasis of the evaluation will be on evaluating the approach of national and regional cooperations on joint advocacy applied in the PIPA project.

Sixteen nations have submitted the formal Instrument of Ratification. They include Bangladesh, Fiji, France, Ghana, Guinea, India, Mauritius, Seychelles, Somalia and South Sudan. ""The ISA is going to a legal entity on December 6,"" Anand Kumar, Secretary in India's Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, told IANS. He's part of the Indian delegation to carry forward the negotiations at the ongoing UN Climate Change Conference ( COP-23 ) in this German city. Kumar said the ISA has been working for tapping 1,000 GW of solar energy by 2030 in its partner countries. On the postponment of the first ISA summit in India that French President Emmanuel Macron was expected to attend on December 9, he said a new date would be announced as per the availability of French President and the Indian Prime Minister. ""There is no date as such fixed for the summit. We have informed the member countries about the deferment of the December summit at this conference ( COP-23 ),"" he added. ISA is the first international intergovernmental treaty-based organisation headquartered in India. Likewise, the second edition of Global Renewable Energy Investors Meet and Expo -- RE-INVEST 2017, scheduled next month in Greater Noida in India has been postponed to April 19-21 next year. France is India's partner in both the ISA summit and RE-INVEST 2017. Earlier this month, the ISA and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development signed the Joint Financial Partnership Declaration in New Delhi to deepen the cooperation to promote renewables. The ISA's main objective is to undertake the joint efforts required to reduce the cost of finance and the cost of technology and mobilise more than $1,000 billion of investments needed by 2030 for the massive deployment of solar energy. A report by the US-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) says India's renewables' boom is attracting the attention of a diverse range of leading overseas investors, including banks, utilities, pension funds and asset managers. They include Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, the Macquarie Group, Sembcorp, Enel, EDF, Engie, SoftBank and Brookfield. The report, authored by Tim Buckley, Director of Energy Finance Studies Australasia with the IEEFA, and energy finance analyst Simon Nicholas, says overseas investors are now seeking more opportunities in Indian renewable projects. According to financial experts in India, there is a noticeable spike in solar investment by Chinese firms. ""Chinese investments in Indian coal projects have been declining. At the same time, Chinese investments in India on solar projects are slowly increasing,"" Jai Sharda, a founding partner with Indian equity research firm Equitorials, told IANS. Greenpeace India senior campaigner Nandikesh Shivalingam said it is an opportunity for China to play a much more positive role.

But the sudden removal of chief climate negotiator Nazhat Shameem Khan last month, despite praise for her leadership, revealed a rift between the Geneva-based diplomat and capital Suva. In exclusive interviews with Climate Home News, insiders said this eventually led to her ousting, with Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama taking the consultants' side. They raised concerns that Fiji ceding control to unaccountable professionals jeopardised a critical year of climate talks. ""In the world of [UN climate negotiations], to see a small island state in the presidency being closely managed and controlled by consultants from developed countries is not good for trust and goodwill,"" a source from the Fiji delegation told Climate Home News. ""But [the consultants] refused to take a back seat and we had difficulties in relation to this."" Another member of the national staff, contacting CHN independently, said: ""Most of their advice and interference was harmful rather than helpful... They undermined us and didn't understand the local dimensions."" Both sources spoke on condition of anonymity. Fijian PM Statement 070318 by Megan Darby on Scribd No response at first CHN asked Bainimarama's office about the circumstances surrounding Shameem Khan's removal, specifically about her objections regarding consultants. But no response was made to this point. Writing to Climate Home News prior to publication, Bainimarama said any suggestion the country had been unduly influenced was ""false and mischievous"". After this article was published, he issued a further statement, embedded above. Fiji Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama visiting Bonn Zone during COP23 ... his speech in Parliament this week spoke of ""a rejuvenated team"". Image: COP23 .com In a speech to the Fijian Parliament on Monday, Bainimarama alluded to the deterioration in the relationship. After thanking Shameem Khan for her work, he said the country needed ""a rejuvenated team unquestionably willing to work with all members of the COP23 [climate talks] presidency"". Her replacement Luke Daunivalu, Fiji's permanent representative to the UN in New York, was ""a team player"", said Bainimarama, with the ""personal qualities and experience to shape the consensus for more ambition the world needs to reach"". Sources said Shameem Khan raised the concerns in this article with Bainimarama and his attorney general Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum over the past six months, as well as directly asking the consultants to keep a low profile. Lead diplomat: Bonn climate talks must 'restate vision of Paris' Fiji's presidency of the climate talks centred on the UN Conference of Parties (COP) in Bonn in November 2017 and will continue throughout 2018 to COP24. To help with the huge undertaking, the Fijian government hired consultants, including law firm Baker McKenzie, climate experts Systemiq and public relations specialists Qorvis. An Australian, John Connor, was appointed as executive director. It is not unusual for national delegations, particularly small or poor countries with limited capacity, to take external advice. They were paid through funds donated by other countries, with the bulk coming from the developed world. Fiji wins chalked up The consultants chalked up wins for Fiji, brokering a $50 million green bond for the island nation and coordinating ""America's Pledge"" with California governor Jerry Brown and business leader Mike Bloomberg. Initially, Shameem Khan and her team relied on consultants, UN officials and former presidents of the climate talks to bring them up to speed on the issues and processes. As they became more knowledgeable, though, they quickly came to question the consultants' advice and level of influence over the strategy. ""The balance of power was wrong from day one,"" said the first Fijian delegation source. ""They were telling us how to run the Cop at a visionary level."" Report: Fiji announces $50m 'climate bond' ahead of COP23 presidency Ahead of the Bonn summit, China and other emerging economies raised concerns that consultants paid for by countries such as Australia were drafting statements for a Pacific island that were seen to favour developed world narratives. A non-Fijian source familiar with the matter told Climate Home News these tensions fuelled a spat over pre-2020 action that came to dominate the conference. Closer to home, Pacific campaigners were outraged to discover Fiji was not planning to make ""loss and damage"", UN jargon for support for the victims of climate disaster, a key theme of its presidency. They saw it as a top priority for the vulnerable region. A briefing note circulated by Baker McKenzie's Martijn Wilders in March 2017 explicitly ruled out loss and damage as a theme. ""This will be considered in April but we need to take care for now as to what we promote,"" he wrote in an accompanying email seen by Climate Home News. ""[The consultants] are so closely aligned to developed country policies,"" said the first Fijian source. ""They were trying to protect us from doing something very controversial, but unfortunately, they forgot the developing country views."" 'Extensive consultation' A spokesperson for the presidency in Suva said the position on loss and damage was the result of ""extensive consultation with a range of Fijian and international experts"". These included a past president of the climate talks, officials from the UN climate body and Shameem Khan. ""It was a position that was conscious of the role of COP president and mandate to operationalise the Paris Agreement"" and ""supported by all in the Fijian delegation"". {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par Report: No finance plan for climate change victims in draft UN decision While these wider political fights played out, relations within the presidency became increasingly strained. Shameem Khan's allies say consultants frequently went over her head to Bainimarama's number two, Sayed-Khaiyum, a government minister. A spokesperson for the presidency said Sayed-Khaiyum had never overruled Shameem Khan on negotiation issues. At the Bonn summit itself, the rift hampered communications. Bainimarama's speeches were co-written by Graham Davis of PR firm Qorvis and UK-based consultant James Cameron, a longtime adviser of island states in climate negotiations. Cameron was attending the delegation's morning meetings but had been largely relegated from the negotiating rooms. According to the first Fijian source, Shameem Khan was not consulted on the speeches and they did not reflect the state of play of negotiations. 'Real embarrassment' ""It was a real embarrassment. When I look back, it is a miracle COP23 had any successes at all,"" said the source. Davis said Shameem Khan had ""ample opportunity"" to raise concerns about the content of the speeches with him and had not done so. Cameron declined to comment. ""As the prime minister's principal speechwriter for the past five years, I have consistently conveyed the Fijian government's advocacy of the need for more ambitious climate action,"" Davis told Climate Home News by email. It is not the first time Qorvis' influence on Fiji's government has been questioned. In November, a former public servant told Australia's ABC he had lost his job after refusing to become a ""lackey"" for the PR firm. Report: Poland to put 'common sense' over climate ambition as host of critical UN talks Fiji passes the baton this year to Poland, which is hosting the next climate summit in December. Bainimarama told Parliament Fiji would continue to preside over a mass outreach programme, known as the ""talanoa dialogue"", in partnership with Poland after its formal term ended. ""Because the Talanoa concept was Fiji's idea, we will continue to lead and shape that dialogue,"" he said, ""in a way that no Pacific nation has ever had the opportunity to do before."" {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par Pacific campaigners expressed concerns at the impact of Shameem Khan's removal.

Hoping that many others will support it into the future, she said ""more will join as the world moves to implement the Paris Agreement and realize this year's COP23 motto -- Further, Faster, Together"". Two years after the world united around the Paris Climate Agreement and a year after its entry into force, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change's (UNFCCC) 197 parties have been reconvened for the 23rd annual climate change talks ( COP 23 ) in Bonn till November 17. The Bonn talks, which began on November 6, are expected to take a number of decisions necessary to bring the Paris Agreement to life, including meaningful progress on the agreement implementation guidelines, to achieve a goal of keeping global warming within 1.5 degrees Celsius with an aim to cut greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels. The UN Climate Change secretariat, headquartered here, said the new allies included Deutsche Post DHL Group, a logistics company in Germany, Iberdrola S.A., a multinational power utility company that believes in the decarbonisation of the electricity sector, and KPMG, a Swiss cooperative made of a global network of professional firms operating in 155 countries providing advisory services, including climate change and sustainability services. Climate Tracker, an NGO that works to make the climate movement global, and empowers young journalists, is also among the new allies. Britain-based Christian Aid's International Climate Lead Mohamed Adow, who is monitoring the climate talks, said: ""The climate will not let us wait until 2020 when the Paris Agreement comes into force. Climate change is happening now and it's vital that immediate actions to cut emissions become a feature of this summit."" ""It risks undermining the very foundations of the Paris Agreement and the multilateral process. In Durban in 2011 poor countries agreed to a single negotiation track in return for assurances that pre-2020 actions would be addressed. Likewise, developed countries committed to a second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol in Doha in 2012 and yet five years later it remains unratified - and at this rate may not come into force before its end date in 2020!"" He said when richer countries continued to fail to act on their promises it created a trust deficit and threatened unravelling the progress made since Paris. At COP 23 , attention is turning to whether the US and its allies will continue to advance an agenda focused mainly on mitigation, carbon markets and transparency of action, while neglecting or foot-dragging on other key issues such as adaptation, loss and damage, finance, technology transfer, capacity building, transparency of support, compliance, and the global stocktake. In his inaugural remarks on November 6, Fiji President Frank Bainimarama, who is chairing the meeting, said there was a need to keep the climate action commitments in full and not back away from them. ""That is why Fiji has been so determined to help build a grand coalition of governments at every level -- civil society, private sector and faith-based organisations -- and to connect this effort to as many of the 7.5 billion citizens of the planet as possible,"" he said. --IANS vg/vd \"

"COP23","India","COP23_India152","Austria : IAEA Releases Projections on Global Nuclear Power Capacity Through 2050","October 5, 2017 Thursday","TendersInfo","The IAEAs annual publication on energy and electricity projections show that nuclear powers global potential up to 2050 remains high, although its expansion is expected to slow in coming years. The newly released 37th edition of Energy, Electricity and Nuclear Power Estimates for the Period up to 2050 (Reference Data Series No. 1 (RDS-1)) documents these trends in detail by region. Projections are presented as low and high estimates, reflecting different driving factors that have an impact on nuclear power deployment. Interest in nuclear power remains particularly strong in the developing world, the publication highlights. However, compared with the 2016 projections for 2030, the 2017 projections were reduced by 45 GW(e) 1 by 2030 in both high and low cases. Over the short term, the low price of natural gas, the impact of renewable energy sources on electricity prices, and national nuclear policies in several countries following the accident at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in 2011 are expected to affect nuclear growth prospects. Yet, commitments agreed to at the 21st session of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) could have a positive impact on nuclear energy development in the future. The high projections indicate an increase from 2016 levels by 42% in 2030, by 83% in 2040 and by 123% in 2050. The low projections, on the other hand, indicate a decline in capacity by 12% in 2030 and 15% in 2040, before rebounding to present levels by 2050. The wide range in these projections is also due to the considerable number of reactors scheduled to be retired around 2030 and beyond, particularly in North America and Europe, and whether new nuclear capacity would be built to replace these retirements. The leading influential factors that might affect the future of nuclear power are discussed in detail in the recent IAEA report on International Status and Prospects for Nuclear Power 2017. \"

"COP23","India","COP23_India155","Fiji : Fiji issues first developing country green bond, raising $50 million for climate resilience","October 20, 2017 Friday","TendersInfo","Fiji has become the first emerging market to issue a sovereign green bond, raising 100 million Fijian dollars, or US$50 million, to support climate change mitigation and adaption. Home to over 870,000 people, Fijis 300 volcanic islands include low-lying atolls that are highly susceptible to cyclones and floods. In 2016, Tropical Cyclone Winstonthe most intense tropical cyclone in the Southern Hemisphere on recordpassed directly over Fiji, causing economic losses that amounted to almost one third of the countrys GDP. Like all Pacific island states, Fiji is also highly vulnerable to the impact of climate change: close to 20 percent of the regions 10 million people could be displaced due to climate change by 2050. Green bonds are fixed income, liquid financial instruments that are used to raise funds dedicated to climate-mitigation, adaptation, and other environment-friendly projects. This provides investors an attractive investment proposition as well as an opportunity to support environmentally sound projects. At the request of Fijis Reserve Bank, the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group focusing on private sector, provided technical assistance to assist the government in issuing a sovereign green bond. This collaboration took place under a broader, three-year Capital Markets Development Project supported by the Australian Government. Through this partnership, Australia and IFC are helping stimulate private sector investment, promote sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty in the Pacific. Projects financed from the Fiji green bond will follow the internationally developed Green Bond Principles, and will focus primarily on investments that build resilience against the impacts of climate change. Sustainalytics US (Sustainalytics), a provider of environmental, social and governance research and analysis, evaluated Fiji Sovereigns green bond transaction and its alignment with the Green Bond Principles. Fiji will also use bond proceeds for projects supporting its commitment to achieve 100% renewable energy and reduce its CO2 emissions in the energy sector by 30% by 2030. Fijian Prime Minister and President of COP23 Frank Bainimarama said: The Fijian people, along with every Pacific Islander, live on the front lines of climate change. The rising seas, changing weather patterns and severe weather events are threatening our development, our security and the Fijian way of life, along with the very existence of some of our low-lying neighbors. I have made access to climate finance a key pillar of our upcoming COP23 Presidency, and we are proud to set an example to other climate-vulnerable nations by issuing this green bond to fund our work to boost climate resilience across Fiji. By issuing the first emerging country green bond , we are also sending a clear signal to other nations that we can be creative and innovative in mobilizing funds and create win-win outcomes for countries and investors in adapting to the serious effects of climate change. With this bond, Fiji has demonstrated that green capital markets can be created in emerging economies, and that all countries, big and small, have an important role to play in facilitating climate solutions, World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim said. As it takes the helm of COP23 , Fiji is uniquely positioned to inspire other countries to meet their respective targets and build resilience against climate change. The World Bank and IFC are among the pioneers of the green bond market. The World Bank issued the first green bond in 2008. Since then, both institutions have provided leadership by issuing green bonds across a range of currencies, tenors and volumes; helping to define best practice for reporting and standards; and working with countries to facilitate the development of domestic green bond markets. The global green bond market is expected to reach US$134.9 billion in 2017. The Government of Fiji will chair the 23rd Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ) in Bonn, Germany from November 6-17, 2017. Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama has given high priority to COP23 and aims to continue the momentum for action since the entry into force of the Paris Climate Change Agreement last year. \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India156","Moving Into Action Mode On Climate Change","November 7, 2017","Business World","A broad-based international dialogue can facilitate global stock take and increase ambitions The much-acclaimed Paris Agreement on climate change has had a tumultuous year. The agreement came into force with much fanfare on November 4, 2016, when 55 parties, accounting for 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions signed the agreement. 195 countries have signed the agreement, with India signing on October 2 last year. Months later, US President Donald Trump shocked the world by announcing his decision to withdraw from the agreement. While has subsequently indicated that the US is open to renegotiating its participation in the agreement, it has introduced an element of uncertainty into climate change diplomacy. What is certain is that climate change matters to global diplomacy in a way that it has not previously. Climate change is on its way to becoming one of the biggest public health crisis that humanity has ever faced. High impact hurricanes that laid waste to south-eastern USA have been described as a storm 'humans helped cause'. Back in India, incessant rains hit the country's financial capital Mumbai for 4 consecutive days bringing the city to its knees. This was preceded by similar 'crisis-like' situation in Chandigarh, Agartala and Bengaluru. Attributing a one-off event directly to climate change may be debatable, but the fact that these incidents are becoming more frequent and intense overall indicates an active role of global warming. What is heartening, however, is that the world is coming together in more ways than one to collectively tackle the effects and causes of climate change. As the scientific evidence base and credibility behind climate change risk becomes stronger, the push to countries to change their attitudes toward investing in climate smart and resilient policies becomes stronger. This has resulted in growing investments worldwide, and across sectors, to de-risk future climate change threats. In India, the viability of the renewables sector has gained a boost after an unprecedented decline in tariffs, which are now comparable to conventional electricity. China sees the business case for being the world's solar panel factory. In the US, the renewables industry provides jobs to over 700,000 people. While there is growth in renewable energy capacity worldwide, driven by economic fundamentals rather than climate concerns, there are still issues around adaptation and reducing disaster risk for vulnerable nations. This is categorically a public finance issue since the developing world still heavily reliant on development assistance and low-cost finance from developed countries. These aspects are likely to capture the public narrative as we move closer to the next Conference of Parties, or COP 23 in November in Bonn, Germany. For the first time, the Presidency of the COP will go to a pacific island nation - Fiji. As a vulnerable pacific island nation that is preparing to tackle the most calamitous impacts of climate change, Fiji's presidency renews the sense of urgency to COP 23 . Over the past years, Fiji has grappled with issues around disaster risk reduction, adaptation finance and reducing the burden of diesel imports and a moving to clean energy. One of the key focus points of COP 23 will be to build consensus around the transparency mechanism that allows flexibility to parties to report on their nationally determined contributions. With the work on formalizing the implementation guidelines progressing slowly, COP 23 will have to re-group and work towards finalizing the contours of the implementation guidelines as we head into the facilitative dialogue the next year. Ratcheting-up ambition is enshrined in the Paris Agreement and the 'global stock-take' is the key driver. The first ""global stock-take"" under the agreement was accordingly scheduled for 2023, with new NDCs to be submitted by 2025. The facilitative dialogue planned for 2018 would serve as a per-cursor to the 'global stock-take'. For the facilitative dialogue to be successful there is a need to engage parties towards a common goal which should be achieved through collective efforts. One way could be to initiate a year-long engagement process that will involve all key stakeholders to dwell upon the inputs to the stock taking exercise, what its operational modalities are, and what its outputs should be. The non-state actors should play an important role in this year-long process. The non-state actors are now an integral part of climate change governance. They are highly diverse including local regional, national and international groups with various missions dedicated to sustainable development, poverty alleviation, food security, energy security, environmental protection and other issues. This diversity is the key to mobilizing assets motivating people and implementing programs. It also provides the parties with the opportunity to build collective ambition through collective efforts. COP23 is an opportunity to reaffirm the collective global vision and intent to tackle climate change that was firmly established in Paris two years ago. It is a chance to renew the focus on one's own actions and results, and move forward with a positive attitude. With regard to tackling climate change, the world has run out of excuses for inaction, and soon, we may run out of time.

Reaffirming India's resolution to go ahead with the set agenda with determination and clarity, Shri C.K. Mishra, Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, Government of India, said that India has been pursuing its goals of setting up renewable energy capacities and changing its energy mix, and will continue to do so to provide equitable sustainable development. Speaking about the Government's interventions, Dr. P.C. Maithani, Adviser, MNRE said that policies are being drafted on a continuous basis to address challenges as the market evolves. Giving examples of how the question is no longer about availability of finances but that of cheap finances, Shri K.S. Popli, CMD, Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited (IREDA) said that the markets have matured and one indicator of that is seen in how the bond markets have progressed. Dr. Ajay Mathur, DG, The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) stressed upon the need to push for higher research in storage technology which could compliment the infirm renewable power. There is an imminent need to look at bringing down storage costs, he added. India's renewable energy journey has come a long way since it set its ambitious target of 175 GW by 2022. Prices of solar and wind have dramatically reduced to 3-4 cents per Kwh as against 9-12 per unit in 2013, even as capacities have scaled up to 47.5 GW. Policymakers and industry are now confident of accelerating this growth trajectory to provide electricity, along with storage, at an estimated Rs 5 per unit before 2025. Explaining the scope of the renewables market, Shri Rahul Munjal, MD, Hero Futures Energy said that there has been an exponential expansion of the industry, with almost 10,000 firms operating in the ecosystem. This is a result of the market being conducive to business and investments. Echoing a similar thought and projecting high optimism, Shri Rajiv Ranjan Mishra, MD, CLP India said that renewables are becoming more an imperative for economies like India which have to reach power to large sections of the people. Shri Ratul Puri, Chairman, Hindustan Power Projects Pvt Ltd (HPPPL) highlighted the need to make power available at affordable rates and said that Indian industry is working towards achieving that goal.

This takes place against the backdrop of this years destructive hurricanes, fires, floods, droughts, melting ice and impacts on agriculture, which threaten food security. For us, it has become more and more important to engage with US States and their top political representatives, given the particular make-up of the US political system, alongside our regular contacts from Congress and the administration, he added. Governor Brown said: The nature of the threat from climate change is existential, and the level of commitment is not up to the threat.

As part of its Presidency of COP23 in Bonn, Germany, the Fijian Government will launch an immersive VR experience that aims to transport delegates, decision-makers and the global community to Fiji to experience the current and future impacts of climate change on the Pacific. Featured in this program is Our Home, Our People, which was produced by the World Bank. The video takes viewers to communities across Fiji to experience the stories of four people whose lives have already been fundamentally changed by climate change, including through last year's devastating Category Five Tropical Cyclone Winston. The VR experience includes the story of Vunisavisavi, a remote coastal community which has already seen significant relocation due to the impacts of rising sea levels. Our Home, Our People is launching alongside the Fijian Government's Climate Vulnerability Assessment 2017, a significant new report which sets out, in significant detail, the climate impacts already felt by Fiji, and identifies possible strategies and costs to make Fiji more climate resilient. The Fijian Government's High-Level Climate Champion, Hon. Inia Seruiratu, said that VR provides a powerful medium for helping decision-makers and members of the public more deeply understand the impacts climate change is already having on Fiji and Fijians. Michel Kerf, World Bank Country Director Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands said Our Home, Our People is about delving into the stories behind the numbers and projections of how climate change will - and is - impacting Fiji and the Pacific.

"COP23","India","COP23_India161","Bonn and off","November 22, 2017 Wednesday","Business Line","Fatehabad (Haryana), Nov. 22 -- The political masters have given the recently-concluded climate talks in Bonn a coat of success paint, but scratch the surface and the ugly reality shows itself. At the 23rd Conference of Parties to the Convention, or COP23 , developing countries came a cropper. ('Convention' refers to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was born at the 1992 Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.) Negotiators of the developing countries return home with nothing more than the satisfaction of having roared at the mighty developed world, who, nevertheless displayed their empty pockets. Billed as an 'Implementation COP', the Bonn meeting was meant to further negotiations so as to come up with a 'rulebook' by 2018 for implementing the 'Paris Agreement', the 'historic accord' that the COP21 of 2015 delivered. In Paris, 197 countries agreed to a target of limiting rise in global temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrialisation era of the mid-19th century, with an ""ambition"" of 1.5 degrees. This would be achieved by all countries doing what they promised to do in terms of their stated 'nationally determined contributions (NDCs)'. While the agreement was hailed epochal, many have also criticised it for lack of concreteness and for the fact that it contains no punitive measures for violations, relying exclusively on naming and shaming of the violator. In October, the United Nations Environment Programme said in its 'Emissions Gap Report, 2017', that even if all the countries did what they said they would do at Paris, the planet would turn hotter by 3 degrees, which bodes disaster. The EGR 2017, therefore, highlighted the urgency in climate change combat. Against this backdrop, the hope was that COP23 would move rapidly forward, framing rules that would bind all countries to their promises - more the developed countries, especially when it comes to providing finance and technology. However, what Bonn has brought forth is a bunch of agreements that are peripheral to climate talks, such as a 'gender action plan' to include women in climate activities, an insurance facility, a plan to have ""indigenous people"" (adivasis) to have a say in climate talks, a call for action from the UN Ocean Conference, an agreement to begin talking about what to do to bring down emissions that come from agricultural activities. All this has been packaged to sound good. ""We leave Bonn having notched up some notable achievements, including our Ocean Pathway, the historic agreement on agriculture and others on a Gender Action Plan and Indigenous People's Platform,"" says Frank Bainimarama, the Prime Minister of Fiji, who will head climate talks for a year till the next COP, which will be held in Katowice, Poland. Bainimarama has expressed satisfaction. ""We have done the job we were given to do, which is to advance the implementation guidelines for the Paris Agreement,"" he said in a statement. As though in response to this statement, Nick Mabey, CEO and Director of E3G, a European climate change think tank, says: "" COP23 achieved what it had to but not what it needed to."" Practically, the entire civil society is unhappy with Bonn's lack of progress. ""At COP23 , political agreements did not sufficiently address the harsh climate reality that millions of poor and vulnerable people already face,"" says Wolfgang Jamann, Secretary-General and CEO of CARE International. Involving women in climate activities and getting tribals to have their say in talks are all fine, but the meat lies in securing funding for developing countries, especially for £daptation' (building defences against climate change-caused vagaries of nature, and 'loss and damage' (repairs and rehabilitation after a climate event, like hurricane, occurs.) In this, the Bonn meeting, as has been widely pointed out, falls flat. The most that happened in Bonn about these was to hold the rich countries to the Article 9.5 of the Paris Agreement, which says that the developed world shall ""communicate"" once every two years how much of funds would flow to the developing countries. Some observers give this a few marks. ""While the quantum of finance remained elusive as ever, some agreements on predictability of finance and discussions around Adaptation Fund eventually salvaged a very pertinent issue,"" says Aarti Khosla of Climate Trends. Also, the Adaptation Fund, which is meant to help developing countries to build their defences against climate change-related vagaries of nature, was linked to the Paris Agreement. Incidentally, the 10-year-old Adaptation Fund has a corpus of $93.3 million, when the need for adaptation finance runs into tens of billions. ""We are no longer talking about the future,"" says Tracy Carty, of Oxfam International, an NGO, ""the world's poorest countries and communities are already fighting for their lives against disasters intensified by climate change. Yet, for the most part, rich countries showed up to Bonn empty-handed and blocked progress on finance."" It did not help that the United States is in the process of quitting the Paris Agreement, enlarging the hole in funding. In a way, the developing countries played into the hands of the rich countries by consuming a full week in negotiating ""pre-2020"". The Paris Agreement comes into force in 2020. What the developed countries would do till 2020 is the subject of a 2012 agreement, called Doha Amendment (to the Kyoto Protocol). At Bonn, developing countries negotiated hard to get the rich countries report, by May 2018, their progress under the Doha Amendment - which is meaningless, because with just a year-and-a-half left to 2020, knowing the developed countries' progress under the Doha Amendment has little point. The developing countries extracted a win over the developed world - a matter of satisfaction, but little else. Arivudai Nambi Appadurai of World Resources Institute, who has been a part of India's climate negotiations team, sums up COP23 as ""baby steps in the right direction."" Indeed, COP23 leaves something positive on the table. For instance, despite President Trump's stance on climate talks, the US negotiators are said to have been constructive (despite a shocking, but poorly-attended 'pro-coal' event held by the US delegation at COP23 ). A few project-specific funding announcements were made, a bunch of alliances were forged, such as for green buildings, 'power past coal' and eco-mobility. ""There has been positive momentum around us,"" said Bainimarama. Sadly, that is not enough. \"

Following the entry into force of the historic agreement last year, elaborating its implementing guidelines is now a key focus. President Jean-Claude Juncker clearly said it in his State of the European Union speech at the European Parliament this year: ""I want Europe to be the leader when it comes to the fight against climate change. Last year, we set the global rules of the game with the Paris Agreement ratified here, in this very House. Set against the collapse of ambition in the United States, Europe must ensure we make our planet great again. It is the shared heritage of all of humanity."" Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy Miguel Arias Caete said: The Paris Agreement has set the direction of travel for the global transition to a modern low-carbon economy. The increasingly frequent and intense extreme weather events we are witnessing across the world are a stark reminder of the urgency of the challenges we face. Now is the time to translate ambition into action and speed up implementation. COP23 will be a key moment to ensure that we are on track to meet our first deadline: completing the Paris work programme by 2018. The 23rd Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP23 ), presided over by Fiji, is taking place from 6-17 November 2017 in Bonn, Germany. It will bring together ministers and government officials, as well as a wide range of representatives from civil society and business. The EU expects the conference to demonstrate clear progress on the development of the technical rules and guidelines for implementing the provisions of the Paris Agreement, for example on the transparency framework and the 5-year ambition cycle aimed at helping countries make progressively more ambitious contributions. The work programme is due to be adopted at the 2018 UN climate conference (COP24) in Katowice, Poland. The EU is making solid progress on finalising a legislative framework for achieving its Paris target its collective nationally determined contribution (NDC) to reduce EU greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% by 2030. This includes revising the EU emissions trading system (EU ETS) post-2020, setting 2030 emissions reduction targets for non-ETS sectors such as transport, buildings and agriculture and integrating land use, land use change and forestry into the EU's legal framework for climate action. In addition the Commission intends to present a Clean Mobility package of proposals on 8 November to further facilitate the EU's transition to low carbon mobility and economy. The EU remains committed to the collective global goal of mobilising USD 100 billion a year by 2020 and through to 2025 to finance climate action in developing countries, from a variety of sources, and continuing to significantly increase financing for adaptation to climate change. In 2016, the EU and its Member States contributed a total EUR 20.2 billion in climate finance, an increase of more than 10% from the EUR 17.6 billion provided in 2015. Alongside the formal COP23 negotiations, the Bonn conference will showcase climate action by a wide range of stakeholders including cities and regions, businesses and civil society groups. The EU is a strong supporter of the Global Climate Action Agenda (GCAA) as an important platform for multi-stakeholder action and will continue to engage actively in this forum. The EU will be represented in Bonn by Miguel Arias Canete, Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy and Siim Kiisler, Environment Minister of Estonia, which currently holds the presidency of the Council of Ministers of the EU. Events during COP23 During the conference, the EU will host more than 100 events at the EU Pavilion in Bonn (see link below). These events, organised by a variety of countries and organisations from Europe and the rest of the world, will address a broad range of climate-related issues from the energy transition to the role of forests and oceans, climate finance, research and innovation and assessing climate risks. \"

An estimated FJ$9.3 billion (US$4.5 billion) over ten years almost equivalent to 100 percent of the countrys GDP for one year is needed to build the resilience and capacity to adapt to climate change. Climate Vulnerability Assessment: Making Fiji Climate Resilient, which was prepared in partnership with the World Bank and Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), was launched at COP23 today by Fijis Attorney-General and Minister Responsible for Climate Change, Hon. Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum. The Vulnerability Assessment provides significant new analysis of Fijis vulnerability to climate change, with projections outlining potential impacts for Fiji over the coming decades, covering the impact of climate change on Fijis economy, livelihoods and poverty levels, health and food security together with key industries including agriculture and tourism, as well as potential impacts of sea level rise on coastal areas and low lying islands. Key projections from the Assessment include: An increase in the number of Fijians being pushed into poverty and hardship would increase from 25,700 people per year to an estimated 32,400 per year by 2050. A significant increase in the cost of climate change-related disasters, with projections of asset losses from floods and cyclones costing up to 30 percent higher than current averages. Sea-level rise and increased intensity of coastal storms, with most models projecting an increase in global sea levels of 17-38cm relative to current levels by 2065, potentially creating a major threat for the country; with 30 percent of Fijis population currently living in risk-prone areas. Much can be done to help Fiji minimize risks and adapt to climate change. The Assessment identifies 125 measures across five priority areas that could make Fiji and Fijians more resilient. The five areas include: building inclusive and resilient towns and cities; improving infrastructure services; climate smart agriculture and fisheries; conserving ecosystems and building socioeconomic resilience. According to the Assessment, an estimated FJ$9.3 billion (US$4.5 billion) over 10 years is required to finance these interventions, in addition to maintenance and operation costs and social protection systems. Fijis Attorney-General and Minister Responsible for Climate Change, Hon. Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum said the Assessment is critical for climate and risk-informed development to strengthen the resilience of the Fijian economy. Michel Kerf, the World Banks Country Director for the Pacific Islands, said that the World Bank had set out to support Fiji with a comprehensive Assessment that would paint a realistic picture of the challenges ahead and provide a roadmap of recommended priorities for climate resilience. This Assessment presents, in stark terms, clear evidence of the costs of climate change, said Kerf. Yet crucially it also provides an evidence-based resource from which we can best support Fiji, and other island countries, in their drive towards more climate resilient development.

It said the ministers reiterated the work on both the pre-2020 and post-2020 periods should be in full accordance with the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. This was the meeting of the grouping -- Brazil, South Africa, India and China (BASIC) -- that came into effect after the Paris climate change conference in 2015. ""India expects a positive outcome from this COP (Conference of Parties). We are here with supportive mind and we are pushing for certain action, which are pending,"" C.K. Mishra, Secretary in the Indian Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, told IANS here. Admitting open access to financial and technology responsibilities by the developed world, he said the BASIC ministers expressed concern over attempts by some developed countries to unilaterally apply new eligibility criteria for the access of developing countries to funding under the Global Environmental Facility and the Green Climate Fund. The ministers recalled that such criteria are not compatible with guidance from the Conference of the Parties and are a departure from the letter and the spirit of the Convention and its Paris Agreement, the joint statement said. Furthermore, they indicated that such attempts violate the terms of the Instrument for the Establishment of the Restructured Global Environmental Facility, as well as the Governing Instrument of the Green Climate Fund, falling outside the mandate of the Global Environmental Facility Council and of the Green Climate Fund Board on eligibility criteria. The statement stressed the view that such attempts are tantamount to renegotiating the Paris Agreement and potentially undermine the level of ambition of developing countries in the global effort against climate change. In the post-2020 period, the ministers called upon developed countries to provide financial resources to assist developing countries with respect to both mitigation and adaptation in continuation of their existing obligations under the convention. Two years after the world united around the Paris Climate Agreement and a year after its entry into force, the 197 parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 197 have reconvened for their 23rd annual climate change talks (this one is COP 23 ) in Bonn till November 17.

The procedural issues under the agenda are guidance on nationally determined contributions, guidance on adaptation framework for assessing clarity and needs on adaptation actions, global stocktake for assessing collective progress of climate actions, enhanced transparency framework for monitoring climate efforts and support and thereby, gaining clarity on compliance and implementation of Paris Agreement. All the above items are being deliberated under the APA, one of the negotiating bodies under the COP. The pre-sessional roundtables, which were closed to observers, were held on issues such as adaptation communications and global stock take before the COP started on November 6. Extremely slow progress on drafting rules for agenda items On all the agenda items, the discussions have only started and the pace of progress has been extremely slow. Most of the agenda items have linkages with elements under Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) and Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI). Though the linkages have been identified in some elements, including the enhanced transparency framework and global stocktake, the substantive joint discussions have yet to take place. Therefore, as of now, Parties have held only preliminary discussions on all issues, which have been captured in the informal notes prepared for all agenda items. The informal notes, however, by no means, represent consensus of Parties. They constitute only the first step in drafting of the rules, modalities and guidelines for each agenda issue and much work needs to take place in the coming year. Ideally, by the end of the ongoing climate talks at Bonn, Parties should have come up with a rough draft of the rule book for various agenda items, which could have taken forward for more streamlining in the next round of talks. After this Bonn Summit, Parties have only nearly three weeks of negotiation time to finalise and come up with a rule book on all issues for implementation of Paris Agreement. The draft conclusion text on agenda items under APA talks of progress made based on substantive discussions. It also invites Parties to make submissions before the next intersession takes place in April-May 2017. In view of the time constraint, the draft text also suggests an additional session in 2018, ahead of COP in Poland. There will be discussions on whether or not the suggestion should be accepted. The APA's closing plenary would convene tomorrow. Developed countries continue to block progress The result of the obstruction by the developed countries was that the final text passed on loss and damage is weak and reflects no progress on support while only highlighting the need of mobilisation of resources to support the victims of climate-induced loss and damage. It is, nevertheless hoped that in the high- level segment on November 15-16, heads of state and other dignitaries, in their statements, would provide political attention to the much neglected issue of loss and damage in climate negotiations.

"COP23","India","COP23_India168","Little to show for Bonn","November 19, 2017 Sunday","The Telegraph (India)","Bonn: The 23rd United Nations Climate Change Conference concluded here on Saturday without making much headway in resolving key issues such as a clear road map on finance for developing countries and leaving environmental groups critical of developed countries for not doing enough. Climate policy analysts tracking the conference, attended by delegates and politicians from over 190 countries, described the outcome as a mixed bag for developed and developing countries. The conference had set out to finalise rulebooks to implement the 2015 Paris climate accord that seeks action by all countries to avert a global temperature rise beyond 2ACelsius. But many had also expected key decisions on long-term finance to help the developing countries address the challenges of climate change. The non-government New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), which had sent observers to track the conference, said the US ""continued to dictate terms of negotiations and blocked progress on equity and finance"". ""Instead of working together and standing behind the US intransigence, the old bickering between developed and developing nations continued at Bonn,"" Chandra Bhushan, deputy director-general of the CSE, said. Under agreements at previous conferences, the developed countries had agreed to provide finance and technology to developing nations to reduce their emission of Earth-warming greenhouse gases and adapt to the impacts of climate change. But the final draft document prepared in Bonn merely iterates the decade-old commitment of developed countries to raise ""jointly US $100 billion annually by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries"", without a clear road map for payments apart from assurances of further discussions in 2018 and 2019. The climate policy analysts said there had similarly been little progress on issues such as technology transfer, loss and damage payments and the management of climate migrants - people displaced by the impacts of climate change such as sea-level rise. However, the analysts said, the developing countries could claim ""victory"" on pushing the developed nations to accept a road map to implement more emission cuts before 2020. The analysts said India made little impact on the outcome with its oft-repeated demands such as climate justice, equity and sustainable lifestyles hardly finding mention. ""It is a weak compromise - the world needs and deserves more to survive on the climate front,"" said Harjeet Singh, the head of the non-profit Action Aid. \"

The WMO came to this conclusion bearing in mind the many high-impact events including catastrophic hurricanes and floods, debilitating heatwaves and drought. It also said that long-term indicators of climate change such as increasing carbon dioxide concentrations, sea level rise and ocean acidification continue unabated. Arctic sea ice coverage remains below average and previously stable Antarctic sea ice extent was at or near a record low The discourse on climate change and global warming has taken over a larger domain in the last few years and its rapidly growing effects have raised questions on Earth's habitability in the future. The WMO's provisional Statement on the State of the Climate says the average global temperature from January to September this year was approximately 1.1 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial era. As a result of a powerful El Nino, 2016 is likely to remain the warmest year on record, with 2017 and 2015 being second and/or third, while 2013-2017 is set to be the warmest five-year period on record. The WMO statement - which covers January to September - was released on the opening day of the United Nations climate change conference in Germany's former capital. It includes information submitted by a wide range of UN agencies on human, socio-economic and environmental impacts as part of a drive to provide a more comprehensive, UN-wide policy brief for decision makers on the interplay between weather, climate and water and the UN global goals.

In a push to deliver the Paris Agreement, members of the European Committee of the Regions (CoR) the EU's assembly of local and regional governments called for adequate mechanisms for climate finance, reiterated the importance of involving all levels of government and said they would continue to strengthen relations with cities and regions outside Europe's borders to push the climate agenda forward. Speaking in Brussels, the president of the European Committee of the Regions Karl-Heinz Lambertz said: the CoR is committed to strengthening relations with local and regional governments across the world. Having recently formalised cooperation agreements with ICLEI and Climate Alliance , the CoR is now hoping to reach out to the US Conference of Mayors and the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. President Lambertz added: ""climate change is a threat to all of us, which will only be overcome through cooperation. Across the globe, local and regional governments are showing a level of conviction on climate change that often surpasses national ambition. Europe's local and regional governments stand ready to build ties with cities and regions across the Atlantic and beyond to share experiences, work together and ensure global temperatures are kept well below the 2 degree threshold set in Paris."" The EU Commissioner for Energy and Climate, Miguel Arias Caete said: we must make good progress on the implementation of the Paris agreement and reach a consensus on its work programme by the 2018 deadline. The world can continue to count on Europe for global leadership. We will work with all our partners to ensure COP23 is a success, including the many cities, regions and businesses that continue with ambitious climate action. Commissioner Arias Caete referred to Americas Pledge, a coalition of 227 cities and counties, nine states and about 1,650 businesses and investors from the US that are moving to uphold the United States commitments under the Paris deal. Members of EU's assembly of cities and regions adopted its official COP23 position on Climate finance . Rapporteur Marco Dus (IT/PES) said: ""It is not political will that European cities and regions are lacking but tailored financing mechanisms and the technical capacity to access them"". Marco Dus calls for creating new ways for example green bonds and collective guarantees - to finance climate action locally. The member of the Vittorio Veneto Municipal Council in Treviso added: ""Along with the need for additional financial mechanisms tailored to local governments, it is essential that subsidies to economic activities with high environmental impact are gradually phased out and disappear completely by 2035."" Andrew Cooper (UK/EA), rapporteur of the opinion on how to better implement environmental law in Europe , said: ""the reduction of CO2 emissions achieved by local governments needs to be measured, valued and encouraged. A system of Locally Determined Contributions (LDC) needs to be established in addition to Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) to help bridge the emissions gap. The Kirklees Councilor says ""Locally Determined Contributions will help limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees. It would also allow us to set up higher yet remaining achievable targets."" Andrew Cooper's LDC's initiative is in line and has the support of the adopted opinion by Marco Dus (IT/PES) on climate finance. UN's COP23 While the CoR continues to champion the Global Covenant of Mayors initiative within and beyond EU borders, it applauds the America's Pledge initiative whereby an unprecedented number of U.S. states, cities, businesses, and colleges and universities reaffirmed their support for the Paris Agreement. The CoR signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the US Conference of Mayors US in 2010 and is exploring ways to work with Canadian municipalities to forge a new transatlantic coalition on climate. \"

The urgent need to raise the finances to meet the funding goals of the Paris Agreement, especially to support action by developing countries, took center stage Monday at the UN Climate Conference ( COP23 ) in Bonn, Germany. We need all financial players public, private, domestic, international and including markets and regulators, to work together effectively to mobilize at least $1.5 trillion in climate finance that is needed every year, said Eric Usher, Head of Finance Initiative at the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). As part of Finance for Climate Day at COP23 , high-level representatives from across the sector highlighted their efforts to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement of keeping the average global temperature rise well below 2 degrees Celsius and as close as possible to 1.5 Celsius. They stressed that every dollar invested in cutting greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate change gets double the bang for the buck because it directly supports the international communitys 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. According to the UN Climate Change (UNFCCC) Secretariat, finance for climate is flowing at a greater pace than ever, with vibrant and growing markets for renewable energy, electric vehicles, green buildings and climate-smart agriculture seeing aggressive growth, backed by exponential advances in innovative green financial instruments, indices and markets. Equally, the finance sector is recognizing to a much greater degree where and how climate change presents risks to its existing investments and the need to adjust their portfolios away from carbon-intensive assets to reduce that risk. However, much more is needed to secure finance and investment at the scale required to deliver a fully de-carbonized and climate-resilient global economy by 2050. The potential for climate friendly investment in areas such as clean energy and climate-smart agriculture is enormous, said Laura Tuck, Vice-President Sustainable Development at the World Bank. The key is to get the funding to flow so that everyone everywhere can benefit from low-carbon and climate resilient investments. Peter Damgaard Jensen, CEO of the Danish Pension provider PKA and Chair of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) said at a press conference that it is extremely important that there is a significant increase of investor awareness and action with regards to supporting the transition [] to a low carbon economy. Strong investment signals from policy makers across carbon trading, energy, transport and buildings, are essential to unlock the necessary capital, he added. Members of African civil society and members of Parliament spoke on Monday on the urgency of climate finance as a prerequisite to ambitious action in African countries. Africa is the continent that pollutes the least, but it is Africa which suffers the effect of climate change, said at a press conference Roger Nkodo Dang, President of the Pan-African Parliament, which is the legislative body of the African Union. In an interview with UN News, he added that developed countries have a duty to provide additional support to Africans for their green development. If you tell us do not cut the wood, we say, you bring us electricity, he said. Its not a favor; its a compensation.

"COP23","India","COP23_India172","What makes the Bonn meet on climate critical","November 8, 2017 Wednesday","Hindustan Times","NEW DELHI, Nov. 8 -- India played a leading role at the Paris climate negotiations, and emerged as a prominent, constructive and responsible country in discussions and actions to address climate change. We were able to work with the rest of the world in defining a regime that aligned our national goals of enabling adequate and affordable energy for all with the global goal of mitigating global carbon emissions. Our innovative and ambitious steps to accelerate the adoption of renewables and energy efficiency, but at a pace and in a manner that matched the willingness and ability of Indians to adopt these higher-cost options, played a big role in convincing ourselves, and the rest of the world, that this alignment is possible and achievable. Now, at Bonn for the Conference of Parties ( COP23 ), the second since Paris, we face a different world. The Obama administration is gone, together with its aspirations of forging a legacy of climate action, and a willingness to understand the concerns of others, including India. Consequently, as the modalities, procedures, and guidelines (MPGs) for the enhanced transparency framework are negotiated at COP23 , India will need to ensure that they are pragmatic. If it is too onerous, requiring large additional efforts with high transactions costs beyond those required for national energy goals, then this alignment would be lost, There is little hope that international financial support will be available. Consequently, as at Paris, India will need to be in the vanguard to cajole the world into agreeing to a regime, this time of the MPGs, that is robust enough to sustain the trust of countries in the actions of other countries, and flexible enough to be complied with in all countries, especially developing countries. An onerous MPG regime may not necessarily constrain our ability to meet our goals and pledges, but may certainly mean that our verified achievements may fall short of our actual achievements. This would strain the trust that was created at Paris, especially when it will come to the adoption of more ambitious goals. Enhanced commitments is the second area in which India will need to build a global consensus at COP23 This means that we will need to coax an agreement on benchmarks to assess the progress on adaptation, which is of greater importance to India than to most developed countries. We will also need to build an agreement on the ""whos"" and the ""hows"" in the development of more ambitious pledges. Will, for example, developed countries enhance the ambition of their 2020 pledges as a result of the facilitative dialogue? Will the principle of nationally determined pledges continue to apply as countries adopt more ambitious pledges? Or will the bulk of enhanced ambition fall on India, which is now the only major country where the bulk of energy (and consequently greenhouse gas emissions) related infrastructure is yet to be built? Our domestic action on renewables, energy efficiency and afforestation will determine whether we meet our Paris pledges on the reduction in our carbon intensity, increase in the share of non-fossil sources in our electricity-generation mix, and enhanced carbon capture by our forests and trees. However, the speed and extent of these actions will crucially depend on the agreements at COP23 as they will influence the depth to which the accelerator pedal for action is pressed.

"COP23","India","COP23_India175","COP 23 at Bonn:?India has resolved to be a strong leader on climate action","November 9, 2017 Thursday","South Asia Monitor","New Delhi, Nov. 9 -- This week a major United Nations gathering on climate change gets underway in Bonn, Germany. Countries around the world will take this opportunity to showcase their actions taken to fulfil pledges under the landmark 2015 Paris agreement on climate change, another step forward under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). But it's clear that there is still much ground to cover. The Emissions Gap Report 2017, an annual audit of national mitigation efforts and the goals presented by countries in their voluntary Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), finds that pledges to reduce current emissions are only about one-third of what is needed to prevent catastrophic temperature increases. The NDCs must therefore be the floor, not the ceiling, of ambition. In India, Prime Minister Modi has already indicated that the country will go ""above and beyond"" the Paris agreement, with a call to action: ""We must leave for our future generations a climate wherein they can breathe clean air and have a healthy life."" On his watch, the government has demonstrated a deep understanding of the need to reduce India's dependence on fossil fuels, and a recognition of the severe effects of carbon emission pollution on human health. But actions to slow climate change are not only being taken by the national government. State governments, businesses, civil society, and individuals are pitching in to move far beyond commitments. India stands on the cusp of an energy revolution. In just the past year, the country added 11.3 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity, making critical progress towards its ambitious target of 175 GW of renewable energy generation by 2022. Some of India's largest states, including Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan are pitching to use renewables to power their growth. The Indian Railways, one of the biggest consumers of electricity in the country is planning a future based on greater energy efficiency. And it's perhaps small and medium sized enterprises, who are championing the cause of a cleaner future for us, fastest and with the most impact. As we speak, 1,100 steel re-rolling mills across the country are adopting a series of technologies to become more energy efficient, aiming to save emissions equal to 3 million cars each year. In doing so, they expect to save Rs. 1,000 crore in a single year. Meanwhile big gains are also being demonstrated by the khadi handloom sector, with many looking to replace power looms with solar-run systems. At the other end of the spectrum, cities like Indore are pioneering effective waste management systems to deal with plastic, one of the biggest environmental threats facing us today. Recycled plastic is used in road construction and cement factories, reducing thousands of tonnes in emissions and building better livelihoods for those entrusted with keeping our cities clean. These achievements and commitments are a testament to India's resolve to be a strong leader on climate action. The country has often played crucial role, bringing many countries together to negotiate on a common platform. More importantly, India has made compelling arguments about the need for nations to bridge development and climate action on issues of equity, finance and technology. The Bonn summit will be crucial in determining the continued success of the Paris agreement. The essential foundation for how international climate action will be advanced was laid in Paris. Now the strategy on how countries can be held accountable to their NDCs and incentivised to do even more will be written in Bonn. This means making significant progress in some of the more knotty issues in international climate diplomacy, such as financing and technology transfers from developed countries to developing nations. In addition, negotiators will focus on building greater transparency and accountability in how countries report progress and a new five-year cycle to assess progress and spur parties to announce stronger emissions reduction targets. Negotiations will also push for an increase in the level of detail countries provide alongside future targets so the environmental implications can be fully understood. The Paris agreement created a dynamic process for countries to adopt more aggressive commitments by 2020. I am confident that far from falling short in meeting the goals of the Paris accord, experiences from countries like India will only add to our collective ambition to act on climate change.

Building on the UN Ocean Conference, held in June 2017, the roundtable discussed ways to enhance preparations for the Our Ocean Conference to be held in Malta in October 2017 and COP23 in Bonn, Germany, in November 2017. The roundtable took place in the presence of Frans Timmermans, First Vice-President of the European Commission, Dr. Thani bin Ahmed Al-Zeyoudi, Minister of Climate Change and Environment, and Inia Seruiratu, Minister for Agriculture, Rural and Maritime Development and National Disaster Management and COP23 High-Level Champion, Fiji. It brought together government and business leaders, financial institutions, international organisations and academics to build a shared view on near-term investment and policy priorities, and, most importantly, to strengthen partnerships to benefit the sustainable ocean economy. In his welcoming remarks, Dr. Thani Al-Zeyoudi underlined the ever-increasing importance of oceans and marine resources, in particular with the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goal 14 on the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans, seas and marine resources. ""The marine environment has been a significant component of the UAEs environmental resources and continues to play an integral role in our everyday lives. The discovery of oil strengthened the position of our marine environment as a mainstay of our economic resources. Our marine wealth is equally precious for its rich biodiversity and for enabling the countrys significant achievements in the transportation, desalination, tourism and entertainment industries,"" Dr. Al-Zeyoudi said. The Minister added, ""The UAE is home to a wide range of marine species including green turtle, fin whale and dugong. The country is also rich in 'Blue Carbon' coastal and marine ecosystems, such as mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrass, which protect our shorelines, provide nursery grounds and habitats for marine species and support coastal tourism. We also recognise their contribution in mitigating climate change through carbon sequestration and storage."" Dr. Al Zeyoudi emphasised that the UAE is taking proactive measures to ensure the sustainability of these valuable natural assets and to meet its national objective for economic diversification. He noted that the UAEs efforts in the field of marine environment conservation are three-fold and include: protection from pollution due to oil and other harmful materials, protection of marine environment ecosystems, and strengthening the countrys resilience to the impacts of climate change. He also highlighted a set of relevant policies and national plans in the UAEs marine environment protection portfolio, such as the 'National Plan for the Sustainability of Marine and Coastal Environment', the 'National Strategy for Biodiversity 2015-2021', the 'UAE Green Development Strategy', as well as the 'UAE Energy Strategy 2050' and the 'National Climate Change Plan'. In his concluding remarks, Dr. Thani Al-Zeyoudi reiterated the UAE's commitment to facilitating dialogue and cooperation with the global community on the sustainable management of the marine environment and resources that offer immense social and economic value. Inia Seruiratu highlighted the necessity to engage with different stakeholders to achieve a sustainable economy. He said that ""while supporting policy and incentive frameworks are important, the involvement of the private sector, local communities, civil societies and other institutions is crucial to ensure successful implementation."" The Fiji high-level champion urged and challenged partners in the room to come up with innovative and transformative approaches, technologies, and financing, to accelerate climate action and build a more resilient ocean sector. He also informed the high-level participants of a planned Oceans Pathway that the Fiji COP23 Presidency would be introduced during COP23 in November. The Oceans Pathway serves to ensure that the nexus between oceans and climate change is integrated into the UNFCC process by 2020. In his remarks, Frans Timmermans underscored the importance of raising awareness of the challenges that oceans face. He emphasised that the responsibility for preserving the worlds oceans does not fall on one government or sector, but is rather the collective responsibility that all sectors, governments and communities share. He also reiterated the urgent need for all concerned parties and stakeholders to work together in shaping a global strategy to curb plastic waste entering the oceans. \"

It includes information submitted by a wide range of UN agencies on human, socio-economic and environmental impacts as part of a drive to provide a more comprehensive, UN-wide policy brief for decision makers on the interplay between weather, climate and water and the UN global goals. ""The past three years have all been in the top three years in terms of temperature records. This is part of a long term warming trend,"" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. ""We have witnessed extraordinary weather, including temperatures topping 50 degrees Celsius in Asia, record-breaking hurricanes in rapid succession in the Caribbean and Atlantic reaching as far as Ireland, devastating monsoon flooding affecting many millions of people and a relentless drought in East Africa. ""Many of these events - and detailed scientific studies will determine exactly how many - bear the tell-tale sign of climate change caused by increased greenhouse gas concentrations from human activities,"" he said. ""Bonn 2017 needs to be the launch pad towards the next, higher level of ambition by all nations and all sectors of society as we look to de-risk the future and maximize the opportunities from a fresh, forward-looking and sustainable development path,"" she added. --IANS vg/vd \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India183","Austria : IAEA to Lead Events at Climate Change Talks on Energy Policy, Nuclear Power, Ocean Acidification","November 7, 2017 Tuesday","TendersInfo","The IAEA will lead side events on energy policy, sustainable development, nuclear power and climate change, and the future of the oceans at the Bonn Climate Change Conference, which kicks off today in the western German city. The 23rd Conference of Parties ( COP23 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) provides a platform for countries to present their strategies for mitigating the effects of a warming planet, including their next steps for implementing the Paris Agreement on climate change. The conference, presided over by the Government of Fiji, runs through 17 November. The IAEA will seek to raise awareness among participants and country delegates of the role of nuclear science and technology in addressing climate change, including the resources available at the IAEA to meet their needs, said David Shropshire, Head of the IAEAs Planning and Economic Studies Section and of the Agencys delegation at COP23 . The IAEA will lead two other events. On 8 November, Connecting Roadmaps for Innovative Nuclear Energy to the NDC Timeline will focus on how nuclear energy innovation can be coupled with the timelines of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) made by countries in committing to the Paris Agreement. Another side event on 15 November will discuss how nuclear power, which accounts for one third of global low carbon energy production, can further contribute to climate change mitigation. To meet the targets set out in the Paris Agreement, nuclear power capacity will need to be substantially increased by 2050, said IAEA Deputy Director General Mikhail Chudakov, Head of the Department of Nuclear Energy. At the 8 November side event, panellists will discuss innovations in nuclear energy technologies the progress, challenges, and enabling conditions to accelerate their development and hopefully, early deployment, he added. The five-year NDC reporting period and time horizons of innovative nuclear power technologies, could be incorporated into energy plans to support carbon reductions. In addition, the IAEA is the focal point of another joint UN side event on 11 November, Ocean and Climate: A Resilient Ocean for Future Generations. The IAEA will explain how policymakers can make informed decisions on climate change through the use of nuclear science, including in measuring and monitoring ocean acidification, which is profoundly changing seawater chemistry, threatening marine ecosystems and coastal communities. As the focal point for the UN exhibit on Energy, Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, focused on SDGs 7 and 9, IAEA staff will also interact with participants on the Agencys work on climate change during the two-week-long COP23 . \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India184","Belgium : Cor Lamers elected ENVE Commission Chair","September 21, 2017 Thursday","TendersInfo","The Commission for the Environment, Climate Change and Energy (ENVE) of the European Committee of the Regions (CoR) has elected the Mayor of Schiedam, Cor Lamers (NL/EPP), as its new Chair. The election took place shortly before members held a debate with Karl-Heinz Lambertz, President of the CoR, on Reflecting on the future of Europe the environmental dimension. President Lambertz, who will lead the CoR delegation to the COP23 in November, reiterated the frontline role cities and regions play in the fight against global warming. Roby Biwer (LU/PES), Member of the Bettembourg Municipal Council in Luxembourg was elected ENVEs first Vice-Chair while Valter Flego (HR/ALDE), Prefect of the Istra County in Croatia, will be ENVEs second Vice-Chair. Speaking after his election on Monday 18 September, Cor Lamers declared: I want to be an inclusive chair and give ENVE members the space and opportunity to get involved in issues of their interest and expertise. My political objective is to pursue efforts towards building more sustainable cities and regions and finding a balance between the economic, social and environmental development of our communities. The shift towards a circular economy and the support for eco-innovative SMEs is essential for that purpose. Cor Lamers will be part of the CoR delegation to COP23 in Bonn. The Mayor of Schiedam has been a member of the CoR since February 2007. Lamers recalled the importance of cooperating with other EU institutions, highlighting the aim of establishing regular meetings between the CoR and the European Parliaments ENVI and ITRE committees. Ahead of COP23 in Bonn, Lamers stressed the need to identify clear areas of cooperation with US Mayors within the framework of the Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2010, and with the Canadian mayors that we are going to meet in Bonn. President Lambertz congratulated Francesco Pigliaru for his commitment and achievements and welcomed Cor Lamers as the new chair of the ENVE commission. President Lambertz said: ""Energy and climate issues must be at the very heart of Europe's future. Regions and cities are on the frontline which is why we need EU environmental policy that is easy to deliver locally to ensure local and regional governments are fully on board. It is an opportunity to demonstrate that the EU does benefit the lives of all our citizens and proves that Europe is ready for the challenges of the 21st century."" Cities and regions want to give environmental policy a stronger focus within the ongoing reflection on the future of Europe. The EU's assembly of cities and regions is contributing to the debate by holding citizens' dialogues across the European Union, led by CoR members, and through the adoption of Resolution on the EC White Paper on the Future of Europe . Environmental legislation is one of the greatest successes in European integration, also in citizen's views, as it is perceived as 'necessary to protect the environment' by 75% of Europeans, according to a recent Eurobarometer. The debate included the interventions of Jeremy Wates, Secretary-General of the European Environmental Bureau (EEB), Marjolein Demmers, President of Ecopreneur and Gilles Gantelet, Director for Policy at DG Environment European Commission. \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India185","Philippines : Senator Legarda Pushes PH Advocacy in UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn","November 21, 2017 Tuesday","TendersInfo","Senator Loren Legarda is leading efforts to once again bring to the fore the Philippines climate change advocacy at the ongoing 23rd Session of the Conference of Parties ( COP23 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Bonn, Germany. She heads the Philippine Delegation to COP23 , composed of officials from Philippine Government agencies handling climate change-related issues, together with Secretary Emmanuel M. De Guzman of the Climate Change Commission. The representatives of various countries, including the Philippines, are currently drawing up a comprehensive rule book that would facilitate the implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change from 2020 and beyond. Active involvement The Philippines active involvement in this years climate talks signifies our steadfast commitment to realize the principles that we have championed in the Paris Agreement, which we ratified early this year. This is yet again a manifestation of our commitment to climate justiceto make the developed and industrialized countries answer for contributing the most to global warming and climate changeas well as a testament of our solidarity to the call for greater and more ambitious global climate action, Senator Legarda said. Philippine Ambassador to Germany Melita Sta. Maria-Thomeczek, for her part, welcomed the countrys strong participation in COP23 . We are glad to welcome all our delegates, led by Senator Legarda and Secretary De Guzman, to Bonn. In the past few days, they have been engaged in a series of fora and workshops which are, of course, crucial in the effective implementation of the Paris Agreement, the Ambassador said. Together with other leaders and climate change experts, the Senator also had the opportunity to spell out the Philippines commitments and strategy on climate change on the sidelines of COP23 . During the side event, Championing NAPs - Advancing National Adaptation Plans, Senator Legarda shared that the Philippines has made significant progress in the development of a National Adaptation Plan (NAP) with the enactment of the Climate Change Act of 2009 (Republic Act 9729), which mandates the updating of the National Climate Change Action Plan. RA 9729 was principally sponsored and authored by Senator Legarda who chairs the Senate Committees on Climate Change, Foreign Relations, and Finance. The Senator called for scaled-up, continuous, predictable, and adequate financial support for adaptation. Adaptation is at the very core of the Philippines climate change strategy. Like any other climate vulnerable country, we should be able to realize our full capacity to adapt to climate change. We have been championing for a more pronounced commitment from developed countries to finance adaptation in climate negotiations, as part of our demand for climate justice, Senator Legarda said. For her efforts, the Senator was named NAP Champion by the UNFCCC Secretariat last November 13, alongside Fekitamoeloa Katoa 'Utoikamanu (Under-Secretary-General and High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States) a development welcomed by the Philippine Embassy. We are very proud that Senator Legarda was named NAP Champion, which recognizes her tireless efforts to push for decisive action on the issue of climate change, both domestically and in the multilateral arena, Ambassador Thomeczek said. Mr. Youssef Nassef, UNFCCC Adaptation Committee Director, noted that the designation of Senator Legarda and 'Utoikamanu as NAP Champions is ""the first in the process of UNFCCC,"" signifying the urgent need to promote the importance of resilience and facilitate linkages with external contexts to climate change adaptation. 1.5 degree Celsius-limit In her keynote address at the forum, Innovative Climate Finance Strategies and Instruments by and for Climate Vulnerable Countries, Senator Legarda assured the Philippines international climate allies that the countrys Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) would be compatible with the 1.5 ?C-limit in the rise of global temperatures prescribed by the Paris Agreement. We continue to pursue a development path consistent with 1.5 degrees not only because we know it is the best way to protect our people and climate, but also because we know it will also spur economic growth. More than just transitioning our energy sector to clean energy-powered economies, the race to 1.5?C-compatible economies presents to the ambitious an opportunity to transform development itself, the Senator said. Invest in mitigation Senator Legarda pitched for additional investment in climate change mitigation at the forum, Asia-Pacific Climate Action: Making Finance Flows Consistent with a Pathway Towards Low Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate-resilient Development for the Implementation of the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda. We need to foster a policy environment that will raise the participation of the financial sector in low-carbon investments needs. One strategy could be to identify the best mix of lending instruments to attract low-carbon investments, Senator Legarda said. She likewise mentioned that she filed a proposed measure to establish environmental units in every banking institution. This will assess and ensure that projects, subject to financing applications as well as collateral offered as security, comply with Philippine environmental laws. She also stressed that climate action makes good development sense. \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India186","Of the obvious, the banal and the rerun","November 17, 2017 Friday","Down To Earth","India, Nov. 17 -- The penultimate day of the 23rd Conference of Parties (CoP) on climate change in progress in Bonn, Germany, was marked by the presentation of Country Statement by India. In a high-pitched narration, India's environment minister Harsh Vardhan read out a note which merely stated the obvious: reposing its faith in the process of the Paris Agreement. The statement said, ""The task ahead is effective operationalisation (of the Agreement) in accordance with agreed principles of Equity and Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC)."" Vardhan went on to say, "".we expect that the CoP23 outcomes are balanced and reached upon through a Party-driven process. They should not result in reinterpretation of the Paris Agreement and equal progress should be made on all pillars."" Earlier, outlining what was expected of the conference, he had said that CoP23 ""would set the stage for the 2018 Facilitative Dialogue, accelerate pre-2020 action and firm up the modalities for implementation of the Paris Agreement."" Besides waxing eloquent on how India's traditional knowledge can become a ""beacon of light"" at this stage, the statement also stressed on energy actions. It said that India has taken ambitious mitigation and adaptation actions in the field of clean and renewable energy as well as enhancement of energy efficiency. ""Planned actions and economic reforms have contributed positively to the rapidly declining growth rate of energy intensity in India and steps are being taken to decouple the Indian energy system from carbon in the long run."" Commenting on the statement, Chandra Bhushan, deputy director general, Centre for Science and Environment said, ""We all know that equity and CBDR are important and so is ambition. The minister has said nothing new. However, the fact remains that in pre-2020 action, without any commitment from the US, equity and CBDR are meaningless. In fact, without an ambitious commitment from the US, the Paris Agreement will neither be equitable nor ambitious. No one at CoP23 in Bonn is stating this obvious fact."" The presenter of the US Country Statement was Judith Garber, acting assistant secretary for oceans and international environmental and scientific affairs. She began her statement with the now oft-repeated position adapted by her country: while the US intends to withdraw from the Paris Agreement as made clear by President Trump, it remains open to the possibility of rejoining the process at a later date, ""under terms more favourable to the American people"". For its major part, the US Statement dwelt on the energy actions and the partnerships that the country had built up: ""the US is working bilaterally with countries such as China and India to advance power sector transformation and smart grid technologies, energy efficiency and carbon capture utilisation and storage,"" the Statement asserted, adding that the US wanted to support the cleanest and most efficient power generation, ""regardless of the source"". Garber ended by saying that the US intends to remain engaged with its partners and allies around the world on these issues"". The question that remains is whether this chest-thumping and unilateral assertion of engagement will amount to anything in resolving an issue which needs collective and coordinated action.

"COP23","India","COP23_India187","EU seeks to play down divide between rich and developing nations; promises to ratify Kyoto Protocol in coming months","November 11, 2017 Saturday","The Times of India (TOI)","BONN, Germany: A day after developing countries, including India and China, jointly called rich nations to act on their Kyoto Protocol (KP) commitment to build trust, the European Union (EU) on Friday sought to defuse tension by promising to ratify the pre-2020 deal in the coming months but could not forward a convincing argument as to why it continued to oppose its discussion as part of agenda of the ongoing climate conference ( COP23 ). ""The second commitment period (of KP) has been legislated for all members and they are legally bounded to deliver. We have not yet deposited the EU ratification instrument. That is simply because there is some pending national procedure which is in its final stages. The deposition of EU instrument (of ratification) is really imminent"", said Elina Bardram from the European Commission. Elina, however, refused to give any timeline for that. She said, ""I cannot now commit to a timeline because it is dependent on so many factors. But, we can of course hope that this is something that we can do really in the coming months if not weeks"". Developing countries, including India and China, on Thursday appealed the rich nations to ratify the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2013-2020), guiding their climate action for next three years, by June 2018 to build trust and confidence in the multilateral process. The pre-2020 actions refer to existing obligations under the KP where only rich nations are obliged to take mitigation (emission cut) actions. Though the developed countries had in 2012 agreed to undertake their aggregate emission cuts by at least 18% below the 1990 levels, most of them, including the EU, have, so far, not even ratified the decision. Ratification of the Protocol is important for global climate action for the years leading up to 2020. So far, only 84 of the total 191 signatories have ratified it. It has not yet become operational as it still falls short of required number. Though Eline, head of international and Inter-institutional Relations in the European Commission, emphasized that the EU has done a lot on what it had committed even without its ratification, she could not forward any new argument over the existing divide between developed and developing countries on the issue of including the pre-2020 matters in the agenda of the COP23 . ""There is no disagreement on the importance of early action, the importance of pre-2020 actions, and the importance of getting the right political visibility and recognition of this priority. However, as we do have a full negotiation agenda and technical negotiations, we need to be mindful of where we find the best place to discuss the issue, where we get the recognition and draw the public attention to the important issue"", she said. ""This is not a real divide between country or country groups"", said Elina. Both India and China, as part of different groups of developing countries, have been insisting to include the pre-2020 issues in the agenda of the COP23 right from the day one of this Conference. ""If we do not respect the decisions (of the Kyoto Protocol), how do we trust the process and lay good foundation for the implementation of the Paris Agreement?"" asked Chen Zhihua from China while addressing a joint press conference with Indian negotiators Arun Kumar Mehta and Ravi Shanka Prasad on Thursday. Pitching for actions on pre-2020 commitments, Prasad had said, ""If we see the forward movement, there will be lot of clarity, there will be lot of trust and there will be lot of commitment among the Parties (countries) to keep this action forward. I hope that we will be able to discuss this agenda item and take decision during the COP23 to ensure that the trust and confidence in the multilateral process continue and we are on track to bridge the emission gap as has been brought out by the UNEP. It may also ensure that we are on track for the post-2020 (under Paris Agreement) actions"". Mehta too emphasised on it, saying the pre-2020 is essential to building trust in the system that we are talking in a framework where everybody is cooperating. ""Fundamentally, the delayed action is not going to help anyone...All parties need to work together"", said Mehta. The UNEP had on October 31 brought 'Emission Gap Report', noting that the national pledges on emission reduction, made by countries from across the globe under the Paris Agreement, will only bring a third of what is needed to avoid worst impact of climate change. It had said that even full implementation of current unconditional and conditional national climate actions makes a temperature increase of at least 3 degree Celsius by 2100.

"COP23","India","COP23_India188","COP 23: Are countries ready for new market mechanism?","November 8, 2017 Wednesday","Down To Earth","India, Nov. 8 -- At Bonn, Parties are working towards creating a rule book for implementing the various provisions of Paris Agreement. One such provision is the New Market Mechanism (NMM) mentioned in Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. The Agreement talks of cooperative approaches ""which would involve the use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMO) towards nationally determined contributions, promote sustainable development and ensure environmental integrity and transparency."" Thus, ITMOs are meant to help in meeting a part of commitments of Parties, as defined in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The round-table discussion on NMM at Bonn, which was closed to observers. happened on range of issues, including the nature of the work programme, the organisational arrangements to assist in the implementation of NDCs and reporting institutions to monitor action. Thereafter, the discussion focused on fleshing out the rules and technicalities of Article 6. Article 6 not only talks about cooperative approaches, which include ITMOS, but also about sustainable development mechanism (SDM) for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and supporting sustainable development. The Article, however, fails to provide link between ITMOS and SDM. Moreover, it talks about non-market approaches without elaborating them further. Issues with ITMOs Prime questions persist. How to define ITMOs, SDM and non-market cooperative approaches? What should come under the three components and what should be the linkage between the three? Or should they be kept different yet complementary to each other? Some Parties have referred to ITMOs as 'emission reduction units'. However, the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) does not treat ITMOS as 'emission reduction units' or £llowances' or something that is 'bankable'. The group has also focused on non-market cooperative approaches. There are fundamental issues with regard to ITMOs. How would the ITMOs be registered for transfer considering that the nature and content of NDCs are diverse and not mitigation-centric, as was the case under Kyoto Protocol? How to avoid double counting of mitigation outcomes (for both the buyer and seller of mitigation outcome)? How to report and account for the ITMOs? How to generate demand for the mitigation outcomes and how to define additionality (in addition to business-as-usual scenario) in relation to ITMOs? Problem with new market approaches under Paris Agreement Another major issue is the extent of readiness of Parties for creating quality mitigation outcomes and transferring the mitigation outcomes to avoid double counting. Under the Paris Agreement, the incentives for market approaches are different. The purpose, as enshrined in the Agreement, is to ""deliver an overall mitigation in global emissions and contribute to sustainable development"". This approach is different when compared to the motivations behind the market mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol, which was largely about gaining financial benefits for developing countries with developed nations meeting a part of their Kyoto commitments. The Paris Agreement envisages a new role for countries participating in market mechanisms. Distinction between developed and developing countries is absent in the Paris Agreement as it encourages all Parties to voluntarily develop their markets internally and trade the mitigation outcomes with other markets. This makes the situation more complicated because different countries are at different starting points in relation to carbon markets. While countries like US, EU, Japan, Vietnam, Ukraine and Brazil have more developed and active carbon markets, African countries such as Ethiopia are at a preliminary stage. Developing nations need enabling conditions to develop carbon markets The Paris Agreement points to new market approaches to build on the 'learnings and experiences' of the Kyoto market mechanisms but not to the same institutions, mechanisms, structures and methodologies used in the Kyoto regime. Therefore, institutions under Kyoto may not be much relevant to Paris Agreement and may have limited role under the new regime. If this is agreed upon as the starting point for creating NMM, it would be an even more cumbersome process for all countries to start a new regime for carbon markets at whichever stage of development they are in. Developing countries would need enabling conditions, more robust and transparent monitoring and accounting mechanisms for development of carbon markets. Efficient and functioning carbon markets depend largely on enhanced transparency framework of action and support and accounting mechanism. Discussions need to take place on the linkages among the three components and how to integrate and synchronise them. However, the major challenge is that negotiations on markets fall under SBSTA (Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice) while the transparency and accounting frameworks are under the APA (Ad Hoc Working Group on the Paris Agreement). At present, more coordination is needed between the two negotiating bodies. So far, nothing has been agreed upon in relation to markets and almost every issue needs deliberations. Going by the present pace and substance of discussions, a draft document on rules, modalities and guidelines seems difficult.

"COP23","India","COP23_India189","Belgium : UN climate conference makes progress on Paris Agreement implementation","November 20, 2017 Monday","TendersInfo","This year's climate conference, COP23 , concluded today with steps forward to ensure global climate action through implementation of the Paris Agreement. Nearly 200 countries gathered at COP23 , held in Bonn under the presidency of Fiji. The parties made concrete progress on turning the historic 2015 agreement into action on the ground across the world, ahead of next year's UN climate conference in Katowice, Poland. The Paris Agreement sets out a global framework for climate action and the necessary transition to a low-carbon future in order to limit global warming to well below 2C. Under the Paris Agreement the EU has committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% till 2030 (1990 level). As stated by Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in his 2017 State of the Union address, the EU wants to remain the global leader in the fight against climate change. To re-affirm this commitment to ambitious climate action, President Juncker will lead the Commission delegation at the 'One Planet Summit' to be hosted by the French President Emanuel Macron, the United Nations and the World Bank in Paris on 12 December. Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy Miguel Arias Caete said: ""The spirit of Paris is very much alive. We achieved progress in Bonn on the issues that were important to the EU, such as the Paris Work Program. But we must continue to build on this momentum in the coming months, because there is still a lot of work ahead of us before we meet in Katowice next year. The main objective must be to keep the world firmly on the path towards what was agreed two years ago in Paris."" The EU again had a central role in brokering agreements during the two-week climate negotiations. As a sign of climate leadership the EU announced on Thursday that it intends to deposit the ratification instruments of the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol by the end of this year. The Doha Amendment concerns the second period of the Kyoto Protocol, which requires parties to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2020. The EU has already exceeded its 2020 targets in 2016 by having decreased emissions by 23%. The decision to swiftly ratify the Doha Amendment demonstrates our commitment to the international climate action and shows that the EU makes good on its promises. Concrete steps forward were also taken on the work program for implementing the Paris Agreement. Clarity on the design of the so called 'Talanoa Dialogue' (Facilitative Dialogue) has been achieved looking at how global climate action can be accelerated in the years to come. The Facilitative Dialogue next year will be the opportunity for political stock-taking for the parties on progress made on the implementation of the Paris Agreement. COP23 also brought outcomes on a number of other key issues: Facilitative (Talanoa)Dialogue The design of the Talanoa Dialogue has been agreed here in Bonn to set a firm base for ambitiously accelerating global efforts to tackle climate change. The Dialogue will provide a space to showcase progress and share best practice in tackling climate change, with contributions from every corner of society. Pre-2020 ambition The discussions on pre-2020 ambition concluded with an agreement on a decision text which foresees two stocktaking exercises on pre-2020 implementation and ambition to take place at COP24 and COP25. The EU has already exceeded its 2020 target by having decreased emissions by 23% in 2016. Furthermore, the EU and its Member States remain the biggest donors of climate finance to developing countries with a contribution of 20.2 billion in 2016. Loss and damage The parties agreed on a substantive decision text. They worked out a compromise proposal that takes into account asks from the vulnerable and small islands while keeping a balance with what had been already agreed. An expert dialogue will be organised in May 2018 to enhance the support for Loss and Damage. Gender Action Plan The COP23 The Parties agreed on the functioning of the local communities and indigenous peoples' platform, which was established at COP21 in Paris. Again the EU played an important role in securing the outcome. Next steps Ahead of the next UN climate conference (COP24) in Katowice, Poland, in December 2018, the EU will play an active role in a number of key high-level climate events, starting with the 'One Planet Summit' in Paris next month. Next year, the EU will also host the second Ministerial on Climate Action (MoCA) together with Canada and China, in Brussels, and takes part in the 2018 Petersberg Climate Dialogue, as well as preparatory UN climate meetings in Bonn and Katowice ahead of COP24. The release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) special report on global warming of 1.5 celsius ahead of Katowice will be an important source of information for discussions under the Talanoa Dialogue. \"

Climate Change Minister James Shaw and Pacific Peoples Minister Aupito William Sio are attending the climate change meeting in Bonn, Germany, known as COP23 . Under Fijis leadership the voice of low-lying small islands, such as those in the Pacific, will be heard clearly at this COP, Mr Shaw says. Aupito and I will be listening closely to Pacific Island leaders concerns and priorities. This is the first time a small island developing state has presided over the COP. This is important, because these countries are particularly vulnerable to climate impacts such as threats to food and water supplies, and energy security. Mr Shaw and Mr Sio will also be attending a meeting in Rome between Pacific Island Forum Leaders and His Holiness Pope Francis, en route to COP23 . Mr Sio says the Government and Pacific peoples need to speak together in responding to climate change. The Government recognises that Pacific Island nations are at particular risk of rising sea levels as a result of climate change and global warming. People from low-lying island nations face real threats of being displaced from their homes and may need to find new homes in future years. We will work with regional partners and organisations, and review migration policy with the Minister of Immigration to establish a better approach to deal with this very real issue for Pacific nations and peoples, and we will keep fighting climate change, says Mr Sio. We want to see on-the-ground action to reduce emissions, and progress on the Paris Agreement work programme. The aim is to make good progress so the rules and procedures for the Paris Agreement can be completed by COP24, Mr Shaw says. New Zealands goal is to work constructively with the rest of the world to accelerate the global transition to a low emissions future. \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India191","Bridge ambition, investment gap to meet Paris climate goals: Experts","November 13, 2017 Monday","IANS-English","Bonn, Nov 13 -- Finance for countering climate change is flowing at a greater pace than ever, with growing markets for renewable energy. But there is still an ambition- investment gap to meet the goals of the Paris Climate Change Agreement To bridge this, which is completely inter-connected, governments and the entire financial sector must see it as a single challenge. This was the main focus of discussion of high-level representatives at COP23 Finance for Climate Day on Monday who highlighted their efforts to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement and underlined that this challenge of coordination and coherence needed to be quickly addressed. They set out what needs to be done next by governments, cities, states, business and multilateral institutions to secure the pace and scale of investment required, before and after 2020, to meet the Paris goal of keeping the average global temperature rise well below two degrees Celsius and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees. ""At the heart of the climate challenge are two gaps we urgently need to bridge: the ambition and the investment gap,"" UNEP Finance Initiative head Eric Usher said. ""It is up to national governments now to increase the ambition of their NDCs to close the 17 GtCO2e emissions gap that we still face for 2030. When it comes to the investment gap, however, we need all financial players to work together effectively to mobilise at least $1.5 trillion of climate finance that is needed every year,"" he said. What is more, every dollar invested in cutting greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate change gets double the bang for the buck because the results directly support the only sustainable future possible, which is captured in the international community's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Finance is flowing at a greater pace than ever, with vibrant and growing markets for renewable energy, electric vehicles, green buildings and climate-smart agriculture seeing aggressive growth, backed by exponential advances in innovative green financial instruments, indices and markets. Equally, the finance sector is recognising to a much greater degree where and how climate change presents risks to its existing investments and the need to adjust their portfolios away from carbon-intensive assets to reduce that risk. However, as a series of discussions taking place at the UN Climate Change Conference highlight, much more is needed to secure finance and investment at the scale required to deliver a fully de-carbonised and climate-resilient global economy by 2050. Laura Tuck, Vice President Sustainable Development, World Bank said: ""The potential for climate friendly investment in areas such as clean energy and climate-smart agriculture is enormous."" ""The key is to get the funding to flow so that everyone everywhere can benefit from low-carbon and climate resilient investments. That's why we are working with the UN and our other development partners to create the conditions that will attract investors and to get all forms of finance - public, private, philanthropic - working together for maximum impact,"" she said. Vladis Dombrovskis, Vice-President of the European Commission said: ""Hundreds of billions of euros in investment are needed to transition to a low carbon economy and meet the target of well below two degrees warming. This is a challenge but also an opportunity for the EU to become a magnet for green investment and lead the way in mobilising both public and private financing for sustainable projects."" The high-level finance for Climate Day focused, among others, on investment to reallocate capital flows towards low-carbon and resilient growth, with additional upfront capital or risk sharing, to deliver financial returns and resource savings.

The call on ratification deadline was made after developed countries including United States (US), European Union, Canada, Australia and Japan opposed the demand of developing countries to put pre-2020 commitments of rich nations for discussion in the agenda of the ongoing climate conference ( COP23 ). The move is seen as an attempt by developed countries not to discuss something which they had not fulfilled under their previous commitments. The US, which generally remained quite during the negotiation, intervened on the issue in a separate meeting to take a call on the agenda of the Conference and opposed the developing countries demand. Though the US is not part of the KP, its intervention is interpreted as a move to avoid any climate action, whatsoever, on its part till 2020. Ratification of the Protocol is a valuable part of the momentum for global climate action for the years leading up to 2020. So far, only 84 of the total 191 signatories have ratified it.India too had raised the demand of including pre-2020 actions of rich nations in the agenda of the Conference on Monday while supporting a group of developing countries - Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDC) - on the issue. The pre-2020 actions refer to existing obligations under the KP where only rich nations are obliged to take mitigation (emission cut) actions. Though the developed countries had in 2012 agreed to undertake their aggregate emission cuts by at least 18% below the 1990 levels, most of them have, so far, not even ratified the decision.""All developing countries feel that we can have a deadline of May or June 2018 for ratification of the second commitment period (KP-II) by all Parties (countries) to ensure its coming into force"", said Indian negotiator Ravi Shankar Prasad while addressing a joint press conference with representatives of developing countries, including China, on Thursday.Pitching for actions on pre-2020 commitments, Prasad, flanked by senior Indian negotiator Arun Kumar Mehta, said, ""If we see the forward movement, there will be lot of clarity, there will be lot of trust and there will be lot of commitment among the Parties (countries) to keep this action forward.""I hope that we will be able to discuss this agenda item and take decision during the COP23 to ensure that the trust and confidence in the multilateral process continues and we are on track to bridge the emission gap as has been brought out by the UNEP. It may also ensure that we are on track for the post-2020 (under Paris Agreement) actions"".Mehta too emphasised on it, saying the pre-2020 is essential to building trust in the system that we are talking in a framework where everybody is cooperating. ""Fundamentally, the delayed action is not going to help anyone...All parties need to work together"", Mehta said.Chinese negotiator expressed similar concerns during the joint press conference and appealed for including pre-2020 issues in the agenda.

Finland will channel a total of EUR 114 million into the Finland-IFC Climate Change Program, whose duration is 25 years. The funds will be invested in climate projects during the next five years. This will be the largest funding ever targeted at international climate work in Finland. ""With this investment, Finland will fulfil the promise it gave at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris for directing a significant part of its development funding to climate actions. At the same time, establishing a joint fund with the worlds largest development financier will open for Finnish companies a door to the growing clean energy solution markets in developing countries"", says Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Kai Mykknen. Compared with the IFCs usual practice, the Finland Fund allows directing investments to poorer countries than before and focusing on earlier phase investments. Funds will only be invested in developing countries. Financial investments differ from grant based aid in that the capital invested will be returned and can be reused. In return for Finlands financing, the IFC will also invest its own capital in all of the projects. The aim is also to attract a large amount of other private and public capital. Funding targets comprise loans granted for companies operating in developing countries, capital investments and guarantees, for instance. Acceptable sectors include energy efficiency, renewable energy, sustainable forestry and land use, meteorology, and water and wastewater solutions. In addition to climatic effects, the investments also target development effects, such as increasing the number of jobs and tax revenue. The IFC is the worlds leading private sector development financier. Philippe Le Hourou, CEO of the IFC, points out that trillions of dollars are needed for the world to transition to a low-carbon economy. ""This represents a significant investment opportunity for the private sector. But it requires a coordinated approach by governments and businessesto remove barriers to the adoption of low-carbon technologies, strengthen policy and regulatory frameworks, and overcome investor perceptions of high risk. Our partnership with Finland is an important step toward those goals."" New opportunities for international cooperation will open up for Finnish companies, because many of them have strong climate competence and expertise in the sectors emphasized in the fund. ""We need not leave the energy and water solution markets in developing countries to the Danish or other players who traditionally have a strong presence in the area. In December, we will start a tour in Finland to share information on the opportunities offered by the IFC Fund and our other new development funding instruments."" \"

They say there is noticeable climate change and i's still about to get much worse with a future of severe flooding, heat waves and droughts Emissions need to peak soon and approach zero by 2050 and there is a mechanism to transition to a low carbon world. For this, a strong political is required.""There is no room for complacency. Climate change is here. It is dangerous. And it is about to get much worse,"" Stockholm Resilience Centre Executive Director Johan Rockstrom said in this German city. ""In the last two years, evidence has accumulated that we are now on a collision course with tipping points in the earth's system,"" said Rockstrom, who is the Chair of the Earth League, an international network of scientists that co-produced a report, underscoring the need for rapid action. The report, ""The 10 Science 'Must Knows' on Climate Chang"", was presented to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa on the sidelines of UN climate change negotiations ( COP-23 ) in Bonn on Monday. It is published by Future Earth and the Earth League, two major international organisations representing networks of global sustainability scientists, and summarizes recent earth-system science and economic research. ""Emissions need to peak soon and approach zero by 2050. Fortunately, we now have the tools to transition to a low carbon world while increasing energy security, improving human health, and strengthening economies."" Earth League member and director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research Hans Joachim Schellnhuber said some crucial facts on climate change tend to get lost in the noise of daily deliberations -- even at an event such as COP-23 . The 16-page report says the planet has entered a new geologic epoch called the Anthropocene. The rate of change of the earth system is accelerating as a result of human impact on the planet's biology, chemistry and physics. The earth is approaching critical ""tipping points"". By crossing these thresholds, the planet may see abrupt, and possibly irreversible shifts in the workings of the Arctic, the Amazon and other parts of the globe. It says the record-breaking 2017 Atlantic hurricane season provides a glimpse of the increased risks of extreme weather events that the planet may experience in the future. These events include severe flooding, heat waves and droughts. Climate change even as has a huge impact on oceans, with accelerating rise in sea-levels and its acidification. Foreseeing civil unrest, the scientists say the climate change is likely to exacerbate migration and even conflict. In 2015, more than 19 million people globally were displaced by natural disasters and extreme weather events and climate change will likely cause that number to grow. A word of caution: Emissions should peak by 2020 and approach zero by around 2050 if the world is serious about reducing risks. As a simple rule of thumb, this means halving global emissions every decade. A society free of fossil fuels is economically attractive: renewable energy sources increasingly compete with fossil fuels, even when these are priced at historic lows. The estimated costs of inaction range from two to 10 per cent of GDP by 2100 by some estimates, to a fall in projected global output by 23 per cent in 2100 in others. Even if the world meets the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement targets, communities across the globe will still need to build resilience and adapt to the changes already underway, the report says. The central goal of the Paris Agreement is to keep the average global temperature rise well below two degrees Celsius and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees. About one degree of that rise has already happened, underlining the urgency to progress further and faster to cut the greenhouse gases that cause global warming. Two years after the world united around the Paris Agreement and a year after its entry into force, the UNFCCC's 197 parties have been reconvened for the 23rd annual climate change talks in Bonn till November 17.

"COP23","India","COP23_India196","US refutes EU offical's claims of softening stance on Paris climate deal","September 18, 2017 Monday","Zee News","New Delhi, Sept. 18 -- After the former President of the United States, Barack Obama, established the country's contribution and staunch support in the Paris climate deal, current POTUS Donald Trump chose the opposing path and pulled out of the pact in June this year. Climate change seems to be a red rag for the current American administration. Calling climate change a hoax created by China, Trump had recently said that, ""the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive"". Moreover, Trump turned the tables on India claiming that the latter signed the Paris climate agreement to get ""billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid"", which earned him criticisms. Trump's reasoning for backing out of the climate deal was that it undermined the country's economy, cost US jobs, and put it at a disadvantage to other nations. At a summit held in Canada, a European official said that a US envoy has signalled that President Donald Trump may be ready to soften his stance on the Paris climate pact. The United States ""stated that they will not renegotiate the Paris Accord, but they will try to review the terms on which they could be engaged under this agreement,"" said the European Union's top climate official Miguel Arias Canete. However, the White House has insisted that the US will withdraw from the Paris climate accord without more favourable terms. ""There has been no change in the United States' position on the Paris agreement,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in an email. ""As the president has made abundantly clear, the United States is withdrawing unless we can re-enter on terms that are more favourable to our country,"" she said. The White House pushed back at a European suggestion it was softening its stance on the Paris climate accord, insisting Washington will withdraw from the agreement unless it can re-enter on more favorable terms. The remark came as environment ministers from some 30 countries gathered in Montreal seeking headway on the Paris climate accord, which President Donald Trump had pulled out of. The EU official said there would be a meeting on the sidelines of next week's UN General Assembly with American representatives ""to assess what is the real US position,"" noting ""it's a message which is quite different to the one we heard from President Trump in the past."" The US observer was not immediately available for comment and the White House insisted the United States would withdraw from the Paris climate accord without more favorable terms. ""There has been no change in the United States' position on the Paris agreement,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in an email. ""As the president has made abundantly clear, the United States is withdrawing unless we can re-enter on terms that are more favorable to our country,"" she said. Called by Canada, China and the European Union, the summit took place 30 years to the day after the signing of the Montreal Protocol on protecting the ozone layer - which Canada's environment minister hailed as a multilateral ""success story"" by governments, NGOs and ordinary citizens jointly tackling a major global threat. We ""committed to full implementation of the Paris Accord. Everyone agreed that the environment and the economy go together, they are linked. You cannot grow the economy without taking care of the environment,"" Catherine McKenna said at the end of the summit, attended by more than half the G20 members as well as some of the nations most vulnerable to climate change - from the low-lying Marshall Islands and Maldives to impoverished Mali and Ethiopia. ""Changes are real, extreme weather events are more frequent, more powerful and more distressful,"" she told the gathering, pointing at the devastation wrought by mega-storms such as Harvey and Irma which many climate scientists believe are boosted by global warming. Nearly 200 countries agreed in Paris in December 2015 to curb carbon dioxide emissions with the aim of limiting the rise in average global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2050, compared to preindustrial levels. Time is ticking, Canete told AFP, as ministers work to narrow their differences and better understand how to implement the ambitious accord - with less than two months to go until the next UN Conference on Climate Change ( COP23 ), in Bonn in November. ""We need a rule book to be able to monitor and verify and compare emissions of all the parties and see how far we are towards the targets,"" Canete said, with a goal of having those rules in place in time for the COP24 meeting in Katowice, Poland in late 2018. Key player China - the world's largest car market - brings to the table a potentially major advance in transportation after announcing its intention to ban gasoline and diesel-fueled cars, following decisions by France and Britain to outlaw their sale from 2040. The European Union - which is targeting a 40 per cent cut to its emissions by 2030 - will also shortly put forward a proposal to member states on slashing carbon emissions in the transportation sector, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said this week. And Canada - as the world's sixth-largest oil producer - insists it is ""committed to its international climate obligations,"" which it hopes to reach by massively investing in ""clean energy"" technologies. China's special representative to the talks, Xie Zhenhua, said Beijing considers the Montreal Protocol to be a ""very effective and efficient"" example of multilateral action on the environment - largely because it rested on a broad consensus.

Participants focused on how to maintain momentum two years after the adoption of the Paris Agreement on climate change in the context of the recent announcement by the United States of its decision to withdraw from the accord. At COP23 , cities and local governments, including American cities and states, intensified their push to achieve the goals set out in Paris. The Conference, which ran from 6 to 18 November, was chaired by Fiji, an island State particularly affected by the impacts of climate change. The Fiji Presidency announced an agreement on a Gender Action Plan, highlighting the role of women in climate action. Apart from negotiations among Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), several new climate action initiatives, commitments and partnerships were announced by States and non-State actors in the areas of energy, water, agriculture, oceans and coastal areas, human settlements, transportation, industry, and forests. Climate finance and climate resilience were also at the center of the discussions at the conference. More than 20 countries, including the Canada, Finland, France, Mexico, and the United Kingdom, launched a new global coal alliance aimed at achieving the rapid phase-out of existing traditional coal power and at placing a moratorium on any new traditional coal power stations without operational carbon capture and storage. Businesses and other non-government partners have in turn made commitments to focus on powering their operations without coal. The 19 Member countries of the Biofuture Platform, including Brazil, China, Egypt, France, India, Morocco, Mozambique, also announced on Thursday formal agreement on the development of targets for biofuels and to construct an action plan to achieve them. Sustainable biofuels can provide solutions to the energy transport nexus. This partnership offers us that chance,said Rachel Kyte, Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General and CEO, Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All). Among other initiatives announced during the Conference, a global initiative was launched Tuesday with the aim of providing insurance to hundreds of millions of vulnerable people by 2020 and to increase the resilience of developing countries against the impacts of climate change. The InsuResilience Global Partnership is a major scaling-up of an initiative started by the G7 in 2015 under the German Presidency. The Conference took place one year after the entry into force of the Paris Agreement. The Agreement, which was adopted by the 196 Parties to the UNFCCC in December 2015, calls on countries to combat climate change by limiting the rise of global temperature below 2 degrees Celsius and strive not to exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius. Today, 180 Parties have ratified the treaty. The Conference, which was attended by some 27.000, took place in a sobering context of alarming scientific reports of climatic changes. A week before the opening of the Conference, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) announced that the levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere surged at record-breaking speed to new highs in 2016. COP23 will be followed by a series of summits and conferences on climate change which are scheduled ahead of the UN Climate Summit in September 2019, including the One Planet summit to be convened by France next month and focusing on financing, a gathering in California, bringing together non-State actors, and the COP24 in Katowice, Poland, in December 2018.

Canada and the summits host, France, announced a Canada-France Climate Partnership to work together to promote the implementation of the Paris Agreement. This partnership will include work to promote carbon pricing, coal phase-out, sustainable development and emission reductions in the marine and aviation sectors. At the Summit, Minister McKenna also welcomed new members to the Powering Past Coal Alliance. First launched at United Nations climate change conference last month by Canada and the U.K., the Powering Past Coal partners are a diverse range of governments, businesses and international organizations committed to phase out traditional coal power. Earlier today, Canada and the World Bank Group announced a new commitment to support effective climate action in developing countries in support of the Paris Agreement. Canada and the World Bank Group will support the acceleration of developing countries transition away from traditional coal-fired electricity, and toward clean energy to power their fast-growing economies. The partnership will also support small island developing states in expanding their renewable energy infrastructure. Minister McKenna reinforced that Canadas G7 presidency, which begins in January 2018, will form part of the international climate agenda next year and will make climate action and clean growth a priority. Canada was also selected as one of five countries for a new partnership with the Breakthrough Energy Coalition. Bill Gates, on behalf of the Breakthrough Energy Coalition, announced a set of partnerships with five Mission Innovation member countries to help make a shift to clean energy, and to help more companies move their products out of the lab and into the marketplace. Canada also signed on to the Declaration on Carbon Markets in the Americas, along with five Canadian provinces, two U.S. states, and Mexico, Costa Rica, Colombia and Chile. The Declaration commits to strengthening Canadas international and regional cooperation on carbon pricing. Harmonized carbon pricing approaches are efficient and help businesses to remain competitive. Finally, Minister McKenna highlighted the leading role Canada played in achieving the early ratification of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol last month. Implementing the Kigali Amendment could avoid up to 0.5 degrees Celsius of warming by the end of the century. The Paris Agreement is driving climate action around the world, and Canada is playing a leading role. From carbon pricing partnerships to phasing out coal, the global momentum for climate action is real and growing. Looking ahead, Canadas G7 presidency next year will help advance action against climate change, helping to accelerate global transition to clean growth.

"COP23","India","COP23_India201","India questions rich nations' sluggish climate actions under previous commitments at Bonn Summit","November 8, 2017 Wednesday","The Economic Times","BONN, Germany: India has questioned rich nations about their ongoing climate actions, asking how would the developed countries ensure trust in the process (and their commitment under Paris Agreement) if they themselves don't follow the previous decisions (under the Kyoto Protocol) to reduce their carbon emissions. The question was raised by India while supporting a group of developing countries' demand to include implementation of pre-2020 commitments of rich nations in the agenda of the current climate conference ( COP23 ). The group - Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDC) - also demanded that the developed countries must increase their ambition to reduce their carbon footprints. Making intervention, which caught everyone's attention, on the very first day of the Conference on Monday, the chief negotiator of India, Ravi Shankar Prasad said if the (rich) nations don't follow the decisions taken in the previous COPs, what confidence do the others (developing countries) have that the decisions taken in this COP would be honoured? ""What kind of trust are we generating in the process itself? ,"" Prasad asked.An installation made out of placards reading slogans at the Rheinaue park during the COP23 UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn. The pre-2020 actions refer towhere only rich nations are obliged to take mitigation (emission cut) actions, while the post-2020 actions say that all countries should take actions under the Paris Agreement. The developed countries had in 2012 agreed to undertake their aggregate emission cuts by at least 18% below the 1990 levels. But these countries have, so far, not even ratified the decision that they had taken five years ago in Doha. In his intervention, Prasad called for early time-bound ratification of the Kyoto Protocol (2013-2020 period) by developed countries to ensure the highest possible mitigation efforts under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) by all countries. Pitching for including pre-2020 actions in this COP's agenda, he said that this agenda was of utmost importance for developing countries. ""While, the discussions on pre-2020 actions have lagged behind"", he said. India noted that the acts of developed countries on their pre-2020 commitments are the ""foundation upon which climate action should be built after the year 2020"". China echoed India's concerns and raised similar question. These questions assume significance for future of the Paris Agreement - specifically when the US decision to withdraw from the deal has already made the post-2020 task look quite difficult at this juncture. ""Discussing pre-2020 is very important. Both the developed and the developing countries must come together and show to the world that they can take ambitious actions even without the US. The European Union (EU) and other developed countries should enhance their emissions cut and financial contributions. Developing countries should also pledge more mitigation action. This way we can bring the spirit of the Paris agreement back on the table"", said Chandra Bhushan, deputy director general of the New Delhi-based think-tank Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).Other experts too believe that meeting the long-term temperature goal of limiting the temperature rise to 2\\xB0C by the end of century requires strong short-term action. They said the enhanced pre-2020 action will reduce the overall costs and economic challenges for making a transition to low carbon growth pathway.Consultations on the LMDC's demand to include the pre-2020 actions on the agenda of the COP23 have already begun. It would, however, be known on Saturday whether the issue would finally be included in the agenda or not. India on Tuesday made yet another intervention and sought clarity on the issue of long-term finance. It asked the developed countries that are expected to contribute to the Green Climate Fund (GCF), to clearly state their share of public finance in the kitty.

But we need to do more, he underlined. In his remarks, the UN chief said that he will be travelling to Bonn to participate in the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ), where, he will urge efforts to accelerate climate action as well as to raise ambition to do more. The window of opportunity to meet the 2-degree target may close in 20 years or less and we may have only five years to bend the emissions curve towards 1.5 degrees, he said, noting the need for a further 25 per cent cut in emissions by 2020. Speaking on the need for bolstering finance, Guterres called for mobilizing the agreed $100 billion annually for developing countries, which is crucial to spur action. He also said that in September 2019, he will convene a Climate Summit to mobilize political and economic energy at the highest levels.

"COP23","India","COP23_India203","India questions unkept climate promises at Bonn","November 8, 2017 Wednesday","Times of India (Electronic Edition)","India has questioned developed nations about their climate initiatives, asking how they would generate trust in the process and their commitment to the Paris Agreement if they didn't adhere to the Kyoto Protocol to reduce carbon emissions. India has supported the demand by a group of developing countries that want the implementation of pre-2020 commitments of rich nations included in the agenda of the ongoing climate conference, COP23 . The group, Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDC), has also demanded that rich countries increase their ambition to reduce their carbon footprint. Making an intervention, which got everyone's attention on the very first day of the conference on Monday , India's chief negotiator Ravi Shankar Prasad asked if (rich) nations didn't follow decisions taken in previous COPs (Conference of the Parties), what confidence the others (developing countries) could have that the decisions taken in this COP would be honoured. \\x93What kind of trust are we generating in the process itself ?\\x93 he said. Pre-2020 actions refer to existing obligations under the Kyoto Protocol that obligates only rich nations to take mitigation actions (emission cuts), while post-2020 actions are meant for all countries under the Paris Agreement. In 2012, developed countries had agreed to cut emissions by at least 18% below 1990 levels from 2013 to 2020.But these countries have, so far, not ratified the decision. Prasad called for early time-bound ratification of the Kyoto Protocol (for the 20132020 period) by developed nations to ensure strongest possible mitigation efforts under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change . \\x93While action on post-2020 period under the Paris Agreement has gained momentum, the discussions on pre-2020 actions have lagged,\\x93 he said. China echoed India's concerns. These questions are significant for the future of the Paris Agreement, especially with the US decision to withdraw has already made its goal of limiting warming to 2\\xB0C above pre-industrial temperatures look difficult. \\x93Discussing pre-2020 is important. The developed and developing countries must come together and show that they can take ambitious actions even without the US,\\x93 said Chandra Bhushan, deputy director general of Centre for Science and Environment. Consultations on the LMDC's demand to include the pre-2020 actions on the agenda of the COP23 have already begun. The result would be known on Saturday. \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India204","Only More Public-Private Cooperation Can Unlock the Huge Climate Finance Challenge, Says EU Bank Vice-President at Climate Finance Day in Paris","December 11, 2017 Monday 6:30 AM EST","Contify Investment News","Dec. 11 -- The Vice-President in charge of Climate Action and Environment at the European Investment Bank (EIB) has urged the global community to step up efforts to crowd in private investors for climate action. Speaking at Climate Finance Day, ahead of the One Planet Summit in Paris, EIB Vice-President Jonathan Taylor said, ""The EIB - as the Bank of the European Union - is a key supporter of the Paris Climate Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals. The EIB is the world's largest multilateral lender for climate action, and as such we have pledged to provide USD 100bn for climate action in the five-year period to 2020. This is expected to mobilise around USD 300bn of climate-friendly investments. Our support for the Paris Agreement entails higher volumes outside the EU - 35% of total financing by 2020 - and an increased focus on impact, adaptation and mainstreaming climate change considerations into everything we do. Key to unlocking the amounts we need to tackle climate change are increased efforts between the private and public sector. An example of our activities to mobilise private money for climate action is the Luxembourg-EIB Climate Finance Platform, which is the first time a Member State funds an entire climate finance platform rather than an individual climate finance operation. An even earlier platform is the GEEREF fund of funds - the Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund. This has blended first loss capital from public sources with private capital from institutional investors to support investment through equity (participations) in small and medium-sized renewable energy projects in developing countries."" He added, ""On the borrowing side, the EIB is proud to be the pioneer of the green bond market and its largest issuer. This year, the EIB celebrates the 10th anniversary of its first Climate Awareness Bond with an issuance of around EUR 20bn. We are at the forefront of making the green bond market more transparent, to attract more bond issuers and investors with the goal of mobilising what is needed to confront the challenges ahead."" Vice-President Taylor participated in a discussion about how to step up public and private cooperation in the field of climate action. At the One Planet Summit on 12 December, the EIB, together with partners in the public and private sector, will be announcing a number of new initiatives and projects for climate action. HYPERLINK http://www.eib.org/infocentre/events/all/eib-at-one-planet-summit http://www.eib.org/infocentre/events/all/eib-at-one-planet-summit More information on the EIB and Climate Finance The first ever green bond was issued by the EIB in 2007; in 2016, the EIB exceeded its climate action target for the seventh year running, providing over EUR 19.5 billion to help mitigate climate change and adapt to its impact. The EIB's Climate Strategy puts new emphasis on mainstreaming climate considerations across all our activities and tools and ensuring climate change considerations inform sector policies, e.g. through shadow carbon pricing, EPS and other mechanisms. The Luxembourg-EIB Climate Finance Platform: This is a model which can be scaled up and replicated with other Member States of the European Union. Here, Luxembourg will make available EUR 30 million (25% of Luxembourg's climate finance until 2020) of subordinated funding over the next three years for investment vehicles, based in Luxembourg, financing high impact climate projects. This funding will allow the EIB to co-invest and bring in third-party investors from the private sector. At COP 23 , the first investment of EUR 5 million in the Green for Growth Fund under the platform was announced. This is expected to mobilise EUR 100m of public and private money which will support energy efficiency and renewable energy development in the Middle East and North Africa region. On 10 November at COP23 , the EIB signed its biggest ever loan in the Pacific: a water project for Fiji's capital Suva to help increase climate change resilience of the water supply system. Earlier this year, the EIB also approved a USD 20 million investment in the Sustainable Ocean Fund. This will provide money for marine and coastal enterprises that are helping with conservation, improved livelihoods and better economic returns. Source: European Investment Bank \"

It was published with the support of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. As cities remain at the forefront of climate change risk and opportunity, over 7,000 cities have announced a collective intention to address climate change and nearly 600 cities, representing 444 million people, have made climate commitments to the Compact of Mayors. But these commitments must be substantiated with on-the-ground solutions that enable cities to make rapid progress toward near-term decarbonisation, and put them on a path to full climate-neutrality. ""Together, cities around the world can have a meaningful and substantial impact on one of the most pressing challenges and opportunities that we will face in our lifetimes and for generations to come,"" Mayor of the City of Vancouver Gregor Robertson said. The Carbon-Free City Handbook is a resource for city leaders around the world to take real and meaningful action toward their commitments with 22 ready-to-implement, no-regrets solutions that have proven a success. ""Cities can get be dragged down into endless planning and measurement. Yes, metrics matter. But, ambitious actions matter more,"" said handbook co-author Jacob Corvidae. ""This handbook helps cities move to action faster. Don't wait for plans to be completed when you can get moving on meaningful actions now."" Increasingly, cities are looking to work together to find the best solutions, and have the opportunity to harness the power of their peers to bring trusted solutions to their own locations. The handbook celebrates the women and men who have driven solutions in hopes that others can learn from them and remove as much guesswork as possible.

"COP23","India","COP23_India206","Italy : Pacific leaders alarmed over climate changes negative impact on food systems and food security","November 13, 2017 Monday","TendersInfo","Climate change poses an alarming threat to food systems and food security in the Pacific islands, warned leaders of nine small island developing states (SIDS), representatives of regional development bodies, New Zealand and Australia at a meeting chaired by FAO Director-General Jos Graziano da Silva today. The meeting took place ahead of the Pacific leaders' participation at the UN Climate Conference COP23 COP23 . In the statement, the Pacific leaders called upon all countries to exceed previous commitments and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 C as above pre-industrial levels, to reduce the adverse impacts on food security and nutrition, coastal habitats and the livelihoods of those depending on oceans. The 1.5 degrees limit will allow for a greater change at maintaining resilient livelihoods and promote partnerships for sustainable development in the Pacific Islands, the statement read. Noncommunicable Diseases surge in the Pacific region The group also raised concerns about the negative impacts of malnutrition evidenced by the growing incidence of Noncommunicable Diseases, which account for 75 percent of adult deaths in the Pacific, and called for more proactive and integrated actions to promote policies to tackle food insecurity challenges, especially on issues related to obesity, stunting, wasting and NCDs. The group acknowledged the importance of the FAO and partners Global Action Programme on Food Security and Nutrition in SIDS, which recommends action at global, regional, national and local level to accelerate food security and nutrition, calling for its endorsement and immediate implementation. With Pacific island states highly dependent on their oceans for their livelihoods and food security, leaders reiterated their anxiety about ecosystem degradation, and called upon the international community to assist in maximizing the sustainable utilization of the fisheries and aquaculture sectors for the benefit of small island developing states. The Pacific Islands are among the most environmentally vulnerable nations in the world. Drought, extreme high tides, violent winds, and storm surges pose major risks to small island nations, and their efforts to achieve sustainable development. For many islands, the impact of climate change represents the gravest of threats to their survival and viability, including, for some, through the loss of territory. FAO committed to supporting Pacific Islands, improving rural and coastal populations lives In his opening remarks, Graziano da Silva shared the Pacific leaders concerns about the negative impact of climate change on food security and nutrition and its role in exacerbating the burden of malnutrition as well as the alarming overweight and obesity levels. You are suffering from things that you didnt cause, from things you are not responsible for the impact of climate change, the FAO Director-General said. This is what FAO offers support so that you can face climate change; scale up growing local products as we see you import more and more food. Obesity is a big problem. It is an epidemic that we need to address. Together with partners such as the WHO (World Health Organization), we promote the uptake of healthy, fresh food fruits, vegetable and fish instead of processed food. We promote local products bread fruit, for which we have a pilot programme in the Marshal Islands, Samoa, Nauru, and which we want to scale up and multiply, he added. With Oceans Day events underway at COP23 today, Graziano da Silva also highlighted the importance of the FAO Port State Measures Agreement (PSMA), todays main tool in the hands of the international community to tackle illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. He urged all Pacific Island states to adhere to the agreement. You are countries with more water and natural resources to preserve than any other countries. This is why the Port State Measures Agreement is important. FAO is committed to support you to implement and monitor your PSMA process. We can provide assistance for your national legislations, training and funding to put the agreement in place. We will not be able to safeguard our ocean environment if we dont combat illegal fishing, said Graziano da Silva. \"

In addition to providing funds for the early shooting of Beyond Beauty: Taiwan from Above II and organizing follow-up welfare promotion activities, the Foundation is also calling on the public to support this environmental care and education-related film so that it can make it to the big screen. Ms. Shan-shan Guo, executive director of the Delta Electronics Foundation, remarked, at the films kickoff shooting press conference, Even before the first Beyond Beauty: Taiwan from Above, our Foundation had already collaborated with director Po-lin Chi several times by promoting environmental education through film sponsorships, physical exhibitions, public broadcasts, tours to rural areas, book publications and related initiatives. Moreover, during Deltas participation in the 21st United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris at the end of 2015, in which we were invited to the German Pavilion to share our corporate experience on energy conservation, the overwhelming images of Beyond Beauty: Taiwan from Above not only portrayed the challenges we face on climate change, but also enchanted international guests with the unique natural beauty of Taiwan. Last year, upon hearing director Po-lin Chi was preparing to shoot Beyond Beauty: Taiwan from Above II, and that its filming scope would extend beyond Taiwan in an effort to expand international awereness, Deltas founder, Mr. Bruce Cheng, agreed to offer assistance without a second thought. In addition to providing funds to support filming, the sponsorship also includes assistance in promotion of the film as well as Deltas latest laser 4K ultra-high resolution energy-efficient projector so aerial shots by director Po-lin Chi can achieve awe-inspiring results. Screened at the end of 2013, Beyond Beauty: Taiwan from Above not only grossed NTD 220 million at the box office in a milestone as one of the most popular documentaries in Taiwan's film history, but also won recognition from the 50th Golden Horse Awards for best documentary, while making an impact on environmental policies at the time. Four years later, Taiwan is still facing environmental challenges from all several dimensions, including air pollution, marine ecology, energy conservation and carbon reduction, the impact of climate change and other factors. The recent decision by the US President Trump to withdraw from the ""Paris Agreement"" entails that more environmental challenges will emerge in the foreseeable future. Delta Electronics Foundation looks forward to inspiring ever more citizens to rethink upon our environmental issues through the scenes of natural beauty and stunning visuals of Beyond Beauty: Taiwan from Above II, in hopes of joining the ranks of the fight against climate change. \"

If together and with many partners we can realise the world's climate goals we can also play our role in providing a major health boost to billions of people,"" she said. WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: ""Climate change is one of the most pressing public health threats of our time. The health of future generations everywhere depends on all of us working together to take concrete action today."" The collaboration takes place at a time when climate change poses a significant threat to public health -- extreme weather events and variable climate affect clean air, safe drinking water, food security and secure shelter -- and could cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year, from heat stress, malnutrition, diarrhoea and malaria, between 2030 and 2050. The agreement will ensure that health is represented in the global climate change agenda, allowing both institutions to adopt a more integrated and inter-sectoral approach for improving global health and contributing to the implementation of the Paris Agreement. The pact will provide a joint framework for strategic collaboration between the WHO and the UNFCCC to support capacity building, particularly in the developing world, and help countries reduce health vulnerability to climate change by providing guidance on health risks from climate change and benefits from mitigation policies.

Needless to say, the phenomenon of climate change is making its magnanimous presence felt in a bigger way, every day, every month. Climate change and global warming are gradually wreaking havoc over the planet and the negative effects can be seen on various levels. Britain's royal family has also voiced their concern over the effects of the phenomenon. At a Commonwealth gathering geared towards finding practical ways to reverse its effects, Prince Charles on Thursday, warned that tiny island nations could be wiped off the map by climate change. Charles, the heir to the throne, said the planet was facing an existential crisis as he urged the Commonwealth to take forward its ideas to COP23 , the next United Nations climate summit in the German city of Bonn in November. While the 52-member Commonwealth contains G20 industrial powers like Britain, Canada and Australia and emerging forces like India and Nigeria, many of its members are developing island microstates. The 2015 COP21 Paris accord targets keeping the rise in temperatures within two degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels and strives for 1.5 C (2.7 F) if possible. Charles said some northern nations seemed worryingly ambivalent about the difference. ""For some countries, particularly, the small island developing states of the Commonwealth, the difference could scarcely be more critical as it may literally mean the survival of their countries or their extinction,"" he told ambassadors and science experts gathered at the organisation's London headquarters. ""We face an existential crisis in every sense of the word."" A two-day Commonwealth conference in October brought together global experts to thrash out innovative schemes that could pull carbon out of the air and put it back into the Earth. Today's gathering brought together the results of that conference and try and forge a common approach to COP23 . ""The task we face is not only to protect nature but also to collaborate with nature,"" said Charles. The Commonwealth is looking at notions including carbon- absorbing concrete and getting more productive agriculture through mimicking the ecosystems of wild, untended land. (With PTI inputs) \"

Germany's minister for environment, nature conservation and nuclear safety Barbara Hendricks said the process to persuade the US administration under President Donald Trump to continue with the policies of the Obama regime had begun at various levels. Speaking to reporters before the inaugural session of the two-day informal ministerial-level dialogue, Hendricks said, We are trying to influence the United States through different people and channels. Foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel has met with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. The German chancellor has spoken repeatedly with President Trump over phone. The United States, which has the highest greenhouse gas emissions per year after China, is expected to make its position clear on the role it would play globally at the two-day G7 summit beginning on Friday in Sicily, Italy. Later, in her inaugural address, Hendricks underlined the need for the international community to stay united on the climate change course decided at the Paris Agreement. It is fundamentally important that the global community remains united now... We need to flesh out the effective framework for nation states and now the ball is again in the court of governments, she said. The inaugural session began with a moment's silence for India's environment minister Anil Madhav Dave, who died on May 18. Reading out Dave's quote, Hendricks said, Our dear colleague wrote, 'If you want to cherish my memory, plant trees and save them. That would give me happiness.' Maybe we can achieve this through our work. The Petersberg Climate Dialogue is an annual informal ministerial consultation co-hosted by the German government and the chair of the annual United Nations Climate Change Conference . The effort was initiated in 2010 by German chancellor Angela Merkel, following the failure to secure a global agreement on climate change at Copenhagen in 2009. Climate change policy experts, however, are finding a silver lining in the new developments. Lutz Weischer, who heads international climate policy at German Watch, is optimistic about international cooperation on climate change at this time. We have a president (US president Donald Trump) who we do not know would stay in the Paris agreement. But that has further disciplined other countries who have come together to fight climate change. Internationally , we have more unity , Weischer said. He added all eyes are on the G7 summit.For G7 the unity is very important. But all of them agree that there has to be some language on climate change. Canada has the presidency next year. It has made it clear that G7 unity is very important for it. Japan has never been very ambitious about an aggressive climate language.It has always been where US is, he said. The two-day ministerial level talks would see the unveiling of another forum by the European Union, Canada and China that would serve as an alternative to the US State Departmentsponsored Major Economies Forum. \"

""The gap in mid and long-term ambition of the evaluated countries is still too high. In terms of GHG emissions, we see better 2030 targets in countries like Norway or India; comparably good targets for renewable energy, we see in for example Norway, Sweden or New Zealand,"" said Niklas Hohne from Germany's NewClimate Institute and co-author of the CCPI. ""No country has a particularly outstanding energy efficiency target. Saudi Arabia and the United States generally have to drastically raise their 2030 ambitions,"" he said. The nations aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 per cent and increase energy efficiency and renewables by at least 27 per cent by 2030. The report was made public on Wednesday on the sidelines of the UN Climate Change negotiations ( COP23 Fifty-six countries and the EU are together responsible for about 90 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. ""We see a strong commitment to the global climate targets of the Paris Agreement in international climate diplomacy. The countries now have to deliver specific measures breaking down their commitments to a sectoral level,"" Jan Burck, co-author of the CCPI at Germanwatch, said. Foreseeing positive developments on opting renewables and energy efficiency, co-author Stephan Singer from the Beirut-based Climate Action Network said: ""The data show encouraging growth in renewable energy, ever cheaper prices for solar and wind energy and successes in saving energy in many countries. This was responsible for stabilising global energy CO2 emissions in the last three years."" ""But progress is achieved much too slow for a fully renewable energy based world economy in a few decades, because growing oil and gas consumption is higher than the welcomed reduction in coal use."" The top three rankings are still unoccupied as the report says no country is on a Paris-compatible path yet that aims to keep the average global temperature rise well below two degrees Celsius and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees Celcius. About one degree of that rise has already happened, underlining the urgency to progress further and faster to cut the greenhouse gases that cause global warming, climate experts say. Sweden ranks fourth in this year's CCPI, following the empty top three. Relatively low emission levels and a very high trend in renewable energy see Lithuania ranked fifth. Germany, the co-host country for Fiji's COP23 Presidency, lands in the midfield of the CCPI 2018 at 22. The country has put a lot of effort into international climate diplomacy and globally committing to climate action. ""Germany's mid and long-term targets are relatively strong but the last government failed on delivering concrete measures to effectively reduce emissions domestically,"" Burck added. After withdrawing from the 2015 Paris Agreement and dismantling major climate legislation of the previous government, the US finds itself in the bottom five of the ranking at 56. The bottom three of the index is formed by Korea (58), Iran (59) and Saudi Arabia (rank 60), all of which are showing hardly any progress or ambition in reducing its emissions and energy use.

The conference was held as a side event at the UNFCCC COP23 in Bonn on 15 November by the International Climate Governance Coalition (ICGC). Apart from the EESC, the coalition's co-pilots are the European Committee of the Regions (CoR), the OECD and Comit 21. Opening the conference, president of the EESC's Sustainable Development Observatory (SDO) Brenda King said: Civil society actors currently face significant obstacles when they wish to initiate and implement measures to counteract climate change. This is mainly due to the fact that the policy-makers are unaware of how much potential civil society action has in terms of protecting the climate. With GHG emissions concentrations in the atmosphere rising and extreme weather events becoming more dramatic and frequent, the implementation of the COP21 commitments is more urgent than ever. Initiatives and measures taken by non-state and subnational actors are vital to accelerating global climate-resilient and low-carbon pathways set out by the Paris Agreement. At COP23 Despite the growing importance of the non-state and subnational climate actors, they are still disconnected from the international climate agenda, said Eamon OHara, executive director of ECOLISE (European network for community-led initiatives on climate change and sustainability). These actors often feel they operate in a policy vacuum and the need for a supportive framework is stronger than ever. Marco Dus, the CoR rapporteur on financing climate action, stressed the urgency of developing innovative financing schemes to facilitate access to funding for regions and cities. Presenting the findings of the Coalition's mapping study, Mr Dus emphasised that political commitment was a key to making public funds available. He also noted: It is absolutely vital to have clear legal frameworks that reduce uncertainty and build trust between partners, adaptive and flexible management approaches and continued work on public awareness and community involvement. Tadashi Matsumoto, OECD coordinator for National Urban Policy, Climate Change and Green Growth, pointed to the importance of framework conditions, which may enable or hinder subnational action, as well as to the urgent need to assess countries governance structures for effective climate investment. In many cases national policies are designed separately and not aligned to support climate actions of cities and regions, he noted. The ICGC was set up in 2016 to facilitate dialogue and multi-stakeholder partnerships in order to work toward removing obstacles encountered by civil society actors in combating climate change, as well as toward designing a comprehensive framework to secure alignment between state and other actors in climate change over the long term. The coalition's current climate-related work focuses on enabling bottom-up action via multi-stakeholder approaches and multi-level governance, with the aim of securing a swift and effective implementation of the Paris Climate Conference (COP21) commitments. Ms King said that the EESC had joined the coalition following the adoption of its opinion ""Building a coalition of civil society and subnational authorities to deliver the commitments of the Paris Agreement"". This opinion, adopted last year, pinpointed difficulties encountered by civil society actors in tackling climate change. Elina Bardram, head of the European Commission's negotiating team at COP23 , said that the EU was advocating full participation of non-state actors in the Talanoa dialogue, promoted by the Fijian COP presidency in the lead-up to COP24. These actors are best placed to tell the stories about solutions that exist on the ground, she said. Bettina Laville, chairwoman of Comit 21, closed the side event by setting out the main focus of the coalition's work for the next year, namely delivering a useful and practical document supporting multi-stakeholder climate projects before the California Summit of non-state actors in September 2018. The EESC will continue working with its coalition partners to propose elements for an enabling framework for bottom-up climate action and will advocate the need for this to decision-makers at all levels. \"

"COP23","India","COP23_India216","Kenya : Associations representing more than 80,000 planners globally join forces on climate action","November 13, 2017 Monday","TendersInfo","A new initiative launched today by UN-Habitat and its partners brings together associations of urban and regional planners from around the world to contribute to the debate and decisions on climate action. While urban areas account for around two-thirds of the worlds greenhouse gas emissions from global energy use, one of the key communities shaping the way cities grow planners have to date been predominantly omitted. COP23 , being held in Bonn, Germany by Joan Clos, UN Under-Secretary-General and UN-Habitat Executive Director and Said Mouline, Director General of AMEE, the Moroccan Agency for Energy Efficiency. Planning is in a bad way, said Dr Clos during the launch. Urban planning has dramatically decreased from around 80 per cent of urban land being planned before 1900 to less than 50 per cent in 2015. He went on to emphasize the importance of planning as one of the key tools to make climate positive cities. A recognised role for cities Cities contribution to total greenhouse gas emissions is estimated at between 37 per cent and 49 per cent globally a significant portion of total emissions. Despite the significant challenges that they present, it is increasingly evident that well-planned cities can reduce congestion, pollution and provide energy efficiency, leading to reduced emissions. The Paris Agreement, the Sustainable Development Goals and the New Urban Agenda all acknowledge the role that cities have to play in combating climate change. Under the Marrakesh Partnership for Global Climate Action, Human Settlements Day at COP23 aims to promote the invaluable role of non-state actors in global action towards curbing and mitigating climate change while also emphasizing the nexus between these two key issues. Urban and regional planners have a key role to play in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and building climate resilience. Despite this, up to now, planners have not had a comfortable place within existing multi-stakeholder climate initiatives. Planners for Climate Action aims to combat this by bringing global, regional and national associations of planning professionals and planning educators together to ensure their expertise is incorporated into discussions and action. Among other activities, Planners for Climate Action will: Advocate for strengthened and accelerated urban/regional planning Help to monitor implementation of relevant targets Map and share knowledge Jointly develop normative guidance and knowledge products Provide substantive input to ongoing relevant initiatives \"

""By participating in this summit, ACCIONA encourages other companies to adopt its carbon-neutral approach,"" said Joaqun Mollinedo, General Manager of Institutional Relations, Sustainability and Brand at ACCIONA. ""In the working groups and high-level meetings in which the company is participating, we are also promoting a CO2 pricing system that serves as an incentive to decarbonise the economy."" ACCIONA presented its approach to reducing and offsetting emissions, which has enabled it to achieve carbon neutrality since 2016. The company also detailed how the effort to minimise emissions and offset those inherent in its activity has served as a lever to improve its business and drive innovation. ACCIONA also insisted on the importance of the Bonn Summit making progress towards standard, transparent procedures for measuring and assessing the degree of compliance with the commitments acquired under the Paris Agreement, which was adopted at COP21 in Paris in 2015. ACCIONA also reiterated its support for creating market mechanisms that facilitate the decarbonisation of the economy, especially carbon pricing, in line with decisions already made by the European institutions. COP23 , the Prince of Wales's Corporate Leaders Group, of which ACCIONA has been a member since 2009, released a report entitled ""Electric avenue: The future of road transport in Europe"", in which the company describes some best practices in the area of sustainable highways. ACCESS TO BASIC SERVICES The ACCIONA Microenergy Foundation, which channels ACCIONA's community outreach work to promote access to basic services, was also on site at COP23 . In the international encounter entitled ""PPP's for development and achievement of the Paris Agreement goals""the Foundation presented the ""Electricity at Home Oaxaca"" project as a success story, since it has provided electricity to 7,500 households in isolated rural areas of Oaxaca (Mexico) using photovoltaic solar panels. The programme is an example of public-private partnership for development since it involves the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID) and the Mexican Agency for International Development Cooperation (AMEXCID). SUSTAINABILITY AS A BUSINESS MODEL ACCIONA's commitment to combating global warming was made patent by the fact that, at COP21, it announced a commitment to become carbon neutral in 2016; it fulfilled that commitment and 72% of the company's EBITDA and 42% of its global revenues in 2016 came from activities classified as Green Economy by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Last year, ACCIONA's renewable energy production avoided the emission of 14.8 million tons of CO2 to the atmosphere. It also applies the sustainability approach to managing water, having reduced its own water consumption by 7% and achieved a positive water footprint of 510 hm3. \"

"COP23","India","COP23_India220","Qatar : Q & A With Mr Hareb Al-jabri","April 16, 2018 Monday","TendersInfo","QU revealed the biofuel project on the eve of the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP-18, which took place in Doha in 2012. The project, only one of its kind in the region, aims to find a way of producing affordable, sustainable biofuels which do not rely on the use of valuable arable land and which can be produced efficiently in the punishing climate of Qatar. These fuels should provide an additive source of energy, specifically for use by the airline industry. If successfully produced on a commercial scale, the discovery will have international ramifications -- significantly reducing one of the airline industrys biggest fixed costs and providing a sustainable, environmentally-friendly fuel where carbon dioxide is recycled rather than accumulating in the atmosphere. During an interview, Mr Hareb Al-Jabri, Director of CAS Sustainable Development Center (SDC) and Qatar Biofuel Project Manager, talked about the projects updates and importance. What is new in the biofuel project? During the first phase of the project, the research team produced three types of biofuel -- biodiesel, bioethanol and bio-crude oil. At the beginning of the second phase of the project, the team studied the economic feasibility of each type in order to specify which one of them aligns with the projects aim. The team started with conducting the techno economic analysis for the production of each type of biofuel in line with the resources available and the exist infrastructure of oil and gas sector. At the end of the analytical study, we converted the overall biomass into bio-crude oil and then separated its components using the available refinery systems. We are currently developing the techniques of the production process while considering the volume and the quality of the product. Tell us about the importance of Qatar Biofuel Project This project adds value to the oil and gas sector in Qatar. It aims to support the vision of Qatar Airways, which is to use environmentally-friendly fuel in the airline industry in order to reduce the negative environmental effects of the conventional fuel. The project will also contribute to carbon dioxide sequestration by recycling it to produce biofuels. Additionally, the project aims to invest in Qatars natural resources to create products that will contribute to economic diversification, in line with the goals of Qatar National Vision 2030 and the national aspirations towards a knowledge-based economy. What is the role of CAS students in such research projects? The SDC welcomes students from various colleges across QU and assists and supports them in the implementation of their graduation projects at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The students have the opportunity to contribute to the centers research projects. Such opportunities help them enhance their knowledge and gain an in-depth experience in the field of research. What is your opinion with regard to the national efforts towards the diversification of energy resources? The State of Qatar has made huge efforts in the diversification of renewable energy resources. These efforts are highlighted in the Qatar National Strategy which started in 2011. The strategy focuses on the importance of supporting research projects related to the development of technologies for renewable energy, as well as to drive collaboration efforts with various local and regional institutions to produce renewable energy.

"COP23","India","COP23_India221","COP 23: US continues to be obstructionist, reportedly using allies to push its agenda","November 10, 2017 Friday","Down To Earth","India, Nov. 10 -- Even though the US-historically the largest emitter in the world-has announced its decision to pull out of the Paris Agreement, it still continues to have a strong influence in the ongoing negotiations on implement the climate pact. Like in the past, it continues to be an obstructionist, especially in following the mandate and principles of the Paris Agreement. For the US, differentiation is not an option In the current negotiations on enhanced transparency framework, global stocktake for collective assessment of climate actions and accounting for nationally determined contributions (NDCs), the US has made strong interventions, clarifying its position that differentiation is not an option. Even though the Paris Agreement mentions conducting global stock take 'in light of equity', as understood to be equity between countries having elements of responsibility and differentiation, the US does not support any discussions held along these lines. Similarly, transparency framework talks of 'flexibility', which has been interpreted widely as linking to differentiation. In the Kyoto era, US called for stringent standards and guidelines, including international review of climate action and support for transparency-a position that was subjected to heavy criticism by India and China. The US position in the enhanced transparency framework under the Paris Agreement, as per the current negotiations, has leanings to its previous positions. In the same manner, US wants common rules, modalities, standards for accounting as same for all countries with no element of differentiation. Earlier, the US and the European Union jointly opposed the inclusion of pre-2020 climate actions in the Agenda, a move strongly pushed by India and Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDC) group. The pre-2020 climate action is for scaling up ambition and supporting commitments till 2020, after which Paris Agreement becomes operative. Developed countries have so far shown reluctance on pre-2020 climate actions and the focus is primarily on the Paris Agreement and its implementation. On market mechanism and global stocktake On the issue of market mechanisms, a top negotiator, on condition of anonymity, confirmed that ""the US was being constructively passive"". The source also confirmed a strong possibility of the US aligning with the allies (Japan, Canada and Australia) to push its agenda without having to do much work in the negotiation. The Japan-United States Strategic Energy Partnership (JUSEP) for promoting coal and nuclear technologies in the Southeast Asian region is another clear indication that US would continue to have its way. In the stocktake meeting on all items under discussion under Ad Hoc Working Group on the Paris Agreement (APA) held on November 9, the Umbrella Group, comprising the US and other non-EU developed countries and Environment Integrity Group, expressed its disappointment with the progress on transparency and mitigation issues and urged parties to move forward. In the same meeting, developing countries also pointed to the slow progress on finance issues and stressed on differentiation in the rulebook of Paris Agreement. Other countries failing to contain the US Ideally, the US, having announced its intention to pull out of the Paris deal and adopting slew of domestic measures to further its anti-climate agenda, should be just an observer in the ongoing negotiations and not be allowed to determine the course of negotiations. However, that does not appear to happen as the Paris Agreement allows the US to participate actively in the negotiations until the pullout takes effect in late 2020. Thus, the announcement of pullout does not have any legal bearing on US' role, till its actual withdrawal. There are also no legal ways to contain the US, in accordance with the Agreement. However, there could be political options. It was expected that the countries would pose a united front against the US and isolate it, or at least not allow the rogue player to block discussions on critical issues. On the contrary, the political posturing towards the US has been positive and accommodating, with no country having made any statement against it. Further, countries have, till now, failed to stop the US from carrying on with its obstructionist climate agenda. The developing countries need to jointly respond to this.

The summit will be co-hosted by President Ram Nath Kovind and his French counterpart President Emmanuel Macron.Here is all you need to know about the International Solar Alliance (ISA). The initiative was launched by PM Modi at the India Africa Summit in New Delhi and the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, held in the months of October 2015 and November 2015, respectively. A year later, the ISA Framework Agreement was opened for signature during the CoP-22 at Marrakesh, Morocco, on November 15, 2016. As of date, there are 121 prospective member countries and territories of ISA, out of which close to 90 countries have signed the ISA Framework Agreement. The aim of the summit is to deliberate on a finance mechanism for the promotion of solar energy in member countries, crowd-funding and technology transfer.  The summit is of particular significance to India as it strives to achieve the ambitious target of generating 175 GW of renewable energy, including 100 GW of solar energy, by 2022. The summit, which will be held in the Rashtrapati Bhavan Convention Centre, is close to the scale of the India-Africa summit held in New Delhi a few years ago. The ministry of external affairs (MEA) has summoned some of its brightest officials from distant countries to handle the protocol and diplomatic details. Several global bankers have confirmed their participation at the event including Werner Hoyer, President & Chairman, European Investment Bank, K V Kamath, President, BRICS Development Bank, Nandita Parshad, Managing Director, Energy & Natural Resources, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and Banbang Susantono, Vice President, ASIAN Development Bank. Other than France, countries like Australia, UAE, Niger, Gabon, Seychelles, Ghana, Rwanda, Fiji, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka will be a part of the summit, as well. India will work towards finalizing mechanisms to merge Indian technology and finance capabilities with specific projects around the world. Among the countries that have requested India for projects are Tanzania, Togo, Benin, Congo, Chad and Seychelles. The summit will kick off 24 projects in about 14 countries. At the moment, India is looking at four types of solar-powered projects - off-grid power supply hubs, street lighting, irrigation, green buildings, in addition to everyday products like solar cookers etc. Since a bulk of the countries who are part of the ISA are from Africa, India has decided to use about $2 billion of the $10 billion line of credit promised to Africa for renewable energy projects in these countries. For India, it will be the first time an international treaty body will have its secretariat in this country. The Modi government, according to sources, is pushing for several outcomes from the summit and wants to ensure that ISA becomes a platform for deepening diplomatic engagement with a range of countries on crucial development issues. In addition, the forum is expected to spur innovation in the renewable energy space, and help make India a technological hub in the sector and not just remain a re-exporter of Chinese photovoltaic cells.

As we look at the future of nuclear power and the issue of climate change, it is worth taking a moment to lay out a roadmap showing how nuclear energy innovations can support our Member States with their national climate action plans, said Mikhail Chudakov, IAEA Deputy Director General and Head of the Department of Nuclear Energy, in his video message to the event. At the two-week-long 23rd Conference of Parties ( COP23 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the IAEA is leading three side events on energy policy, sustainable development, nuclear power and climate change. Existing nuclear power plants account for a third of the low carbon energy produced globally, Chudakov said. To meet the targets set out in the Paris Agreement, we need to substantially increase nuclear power capacity by 2050 and beyond. Under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, all Parties submit their planned actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Starting from 2020, governments will submit updates to their NDCs every five years to the UNFCCC with increasingly ambitious climate actions to achieve the Paris Agreement goals. At the side event on Connecting Roadmaps for Innovation in Nuclear Energy to the NDC Timeline, senior representatives from the industry discussed how advanced nuclear energy technologies can help achieve a low carbon future. Panellists outlined options to incorporate innovative nuclear power technologies into climate action plans and NDC timelines. An outline of innovations in nuclear energy technologies currently under development and their linkage to NDC updates. (Infographic: IAEA) Enhanced Accident Tolerant Fuels are revolutionary concepts of the next generation to be deployed within the next decade, said Elmar Schweitzer, AREVAs senior expert on Materials and Thermal-Mechanics. There are a number of other advanced nuclear power technologies such as accident High Temperature Reactors, Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), non-electric nuclear applications and innovative nuclear systems with great potential for enhanced competiveness and sustainability. With this knowledge, Member States may choose to include new nuclear technologies in the updates of their NDCs, participants at the session heard. Through various activities, the IAEA helps Member States use nuclear technologies to mitigate climate change and achieve other Sustainable Development Goals. These include supporting energy planning and infrastructure development with training and guidance, providing information on innovative nuclear power technologies such as advanced reactor designs and innovative fuels, as well as new applications.

They are Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France, India, Indonesia, Italy, Morocco, Mozambique, the Netherlands, Paraguay, the Philippines, Sweden, Britain and Uruguay. The decision is set out in a declaration released by the Biofuture Platform members, ""Scaling Up the Low Carbon Bioeconomy"". It is a major step for sustainable biofuels and the broader bio-economy, which will now become a key component of the global solution to climate change. ""The declaration is the culmination of nine months of negotiations and is the first time countries and other stakeholders have formally agreed to develop targets for biofuels and the bio-economy and construct an action plan to achieve them,"" an official statement said. ""What we have just accomplished here with the endorsement of this statement is quite remarkable,"" the statement quoting Brazil's Minister of the Environment Jose Sarney Filho as saying. ""The technology and the awareness of the need for bio-based solutions are finally coming together."" The decisions announced have been informed by modelling from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) -- both partners in the Biofuture Platform -- concluding that the 2030 temperature goals adopted in the 2015 Paris Agreement cannot be reached without a major increase in the production and use of sustainable biofuels and bioproducts. The IEA and IRENA believe in order to limit the increase in global average temperature to well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to reach 1.5 degrees, bioenergy and biofuels' share in the global energy matrix must be accelerated to achieve at least a doubling in the next 10 years. In specific sectors, such as transport, the need is even greater. ""Biofuels in transport would need to grow three fold by 2030, most of it coming from advanced technologies using non-edible feedstocks, including waste and residues,"" IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said. In addition to developing specific targets, participating countries will ""devise an action plan outlining detailed actions to support achieving the targets, and develop a reporting mechanism to track progress"".

Today, I am inviting all companies, particularly those that emit the most, to commit to set science-based targets. Over the course of 2018, I will be working to expand the adoption of science-based targets not only across the Mahindra Group, but amongst my business colleagues so that by the Global Climate Action Summit in September, 500 companies step up and commit to set science-based targets, said Anand Mahindra, Chairman, Mahindra Group. More than 330 of the worlds biggest companies have already committed to align their strategies with the ambition of the Paris Agreement through the Science Based Targets initiative. Almost 900 more companies have declared their ambition to set science-based targets within the next two years in their disclosures to the CDP, signaling the emergence of a new normal in the way businesses are developing their strategies for the future. Mahindra Sanyo Special Steel Pvt. Ltd. set a science-based Greenhouse Gas emission reduction target of 35% under SCOPE 1, 2 and 3 per ton of steel produced by the year 2030, against 2016 baseline year. A key purpose of the 2018 Global Climate Action Summit which will be held from September 12-14 in San Francisco, is to showcase climate action around the world, along with bold new commitments, to give worldwide leaders the confidence they need to go even further when they meet at the United Nations COP24 in November. Summit participants, including sub national governments, investors, businesses and others from around the world, will report on their climate action and commit to ambitious new actions that can help prevent the climate from warming more than 2 degrees Celsiusthe point at which scientists warn of potentially catastrophic global consequences. Setting science-based targets is a great way for businesses to future-proof growth and boost their competitive advantage in the transition to a low-carbon economy. It also sends a powerful signal to global governments that business is aligning strategy with the Paris Agreement, opening the way for us all to move further, faster on the ambition of the Agreement. We welcome the challenge to business to step up in advance of the Global Climate Action Summit by committing to the Science Based Targets initiative, and we hope that many businesses will quickly follow Mahindra's lead, said Paul Simpson, CEO of CDP, one of the partners of the Science Based Targets initiative. Todays announcement is the first of what will be multiple Summit Challenges that will concretely help deliver greenhouse gas reductions to help ensure worldwide emissions start trending downward no later than 2020a goal that must be met to prevent dangerous temperature rise. It will also help the Summit deliver on its goal to help continue a worldwide energy transition that generates quality employment and inclusive economic growth. \"

Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum further said, ""We actually spend $1billion a year buying fossil fuel from overseas."" The AG added, ""That fossil fuel, of course, is not only used for cars and buses but it is also used to generate electricity. ""The Fijian Government has an objective that by 2030, that 99 per cent of our electricity needs will be provided by renewable energy. ""So GIMCO's relationship with Tropik Wood has actually been a very fruitful relationship. We look forward to this develop further."" According to him, Korean firms GIMCO, GS Power and Mirae Asset have invested in Fiji and this move reflects their buoyancy on the Fijian economy. He added, ""What is also very important for everyone to understand is that they have spent close to $100million in investing in this plant. ""Companies do not come to new countries; in particular invest in a new project such as a biomass plant, unless they have confidence in the government. ""Unless they believe that the policies of that government, unless they believe that the laws of that Government and that country gives them that level security and that level of confidence to know that they will get a return on that investment. Sayed-Khaiyum has revealed that this biomass plant in Nadroga has been fully supported by the overseas investors. He continued, ""It has come from overseas. ""That means that it improves the balance of our foreign reserves. We are getting foreign money that is coming into Fiji to invest in Fiji."" The official has also noted that the renewable energy source has also supported the Fijian Government's initiatives at Bonn in Germany, where Premier will represent Fiji as the COP23 President. The Climate Change Minister revealed, ""We have been very much honoured as a small island state in the middle of the Pacific Ocean to be given the presidency of COP23 . ""Fiji has the capacity to be able to tell the world what our challenges are and how we can translate that into commercial and economic benefit for all Fijians."" He has also disclosed that he has made requests to the company, landlords and the stakeholders of the project worth quite a few million dollars to ascertain the permanence of the business. ""I urge the landowners, the various stakeholders of this investment is a good project and it is on you to work together to give continuity to it. ""We must ensure that this project is able to go on for the next 10, 20 and 30 years. ""The investors get their returns, we benefit and the landowners continue to get their lease money."" \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India228","Climate bites off Bengal toe","December 24, 2017 Sunday","The Telegraph (India)","The Sunderbans: Climate change has found a beachhead in Bengal, literally cutting the ground from under the feet of the state. Large chunks of Mousuni, a strip of an island in the Indian Sunderbans and located on the southernmost tip of Bengal, have been falling off, devoured by a sea made ravenous by the invading forces of climate change. At least three Sunderbans islands - Lohachara, Suparibhanga (Bedford) and New Moore - have disappeared in the past five decades. Sagar, the biggest island in the Sunderbans that hosts the Gangasagar Mela, has lost three of its mouzas. The Sunderbans, a group of more than 100 islands on the southern fringe of Bengal and Bangladesh, are in need of urgent international attention, warn global analysts. The Indian Sunderbans have lost slightly more than 250sqkm of land - an area larger than Calcutta - between 1970 and 2015, says a recent report by the School of Oceanographic Studies in Jadavpur University. About 36 per cent of this erosion took place in the past 15 years. ""Many other Sunderbans islands are vulnerable,"" said Sugata Hazra, who teaches oceanography at Jadavpur University. In the Indian Sunderbans, the rate of sea-level rise is about 8-10mm a year, nearly three times the global average, Hazra added. About 1.5 million people in the Indian Sunderbans face a severe threat from climate change, which is doubly unfair as the area's carbon contribution is negligible. If the Sunderbans do not survive, neither perhaps will a large part of south Bengal, including Calcutta. The Sunderbans act as a buffer protecting this hinterland. ""The Sunderbans are definitely a fit case for demanding compensation at international platforms, citing loss and damage suffered by a people because of climate change,"" said Singh. Compensation for ""loss and damage"" is a key strategy that was drawn up at the CoP, the United Nations climate change conference held in Warsaw in 2013, under pressure from developing and poor countries. Unlike the previous ""mitigation"" or ""adaptation"" strategies - aimed at arresting future damage from climate change - this mechanism aims to compensate people for damage already suffered. ""I will definitely raise the issue at the next taskforce meeting of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage next March,"" Singh said. This global body was created after the 2015 Paris agreement to address climate damage. Singh was recently in the Sunderbans as part of a delegation for the trans-boundary Sunderbans project, undertaken by non-profit organisations EnGIO, Third Pole and ORF India with World Bank support. The delegation visited Mousuni, on the southernmost tip of Bengal, where the damage inflicted by climate change is extreme. Local panchayat figures show that about 2,200 families have been displaced or affected severely by the rising sea in Mousuni. ""A recent stakeholder assessment study clearly says that the millions invested in development in the Sunderbans will be nullified unless climate change is countered as a priority, which needs a lot of fund support,"" said Nilanjan Ghosh, an ecological economist attached to ORF. Bengal's Sunderbans affairs minister, Manturam Pakhira, said: ""Climate change has become a major issue in the Sunderbans, threatening all development processes. We have already engaged specialists to develop a strategy and expect to finalise the climate action road map in the Sunderbans soon, including ways to get financial help."" He added: ""We are already in discussion with Nabard, which funds climate action, and international funding agencies. British government officials too visited the Sunderbans recently."" \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India229","Belgium : The fight against climate change cannot be won at the expense of ordinary citizens","November 11, 2017 Saturday","TendersInfo","""The fight against climate change can only succeed if all citizens are included. But it is not enough to convince people that we need to change our lifestyles: it is also important to give them the necessary support,"" said President Georges Dassis at the start of a side event on ""Just transition to low-carbon economy"" organised jointly by the EESC, King's College London, Foundation for European Progressive Studies and Fondation Jean-Jaurs during the COP23 in Bonn on 8 November. ""The transition towards a zero-emission society must be designed in a way that does not aggravate inequalities or create social fractures, but instead helps to balance differences. In calling for a fair transition, the EESC has always refused to play employment off against environmental protection. These two objectives are closely linked and should be pursued with equal determination."" The European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) used this event to present its opinion on Climate Justice. The concept of ""climate justice"" frames global climate change as a political and ethical issue and not just an environmental one. It recognises that the poorest and most vulnerable in society often have to suffer the greatest impact from climate change. Climate justice has been traditionally dealt with as an issue of emerging economies. The EESC wants to apply these principles also to the EU Member States. Therefore the EESC calls for a debate on an EU Bill of Climate Rights that encapsulates the rights of EU citizens and those of nature in the context of the challenges of the global climate change crisis. ""We call on institutions and governments to ensure climate justice at all levels global, EU, national, regional and community level, in this way we can make climate policy more human centered,"" said Cillian Lohan, rapporteur of the opinion. Stop unfairly penalising those who have no alternative EESC calls for a genuine polluter-pays principle In order to mitigate the impact of climate change, it is necessary to change production and consumption systems. Consumers need to be provided with sustainable ethical alternatives which do not mean less convenience, poorer quality or even higher prices. ""The polluter-pays principle must be applied to those causing pollution and profiting from it,"" said Mr Lohan. The EESC therefore encourages subsidies on fossil fuels to be eliminated. The Rapporteur on Climate Justice of the French Economic, Social and Environmental Council (ESEC), Agns Michelot also took part in the COP23 side event. The ESEC opinion adopted in 2016 and the EESC opinion have a high degree of complementarity and convergence and are mapping out concrete solutions at national and European level. The EESC believes that all citizens have a right to a healthy, clean environment, and not only in Europe. In this context, President Dassis reminded participants of increased migration and how badly prepared Europe is to deal with it and share the burden equally. ""Solidarity must be at the heart of the implementation of the Paris Agreement. This is a common and inclusive initiative which needs cooperation at all levels of civil societies and between Member States and EU institutions,"" he concluded. \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India230","Bonn Climate Conference: Demonstrators walk out of US organised pro-coal event","November 14, 2017 Tuesday 6:30 AM EST","IBNS","Bonn, Nov 14 (IBNS): At COP23 , the 23rd session of the Conference of Parties in Bonn, Germany, while hundreds of events and presentations were dedicated to the role of renewable energy in tackling climate change, the US government, held its first press briefing and panel on ""The Role of Cleaner and More Efficient Fossil Fuels and Nuclear Power in Climate Mitigation"" - leading to a demonstration by protestors who interrupted the event and staged a walk out. As the second highest emitter in the world after China and the highest historically, US will, ironically, be the only country in the world to be out of the agreement as Nicaragua and Syria express their intent to join the treaty. Following the walkout, protestors continued the demonstrations outside the hall. Panelists, meanwhile, presented to a near empty hall. The speakers at the event argued that coal would be used for some time to come and the way to go was to explore clean coal, which includes a system of technologies to clean up the emissions from coal, including Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), and the potential of small nuclear plants. The arguments were supported with reports published by energy think tanks, including the International Energy Agency (IEA). Released at an opportune time, the Global Carbon Budget Report stated that the worlds carbon emissions will go up by 2% by end of 2017. This will be the first increase in global emissions since 2014, and is mainly attributed to increased coal use in China; the rise has been recorded at a time when the world needs to drive down its emissions rapidly. In another important development, agriculture, an often-neglected subject in climate conferences, found a place on the map of climate negotiations and action, after years of failure to arrive at a consensus. The member states, on Monday, finally reached a decision on how to deal with agriculture at COP23 in Bonn, Germany. The final decision, which was read out to the group of negotiators and observers, was met with congratulations and jubilation; and parties have been invited to submit adaptation assessment methods for improvement of soil health, soil carbon and soil quality. Even as negotiators consider the decision a small step towards a larger goal, developing countries, including India, that have been reeling from agricultural losses due to unpredictable extreme weather and successive droughts have a reason to rejoice. However, considering Indias sincere efforts to address climate change, the country, unfortunately, failed to articulate its successes with regard to the 2020 commitments at the conference, losing a significant opportunity to rightfully demand enhanced action and efforts from other developed countries. As latest reports state, India is likely to over-achieve its target for 2020 and is among the small group of countries on track to achieve their self-declared climate targets under the 2015 Paris Agreement, it was noted that stressing on such successes would have positioned India as a sincere player and the country needed a stronger narrative to push its climate goals. Unlike EU and China though, India showed reluctance in taking up the leadership role after USs announcement of its decision to pull out of the Paris climate pact. \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India231","COP 23 at Bonn: Countries show no concern over US withdrawal from Paris Agreement","November 6, 2017 Monday","Down To Earth","India, Nov. 6 -- The climate negotiations kicked off in Bonn today (November 6, 2017) to prepare the rule book for implementing the provisions of the Paris Agreement. The Bonn Climate Change Conference is the first UN climate conference after the US-the world's largest emitter in history-announced withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on June 1, 2017. Ahead of the talks, speculations about the US role in the negotiations were rife. The US itself had given mixed indications about its role at Bonn, from playing a ""constructive role"" to working towards ""securing its economic interests"". It was expected that countries would come prepared to Bonn with a strategy to deal with the US. Consensus among the developing countries in this regard could have sent a positive message. However, talks with sources from different negotiating groups, including Association of Small and Island States (AOSIS), Least Developed Countries (LDC), Rainforest Coalition and Umbrella Group reveal a worrying aspect: countries do not want to focus on the US withdrawal. In fact, word around the CoP is that US withdrawal will not impact the agreement much. An AOSIS negotiator was of the opinion that ""US withdrawal had helped the climate change issue to garner political attention and increased awareness in general."" A business-as-usual approach seems to be driving negotiations at this CoP, which has watered down the strategy adopted in the G-20 Summit when major economies came out strongly against the US and reiterated their commitment to climate action. This CoP provided an opportunity for the countries to build on the momentum and adopt a similar approach, which is sadly missing. Sources in the Secretariat have even shown hope about the US coming back on board as the withdrawal has not come into effect yet and the US would still be part of negotiations. As per the lock-in clause of the Paris Agreement, the withdrawal process will take three years until late 2020. Members representing the Least Developed Countries (LDC), Rainforest Coalition and African Group have also signalled a business-as-usual approach. An African negotiator, who wished not be named, explained that the ""negotiating groups primarily work on specific agenda issues and not on the geo-politics surrounding the negotiations."" This argument does not hold water because substantive discussion on issues cannot happen in isolation as they are influenced by the geopolitical settings. The negotiator failed to throw light on how to separate agenda items from geopolitical settings. The Umbrella Group, comprising rich developed countries members, also has not shown any signs of aligning together to deal with US. As it stands, the members of the UNFCCC have not worked on any negotiating strategy and seem ill-equipped or simply unwilling to deal with the withdrawal of the US, reeking of an attitude that is mired in denial of the overwhelming possibility. Without any forthcoming regulatory support from one of the largest emitters in the world, this lackadaisical attitude makes it ever more likely that the US would continue to hold the rest of the world hostage to its inaction. Agenda items at Bonn The Bonn CoP is being seen more as a technical CoP with no major breakthroughs expected, although members such as the EU have called for ""solid progress"" towards preparation of the rule book. Considering that most of the provisions of the Paris Agreement are yet to see any significant progress, one can only wait and see how negotiations unfold in the next two weeks. Among the major agenda items under discussion are the Facilitative Dialogue (scheduled to be held in 2018) for assessment of climate actions, enhanced transparency framework for monitoring of climate actions and support. Members have also expressed the need to update their commitments following the facilitative dialogue in 2018 and the long-awaited IPCC 1.5 Degree Report due to be released in the same year. The need for equity was highlighted by many countries at the plenary session. India's intervention during the plenary session, urging discussions on scaling up pre-2020 climate actions and ratification of the Doha Agreement to the second commitment period, is not expected to gain much traction. The focus of the negotiations is now largely on post-2020 climate actions when Paris Agreement becomes operative. Somewhat ironically, unity among developing members is still lacking when it comes to dealing with commitments made towards pre-2020 climate actions. Although India's focus on pre-2020 actions is welcoming, over the past some time, its involvement in adaptation, loss and damage and agriculture is largely missing.

"COP23","India","COP23_India232","Extent of US Role a Concern at Climate Meet","May 24, 2017 Wednesday","Economic Times (E-Paper Edition)","The annual Petersberg Climate Dialogue concluded in Berlin with a stronger and clear commitment to the Paris Agreement and a call for cooperation in fighting climate change, despite anxiety over the extent of the US' continued participation. The key topic at this year's meeting was the preparation for Climate Conference COP23 in Bonn in November. Germany and Fiji, the two countries leading the global climate negotiations this year, called on the world to continue fighting climate change. 'There is a need for a global alliance of states and various sectors in the path towards meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change,'' German Chancellor Angela Merkel said during the highlevel segment of the Petersberg Climate Dialogue. Earlier, Canadian minister of environment and climate change Catherine McKenna determined view 'no one country can stop our momentum' set the tone of the day's dialogue. But a pall of uncerta inty hung over the two-day dialogue process. The German chancellor said that the global community already made a decisive step with the Paris Agreement, but even with that, the world needs to take necessary steps and measures to implement them. We all feel the impacts of climate change... We are responsible for each other, we are liable for each other, we share a common destiny,'' she said. Fiji Prime Minister Josaia Voreque Bainimarama, who is also the incoming president of the COP23 , said that the elephant in the room \\xAD which is the uncertainty over the United States' participation \\xAD presented a challenge to climate negotiations. However, Bainimarama said, even without the US, there is considerable power among the dialogue's participants, as well as other countries, for a decisive political action on climate. Her speech also echoed the theme of this year's Petersberg Climate Dialogue -Working Together on Solutions. She cited measures made by various countries \\xAD from mobility to energy solutions \\xAD that could be replicated in other parts of the world. Merkel has had several telephonic conversations since March with Trump, when he threatened to walk away from the Paris climate change accord, to overturn that.Merkel was quite clear that convincing political leadership was key to reducing planet-warming. The highlight of the second day of the talks was release of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report 'Investing in Climate, Investing in Growth'. The report estimates that $6.3 trillion of investment in infrastructure is required annually on average between 2016 and 2030 to meet development needs globally. An additional $0.6 trillion a year over the same period will make these investments climate compatible, a relatively small increase considering the short and long-term gains in terms of growth, productivity and well-being. The additional investment cost is likely to be offset over time by fuel savings resulting from low emission technologies and infrastructure, says the report. OECD secretary-general Jose Angel Gurria said, The costs of not doing anything till 2050 are going to start becoming massively evident and so prohibitively expensive. Inaction on climate change path would really manifest itself in 2050. We are subsidising fossil fuel. So it is cheaper to emit.But we need to change this. Since 2010, the Petersberg dialogue has provided the opportunity for countries to engage in an informal exchange of experiences on international climate policy.

"COP23","India","COP23_India233","Climate change threat to Pacific Isles' food systems, warn SIDS leaders","November 14, 2017","Food & Beverages News","New Delhi, Nov. 14 -- Climate change poses an alarming threat to food systems and food security in the Pacific islands. This was stated by leaders of nine small island developing states (SIDS), representatives of regional development bodies, New Zealand and Australia at a meeting which took place ahead of the Pacific leaders' participation at the COP23 (the 23rd annual Conference of the Parties to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Conference), currently underway in Bonn. The meeting, which concludes on November 17, 2017, culminated in the leaders signing a joint statement - a call for action that they will take to COP23 . It was chaired by Jose Graziano da Silva, director general, Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). ""The 1.5-degree limit will allow for a greater change at maintaining resilient livelihoods and promote partnerships for sustainable development in the Pacific Islands,"" it read. Non-communicable diseases surge in the Pacific region The group also raised concerns about the negative impacts of malnutrition evidenced by the growing incidence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which account for 75 per cent of adult deaths in the Pacific, and called for more proactive and integrated actions to promote policies to tackle food insecurity challenges, especially on issues related to obesity, stunting, wasting and NCDs. It acknowledged the importance of FAO's and its partners' Global Action Programme on Food Security and Nutrition in SIDS, which recommends action at the global, regional, national and local levels to accelerate food security and nutrition, calling for its endorsement and immediate implementation. With the Pacific Island states highly dependent on their oceans for their livelihoods and food security, the leaders reiterated their anxiety about ecosystem degradation, and called upon the international community to assist in maximising the sustainable utilisation of the fisheries and aquaculture sectors for the benefit of SIDS. The Pacific Islands are among the most environmentally-vulnerable nations in the world. Drought, extreme high tides, violent winds and storm surges pose major risks to small island nations, and their efforts to achieve sustainable development. For many islands, the impact of climate change represents the gravest of threats to their survival and viability, including, for some, through the loss of territory. FAO's commitment In his opening remarks, Graziano da Silva shared the Pacific leaders' concerns about the negative impact of climate change on food security and nutrition and its role in exacerbating the burden of malnutrition as well as the alarming overweight and obesity levels. ""You are suffering from things that you didn't cause, from things you are not responsible for - the impact of climate change,"" the FAO chief said. ""This is what FAO offers - support so that you can face climate change; scale up growing local products as we see you import more and more food,"" he added. ""Obesity is a big problem. It is an epidemic that we need to address. Together with partners such as the World Health Organisation (WHO), we promote the uptake of healthy, fresh food - fruits, vegetable and fish instead of processed food,"" Graziano da Silva said. ""We promote local products such as breadfruit, for which we have a pilot programme in the Marshall Islands, Samoa and Nauru, and which we want to scale up and multiply,"" he added. With Oceans Day events underway at COP23 , the FAO chief also highlighted the importance of the FAO Port State Measures Agreement (PSMA). He said, ""Today's main tool in the hands of the international community to tackle illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing."" He urged all Pacific Island states to adhere to the agreement. ""You are countries with more water and natural resources to preserve than any other countries. This is why the Port State Measures Agreement is important,"" Graziano da Silva added. ""FAO is committed to support you to implement and monitor your PSMA process. We can provide assistance for your national legislations, training and funding to put the agreement in place,"" he said. ""We will not be able to safeguard our ocean environment if we don't combat illegal fishing,"" added Graziano da Silva.

"COP23","India","COP23_India235","Germany : What role can International Standards play in the implementation of the Paris Agreement?","November 16, 2017 Thursday","TendersInfo","International Standards can be used as tools to help implement the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development. This is the message of a side event organized by ISO and the IAF (International Accreditation Forum) as part of the 23rd Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC COP23 ) in Bonn, Germany. COP23 has started with the aim of clarifying the enabling frameworks that will make the Paris Agreement fully operational and the support needed for all nations to achieve their climate change goals. For the many countries that have ratified the agreement, the time for implementation has begun. The devastating climatic events the world has recently had to face show us how urgent it is to act now and to take concrete measures to protect our planet and our society. Voluntary International Standards developed with consensus by experts around the world are solutions that can have a practical and positive impact on our daily lives. They provide guidance to businesses as well as organizations from the public or private sector in addition to policy makers to support their efforts to reduce their environmental impact, says ISO Secretary-General, Sergio Mujica. Environmental and climate protection have been solidly anchored in German standardization for many years. There is also agreement at the international level that standardization is an important factor in the realization of UN sustainability goals, says Christoph Winterhalter, Executive Board Chairman of DIN, ISOs member for Germany. Concrete projects that are driving us forward at the moment focus largely on the consequences of climate change. This includes raising the standards committees awareness of the need to adapt to the consequences of climate change and the need for standardization in support of adaptation to climate change. Examples of this include vulnerability assessment, a vulnerability analysis which deals with the impact of climate change on organizations, as well as the issue of climate finance, i.e. investment and financing related to climate change. ISO is developing new international framework standards to assist non-state actors in meeting climate targets aligned with the Paris Agreement. The ISO-IAF joint side event will highlight the role of these new standards, as well as a harmonized global approach for accreditation, to facilitate the acceptance of verification between economies, build confidence and strengthen governance and transparency in future adaptation activities. This side event will focus on well-known standards such as ISO 14001 (environmental management), ISO 14065 (greenhouse gas validation and verification) and ISO 50001 (energy management). Standards such as these help to open world markets for clean energy and energy-efficient technologies and support climate change adaptation and mitigation schemes. It will show how environmental management and energy management, and new framework standards, will support parties and non-state actors in facilitating global or local climate actions. ISO standards currently under development will also be highlighted, such as ISO 14090 on a framework for climate change adaptation, ISO 14080 on a framework for climate action and ISO 14097, which focuses on climate finance. Monitoring climate change, quantifying greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and promoting good practice in environmental management and design are just some of the ways in which ISO International Standards help organizations address climate change. \"

Weve known for a long time that tackling agricultural climate pollution and other sources of air pollution are critical to addressing climate change and ensuring we leave a stable climate for future generations. The Green Partys confidence and supply agreement with Labour commits to significant reductions in waste to landfill by 2020, and this Bonn Communique recognises how important work to reduce waste emissions is. Auckland City has committed to a very ambitious target of zero waste by 2040. The new Government is proud of the leadership Auckland is showing. We support that goal, both at home and on the world stage, Mr Shaw says. \"

""I commit that the Mahindra Group will implement the Paris Agreement in its entirety. A powerful way of ensuring corporate climate action, aligned with the ambition of the Paris Agreement, is by setting science-based targets. I applaud all 330+ companies that have already committed to set science-based targets through the Science Based Targets initiative. Two of the three Mahindra companies with the highest emissions in the Group, Tech Mahindra and Mahindra Sanyo Special Steel, have already done so. Today, I am inviting all companies, particularly those that emit the most, to commit to set science-based targets. Over the course of 2018, I will be working to expand the adoption of science-based targets not only across the Mahindra Group, but amongst my business colleagues so that by the Global Climate Action Summit in September, 500 companies step up and commit to set science-based targets,"" said Anand Mahindra, Chairman, Mahindra Group. More than 330 of the world's biggest companies have already committed to align their strategies with the ambition of the Paris Agreement through the Science Based Targets initiative. Almost 900 more companies have declared their ambition to set science-based targets within the next two years in their disclosures to the CDP, signaling the emergence of a 'new normal' in the way businesses are developing their strategies for the future. Mahindra Sanyo Special Steel Pvt. Ltd. set a science-based Greenhouse Gas emission reduction target of 35% under SCOPE 1, 2 and 3 per ton of steel produced by the year 2030, against 2016 baseline year. A key purpose of the 2018 Global Climate Action Summit which will be held from September 12-14 in San Francisco, is to showcase climate action around the world, along with bold new commitments, to give worldwide leaders the confidence they need to go even further when they meet at the United Nations COP24 in November. Summit participants, including sub national governments, investors, businesses and others from around the world, will report on their climate action and commit to ambitious new actions that can help prevent the climate from warming more than 2 degrees Celsius-the point at which scientists warn of potentially catastrophic global consequences. Setting science-based targets is a great way for businesses to future-proof growth and boost their competitive advantage in the transition to a low-carbon economy. It also sends a powerful signal to global governments that business is aligning strategy with the Paris Agreement, opening the way for us all to move further, faster on the ambition of the Agreement. We welcome the challenge to business to step up in advance of the Global Climate Action Summit by committing to the Science Based Targets initiative, and we hope that many businesses will quickly follow Mahindra's lead,"" said Paul Simpson, CEO of CDP, one of the partners of the Science Based Targets initiative. Today's announcement is the first of what will be multiple ""Summit Challenges"" that will concretely help deliver greenhouse gas reductions to help ensure worldwide emissions start trending downward no later than 2020-a goal that must be met to prevent dangerous temperature rise. It will also help the Summit deliver on its goal to help continue a worldwide energy transition that generates quality employment and inclusive economic growth.

The UPA (United Progressive Alliance) vision of Aadhaar was that it should be implemented only for delivery of social benefits. Aadhaar was meant to be an instrument of eliminating fraud and duplicate identity in delivery of social programmes. ""I never expect aadhaar for airline tickets, bank accounts, mobiles...this is ridiculous. They (the Modi government) have made mockery of Aadhaar,"" he told IANS in an interview on the sidelines of the Tata Steel Kolkata Literary Festival. Further, Ramesh said, ""People are dying because of Aadhaar card as they are not getting ration, pension without the biometric card. Aadhaar is inducing deaths of people."" The former Union Environment Minister accused the Modi government of weakening and tweaking environment laws to favour industries. ""All the environmental laws are being weakened and diluted. Ministry of Environment has become a rubber stamp body. In the name of ease of doing business, it is being tweaked to favour industry...they are trying to weaken National Green Tribunal, forest conservation laws,"" he said. Criticising the river-linking project, Ramesh said, the ""Ken-Betwa river linking project, of which Modi is going to lay the foundation stone soon, will destroy the Panna Tiger reserve in Madhya Pradesh. The technocrat-turned-politician also took a swipe at Modi for his speech at the World Economic Forum (WEF) at Davos. Addressing world leaders and global corporate honchos at the plenary session of the WEF, Modi dwelt on the threat of climate change. ""Prime Minister Modi goes to Davos and gives big bhashan (lecture) on environment and climate change. But his actions are entirely different. ""The Ministry of Environment has become the Ministry of Environment approvals. It is supposed to regulate. But they are not serious about it,"" he said. Asked about the present government's role in the United Nations climate change conference , he said: ""Now, BJP is parroting what I said in Cancun in 2010 that all countries must mitigate. BJP and (Arun) Jaitley criticised me. Now, the same thing you are saying nine years later."" Lauding the erstwhile UPA government for putting the country's economy on a higher growth trajectory, he said whatever the Modi government is doing is by building on the success of previous governments. ""When Modi talks about high growth, he forgets that during the ten years of UPA government (2004-2014), the average rate of annual growth was 7.4 per cent, which was quite high. In fact, in the last two years, the growth has been lower than the long term average. We hope the growth will recover from the next year onwards."" In this context, Ramesh gave credit to the P.V. Narsimha Rao government and the then Finance Minister Manmohan Singh for delivering a landmark budget in 1991 with a direction of liberalisation. ""In the last 26 years, we have had six Prime Ministers. Nobody has changed the direction of 1991 (for economic liberalisation) given by Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh. In the last three decades, the Indian economy grew on an average of almost 6.6 per cent per year. So it is a huge achievement."" Ramesh also criticised the Modi regime for demonetisation and the way the new indirect tax was implemented. ""I personally feel that the (current) slow down of economy is not irreversible. Demonetisation was a bad idea implemented badly. Goods and Services Tax (GST) was a very good idea implemented poorly. So both these shocks have combined to reduce economic growth,"" the Rajya Sabha member said. He accused the BJP government of failing to create employment and instead destroying jobs. ""Jobs are not only not being created but destroyed also. For the first time, in IT industry in Bangalore (Bengaluru), jobs are being destroyed. Job creation is a very serious issue today. This is not being created because investments are not taking place. The investment rate in India today is less than 28 per cent of GDP which is the lowest in the last 35-40 years.""

"COP23","India","COP23_India241","Switzerland : IOM Council Panel Highlights Migration, Environment, Climate Change Link","December 4, 2017 Monday","TendersInfo","IOM, the UN Migration Agency yesterday (30/11) held a high-level panel discussion to identify and assess opportunities to address migration and climate change in the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular migration (GCM). The event was convened during the ongoing 108th Session of the IOM Council in Geneva. IOM Director General, William Lacy Swing moderated the panel which included Nicolas Hulot, Frances Minister for the Ecological and Inclusive Transition; Ambassador Nazhat Shameem Khan, Permanent Representative of Fiji to the United Nations in Geneva and Chief Negotiator for the COP23 Presidency; and Keiko Kiyama, Executive Director of the Japan Platform and Co-President of the Japan Emergency NGO, who represented civil society. Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC and Erik Solheim, Executive Director of UN Environment shared written and video statements, respectively. In the past 10 years, environmental migration has been primarily acknowledged and addressed at the international level in climate change negotiations. DG Swing highlighted that the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration offers yet another historical opportunity, this time within the international migration governance policy realm, to recognize the importance of environmental and climate factors. Minister Hulot said, Migration in the context of environment and climate change is a living reality that affects hundreds of thousands of women, men and children, already in a vulnerable situation. He further underscored that cooperation among countries of origin, transit and destination is necessary and indispensable. He pointed out that countries most vulnerable to climate change are the first to welcome climate migrants and with a solidary spirit. We must also rise up to the challenge. Ambassador Khan recalled the results of the Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP23 ) and highlighted that in 2018, the second year of our Presidency, Fiji will aim to promote higher ambition and further actions to prevent, minimize and avert the effects of climate change on people () including on migration and displacement. Both Minister Hulot and Ambassador Khan underscored the need for global policy coherence on addressing climate and migration across agendas, including the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement as well as the forthcoming Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM) and the Global Pact for the Environment. Advances made at the Human Rights Council, the Conference to Combat Desertification and through the Platform on Disaster Displacement should also be built upon. Minister Hulot mentioned that the forthcoming December One Planet Summit convened by French President, Emmanuel Macron will aim to continue and upscale the mobilization of all actors in the fight against climate change and the support to adaptation efforts. Kiyama called for migrants and potential migrants to be considered as the first stakeholders tackling root causes requires local knowledge. Since they are the owners of their lives, when they are included in all the phases, the projects will be more efficient and productive, and the result will be to the point and sustainable. Moreover, the discussion stressed the positive dimension of migration, as migrants bring skills and knowledge and can be actively involved in climate action. Some Member States took the floor to once again call for the recognition of environmental and climate risks and impacts on all policy areas. This includes the design of migration policy, in particular in the process of developing the GCM. IOM has been addressing the nexus of migration, environment and climate change since the 1990s making advances on all fronts: operational response in disaster situations, building capacities of policymakers, facilitating policy dialogue as well as policy development, supporting research and collecting data. Through this work, IOM aims to minimize forced forms of migration in the context of climate change and disasters, ensure assistance, protection and durable solutions for those affected, and facilitate migration as an adaptation strategy to climate change. \"

"COP23","India","COP23_India243","Time to reduce carbon dioxide emissions","November 16, 2017 Thursday","Herald (Goa) (India)","Goa, Nov. 16 -- In light of the severe pollution in Delhi and the related problems it is causing, it is pertinent to act to stem the possibility of a similar situation from ever occurring in Goa. There has been enough evidence that coal handling at the Mormugao Port Trust has cloaked the town of Vasco with a layer of dust, leading to breathing difficulties and other health issues arising from the dust. The monitoring conducted by Goa State Pollution Control Board has also found that the particulate matter in the air was far higher than the permissible level, though the monsoon later brought this down. The residents of the town, and those on the transportation routes, have taken up the issue demanding that the handling of coal be stopped in the State. There is no denying that pollution levels in Goa have increased over the years, and it is also not just coal or iron ore mining and transportation that are the only or the main reasons for pollution in the State. Pollution is due to many factors, and this needs to be tackled now, rather than waiting for it to engulf the State, in the manner that Delhi has been choked. It is perhaps time to take a leaf from the manner in which the National Green Tribunal has reacted to the petitions before it regarding the pollution in Delhi. For one the tribunal has refused to exempt two-wheelers and women drivers from the odd-even rule that permits vehicles with odd numbers to ply on certain days of the week and vehicles with even numbers to ply on other days. This is done for that the streets of the National Capital have fewer vehicles on the roads. The tribunal has also ordered that diesel vehicles that are older than 10 years be taken off the roads immediately. These two points in the Tribunal's order need to be considered by the administration in Goa, as the State could someday be led to take similar decisions, if steps are not taken today to keep pollution levels below the permissible levels. Admittedly, most of the pollution is from vehicle fumes. Traffic on the roads is increasing steadily, with the number of vehicles growing. As pointed out in Herald, in Margao itself over 40 new two-wheelers take to the streets daily, adding to the traffic and the fumes of fossil-based fuels - carbon dioxide. The State does not have the kind of traffic that Delhi has, but vehicles in Goa are not just filling up the streets of the towns, but also leading to air pollution through the release of fumes. Admittedly, the pollution levels in most Goan towns is within limits, but it is better to ensure that these limits are not crossed, rather than having to take drastic and emergency measures when the pollution level crosses the permissible limits. There are proposals to convert the public transport system to bio fuels and the possibility of going green is already being experimented on a pilot basis, with selected Kadamba Transport Corporation buses running on the bio fuel. But the State needs to take a few steps ahead and plan for a proper, systematic transport system that will reduce the number of private vehicles on the roads and so help the State bring down its carbon footprint. This could also be Goa's contribution to the global battle to combat carbon dioxide emissions and contain the changes in climate. Currently the United Nations Climate Change Conference is being held in Bonn, Germany and it was revealed here that transport contributes about a quarter of all energy-related carbon dioxide emissions and about 15-17 percent of the entire spread of human carbon dioxide emissions. This, then, could be the right time to take a call on reducing pollution levels caused by humans. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Herald Goa.

Financed by a consortium of commercial banks (Caisse d'Epargne CEPAC, Credit Agricole du Languedoc and Unifergie-Crdit Agricole Group) and public (Bpifrance), this project benefited from contributions from own funds of VALECO & MIROVA and the guarantee of European Investment Bank (EIB) under the Juncker Plan. Erick Gay, President of the VALECO Group declares ""The finalization of this innovative operation allows the VALECO Group to demonstrate its ability to partner with major players who trust it over time. This is an important step for the VALECO Group which doubles in two years its installed capacity in wind power in France. This is only a first step in the ambitious achievement of our portfolio of advanced projects of 1000 MW of which 400 MW are currently in advanced instruction. Raphael Lance, Director of Renewable Energy Funds at MIROVA, commented on the transaction: ""MIROVA is proud of its investment in the Discovery Solar Power Plant, alongside its partner VALECO. This operation illustrates a successful and long-term cooperation between this growing family-owned company, institutional investors increasingly involved in financing green energy through our funds, and the EIB. This successful mobilization of savings and financing is necessary to achieve the goals we have set for energy transition."" Ambroise Fayolle, Vice President of the EIB, praises this unprecedented financial partnership in Europe: ""I am very pleased that the EIB today announces this innovative partnership with VALECO and several banks to finance wind and photovoltaic sites in France. . This Discovery Center is an emblematic project of our action in favor of an alternative energy and more respectful of the environment, creating jobs and economic dynamism in the heart of a territory. With the guarantee of the Juncker Plan, we are able to accelerate financing in the energy transition sector and on smaller projects in line with our commitments under the Paris Agreement and the priorities of the Grand Plan of the French Government. Miguel Arias Caete, European Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy, said: ""Renewable energies are today competitive and sometimes cheaper than fossil fuels, their production employs more than one million people. people in Europe, attracts more investment than many other sectors, and has reduced our fossil fuel import bill by 16 billion a year. We must now redouble our efforts as Europe works with its partners to take the lead in the global race for a more sustainable and competitive economy. Today's decision sends a strong and positive message as the United Nations Climate Change Conference concludes in Bonn: Realized by GROUPE VALECO in close collaboration with all local stakeholders, the Discovery Center is the result of a proactive approach to planning and sustainable development of the town of Decazeville-Aubin. Built on a mining industrial wasteland, historically anchored in the local landscape, the power station is an innovative, attractive and job-creating solar production site. The solar plant of Discovery covers an area of ??18 hectares on a dozen sites of the old dump of Montet and old discoveries of the coal mining of Lassalle and Buyssonie. The converted site is composed of 38,000 photovoltaic panels that will provide a total power of 12 MW, covering the electricity consumption of 6,000 surrounding homes. The installation of 1,810 ""trackers"" throughout the site, automatically controlling the alignment of photovoltaic panels according to the advance of the sun, made it possible to optimally optimize production. Particular attention has been paid to respecting the site's environment in all its human, physical and landscape components in order to conserve natural areas, while preserving them from noise and visual nuisances. By saving 13,340 tons of CO2 per year, the Discovery plant is fully committed to the actions of the EIB, the commercial banks and Bpifrance in favor of the Energy and Environmental Transition (TEE). \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India245","2017 is set to be in top three hottest years, with record-breaking extreme weather: finds report","November 6, 2017 Monday 6:30 AM EST","IBNS","Washington, Nov 6 (IBNS): It is very likely that 2017 will be one of the three hottest years on record, with many high-impact events including catastrophic hurricanes and floods, debilitating heatwaves and drought. Long-term indicators of climate change such as increasing carbon dioxide concentrations, sea level rise and ocean acidification continue unabated. Arctic sea ice coverage remains below average and previously stable Antarctic sea ice extent was at or near a record low. The World Meteorological Organizations provisional Statement on the State of the Climate says the average global temperature from January to September 2017 was approximately 1.1C above the pre-industrial era. As a result of a powerful El Nio, 2016 is likely to remain the warmest year on record, with 2017 and 2015 being second and/or third. 2013-2017 is set to be the warmest five-year period on record. The WMO statement which covers January to September - was released on the opening day of the United Nations climate change conference in Bonn. It includes information submitted by a wide range of UN agencies on human, socio-economic and environmental impacts as part of a drive to provide a more comprehensive, UN-wide policy brief for decision makers on the interplay between weather, climate and water and the UN global goals. The past three years have all been in the top three years in terms of temperature records. This is part of a long term warming trend, said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. We have witnessed extraordinary weather, including temperatures topping 50 degrees Celsius in Asia, record-breaking hurricanes in rapid succession in the Caribbean and Atlantic reaching as far as Ireland, devastating monsoon flooding affecting many millions of people and a relentless drought in East Africa. Many of these events and detailed scientific studies will determine exactly how many bear the tell-tale sign of climate change caused by increased greenhouse gas concentrations from human activities, he said. Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of UN Climate Change which is hosting the Bonn conference, said: These findings underline the rising risks to people, economies and the very fabric of life on Earth if we fail to get on track with the aims and ambitions of the Paris Agreement. There is unprecedented and very welcome momentum among governments, but also cities, states, territories, regions, business and civil society. Bonn 2017 needs to be the launch pad towards the next, higher level of ambition by all nations and all sectors of society as we look to de-risk the future and maximize the opportunities from a fresh, forward-looking and sustainable development path, she added. Extreme events affect the food security of millions of people, especially the most vulnerable. A review of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) found that, in developing countries, agriculture (crops, livestock, fisheries, aquaculture and forestry) accounted for 26% of all the damage and loss associated with medium to large-scale storms, floods and drought. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the global health impacts of heatwaves depend not only on the overall warming trend, but on how heatwaves are distributed across where people live. Recent research shows that the overall risk of heat-related illness or death has climbed steadily since 1980, with around 30% of the worlds population now living in climatic conditions that deliver prolonged extreme heatwaves. Between 2000 and 2016, the number of vulnerable people exposed to heatwave events has increased by approximately 125 million. In 2016, 23.5 million people were displaced during weather-related disasters. Consistent with previous years, the majority of these internal displacements were associated with floods or storms and occurred in the Asia-Pacific region. In Somalia, more than 760 000 internal displacements have been reported, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and International Organisation for Migration (IOM). The latest International Monetary Fund (IMF) World Economic Outlook indicates that adverse consequences are concentrated in countries with relatively hot climates and which are home to close to 60% of current global population. \"

""These ecosystems are high on the agenda for Small Island Developing States because we are among the most vulnerable nations to the impacts of climate change,"" said Fiji's Economy and Climate Change Minister Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, whose country holds this year's presidency of the conference. ""While important progress has been made in protecting these ecosystems to enhance our resilience to a changing climate, we need all countries to make forest protection and rehabilitation and the financing of all forest ecosystems a priority. In particular, we need to create real incentives to attract both public and private finance to delivering nature-based solutions,"" he said. Two years after the world united around the Paris Agreement and a year after its entry into force, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change's (UNFCCC) 197 parties have been reconvened for the 23rd annual climate change talks in Bonn till November 17. The Bonn talks, which began on November 6, are expected to take a number of decisions necessary to bring the Paris Agreement to life, including meaningful progress on the agreement implementation guidelines, to achieve a goal to cut greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels. The new actions to cut emissions from forest use included an Ecuadorean initiative to reduce 15 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions in the forest sector, launched by Maria Victoria Chiriboga, Ecuador's Under Secretary of Climate Change. A commitment to deforestation-free commodities by Laura Phillips of Walmart's Senior Vice President of Sustainability. Mars Inc's new policy to reduce their carbon footprint 27 per cent by 2025 and 67 per cent by 2050 by addressing deforestation throughout their corporate value chain was presented by Kevin Rabinovitch, Global Vice President of Sustainability. Lee White, Director of Gabon's National Park Service, described efforts to halt an illegal logging operation that will stop the emission of 20 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. Sustaining and increasing forests is vital to get on track in time to meet the Paris Climate Change Agreement's goal, which is to keep the average global temperature rise well below two degrees Celsius and as close to 1.5 degrees as possible. The maths of climate science show that meeting this goal is impossible without nurturing forests, which from the atmosphere's point of view are a massive sink of carbon, locked up in trees, plants and the soil, and a source of oxygen through photosynthesis. But destructive, often illegal, logging and deforestation continues. Last year, forests equal to the size of New Zealand disappeared. ""Our planet's forests are being decimated at an alarming rate. Putting a stop to this destruction is crucial to tackling climate change, reducing poverty and feeding a growing global population, in line with the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals,"" said Director General of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Inger Andersen. ""Nature-based solutions such as protecting and restoring forests can contribute over one-third of the total climate change mitigation required by 2030 to keep the temperature rise below two degrees Celsius. More decisive, collective action is now needed to seize this opportunity,"" he added. (Vishal Gulati is in Bonn at the invitation of the Global Editors Network to cover COP23 .

These issues include the 'rulebook' for the Paris Agreement, and to prepare the ground for governments to commit to raise the ambition of their climate pledges by 2020. Promising developments, seen across the world in the past few weeks, built the momentum for the Talanoa Dialogue and gave reason to hope that 2018 can be a trampoline before the world in 2019 jumps and scales up ambition to close the emissions gap, a climate expert told IANS. The Talanoa Dialogue is an important international conversation in which countries will check progress and seek to increase global ambition to meet Paris Agreement goals. The dialogue was launched at the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ) in Bonn in November 2017 and will run throughout 2018. The Paris Agreement's central aim is keep the global average temperature rise to below two degrees Celsius and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees Celsius. ""To achieve success at COP24, it is essential that the nations begin to work towards draft negotiating texts at the May meeting. This will provide a solid foundation for work in the second half of 2018 and help them deliver strong results,"" an official statement quoting UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa said. At the COP23 COP24 is the deadline for nations to agree on a common set of implementation guidelines for the Paris Agreement, the so-called rulebook, which will establish the rules and processes needed to reach the global goal. With the Talanoa Dialogue, Bonn will offer a platform for countries and non-party stakeholders to showcase their progress towards a low-carbon economy in all sectors and inspire each other while at the same time demonstrating the risks of inaction. This summit, which will continue till May 10, will kick-start a process throughout the year and be followed by other international moments that showcase climate action around the world like the Petersberg Climate Dialogue in Germany and the Ministerial on Climate Action in Brussels in June. The 2018 Talanoa Dialogue will conclude at COP24 with a final report by the Presidency when ministers are expected to signal that they will enhance national climate pledges by 2020. Just a week before Bonn, the 2018 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London concluded with a commitment from all 53 member-states to limit global warming to well below two degrees and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees, recognising that the impacts of climate change are a significant reality. Bonn should be the place to help resolve the finance question, British charity Christian Aid's International Climate Lead Mohamed Adow told IANS. ""Rich countries need to honour their promise of delivering $100 billion a year to poor countries to help them reduce their emissions and cope with a changing climate,"" he said. With 197 Parties, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has near- universal membership and is the parent treaty of the Paris Agreement.

"COP23","India","COP23_India251","Fiji : Fijian Envoy Addresses ACP Fisheries Ministers Meeting","September 25, 2017 Monday","TendersInfo","Steps taken by the Fijian Government to maintain a sustainable fisheries sector against a backdrop of growing challenges was highlighted this week at the 5th Meeting of the African, Caribbean, and Pacific Group of States (ACP) Ministers in charge of Fisheries and Aquaculture. Fisheries is regarded as the mainstay for food security. The industry is the 3rd largest natural resource based sector within the Fijian economy, and contributes 7.0 per cent of Fijis total export earnings. Fijis Head of Mission to the European Union based in Brussels, Ambassador Deo Saran, led Fiji's delegation to this meeting where he highlighted the importance of the fisheries sector to Fijis socio-economic development. Speaking at the Ministerial Round Table on exchange of views with key partners for the EU, ADB, World Bank, IFAD and FAO, Ambassador Saran presented Fiji's strategies and initiatives and the many challenges it faces in maintaining a sustainable fisheries sector. He said that recognising the immense value of the marine environment and the importance of looking after our coastal seas, the ocean and marine resources, the Fijian government adopted a number of fisheries sustainable policies. In this regard it has entered into several international conventions and made commitments to ensure the sustainability of the fisheries sector. Fiji made a declaration at the meeting of the Small Island Developing States in Mauritius to effectively protect 30% of its seas by 2020. This was the first declaration of its kind in the Pacific and showed Fijis leadership in the area of marine conservation and sustainable fisheries development. Fiji renewed this commitment in 2014 at the second 3rd UN SIDS Ocean conference in Samoa. As Fijis Climate Ambassador for the COP23 , the ongoing negotiations on climate change, Ambassador Saran told delegates that Fiji intends to draw a strong link between the health of oceans and climate change when it assumes the presidency of COP23 in November this year. He added that Fiji would highlight the role of oceans in existing climate change negotiations and the Action Agenda and build support for a more integrated programme of work to address the impact of climate change to oceans and marine life. In June 2017, Fiji served as co-President of the first United Nations Ocean Conference in New York along with the Government of Sweden. Fiji also made 17 voluntary commitments at this years Conference that will serve as drivers for sustainable fisheries resource management, through strategic partnership with both Pacific SIDS and national stakeholders and conservation partners. Ambassador Saran added that these commitments come with great challenges, but at the same time, provide some opportunities for Fiji and the pacific small island states. Having a large marine managed area, will definitely increase the coastal and oceanic fisheries productivities and biomasses which would make them attractive to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activities (IUU), therefore heightens the need for effective monitoring, control, surveillance and enforcement. Implementing multiple management tools such as focus management of endangered and vulnerable species, seasonal closures, size limits and allocation of quotas is essential. As small islands economies, we can also pursue this as an opportunity for strengthening aquaculture development and post-harvest or value addition of fisheries products to maximize the return with limited resource used. In response the ACP Group secretary-general Dr Patrick Gomes commended Fiji for her leadership on climate change and sustainability issues of Small Island Developing States. Ambassador Saran was supported by the Principal Fisheries Officer at Fijis Ministry of Fisheries, Mr Shalendra Singh who presented on aquaculture development in Fiji at the senior officials forum. \"

"COP23","India","COP23_India255","Philippines : UNFCCC Designates Legarda as 1 of 2 Adaptation Champions","November 21, 2017 Tuesday","TendersInfo","On November 13, 2017, Senator Loren Legarda was presented to international press in Bonn, Germany as a National Adaptation Plan (NAP) Champion designated by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), an international treaty to which the Philippines is a Party. Legarda, Head of the Philippine Delegation to the 23rd Session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 23 COP23 side event ""Championing NAPs - Advancing National Adaptation Plans"" organized by the Least Developed Countries Expert Group (LEG) of the UNFCCC. ""I am inspired by the designation of the UNFCCC as NAP Champion. With this, I will work harder in building the Philippines' resilience through developing and financing adaptation projects,"" Legarda said. ""Adaptation essentially means enhancing our resilience, policies, projects, and programs, against the impacts of climate change. There can be no resilience without adaptation. Adaptation is the battle cry for those who seek climate justice,"" she added. As further defined by the LEG, adaptation to climate change means ""human-driven adjustments in ecological, social, or economic systems or policy processes, in response to actual or expected climate stimuli and their effects or impacts."" Mr. Youssef Nassef, Director of the Adaptation Committee of the UNFCCC, noted that the designation of Legarda and 'Utoikamanu as NAP Champions is ""the first in the process of UNFCCC,"" signifying the urgent need to promote the importance of resilience and facilitate linkages with external contexts to climate change adaptation. For Legarda, being the Chair of the Senate Committee on Finance, while also being the Chair of the Committees on Climate Change and Foreign Relations, is an advantage because this allows her to enshrine climate and environment provisions in the Philippines' General Appropriations Act (GAA). ""I am proud that we are able to make our national budget a climate budget, with special and general provisions on adaptation, such as the establishment of multi-hazard early warning systems, rainwater harvesting, seed banks, mangroves, rooftop gardens, roadside ditches, sea wall, and practice drills for response and preparedness,"" Legarda said. Legarda also highlighted the crucial role of private sector in pursuing adaptation in the country. She said that the government should implement the mechanisms of what adaptation really is so that the private sector could understand and realize that resilience is extremely relevant in our businesses and industries. ""It is a misconception that adaptation is an unattractive investment for the private sector. We have to emphasize that adaptation means less reconstruction and rehabilitation, or less lives lost and less livelihoods and businesses affected,"" she said. Legarda also said that she would host an Adaptation Summit in the Philippines next year, with her fellow NAP Champion Fekitamoeloa Katoa 'Utoikamanu of Tonga as guest of honor. Aside from showcasing best practices in adaptation, the Summit aims to launch a mentoring process for small vulnerable communities in the Philippines. ""Adaptation is a matter of life and death. It is important to learn from other country's best practices, and share our own, as we further develop and implement our National Adaptation Plans. The Adaptation Summit for climate-vulnerable countries will serve as a platform to foster this cooperation towards realizing our objectives and goals,"" Legarda concluded. Legarda is a three-term senator who chairs the Senate Committees on Foreign Relations, Finance and Climate Change. She has authored the Philippines' landmark environmental laws, including the Philippine Climate Change Act and the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, which were hailed by the UN as among the world's best laws on climate and disaster resilience. She also shepherded the Philippines' ratification of the landmark Paris Agreement. Legarda was appointed by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) as its Global Champion for Resilience with a distinguished role to provide leadership to build the resilience of nations and communities to disasters. Meanwhile, Ms. 'Utoikamanu was appointed as High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States (UN-OHRLLS) in April 2017 to lead the UN Office in undertaking appropriate advocacy work, assisting in mobilizing international support and resources, and providing appropriate support to group consultations for least developed countries, landlocked developing countries, and small island developing States. She was previously Chief Executive Officer of the Ministry of Tourism in Tonga (2017); Acting Pro-Chancellor and Chair (2015) and Deputy Pro-Chancellor and Deputy Chair (2009-2016) of the Council of the University of the South Pacific; Deputy Director General and Director of Education, Training and Human Development of the Secretariat of Pacific Community (2009-2015); Permanent Representative and Ambassador of the Government of Tonga to the United Nations, United States of America, Cuba and Venezuela and High Commissioner to Canada (2005-2009); and Secretary for Foreign Affairs and European Commission's National Authorizing Officer for Tonga (2002-2005). About the UNFCCC The UNFCCC is an international environment treaty that seeks to foster international cooperation to combat climate change by limiting average global temperature increases and coping with its impacts.

Legarda, Head of the Philippine Delegation to the 23rd Session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 23 COP23 side event ""Asia-Pacific Climate Action: Making Finance Flows Consistent With a Pathway Towards Low Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate-resilient Development for the Implementation of the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda."" The event was a forum organized by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP), with the aim of identifying the challenges faced by the public and private sectors in climate-vulnerable countries in the Asia-Pacific region to tap capital markets for low greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and climate-resilient development, as well as introducing the idea of a Regional Action Agenda to direct finance flows towards low-carbon development. ""We need to foster a policy environment that will raise the participation of the financial sector in low-carbon investments needs. One strategy could be to identify the best mix of lending instruments to attract low-carbon investments,"" Legarda said. ""There should also be greater efforts towards making low-carbon innovations more affordable in the Philippines and increasing awareness of the severe impacts of climate change to encourage more investments. Regulatory challenges and technical risks could also be covered by the government through technical assistance to assist the private sector,"" she added. Legarda also mentioned the challenges and concerns from both the supply and demand sides of green investments. ""The demand side faces constraints, such as high capital requirements. On the other hand, green lending institutions also face challenges, such as market gaps faced by government banks, which are heightened because of uncertainties and the lack of large-scale long-term finance. For the private banks, long-term lending is constrained by the long-term risks associated with the global financial crisis, liquidity requirements, and sustainability of climate investments, among other factors,"" Legarda explained. The Senator, however, said that, even though the Philippine contribution to GHG emissions remains negligible at 0.31%, pursuing low-carbon or climate change mitigation investments are still very much in line with international commitments and national development plans of the Philippines. Legarda mentioned that the National Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP) and the 2017-2022 Philippine Development Plan (PDP) already espouses mitigation strategies that would also aid the Philippines in achieving the targets in its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), as part of its commitment to the Paris Agreement. She noted that the estimated cost to implement the identified mitigation actions for the energy, forestry, industry, and transport sectors, for the period of 2015 to 2030, is USD4.12 billion, which will pursue programs, such as the operationalization of the bus rapid transit system (BRT), expansion of rail transport systems, transition from traditional fuels to biofuels, development of more renewable energy programs, and the continued implementation of forest protection, management, and rehabilitation activities. ""This huge financial resource requirement to transit to a low-carbon economy would indeed require external support. Lending institutions have critical role to play to unlock more investments, including those from the private sector, in the pursuit of low-carbon and climate-resilient growth. A strong partnership among the government, the private sector, and the lending institutions will be greatly needed to put in place the right conditions to attract domestic and foreign low-carbon investments,"" Legarda said. In order promote green banking and financing in the Philippines, Legarda said that the Climate Change Commission (CCC), in partnership with UNESCAP, initiated a program to mainstream sustainable climate action within financial institutions in the Philippines, commencing with the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). The program aims to engage banks in ""greening"" the financial sector by increasing awareness and appreciation on how they can integrate climate mitigation and adaptation criteria in in their lending operations. Legarda also mentioned that she filed a proposed measure to establish environmental units in every banking institution to assess and ensure that projects, subject to financing applications as well as collateral offered as security, shall conform to Philippine environmental laws. She also stressed that climate action makes good development sense. ""Pursuing green finance is crucial in our goal of pursuing climate-resilient, sustainable, and inclusive growth that likewise contribute to the fight to keep warming within the 1.5 degree threshold.

High-level government officials from around the world gathered to engage in meaningful conversations about ocean acidification (OA) and steps OA Alliance members can take to mitigate impacts through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The OA Alliance, founded by the West Coast states of California, Washington, Oregon and the Canadian Province of British Columbia, welcomed five new members to a rapidly growing worldwide coalition of governments and supporting affiliates committed to creating regional ocean acidification action plans and sharing climate action best practices with each other. The newest official members of the OA Alliance are Fiji, Sweden, the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) and the scientific and technical organization Pacific Community (SPC). Tokelau also announced their intention to join the OA Alliance at today's event. Todays event highlighted the importance of building relationships among national, state and regional governments to protect coastal communities and livelihoods. Washington State Governor Jay Inslee and Fiji Minister of Fisheries Semi Koroilavesau discussed how carbon emissions impact their fisheries, tourism and ecosystems and voiced a mutual call for climate leadership to protect our oceans. Ocean acidification is already negatively impacting the West Coast. We know that healthy oceans sustain jobs, support coastal economies and feed billions of people. Now all of this is at risk and will cause great damage to Washingtons shellfish industry, coastal communities, and tribes, who rely on the ocean for cultural, subsistence and economic resources, Washington Governor Inslee said. We must take action now to reduce carbon emissions to secure the health of the oceans. We stand with nations and subnational governments around the world ready to take bold action to protect these resources for future generations. The second part of the event focused on Ocean Acidification Action Plans as essential vehicles for implementing change at local, regional and global levels. Ocean Acidification Action Plans include a range of government, industry, and civil society actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other contributors to ocean acidification. They also include actions OA Alliance members can take to adapt and build resilience locally. In October, the OA Alliance announced a goal of developing 15 new member Ocean Acidification Action Plans by 2019. The economic impacts of ocean acidification in Oregon are very real. Using data to inform our policies, we have innovated solutions for the oyster industry within the state and are using this model to tackle the other challenges that climate change has brought to Oregon. Our experience should be a bellwether for other industries and states for what to expect as acidification intensifies over the coming decades, said Oregon Governor Kate Brown. We must work together for the benefit of our collective future, our childrens future, and as part of responsible governance for the planet we all share. We are acting on a moral imperative through the policies we develop together on climate, energy, and ocean acidification. Ocean acidity has increased by 30 percent since the Industrial Revolution and is expected to double over pre-industrial levels by the end of this century as oceans absorb more than 90 percent of the excess heat caused by greenhouse gas pollution. Extensive laboratory and field studies conducted worldwide have documented the alarming impacts on fisheries and marine ecosystems due to ocean acidification and warming. From juvenile oyster die-offs in the Pacific Northwest to coral reef bleaching in the Caribbean and South Pacific Ocean, impacts are already being felt by coastal communities around the world. The OA Alliance is a valuable element of the United Nations newly launched COP23 Presidency initiative, the Ocean Pathway Partnership. This initiative aims to increase collaboration among ocean- and climate-focused coalitions around priorities such as sustainable transport, cities and human settlements, population displacement and migration, coastal infrastructure, marine ecosystem services, ocean food security and ocean energy. The Ocean Pathway Partnership will launch officially on 16 November in Bonn. \"

One of the government's foremost initiatives is the National Plan for the Recovery of Native Vegetation (Planaveg), announced in 2017 by the Ministry of the Environment during the 23rd Conference of the Parties to the Climate Convention ( COP23 ) in Germany. The measure aims to strengthen public policies to recover at least 12 million hectares of native forest by 2030. In recent years, the country has put into practice several economic strategies and actions resulting from international agreements on environmental preservation. Brazil already requires entrepreneurs to prepare Environmental Impact Studies (EIA) as a condition to release environmental licenses for projects whose construction can harm the environment. Conversion of Fines In October of last year, President Michel Temer signed a decree allowing the conversion of environmental fines applied to companies into investments for biome recovery services. Financial funding According to the decree, up to R$ 4.6 billion can be raised from sanctions applied by the Brazilian government that can be converted into reforestation actions, recovery of tributaries of the Sao Francisco River and land title regularisation initiatives. Oversight Although it allows companies to opt for the conversion, the measure does not exempt the fined entities from the obligation of repairing the damages that led to the fine.

That was one of the main conclusions at the panel discussion on Sustainable, liveable cities yesterday at the Sustainable Innovation Forum, at the UNs climate conference COP23 . Climate change brings increased temperatures and heavy rainfall to cities, but every climate incident brings opportunity for more liveability, said Neel Strbk, Group Market Director for Sustainability in Ramboll. Ashok-Alexander Sridharan, Mayor of Bonn, emphasised that coalitions are the key to success: Cities and regions are ready to engage with their stakeholders - in particular with private companies he said. Neel Strbk agreed, and added that private companies like Ramboll can not only facilitate buildings, infrastructure and smart assets they can also help move city governance from silo thinking to integrated solutions. The holistic approach also helps when you involve the citizens - which is something that needs to be done. President of the Assembly of European Regions Magnus Berntsson agreed that cities need to take the lead on climate change. It's about the people, he said. Neel Strbk puts it this way: Cities are people. Although having the right technology is a key enabler, taking lead is what moves cities towards solutions. We see this in cities like Copenhagen, Oslo, Gothenburg, Cologne and Melbourne. Cathy Oke, Councillor and Chair of the Environment Portfolio in the city of Melbourne, agreed: Understanding the ecology of the city is about understanding the ecology of water flows and the biodiversity that lies beneath the urban infrastructure, and coupling that with civil society engagement. This is how Melbourne is moving towards sustainability, she said. Neel Strbk added that biodiversity alone is often not enough: Sustainability also needs to be embedded in engineering solutions, she said. \"

"COP23","India","COP23_India279","PM bats for low-cost solar project financing","March 12, 2018","Free Press Journal (India)","New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said there was a need to provide concessional finance to solar energy projects in India as well as in other countries. Modi, who was speaking at the first International Solar Alliance Summit here co-hosted by France, said India will generate 175 gigawatts (GW) of electricity from renewable energy sources by 2022. This would be more than double the present renewable energy capacity and would be enough to overtake renewable expansion in the European Union for the first time. India needs some $83 billion between FY2018 and FY2022 to meet its 175 GW target, according to industry estimates. Of these, 100 GW is to come from solar and 60 GW from wind. Of the target for solar energy generation, we have already achieved 20 GW installed solar power, he said. Modi, the chief architect of ISA that seeks to bring together 121 nations, presented 10 action points including making affordable solar technology available to all nations, raising the share of electricity generated from photovoltaic cells in the energy mix and framing regulations and standards to support the initiative. He said better and cheaper solar technology should be easily available to all nations. Innovation has to be encouraged so as to provide solutions to different needs. We have to provide concessional financing and less-risky funds for solar projects, he said. Macron said $1 trillion will be needed to achieve one terawatt (TW) of solar power capacity by 2030. The ISA's major objectives include global deployment of over 1,000 GW of solar generation capacity and mobilisation of investment of $1 trillion into solar energy by 2030. Regulatory aspects as well as standards have to be framed that will expedite adoption of solar solutions. Consultancy support has to be development for putting up bankable solar projects in countries, Modi said. Stressing on inclusiveness, he said a vast network of centres of excellence has to be created. Solar energy policy has to be looked at in totality for development so that it can contribute to achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs), he said. We have to strengthen ISA Secretariat and make it more professional. Modi called for rising above narrow private goals to make collective effort for the betterment of the mankind. He said India has launched the world's biggest renewable energy programme with a target to generate 175 GW of electricity from renewable sources. Electricity from renewable sources is cheap, reliable and clean. Besides providing an alternative to polluting coal-based electricity generation, photovoltaic (PV) has big potential to power irrigation and reduce the use of back-up diesel generators. At present, the country's renewable energy installed capacity is 63 GW. Solar and wind power tariffs have dropped to an all-time low of Rs 2.44 per unit and Rs 3.46 per unit, among the lowest in the world. To supplement solar energy generation, India has distributed 28 crore LED bulbs in the last three years which have helped save $2 billion and 4 GW of electricity, the prime minister said. ISA, headquartered in Gurgaon near here, is now a treaty-based inter-governmental organisation that was established following the Paris Declaration as an alliance dedicated to the promotion of solar energy among its member countries. The Prime Minister said of the 121 countries associated with ISA, 61 have joined the alliance and 32 have ratified the Framework Agreement. Indian 'vedas' have since thousands of years considered sun as at soul of the universe and a nourisher of life. We have to look at this ancient balanced and all-encompassing philosophy when when we today look for ways to deal with the challenge of climate change, he said. Modi had in a speech at London's Wembley Stadium in 2015 proposed the idea of an inter-governmental organisation comprising of 121 countries, which lie either completely or partly between the two tropics, with an aim to promote solar energy. ISA was launched by him at the India Africa Summit in New Delhi and the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in October 2015 and November 2015, respectively. Today, heads of 23 nations and 10 ministerial representatives gathered here for alliance's first summit. The summit was co-hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron. The development of solar energy will not just lead to our prosperity, but will also reduce the carbon footprint of the earth, Modi said. Stating that better and affordable solar technology is available to all must be ensured, he said, results would be even better if other forms of energy are linked to solar. Solar energy can have a variety of uses - agriculture, solar water pumps, clean cooking. We need to encourage innovation in the solar energy sector to find different uses for it, he said. \"

The European Commission said the preliminary agreement between the EU Parliament and member states will strengthen the bloc's emissions trading system after 2020 and would put the bloc on track to achieving ""a significant part of its commitment"" under the Paris Agreement. Some 195 countries are currently taking part in talks in Germany aimed at implementing the 2015 climate accord. Environmental group WWF said that while the deal will reduce the oversupply of emissions allowances that had weighed on the market, heavily polluting sectors will continue to get emissions certificates worth billions of euros for free until 2030. ""You couldn't make it up,"" said Sam Van den Plas, a climate specialist at WWF's European policy office. ""While EU negotiators at COP23 in Bonn are making progress on the Paris Agreement, EU decision-makers back in Brussels are busy undermining it."" ""Today's shameful agreement ... means Europe's largest emitters will be paid to pollute, rather than having to pay,"" he added. The Climate Action Network Europe, an alliance of environmental groups, said the EU deal would throw a lifeline to the continued use of coal, one of the most polluting forms of fossil fuel. ""Instead of making polluters pay, the EU decided to do the exact opposite,"" said Wendel Trio, the group's director of CAN Europe. ""It allowed its flagship climate tool to continue subsidizing coal plants."" Several European countries, especially Germany and Poland, still rely heavily on coal to produce electricity. On Thursday, former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg announced he is donating $50 million to encourage countries outside the United States to move away from coal. Bloomberg has already spent $64 million to campaign against the use of coal in America. \"

This year's conference is particularly significant for a climate-vulnerable country like Bangladesh as it is being presided over by Fiji, an island nation that is itself highly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. Last year's conference was criticised for neglecting the critical need for funds allocated to vulnerable and developing nations struggling to cope up with climate change. Many of the countries most affected by climate change are in this perilous situation through no fault of their own. We don't have to look far. The people of Bangladesh have suffered and continue to suffer enormous loss and damage due to the climate change caused by industrialised nations. But far from providing more support to vulnerable countries for mitigation and adaptation to climate change, industrialised nations are barely doing enough in their own countries. Germany, regarded as a leader in combating climate change, has done little to phase out coal and is likely to miss its own CO2 emissions reduction target for 2020. And the United States, the country with the second highest carbon emissions in the world, pulled out of the Paris climate pact itself just earlier this year. It is time we demand more support from the so-called advanced nations whose activities over the past few centuries have gotten us into this mess. We hope that this year, with Fiji's presidency, we will see an improvement in that regard.

Highlighting the influence of cities Cities are under the spotlight this year at the UNs leading climate talks, with a dedicated Human Settlements Day and a day allocated to promoting Sustainable Development Goal 11 to make cities resilient, safe, inclusive and sustainable. Speaking at the Cities and Local Leaders Summit, Dr Joan Clos, UN Under-Secretary-General and UN-Habitat Executive Director, spoke about the enabling capacity of cities under the direction of the New Urban Agenda, signed one year ago at the Habitat III conference. The New Urban Agenda continually draws the link between climate action and environmental protection on the one hand and the transition to a more sustainable economy on the other, said Clos. Closing the Summit, actor and former Californian Governor, Arnold Schwartzenegger confirmed the influencing power of urban areas in the fight against climate change. Cities, states and regions hold tremendous power, especially when you work together, said Schwarzenegger. We are the laboratories of reform, we are the engines of innovation and we are where the action is. \"

More than 80 senior officers and agricultural experts from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka attended the inaugural session of the three-day conference in Hyderabad. ""The consultation will not only strengthen partnership among SAARC countries on climate resilient agricultural systems, but also cover research, economics and innovative policy towards climate smart agriculture in South Asia. ""A discussion on the UNFCCC decision on agriculture will also be held during the conference,"" an official statement said. The conference on ""Climate Resilient Agricultural Policies, Strategies and Programmes"" was inaugurated by Telengana Chief Secretary Shailendra Kumar Joshi, at ICAR-National Academy of Agricultural Research Management (NAARM). Joshi said that it was a unique opportunity to shape and strengthen the process, as well as global attention and action to support climate resilient agricultural systems and dependent communities. We, in South Asia, have many things in common in agricultural practices, food systems and therefore, there is a great opportunity to share our experiences towards effective adaptation to climate change, Joshi said. The regional consultation is also opportune because parties to the UNFCCC at CoP23 had put in place for the first time a joint work programme on climate change and agriculture, the Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture. SAARC accounts for one-fourth of the global population and around 67 per cent of its population lives in rural areas (as per 2014 statistics). Almost half of the workforce is employed in the agriculture sector and around 42 per cent of South Asia's landmass is under agricultural operation, the statement said. Much of the agricultural production in the region is undertaken by small holders and an average range of landholding in SAARC countries varies between 0.3 to 1.4 hectares. Agriculture plays a central role in South Asian economies, lives and livelihoods. Crops grown in the region are important, both for regional and global food security, it added. \"

We are witnessing the severe impacts of climate change throughout the world, said the Executive Secretary of UN Climate Change, Patricia Espinosa, at a press conference. Every credible scientific source is telling us that these impacts will only get worse if we do not address climate change and it also tells us that our window of time for addressing it is closing very soon, she added. We need to dramatically increase our ambitions, stressed the UNFCCC chief, outlining three priorities. First, all stakeholders - including governments, non-governmental organizations, businesses, investors and citizens must accelerate climate action by 2020. Second, she said, the international community must complete the Paris Agreement guidelines, or operating manual, to unleash the potential of the accord. Third, conditions must be improved to enable countries to be more ambitious in determining their own national policies to slow down global warming. At the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ) held last November under the leadership of Fiji, nations agreed to accelerate and complete their work to put in place the guidelines officially known as the Paris Agreement Work Programme (PAWP) at COP24 in Katowice, Poland next December. At this Bonn meeting, which will run through 10 May, Governments will start drafting texts to be finalized at COP24. Finishing off the operating manual is also necessary to assess whether the world is on track to achieve the goals of the historic Paris Agreement limiting greenhouse gas emissions, while pursuing efforts to keep the temperature rise to less than 1.5C. Throughout this year, countries will also focus on how they can scale up their climate ambition and implementation in the pre-2020 period. All countries share the view that climate action prior to 2020 is essential. UNEP GRID Arendal/Lawrence Hislop \"

""Hunger, poverty, and climate can be tackled together through approaches such as Climate-Smart Agriculture that recognize the critical linkages between sustainable agriculture and strategies that promote resource-use efficiency, conserve and restore biodiversity and natural resources, and combat the impacts of climate change,"" said Ren Castro, Assistant Director-General of the Climate, Biodiversity, Land and Water Department of FAO. Ultimately, the world needs to produce 50 percent more food to feed nearly 10 billion people in 2050, and to find a way to do so with only a quarter of current per capita carbon emissions, Castro noted. The online Climate-Smart Agriculture Sourcebook - Second Edition 2017 is the result of one of FAO's major areas of work that comes on the heels of the recently launched FAO's Climate Change Strategy. It comprises a wide range of knowledge and expertise to help guide policy makers, programme managers, academics, extension services and other practitioners make the agricultural sectors more sustainable and productive while also contributing to food security and lower carbon intensity. The second edition of the sourcebook adds new modules addressing climate change adaptation and mitigation, integrated production systems, knowledge-support systems for rural producers, the role of gender and how to improve implementation. Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) has garnered increasing attention. Some 32 countries, half of them Least-Developed Countries, and three-fourths of them in sub-Saharan Africa, specifically refer to CSA in their Nationally Determined Contributions to achieving pledges made under the Paris Agreement. Climate-Smart Agriculture is one of the approaches to steer the needed transformation in the world's agriculture and food systems in ways that are both productive and sustainable and contribute to adaptation to and mitigation of climate change. \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India290","Canada : California Governor Jerry Brown and Michael Bloomberg Launch ""America's Pledge""","July 14, 2017 Friday","TendersInfo","Today, California Governor Jerry Brown and Michael Bloomberg launched America's Pledge on climate change, a new initiative to compile and quantify the actions of states, cities and businesses in the United States to drive down their greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement. ""Today we're sending a clear message to the world that America's states, cities and businesses are moving forward with our country's commitments under the Paris Agreement - with or without Washington,"" said Governor Jerry Brown, who was recently named Special Advisor for States and Regions ahead of the United Nations' 23rd Conference of the Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP23 ). Building on this positive momentum, the America's Pledge initiative will for the first time aggregate the commitments of these and other ""non-Party actors"" in a report on the full range of climate-related activities across the whole of U.S. society. The process of developing America's Pledge will also provide a roadmap for increased climate ambition from U.S. states, cities, businesses and others, and will transparently demonstrate to the international community how and in which ways these entities can help the U.S. deliver on its pledge under the Paris Agreement. ""In the U.S., emission levels are determined far more by cities, states, and businesses than they are by our federal government - and each of these groups is taking action because it's in their own best interest,"" said Michael Bloomberg, the United Nations Secretary-General's Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change. ""Reducing emissions is good for the economy and good for public health. The American government may have pulled out of the Paris Agreement, but American society remains committed to it - and we will redouble our efforts to achieve its goals. We're already halfway there."" In 2015, during the lead-up to the Paris conference on climate change, the U.S. submitted its ""Nationally Determined Contribution"" committing to reduce emissions 26-28% against 2005 levels by 2025. Last weekend, the G20 Leaders' Declaration took note of the Trump Administration's decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, confirming that ""it will immediately cease the implementation of its current nationally-determined contribution"" while underscoring that ""the Leaders of the other G20 members state that the Paris Agreement is irreversible."" Through the America's Pledge initiative, Brown and Bloomberg will work to demonstrate continued climate leadership across U.S. society, and that subnational action can significantly reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions at a time of limited federal leadership. Commissioned by Brown and Bloomberg, the Rocky Mountain Institute and the World Resources Institute will jointly lead an inclusive analytical effort supporting America's Pledge, with involvement by a broad set of stakeholders to be announced later this year. In November, Brown and Bloomberg, along with other U.S. governors, mayors, and business leaders, will compile and showcase existing climate commitments of U.S. subnational and non-state actors at COP23 , to be hosted by the Government of Fiji in Bonn, Germany. In addition, the America's Pledge initiative will work to quantify the aggregate impact of these commitments on projected future emissions, comparing against both a business-as-usual (BAU) trajectory of projected greenhouse gas emissions under likely Trump Administration policies, and the U.S. Nationally Determined Contribution of 26-28% reductions against a 2005 baseline by 2025. Finally, the America's Pledge initiative will present a game plan for raising the bar and expanding the map when it comes to non-Party actors driving down U.S. emissions. This set of options, which will highlight the significant levers available to states, cities, and businesses to further reduce U.S. emissions, will serve as a playbook for enhanced ambition among U.S. climate leaders who are committed to meeting America's commitments under the Paris Agreement. ""I am convinced that to be effective, action to address climate change must be taken at all levels of society, including by mayors, governors, local leaders, chief executive officers and others,"" said United Nations Secretary-General Antnio Guterres. ""This is demonstrably not an issue that can be addressed by national governments alone. The effort to aggregate and quantify the actions of subnational authorities and non-Party stakeholders in the United States via 'America's Pledge' is welcome."" \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India291","Amidst US shadow, nearly 200 nations pledge climate action","November 18, 2017 Saturday","IANS-English","Bonn, Nov 18 -- Amidst the shadow of the US decision to pull out of the Paris Climate Change Agreement, nearly 200 nations on Saturday pledged to launch a process next year to start reviewing existing plans to limit greenhouse gas emissions A set of decisions to accelerate actions to minimise emissions ahead of 2020 included allocation of finance by the developed world and adopting climate adaptation policies. Stepping up climate risk insurance, Germany pledged additional $125 million to support provision of insurance to 400 more million poor and vulnerable people by 2020, in addition to the climate adaptation fund Germany's further contribution of 50 million euros. Climate experts told IANS the design for the 'Talanoa Dialogue', a process to take stock and test options for enhanced ambition during 2018, was one of the major outcome at the two-week negotiations that saw assembly of 197 country delegates. Talanoa is the Pacific tradition of decision-making based on respect and understanding to a negotiating process that has often lacked both. The countries endorsed the 'Talanoa dialogue', which will help countries and non-state actors push new boundaries for enhancing climate action, said an expert. ""Countries also came together on urgent action, pre-2020 ambition. As impacts have intensified and low carbon opportunities have grown, the demand for climate action has deepened. Creating space for this important discussion has been a crucial trust building process and bodes well for securing robust Paris rules by COP24 next year,"" the expert added. The common message from all sides at this conference has been that action to get on track towards the objectives of the Paris Agreement and to ultimately achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals is urgent, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Secretariat said. Pledging to continue with its commitments to minimize emissions, it said: ""Time is really running out and everyone simply must do much better together to drive climate action further and faster ahead now."" ""Above all, this means rapidly raising the current global ambition to act on climate change that is captured in the full set of national climate action plans (NDCs) which sits at the heart of the Agreement."" The two-week negotiations were aimed to take a number of decisions necessary to bring the 2015 Paris Agreement to life, including meaningful progress on the agreement to implement guidelines to keep global warming within 1.5 degrees Celsius with an aim to cut greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels. According to an environmental advocacy, the decision to maintain the Adaptation Fund under the Paris Agreement speaks to the necessary balance that the Paris regime requires in pursuing efforts to adapt and build resilience to impacts whilst the planet warms as countries decarbonise. ""The outcome is testament to countries' unwavering commitment to the Paris Agreement following the announcement of the US government's intent to withdraw. US non-state actors rose to the occasion, as the 'We Are Still In' coalition of businesses, cities, states, etc. showed that many parts of the US society remain in Paris,"" it said. The talks, however, missed many prominent issues like financial support for developing nations for cutting emissions and climate adaptation. Among the major announcements are funds to support the poorest and most vulnerable, whose plight has been brought into sharp perspective by this year's extreme weather, a UNFCCC spokesperson said. In the InsuResilience Initiative, additional $125 million from Germany will support provision of insurance to an additional 400 million poor and vulnerable people by 2020. According to recent estimates, only about 100 million people in developing countries and emerging economies are currently covered by climate risk insurance. Likewise, the climate adaptation fund exceeded its target with Germany's contribution of 50 million euros and Italy's contribution of seven million euros, which means the fund has now surpassed its 2017 target by over $13 million and stands at the equivalent of $93.3 million dollars. At Bonn, India reiterated provisions for finance -- both for adaptation and mitigation, technology transfer for climate actions from the developed nations. A day after a major victory for India and developing countries on climate action before 2020 that the developed world agreed to discuss in subsequent two years, India's Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Harsh Vardhan has said provisions for finance, technology transfer and capacity building support to developing nations are critical. Stressing that this Conference of Parties ( COP23 ) is crucial as it would set the stage for the 2018 Facilitative Dialogue, accelerate pre-2020 action and firm up the modalities for implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement, he said India has undertaken ambitious mitigation and adaptation action. The action is in the fields of clean energy, especially renewable energy; enhancement of energy efficiency; development of less carbon-intensive and resilient urban centers; and promotion of waste-to-wealth and efforts to enhance carbon sink through creation of forest and tree cover. On the demand of BASIC countries (Brazil, South Africa, India and China), Fiji, which was presiding over the conference, has also been asked to send letters to all the countries which are yet to ratify the Doha amendments to the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 to do so ""as soon as possible"".

Solar and wind power tariffs have dropped to an all-time low of Rs 2.44 per unit and Rs 3.46 per unit, among the lowest in the world.To supplement solar energy generation, India has distributed 28 crores LED bulbs in the last three years which have helped save $ 2 billion and 4 GW of electricity, the prime minister said.China is targeting over 360 GW of renewable capacity generation by 2022.The coming together of the solar allianceIn 2015, PM Modi had in a speech at London's Wembley Stadium proposed the idea of an inter-governmental organisation comprising of 121 countries, which lie either completely or partly between the two tropics, with an aim to promote solar energy.ISA was launched by him at the India Africa Summit in New Delhi and the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in October 2015 and November 2015, respectively.Today, heads of 23 nations and 10 ministerial representatives gathered here for alliance's first summit. The summit was co-hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron.ISA, headquartered in Gurgaon, is now a treaty-based inter-governmental organisation that was established following the Paris Declaration as an alliance dedicated to the promotion of solar energy among its member countries.As of now, 121 countries are associated with ISA, 61 have joined the alliance and 32 have ratified the Framework Agreement.

This comes as a wake-up call for India-the only major emitter to register a significant increase in GHG emissions. Among the emitters that make up nearly two-thirds of all global GHG emissions, Russia and the US managed to decrease their emissions by 2 per cent and Japan by 1.3 per cent. In Brazil and the UK, emissions reduced by over 6 per cent. Emissions from China and EU-member states saw no change from their levels in 2015. India and Indonesia, on the other hand, registered 4.7 and 6.4 per cent increases in their GHG emissions according to the report. The global slowdown in emissions has been attributed to the decreased use of fossil fuels especially coal, and the increasing popularity of renewables. Here too, India remains one of the few big emitters investing more in thermal power as coal consumption rose by 4 per cent in the country. According to the report, 2016 is essentially the second year in a row that emissions have remained more or less stagnant, notwithstanding the increase in non-CO2 GHGs. While this comes as a reason for cautious optimism in the run up to the COP23 in November, there is little clarity on how sustainable it is to keep carbon emissions static and how far or near we are to a tipping point in the earth's carbon budget scenarios.

"COP23","India","COP23_India296","Germany : New WFP Report Examines How Climate Change Drives Hunger","November 16, 2017 Thursday","TendersInfo","A compelling new report about the impact of climate change on global food security has been launched by the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) in partnership with the Government of Sweden. How Climate Change Drives Hunger was unveiled today at the 23rd UN Climate Change Conference - known as COP23 - which is being held in Bonn, Germany. The risk of hunger could increase by up to 20 percent due to climate change by 2050 unless increased efforts are made to enable the worlds most vulnerable communities to better adapt to extreme weather events such as drought and flooding. Drawing on such findings by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change, the report offers a wide-ranging review of multiple analyses into the impact of climate change on food security by WFP and partners. Climate change disproportionally affects the poorest and most food insecure people, said Gernot Laganda, Director of WFP Climate and Disaster Risk Reduction Programmes, at the launch of the report. Floods, storms and droughts are becoming more frequent and more intense, which is changing the way humanitarian organisations need to operate in the future. Understanding the way climate risks play out at country level is critical for effective response planning, but also helps us anchor community-based prevention and adaptation activities in country strategic plans. If countries remain stuck in a pattern of repetitive crisis response, but lack the planning and financing tools to take a more forward-looking approach to risk management, we will never achieve the Sustainable Development Goal of a world with zero hunger by 2030. Research for the report was undertaken by WFP under the Climate Adaptation Management and Innovation Initiative (C-ADAPT), launched in 2013 and funded by the Swedish Government. The assembled material provides an overview of major climate change and food security challenges, while outlining key policy and programming options available to governments and their partners. Country-specific analysis focuses on 15 nations that are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change: Afghanistan, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Mali, Nepal, Philippines, Senegal, Sudan, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Timor Leste and Uganda. \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India297","South Africa : Joint statement issued at the conclusion of the 25th BASIC Ministerial Meeting on Climate Change","November 15, 2017 Wednesday","TendersInfo","The 25th BASIC Ministerial Meeting on Climate Change was held in Bonn, Germany, the Headquarters of the UNFCCC, on 13 November 2017. The meeting was attended by H.E. Mr. Jos Sarney Filho, Minister of Environment of Brazil, H.E. Mr. Xie Zhenhua, Special Representative for Climate Change of China, H.E. Ms. Barbara Thomson, Deputy Minister of Environmental Affairs of South Africa, and H.E. Mr. C.K. Mishra, Secretary and Vice-Minister, Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change of India. BASIC Ministers welcomed the large number of ratifications of the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) achieved to date (169) and requested remaining parties to the UNFCCC to ratify the Agreement at an early date. Ministers reaffirmed that the Paris Agreement is a hard-won achievement by the international community which enhances the implementation of the Convention in the post-2020 period and strengthens the global response to climate change in the context of poverty eradication and sustainable development, reflecting equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances. Ministers reiterated that the global effort against climate change is an irreversible process that cannot be postponed. It offers valuable opportunities to promote sustainable development. In this regard, Ministers underlined BASICs highest political commitment to the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention, its Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement in all their aspects. Ministers urged all signatories to stay the course and maintain their support to the Paris Agreement for the good of all humankind and our future generations. Ministers highlighted BASICs willingness to work together with all Parties and stakeholders to promote global low greenhouse gas emissions, climate-resilient and sustainable development. Ministers pledged BASICs full support to the Fijian Presidency of COP 23 . They underlined the importance of COP 23 to prepare the ground towards the completion of the work related to the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Ministers reiterated that the work on both the pre-2020 and post-2020 should be in full accordance with the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. They also emphasised the importance of openness, transparency, inclusiveness and the Party-driven nature of the negotiations. The Ministers recalled BASIC's request captured in the COP 22 report for pre-2020 issues to be given equal treatment at COP-23 . Ministers further underlined that COP 23 should accelerate the implementation of pre-2020 commitments and actions, including addressing this issue under a dedicated COP Agenda Item. Ministers expressed BASICs willingness to continue working constructively with other Parties to adopt balanced and meaningful outcomes, in 2018, related to the implementation of the Paris Agreement in the post-2020 period. With the aim of accomplishing this task, they underscored the need for advancing textual negotiation in order to produce a comprehensive, party-driven negotiating text covering all the matters related to the implementation of the Paris Agreement at COP 23 that can serve as the basis for negotiations in 2018, reflecting all Parties views and inputs in a balanced manner. It is important to ensure that the COP-23 outcome captures the range of views as a set of alternatives and that the draft guidance operationalizes equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC), while not reinterpreting the Paris Agreement. Ministers affirmed that the outcomes in 2018 of the work related to the implementation of the Paris Agreement should be comprehensive and balanced, reflect differentiation, the nationally determined nature of Parties contributions, and flexibility for developing countries. Ministers reiterated that, as nationally determined contributions to the global response to climate change, Parties efforts should cover mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation, taking into account differentiated responsibilities and obligations of developed and developing country Parties under the Convention and Paris Agreement. The guidance being developed under the Paris Work Program should assist Parties with the preparation and communication of their NDCs, while respecting the nationally determined nature of Parties contributions. Ministers emphasised that adaptation is an issue that requires an urgent global response, and reiterated the importance of both the global adaptation goal and of the adaptation communication as a component of Parties NDCs in achieving the purpose of the Paris Agreement. Ministers emphasised the importance making progress to define the information and methodologies and approaches to generate such information. They urged developed countries to provide adequate support to developing countries in meeting the cost of their adaptation actions. Ministers noted the extent to which developed countries will provide sustained, predictable and adequate finance, technology development and transfer and capacity-building support to developing countries will determine the extent to which developing countries are able to contribute their highest possible ambition towards addressing the global challenge of climate change. \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India298","IEA Recognises Coal's Continuous Importance to Global Energy Needs","November 14, 2017 Tuesday 6:30 AM EST","Contify Energy News","Nov. 14 -- The World Coal Association (WCA) has welcomed the International Energy Agency's (IEA) recognition that coal will continue to play a vital role in the global energy mix. In its latest World Energy Outlook (WEO) 2017 report, coal remains the single largest source of electricity generation through to 2040 at 26%. India and Southeast Asia will be the driving force of demand for coal in the decades to come. Commenting on the report, Benjamin Sporton, Chief Executive of the World Coal Association says:  It is clear that coal will continue to play a crucial role in global energy supply. In all its scenarios, the IEA notes coal's continuous importance, that's why the WCA is urging countries using coal to do so with the cleanest and most efficient low emission coal technologies available.  In line with emissions reduction, the report notes increased efficiencies of coal-fired power plants around the world which have resulted in significant reductions in CO2 emissions.  It is not surprising that the IEA projects that three-quarters of all new coal plants entering into operation over the next 25 years will use either supercritical or ultra-supercritical technology. We at the WCA have been advocating for this and it's why we set up the global Platform for Accelerating Coal Efficiency (PACE) to help raise the global average efficiency of coal-fuelled power plants and, in effect, to minimise CO2 emissions. Increased levels of financing could lead to even greater levels of coal efficiency and therefore further reductions in emissions.  Ultimately though, as the report points out, CCS will be critical to global climate objectives and will play an important role in ensuring a sustainable future for coal.  The report points out the need to accelerate the deployment of CCS to ensure it becomes commercially viable.  Coal producers are important stakeholders in driving CCS deployment and have worked to enhance the deployment and commercialisation of CCS through initiatives such as Australia's COAL21 Fund. We alone cannot drive commercialisation, we need enhanced partnerships - that's why I have been calling for greater CCS ambition at COP23 in Bonn. Source: World Coal Association \"

The study, released on Wednesday, however, said the average world temperatures are still on track to rise far above the key goal set in the 2015 Paris Agreement of limiting warming to ''well below'' two degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-1990 levels. The Carbon Action Tracker (CAT) report, by three independent European research groups, said current policies would help limit global warming at 3.4 degrees Celsius (6.1 Fahrenheit) by 2100, down from 3.6 degrees (6.5) it predicted a year ago. ''This is the first time since the CAT began tracking action in 2009 that policies at a national level have visibly reduced its end of century temperature estimate,'' it said. China is set to over-achieve its pledge under the Paris Agreement to peak its carbon emissions by 2030, it said. And India was also making progress to limit a surge in emissions driven by more coal use. A rise of 3 degrees Celsius (5.4F) in average global temperatures could cause loss of tropical coral reefs, Alpine glaciers, Arctic summer sea ice and even an irreversible melt of Greenland's ice that would drive up world sea levels, according to a UN science panel. ''It is clear who the leaders are here: in the face of US inaction, China and India are stepping up,'' said Bill Hare of Climate Analytics, one of the research groups. US President Donald Trump does not believe that climate change is caused by man-made greenhouse gas emissions, a convenient excuse for promoting US fossil fuel industry. And despite a slowing of emissions growth in India and China, global emissions are growing. In India, however, the government has done little to stop the use of coal, which is the main source of air pollution. COP23 \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India301","Canada : Governor Brown Discusses Climate Action with German Federal Minister for the Environment","June 12, 2017 Monday","TendersInfo","Within hours of expanding California's climate partnership with China and other world leaders in Beijing, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. met with German Federal Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety Barbara Hendricks to further California's leadership on climate change in the wake of the U.S federal government's retreat. ""China and Germany - two of the most powerful countries in the world - are working with California and with other states to deal with climate change,"" said Governor Brown. ""The current withdrawal from the Paris Accord by the Washington administration is being overcome and countermanded by people throughout the whole world."" ""The United States' withdrawal from the Paris Agreement underscores the significance of subnational actors in particular in our joint efforts to achieve the overall objective and goals,"" said Minister Hendricks. ""Together with California, Germany will provide strong leadership for the Under2 Coalition in the COP23 in Bonn this November."" California and Germany have a strong record of working together to take action on climate change. In 2015, California and the German state of Baden-Wrttemberg formed the Under2 Coalition - an international pact among cities, states and countries to limit the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius, the level of potentially catastrophic consequences - to help galvanize subnational action in the lead up to COP21. The Federal Republic of Germany endorsed the Under2 MOU in 2015 and the German states of Bavaria, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia, Schleswig-Holstein and Thuringia have also joined the coalition. The Under2 Coalition now includes 175 jurisdictions on six continents collectively representing more than 35 countries, 1.2 billion people and $28.8 trillion GDP - equivalent to over 16 percent of the global population and over 39 percent of the global economy. Eighteen U.S. jurisdictions have joined the coalition, representing 89 million people and 28 percent of the U.S. population. Following their meeting in San Francisco today, the Governor and Minister Hendricks issued a joint statement on climate cooperation, highlighting the importance of California's leadership in curbing greenhouse gas emissions and emphasizing that climate change action is not only a necessity but also an opportunity for economic growth. Today's meeting comes on the heels of Governor Brown's week-long California-China Climate Mission, during which the Governor strengthened California's long-standing climate and clean energy ties with the nation through bilateral meetings - including with President Xi Jinping and China's Special Envoy on Climate Change - as well as agreements with China's national government through the Ministry of Science and Technology in Beijing and with the leaders of Sichuan and Jiangsu provinces. Also during the mission, the California Energy Commission signed a clean technology pact with Haidian District and the Regents of the University of California and Tsinghua Holdings, a subsidiary of Tsinghua University, announced a partnership to develop the California-China Clean Technology Funds. Last week, in response to President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, Governor Brown joined New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Washington State Governor Jay Inslee to form the U.S. Climate Alliance, which has since grown to 13 U.S. states committed to achieving the U.S. goal of reducing emissions 26-28 percent from 2005 levels and meeting or exceeding the targets of the federal Clean Power Plan. The U.S. Climate Alliance complements the goals of the Under2 Coalition, which climate alliance co-chairs New York and Washington State and six other members have also joined. California, the sixth-largest economy in the world, has advanced its nation-leading climate goals while also growing the economy. In the last seven years, California has created 2.3 million new jobs - outpacing most of the United States - cut its unemployment rate in half, eliminated a $27 billion budget deficit and has seen its credit rating rise to the highest level in more than a decade. In March, Governor Brown reaffirmed California's commitment to exceed the targets of the Clean Power Plan and the state's efforts to curb carbon pollution, which include establishing the most ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in North America and the nation's toughest restrictions on destructive super pollutants. The Governor has also signed legislation that directs cap-and-trade funds to greenhouse gas reducing programs which benefit disadvantaged communities, support clean transportation and protect natural ecosystems. This action builds on landmark legislation the Governor signed in October 2015 to generate half of the state's electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and double the rate of energy efficiency savings in California buildings. Governor Brown has also committed to reducing today's petroleum use in cars and trucks by up to 50 percent within the next 15 years; make heating fuels cleaner; and manage farm and rangelands, forests and wetlands so they can store carbon. Governor Brown attended the United Nations' 2015 Climate Conference (COP21) in Paris and later this year will attend the COP23 in Bonn, Germany to represent subnational jurisdictions that remain committed to climate action. The Governor has also traveled to the United Nations headquarters in New York, the Vatican and the Climate Summit of the Americas in Toronto, Canada to call on other leaders to join California in the fight against climate change. \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India302","Climate scientists warn of unprecedented risks to humanity","December 20, 2017 Wednesday","Kashmir Times (India)","Jammu, Dec. 20 -- Scientists are warning of a profound impact on human health and migration, leading to civil unrest and conflict. In a new statement to national representatives meeting in Bonn for the annual climate talks widely known as COP23 , scientists said that Earth is approaching tipping points that threaten human security. The warning that Planet Earth is coming close to a critical situation - when a series of small climate changes would become significant enough to cause havoc - comes as global emissions are projected to rise after three stable years. COP23 is an abbreviation for the 23rd session of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in the former West German capital city Bonn, from November 6 to 17. The statement, ""the 10 Science 'Must Knows' on Climate Change"", was presented to the UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa on November 13 and distributed to climate negotiators from around the world in Bonn. Professor Johan Rockstrom, executive director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre and Chair of The Earth League, an international network of scientists that co-produced the statement, said: ""There is no room for complacency. Climate change is here. It is dangerous. And it is about to get much worse."" ""In the last two years evidence has accumulated that we are now on a collision course with tipping points in the Earth system,"" he added, underscoring the need for rapid action. According to Dr. Amy Luers, executive director of Future Earth, ""The news that emissions are rising after the three year hiatus is a giant leap backwards for humankind."" ""Pushing Earth closer to tipping points is deeply concerning. Emissions need to peak soon and approach zero by 2050. Fortunately, we now have the tools to transition to a low carbon world while increasing energy security, improving human health, and strengthening economies,"" Luers added. Earth League member and director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, said: ""Some crucial climate-change facts tend to get lost in the noise of daily deliberations - even at an event such as the UN climate summit. It is important therefore to remind everyone of the very reason why ten thousand people meet in Bonn: ""unprecedented risk to humanity due to global warming, as revealed by science,"" he said. ""This must be the starting point for re-thinking what in the past 70 years has become our culture of short-term convenience and consumption, a culture which eventually comes at the cost of the well-being of present and futures generations across the world,"" Schellnhuber added. The 10 Science Must Have's are: 1 - Much evidence suggests that the planet has entered a new geologic epoch-called the Anthropocene. The rate of change of the Earth system is accelerating as a result of humans' impact on the planet's biology, chemistry, and physics. Earth's climate has been remarkably stable since before the dawn of civilization. This stability is at risk. 2 - Earth is approaching critical ""tipping points"". By crossing these thresholds, the planet may see abrupt, and possibly irreversible, shifts in the workings of the Arctic, Amazon, and other parts of the globe. 5 - The economic costs of climate change are already being felt, and the some of the world's poorest nations are bearing the heaviest burden. 6 - Climate change will have a profound impact on human health by placing new pressures on the food and water security in nations around the world. 7 - Climate change is likely to exacerbate migration, civil unrest and even conflict. In 2015, more than 19 million people globally were displaced by natural disasters and extreme weather events, and climate change will likely cause that number to grow. 8 - The world needs to act fast: If humans continue to emit greenhouse gases at current rates, the remaining carbon budget to reduce risk of exceeding the 2 degrees Celsius target will be exhausted in around 20 years. Emissions should peak by 2020 and approach zero by around 2050 if the world is serious about reducing risk. As a simple rule of thumb, this means halving global emissions every decade. 9 - A fossil-fuel free society is economically attractive: renewable energy sources increasingly compete with fossil fuels, even when these are priced at historic lows. Moreover, the estimated costs of inaction range from 2-10% of GDP by 2100 by some estimates, to a fall in projected global output by 23% in 2100 in others. 10 - Even if the world meets the Paris Agreement targets, communities across the globe will still need to build resilience and adapt to the changes already under way. -( Third World Network Features).

"COP23","India","COP23_India303","United Kingdom : Funding for 84 million for artificial intelligence and robotics research and smart energy innovation announced","November 9, 2017 Thursday","TendersInfo","More than 68 million of investment from the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund for robotics and artificial intelligence projects aimed at improving safety in extreme environments has been announced by the government. This investment will develop robots and artificial intelligence able to take on jobs in the freezing depths of the North Sea, dealing with extreme environments in the process of nuclear energy production, the hostile vacuum of space, and heat of deep mining. In her keynote speech to the Innovate UK Conference in Birmingham today (8th November), Climate Change and Industry Minister Claire Perry set out how British experts and innovators are leading the world in this new sector, receiving support from the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund. The government is working with business and academia in order to encourage investment in robotics and artificial intelligence a priority area of the Industrial Strategy. Almost 45 million will be used to set up four new research hubs based at the University of Manchester, University of Birmingham, University of Surrey and Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. The centres of excellence, managed by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), will be responsible for developing robotic technology to enable safer working environments in space and deep mining and the hazardous and harsh environments of nuclear energy and off-shore wind. As well as receiving government investment, the four hubs will be supported by 52 million of industry support from commercial and international partners, and UK Space Agency is co-funding the University of Surrey hub. Next week, I will be at the COP23 conference in Germany, and it will be abundantly clear there that, if we want to truly make a difference to our climate as well as take advantage of the economic opportunities of our transition to a low carbon economy, it will come down to continued innovation. The investment announced by the Climate Change and Industry Minister today also includes: 4.3 million for the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) to fund five research projects at the National Oceanography Centre (NOC), and the Universities of Exeter and Southampton, to develop sensors capable of working in the oceans extreme conditions 16.5 million for a collaborative research and development competition, run by Innovate UK, with winners set to include more than 70 businesses, 13 universities and 10 research organisations funding of 3 million for 17 studies which focus on demonstrating how artificial intelligence can operate in extreme environments, following a separate competition run by Innovate UK. Professor Philip Nelson, Chief Executive of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, said: These new Robotics Hubs will draw on the countrys research talent to nurture new developments in the field of robotics and provide the foundations on which innovative technologies can be built. The resulting outcomes from this research will allow us to explore environments that are too dangerous for humans to enter without risking injury or ill-health. The Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund is helping us achieve a joined up approach to research, discovery and innovation. Ruth McKernan, Chief Executive of Innovate UK, said: These pioneering projects driven by the very best minds in UK research and industry exemplify the huge potential of what can be achieved through the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund and the long-term benefits for the UK economy. These are just the first competitions in robotics and AI, there will be further opportunities for businesses in the coming months. Professor Duncan Wingham, Chief Executive of the Natural Environment Research Council, said: These sensors will help us to better understand our oceans, helping us to manage them sustainably for the future. The projects will develop ambitious new technologies that work in hazardous and extreme environments, maintaining the UKs world-class status in marine robotics. Other industries, such as the water, aquaculture and industrial waste, are also likely to benefit from these technologies. Todays announcements follow the publication of the industry-led Made Smarter review, which predicted Britains manufacturing sector could unlock more than 450 billion over the next decade and create thousands of jobs if it successfully embraced digitisation, robotics and artificial intelligence. Alongside the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, BEIS has also been working with Professor Dame Wendy Hall and Dr. Jerome Pesenti to establish how to grow the UK can grow and support its burgeoning artificial intelligence sector. In April, the government announced 1 billion of investment through the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund for cutting-edge technologies to create jobs and raise living standards. Other areas receiving government support include cutting edge healthcare and medicine, battery storage and satellite and space technology. Ahead of attending climate change talks at COP23 in Germany next week, the Minister also announced 16 million for research into two new smart energy innovation competitions, which build on Governments ambition to fund over 2.5 billion in clean technology innovation, as set out in last months Clean Growth Strategy. \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India304","Nations begin drafting operating manual for climate action","May 1, 2018 Tuesday","UNI (United News of India)","United Nations, May 1 -- The latest round of United Nations climate change negotiations has begun to further develop the ""operating manual"" for implementing the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to keep temperature rises this century, well below 2 degrees Celsius. It took off on Monday in Bonn, Germany. ""We are witnessing the severe impacts of climate change throughout the world"", said the Executive Secretary of UN Climate Change, Patricia Espinosa, at a press conference. ""Every credible scientific source is telling us that these impacts will only get worse if we do not address climate change and it also tells us that our window of time for addressing it is closing very soon,"" she added. First, all stakeholders - including governments, non-governmental organisations, businesses, investors and citizens - must accelerate climate action by 2020. Second, she said, the international community must complete the Paris Agreement guidelines, or operating manual, to unleash the potential of the accord. Third, conditions must be improved to enable countries to be more ambitious in determining their own national policies to slow down global warming. At the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ) held last November under the leadership of Fiji, nations agreed to accelerate and complete their work to put in place the guidelines - officially known as the Paris Agreement Work Programme (PAWP) - at COP24 in Katowice, Poland next December. At this Bonn meeting, which will run through 10 May, Governments will start drafting texts to be finalized at COP24. Finishing off the operating manual is also necessary to assess whether the world is on track to achieve the goals of the historic Paris Agreement limiting greenhouse gas emissions, while pursuing efforts to keep the temperature rise to less than 1.5degC. Throughout this year, countries will also focus on how they can scale up their climate ambition and implementation in the pre-2020 period. All countries share the view that climate action prior to 2020 is essential.UNi XC-SNU 1653 Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from United News of India.

"COP23","India","COP23_India305","Blockchain-Based Currency to Promote Carbon Emission Reductions","December 5, 2017","India Engineering news","New Delhi Dec. 05 -- FoundationBlue Foundation, a Swiss-based foundation working to lead the transition to zero-emission cities by 2050, has announced the launch of the Bluenote. This new blockchain-based currency is intended to stimulate investment in zero-emission cities. The first Bluenote projects leveraging the blockchain platform will be investments in emission-reducing technology upgrades of commercial office buildings. The initial coin offering (ICO) for the Bluenote token sale has already launched for private investors and will be open to the public shortly. Thirty percent of global carbon dioxide emissions are caused by buildings and the electricity they consume. At the same time, energy-efficiency investments have been shown to be the least-expensive method of reducing CO2 emissions. The initial building retrofit projects will demonstrate how the platform can create new markets to identify, finance and implement replicable initiatives that achieve environmental, economic and social benefit. The Bluenote will operate on an open and transparent platform, allowing any number of ""Blue"" projects to upload their raw performance data and receive a community-verified calculation of the carbon-emission reduction or social impact - a permanent, tradable attribute that is traceable to its data source. The launch of Bluenote comes on the heels of recent discussions among international climate experts at the 23rd annual COP23 conference in Bonn, Germany, where the world's climate negotiators sounded a clarion call for major new investment in low-carbon strategies. Bluenote will fulfill the need articulated by the conference's attendees - in particular by unlocking the opportunity for $1.5 trillion in new climate investments each year in order to meet the goals of the Paris Accords. Private capital and markets have played a role in carbon emission reduction policies when outcomes are easy-to-measure - such as renewable energy-generation at its meter - but fail to take off when results are harder to measure. The Bluenote data-analysis platform will bridge this gap, leveraging the transparency and auditability of blockchain to help users streamline and even automate data analysis and gain insights to fuel and justify investments. Third parties will be able to develop other modules to analyze their own unique emission reduction projects. \"

The mega meet is now expected to be scheduled early next year, depending on availability of Macron and PM Narendra Modi. ISA is India's brainchild and is meant to bring 121 solar rich countries on a single platform to explore ways to utilise and promote solar energy. The alliance was jointly launched by PM Modi and the then French President Francois Hollande in Paris on November 30, 2015. Since France had been quite active on this Indian initiative to forge a global coalition to harness solar energy, India is keen to have Macron on board at ISAs inaugural summit. \\x93We have had discussion on the issue here with the French government's special envoy for implementation of ISA, S\'e9gol\'e8ne Royal. Fresh dates are being explored, keeping in mind the availability of PM Modi and President Macron. The summit is likely to be held early next year,\\x94 said Anand Kumar, secretary in the ministry of new and renewable energy, on Tuesday. Kumar said member countries had been proactively working on their solar goals and achieving the target of 1,000GW by 2030 would be a collective goal. The current installed global capacity of solar power is around 303GW, including 12GW in India. Nearly 75GW of solar power was added globally in 2016. India had in 2015 revised its solar power target from 20 GW to 100 GW by 2022. So far, 44 countries have signed the ISA framework agreement. \"

CMA CGM is becoming the first shipping company in the world to equip giant containerships with this type of motorisation, thus pursuing its firm commitment to the protection of the environment and to ocean conservation. The use of LNG is a real technological breakthrough that will yield significant benefits compared to heavy fuel oil: up to 25% less CO2 99% less fine particles 85% less nitrogen oxides emissions Moreover, the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI), which measures a ships environmental footprint, is improved by 20% compared to ships only propelled by fuel oil. These containerships will be LNG-powered a few percent of marine gas oil will only be used for the ignition in the combustion chamber. By choosing LNG, the CMA CGM Group goes beyond current and future regulations that limit the sulphur cap to 0.5% in 2020. The Group is also fully in line with the Paris Agreement and the ongoing discussions at the international level. An innovative and ambitious group engaged in the protection of our planet The CMA CGM Group is firmly committed to the reduction of its carbon footprint for the protection of the environment and the preservation of the oceans and biodiversity. Between 2005 and 2015, the Group has reduced its CO2 emissions per container transported per kilometer by 50% and has set up an ambitious plan to further reduce its CO2 emissions by 30% between 2015 and 2025. \"

India has supported the demand by a group of developing countries who want implementation of pre-2020 commitments of rich nations included in the agenda of the current climate conference - COP23 . The group, Like Minded Developing Countries, also demanded that developed countries must increase their ambition to re duce their carbon footprints. Making an intervention, which got everyone's attention on the first day of the conference on Monday, India chief negotiator Ravi Shankar Prasad said if (rich) nations don't follow decisions taken in previous COPs, what confidence do the others (developing countries) have that the decisions taken in this COP would be honoured? \\x93What kind of trust are we generating in the process itself ?\\x93 he asked. The pre-2020 actions refer to existing obligations under Kyoto Protocol where only rich nations are obliged to take mitigation (emission cut) actions, while the post-2020 actions are meant for all countries to take actions under Paris Agreement. In his intervention, Prasad called for early time-bound ratification of Kyoto Protocol (2013-20) by developed countries to ensure the highest possible mitigation efforts under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change by all countries.Pitching for including pre2020 actions in this COP's agenda, he said this agenda was of utmost importance for developing countries. India made yet another intervention and sought clarity on the issue of long-term finance.

This African Development Bank (AfDB) initiative is intended to help the 54 African countries fulfil their commitments under the Paris Agreement, in other words, to put their respective NDCs into action without neglecting their own development priorities. ""This platform is a response to requests made by various African countries,"" said Amadou Hott, AfDB vice president for electricity, energy, climate change and green growth, as he unveiled the new initiative to a gathering of Heads of State, ministers, policy makers and representatives of civil society, among others, from across the continent. It should be seen as an ""opportunity to accelerate investment in climate action in Africa through NDCs,"" he said, noting that it will facilitate ""better coordination among partners to provide a collective and effective response"", for and by the whole of Africa. This platform should be a catalyst for concessional funding for climate-related projects in Africa which will, in turn, help raise private finance. This is a most timely initiative, bearing in mind that, US$ 4 billion will be required to implement the NDCs, according to recent studies, While all 54 African countries signed the Paris Agreement, 43 have ratified it and 53 (the exception being Libya) have submitted their NDCs, 85% of which are conditional upon financial aid from abroad while only 15% are on the basis of domestic budgets. And Africa is already the poor orphan when it comes to world climate funding, capturing less than 5% of the total. Thus, the announcement of this new platform was warmly welcomed. To date, Africa NDC Hub has 10 partners other than AfDB: the African Union Commission (AUC), the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), the NEPAD Planning and Coordination Agency, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the International Institute for the Environment and Development (IIED) and the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India311","Industry, government commit to deforestation-free cocoa","December 6, 2017 Wednesday","Indian Food and beverages news","New Delhi, Dec. 06 -- At the United Nation's (UN) Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ), top cocoa-producing countries Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana have announced far-reaching Frameworks for Action with leading chocolate and cocoa companies to end deforestation and restore forest areas. Central to the Frameworks is a commitment to no further conversion of any forest land for cocoa production. The companies and governments pledged to eliminate illegal cocoa production in national parks, in line with stronger enforcement of national forest policies and development of alternative livelihoods for affected farmers. The two countries produce nearly two-thirds of the world's annual supply of cocoa, the main ingredient in chocolate and a range of other consumer products. The companies that have committed to the Frameworks for Action thus far are Barry Callebaut; Blommer Chocolate; Cargill Cocoa and Chocolate; CEMOI; Cococo Chocolatiers; ECOM Group; Ferrero; General Mills; Godiva Chocolatier; Guittard Chocolate; The Hershey Company; Mars Wrigley Confectionery; Meiji; Mondelez International; Nestle; Olam Cocoa; Sainsbury's; Toms Group; Touton; Tree Global; and J.H. Whittaker & Sons. Additional companies are soon expected to announce their commitment. Both countries have announced plans to introduce a differentiated approach for improved management of forest reserves, based on the level of degradation of the forests. Up-to-date maps on forest cover and land-use, as well as socio-economic data on cocoa farmers and their communities will be developed and publicly shared by the governments. The industry companies have agreed to put verifiable monitoring systems in place for traceability from farm to the first purchase point for their own purchases of cocoa, and will work with the governments of Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana to ensure an effective national framework for traceability for all traders in the supply chain. The governments and companies agree through the Frameworks to accelerate investment in long-term sustainable production of cocoa, with an emphasis on ""growing more cocoa on less land."" Key actions include provision of improved planting materials, training in good agricultural practices, and development and capacity building of farmers' organizations. Sustainable livelihoods and income diversification for cocoa farmers will be accelerated through food crop diversification, agricultural inter-cropping, development of mixed agro-forestry systems, and other income generating activities designed to boost and diversify household income while protecting forests. \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India312","United States : Smart Money Headed for Investments in Climate-Friendly Development, Secretary-General Tells Bonn Summit, Stressing Need for More Ambition","November 17, 2017 Friday","TendersInfo","Following are UN Secretary?General Antnio Guterres remarks at the high-level event on the twenty?third Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP23 ), in Bonn, Germany, today: I thank Prime Minister of Fiji, Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama for his remarks. And I want to congratulate him for his remarkable Presidency of COP23 . My sincere gratitude for the excellent work that Fiji, the Government of Fiji and yourself, Prime Minister, have done. And you are right. We need more ambition. We must go further and faster together. It is fitting that this years conference is led by Fiji, a nation on the frontlines. Last month I visited other small islands facing the impacts of a warming world: Antigua and Barbuda, and Dominica. The hurricanes damage was beyond belief. The catastrophic effects of climate change are upon us. And the voice of small island States that are on the frontlines of the impact of climate change must be the voice of us all. In the battlefield, when the frontline is decimated, the whole army is lost. And the same would happen to the planet with climate change. Floods, fires, extreme storms and drought are growing in intensity and frequency. Atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide are higher than they have been for 800,000 years. Climate change is the defining threat of our time. Our duty to each other and to future generations is to raise ambition. We need to do more on five ambition action areas: emissions, adaptation, finance, partnerships and leadership. First, reducing emissions. The latest UN Environment Programme Emissions Gap Report shows that current pledges will only deliver a third of what is needed to stay in the safety zones of the Paris Agreement on climate change . The Global Carbon Project reported earlier this week that 2017 will see the first increase in CO2 emissions in three years. The window of opportunity to meet the 2C target may close in 20 years or less and we may have only five years to bend the emissions curve towards 1.5C. We need at least a further 25 per cent cut in emissions by 2020. It is crucial for all countries to follow through on their Paris commitments. The agreement itself calls for raising ambition and so I urge you to use the 2020 revision of the nationally determined contributions to close the 2030 emissions gap. The second area for greater ambition is adaptation. Mitigation is essential, but climate change is already upon us and will only worsen in the short term. It is essential that we adapt and that we strengthen resilience. The Green Climate Fund can play a catalytic role on this, and I appeal to its members, especially donor nations, to bring this mechanism fully to life. I have also asked the UN system to promote adaptation and resilience efforts at the country level. I commend the 2015 pledge by G7 nations to provide insurance against extreme weather events for 400 million more vulnerable people by 2020. And I welcome the announcement here in Bonn, led by the Government of Germany, to fast?forward this ambition. The insurance industry itself has long sounded the alarm about climate change. The industry is keen to promote coverage for people at risk and it is pressing business and Governments alike to figure climate shocks into their planning, policies and operations. I will do everything to facilitate these efforts. Third, finance. Greater ambition on emissions, adaptation and resilience is inextricably linked to funding. We need to mobilize the agreed $100 billion annually for developing countries. Upholding this promise is essential for building confidence and trust. It is crucial for enabling all countries, but especially the most vulnerable, to face inevitable climate impacts and to grow their economies cleanly. In addition, markets can and must play a central role in financing a low-carbon, climate-resilient future. Yet, markets need to be reoriented away from the counterproductive and the short-term. In 2016, an estimated $825 billion were invested in fossil fuels and high-emissions sectors. We must stop making bets on an unsustainable future that will place savings and societies at risk. Earlier this year, a report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development showed that bringing together the growth and climate agendas could add 1 per cent to average economic output in the G20 countries by 2021. If we add the economic benefits of avoiding the devastation of climate change impacts, gross domestic product in 2050 would soar by 5 per cent. Infrastructure investment will be crucial. The world should adopt a simple rule: if big infrastructure projects are not green, they should not be given the green light. Otherwise we will be locked into bad choices for decades to come. Investing in climate-friendly development is where the smart money is headed. I welcome the initiative of President Emmanuel Macron to convene the One Planet summit next month to focus on financing. I will be working to scale up international financing in renewable and energy efficiency projects to reduce at least 1 gigaton or more of carbon emissions by 2020. The formation of a clean energy investment coalition, as proposed by Denmark, is an idea worth pursuing. \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India313","New Tool Maps World's Water Batteries: The Clean Storage Solution for Renewables","November 9, 2017 Thursday 6:30 AM EST","Contify Energy News","Nov. 9 -- More than 100 pumped storage hydropower projects totalling some 75 GW of new capacity are in the pipeline around the world, according to a new online resource launched today in Bonn, Germany. The new Hydropower Pumped Storage Tracking Tool - developed by the International Hydropower Association - maps the locations and vital statistics of existing and planned projects. According to the tracking tool, the 100 planned projects will increase existing global storage capacity by 50 per cent, from 150 GW to almost 225 GW. The first of these projects will come on line in 2018, and the majority will be operational by 2030. Known as the world's 'water batteries', pumped storage hydropower is the cleanest and most cost-effective form of energy storage existing today. It makes up more than 95 per cent of global energy storage, next to less than five per cent combined for thermal, electromechanical and electrochemical storage, including lithium batteries. The Hydropower Pumped Storage Tracking Tool is designed for policy-makers, investors and researchers. It shows the status of a pumped storage project, its installed generating and pumping capacity, and its actual or planned date of commissioning. Richard Taylor, Chief Executive of the International Hydropower Association, announced the tool at the COP23 climate conference in Bonn, Germany. ""Pumped storage is the cleanest battery on earth, simply cycling water between two water bodies at different elevations. It takes surplus electricity in the system and stores it for use when it is needed. Switching between modes of pumping and generating in seconds, it ensures that renewables generation is not curtailed in the electricity system, and supply and demand are harmonised."" Mr Taylor said. ""This tracking tool is the most comprehensive online resource of its kind. It shines a light on the enormous contribution of pumped storage to meeting the battery demands of clean energy systems, with very high efficiency."" The latest pumped storage technology offers essential ancillary services such as electric frequency control and voltage regulation, in order to ensure stable and reliable operation of power grids. Along with conventional hydro, it is also a leading solution for restarting a grid after a black-out. Source: International Hydropower Association \"

But salubrious weather might become a thing of the past if a recent report by the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, is anything to go by.The report submitted to the city municipal corporation recently predicts that Coimbatore is likely to witness a vast temperature variation by 2030. The minimum temperature which hovers between 19C and 24C will go up by 2C in the rural areas and 4C in urban areas. The minimum night temperature is also likely to go up more than the day temperature. Areas such as Sai Baba colony, R S Puram and Vadavalli that currently have abundant tree cover will also not escape from this phenomenon, said experts.This temperature rise is more or less in consonance with the global average which is predicted to increase by 2C by 2030. In the UN conference on climate change held in Paris in 2015, the countries agreed that they will work together to ensure that the temperature rise will be contained at 1.5C to protect vulnerable island states. And they set the absolute limit at 2C. In Coimbatore, experts said this temperature rise is primarily due to urbanization. Population explosion which in turn results in higher number of vehicles and there by emission of greenhouse gases will be major reasons. Factors like escalation in garbage generation, construction activities, industries, and subsequent reduction of green cover will aid in temperature increase. According to the study, nearly 40% of the GHG emissions will come from vehicles followed closely by industrial and construction sector that accounts for 29%. It was not just the temperature but also by 2050, there will be a 15% increase in rainfall that will be high intensity but will not be spread over a period. ""Almost a year's rainfall will be experienced in a few days. This will cause floods in cities,"" said professor and head of Agro climate research centre, S Panneerselvam. He added that every area in the city has its own infrastructure, soil composition, natural resources, urban spaces and green spaces that affect its climate. Geetha Lakshmi, another climate expert said that these predictions were highly theoretical and were based on various climate calculations made in the previous decades. ""It is a fact that the night temperature will increase a little above the day temperature due to the heat stress. And the urban areas will be most affected in future,"" she said. Bedo Shruthi, programme co-ordinator, sustainability, ICLEI (International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives) said that they conducted the climate risk assessment to implement measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. ""Cities consume two-thirds of the world's energy and account for more than 70% of the global Co2 emissions. By 2030, cities will house 60% of the global population which means that their greenhouse gas emission will also increase. So deployment of renewable energy, promoting clean energy, increasing forest cover, sustainable transport and climate resilient urban development will help mitigate problems faced by climate change,"" she said.

"COP23","India","COP23_India315","Caring for the planet starts with 'the ground we walk on;' UN says on World Soil Day","December 6, 2017 Wednesday","India Blooms","India, Dec. 6 -- ""Soil is the foundation of agriculture , it is where food begins,"" said Maria Helena Semedo, Deputy Director-General of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). ""Maintaining the soil's important functions and ecosystem services to support food production and increase resilience to a changing climate calls for sustainable soil management practices,"" she added. Soil organic matter, with carbon as its main component, is crucial to soil health and fertility, water infiltration and retention as well as food production. The world's soils act as the largest terrestrial carbon sink, reducing greenhouse gases. Intensifying its role could significantly offset the rapid rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In an historic decision on agriculture, the 2017 UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn ( COP23 ) recognized the need for improved soil carbon, soil health and soil fertility. The Global Soil Organic Carbon Map, the most comprehensive to date, illustrates the amount of organic carbon stock in the first 30 cm of soil - revealing natural areas with high carbon storage that require conservation along with regions where further sequestration would be possible. This information can prove a powerful tool to guide decision-making on practices aimed to preserve and increase the current soil carbon stocks - helping win the fight against climate change. The map shows that globally the first 30 cm of soil contains around 680 billion tons of carbon - almost double the amount present in our atmosphere. The degradation of one third of the world's soils has already prompted an enormous release of carbon into the atmosphere. Restoring these soils can remove up to 63 billion tons of carbon, significantly reducing the effects of climate change. FAO's Intergovernmental Technical Panel on Soils supported the map's development, including by putting together the national carbon maps of more than 100 countries, making a concrete contribution towards Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15, Life on Earth. The next step is for countries to monitor their national soil information systems for organic carbon levels to make evidence-based decisions on how to manage and monitor their soils.

The InsuResilience Global Partnership for Climate and Disaster Risk Finance and Insurance Solutions, launched today at the 2017 UN Climate Conference in Bonn, now brings together G20 countries in partnership with the V20 nations. The V20 is a group of 49 of the most vulnerable countries including small islands like Fiji which holds the Presidency of this years conference: COP23 . Germany has joined forces with its partners, the Ethiopian Chair of the V20, the United Kingdom and the World Bank, in order to launch this Global Partnership. ""The Global Partnership is a practical response to the needs of those who suffer loss because of climate change. And I am very proud that it has happened under Fijis Presidency of COP. At the same time, it is a means of preparing for a more resilient form of development for those who will have to adapt to the great challenge of climate change,"" said the COP23 President and Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama. Thomas Silberhorn, Parliamentary State Secretary to the Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development, announced support for the new global partnership of 125 million US dollars as part of todays launch. This follows the 30 million pounds Sterling commitment made by UK Government in July 2017 to the Partnership via its Centre for Global Disaster Protection. The announcement comes in the wake of a year of damaging and devastating extreme weather events that have hit countries and communities in Asia, the Eastern Caribbean and the Americas with some of the events described by scientists as unprecedented. The Global Partnership supports data and risk analysis, technical assistance and capacity building according to countries needs and priorities, solutions design of concrete risk finance and insurance solutions, smart support for the implementation for such schemes and monitoring and evaluation efforts. This will range from sovereign risk pools in the Pacific, Africa and the Caribbean. The insurance schemes focus on the meso and micro level benefitting smallholders, the urban poor and other vulnerable groups. The next phase, announced today under the Global Partnership, is aimed at meeting the pledge of providing cover and support to an extra 400 million vulnerable people by 2020 while the efforts of the Global Partnership go beyond that original G7 goal. The InsuResilience Initiative was launched in 2015 by the G7 group of nations under the German Presidency. Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the UN Climate Change Secretariat, said: ""People devastated by recent weather events and communities vulnerable to climatic impacts are looking to the nations meeting in Bonn for an answer, for support and hope for the future."" ""This new and higher ambition initiative represents one, shinning, example of what can be delivered when progressive governments, civil society and the private sector join hands with creativity and determination to provide solutions,"" she said. ""This Global Partnership brings important groups like the V20 group made up of those countries most vulnerable to climate change and the G20 group of the worlds strongest economies together around one table so that they can join forces to increase the resilience of poor and vulnerable people to the impacts of climate change. Instead of only reacting to catastrophes we want to shift to planning, preparing and protecting, said Thomas Silberhorn. The new Global Partnership comes as the UN Climate Change secretariat has also launched this week an online platform or Clearing House for Risk Transfer under the Paris Climate Change Agreement that will use artificial intelligence to connect countries seeking innovative insurance solutions with countries needing them. In July 2017, at their Summit in Hamburg, the G20 welcomed the creation of a Global Partnership for Climate and Disaster Risk Finance and Insurance Solutions. It is therefore known as the ""InsuResilience Global Partnership"". The aim of the Global Partnership is to increase the resilience of developing countries and protect the lives and livelihoods of poor and vulnerable people against the impacts of climate change and against natural disasters. Under the framework of the Global Partnership, key players from developing and industrialised countries, international organisations and development banks, the private sector, civil society and the scientific community will work together to develop concrete and practical solutions that will provide financial protection against climate risks and natural disasters. Innovative finance and insurance solutions for individual countries, which are tailored to the specific needs and challenges of poor members of the population in particular, are to be developed and implemented through the Global Partnership. The Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF), for example, is being supported with the help of InsuResilience. The most recent example of support was in September 2017, when more than 55 million US dollars were paid out to ten Caribbean countries within just 14 days after hurricanes Irma and Maria had wreaked disaster on the islands. The money was used in various ways, for example to quickly buy urgently needed medicines and to build emergency shelters for the people affected by the storms. In Zambia, InsuResilience supports the NWK Agri-Services cotton company, which offers direct weather and life insurance to small contract farmers. In 2015, some 52,000 farmers decided to buy insurance. Following a major drought in 2016, more than 23,000 farmers received payments. On the one hand, the Partnership is meant to enable governments to react faster and more specifically following a natural disaster. \"

""Low carbon livestock is possible,"" he said on the margins of the Conference of the Parties ( COP23 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Agriculture accounts for a large share of greenhouse gas emissions but is also the ""most exposed of all economic sectors to the effect of climate change,"" Graziano da Silva said. He noted that adverse effects disproportionately burdened the world's poorest and most vulnerable people, most of whom live in rural areas relying on farming, forestry and fisheries for their livelihoods. He spoke at a side event held by the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, a voluntary partnership of 122 governments, intergovernmental organizations and non-governmental organizations committed to improving air quality and protecting the climate through actions to reduce short-lived climate pollutants. Short-lived climate pollutants such as methane, hydrofluorocarbons and soot can provide for up to 0.9 degrees Celsius in avoided warming by 2050, making a significant contribution to the target of the Paris Agreement, according to CCAC. Methane and mitigation Almost two-thirds of the poorest rural households raise and rely on livestock. ""With improved and climate-smart practices, we can quickly achieve more sustainable, greener' livestock supply chains,"" Graziano da Silva said. Reducing enteric methane emissions is one of the most cost-effective climate change mitigation strategies, linking it to increased productivity and improved food security is a natural and urgent action, he said. Short-lived climate pollutants carry greater global warming potential, and reducing them has an accelerated impact compared to carbon dioxide. Greening the livestock sector can lead to ""fast wins while contributing to adaptation, sustainable development and food security"", Graziano da Silva added, noting that FAO and its partners stand ready to assist countries worldwide to achieve such wins. FAO is working with the Climate and Clean Air Coalition on reducing enteric methane emissions in Latin America, South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India318","India, Pakistan held NSA-level talks in Thailand in December: MEA","January 12, 2018 Friday","MINT","New Delhi, Jan. 12 -- India on Thursday confirmed that its national security adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval met his Pakistani counterpart Nasser Khan Janjua in Thailand last month. Indian foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar said that the engagement was not contrary to India's stated position that talks with Pakistan could not continue as long as Islamabad supported anti-India terrorist groups. ""India and Pakistan have a dialogue process and we have said terror and talks cannot go together. However, there are other dialogue mechanisms like at the DGMO (Directors General of Military Operations) level or between the BSF (Border Security Force) and Pakistan Rangers,"" Kumar told reporters in New Delhi on Thursday. ""Similarly, the NSA-level engagement is part of operational-level talks. We have said terror and talks cannot go together, but talks on terror can definitely go ahead,"" Kumar said. This engagement was not the resumption of talks, he clarified. The confirmation of the NSA-level engagement comes almost two weeks after news reports said the two NSAs had met in Thailand. India and Pakistan have not held official level talks since 2013. Efforts to revive the official dialogue process took place immediately after the Narendra Modi government came to office in 2014. Modi invited the heads of government of all South Asian countries for his inauguration on 26 May 2014, including then prime minister Nawaz Sharif. Efforts to get the talks on track failed in 2014 after Pakistan insisted that its then foreign minister Sartaj Aziz would meet the leaders of the Kashmiri separatist Hurriyat Conference in New Delhi prior to holding talks with Indian officials. In 2015, Modi tried to re-engage Pakistan by sending foreign secretary S. Jaishankar on a visit to all South Asian capitals including Islamabad. Modi met Sharif in the Russia city of Ufa on the sidelines of a regional meet and later on the sidelines of the UN conference on climate change in Paris. This was followed by a visit to Pakistan by foreign minister Sushma Swaraj for a conference on Afghanistan in December 2015. Modi also visited Pakistan in a surprise stopover on 25 December, 2015, on his way back from Russia and Afghanistan. This was the first visit by an Indian prime minister to Pakistan in a decade. During Modi's Pakistan visit, it was decided that the foreign secretaries of India and Pakistan would meet in January 2016 and decide on a calendar for re-engagement. But a terrorist attack on India's Pathankot air force station in January-days after Modi's visit and before the foreign secretary talks-put paid to that effort. Pakistan's arrest of an alleged Indian spy on changes on charges of inciting violence in Baluchistan and more terrorist attacks on military installations ensured that the talks remained suspended in 2016. Last year too, there was no movement on India-Pakistan talks though in December, The Indian Express reported that Doval had met his counterpart in Thailand.

With these extra resources, Belgium wants to help the most vulnerable countries to become more resilient against the impact of climate change. The programs and projects of the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) aim to increase the resilience of vulnerable communities in least developed countries against drought, floods, violent storms and other consequences of global warming. The LDCF has made available 1 billion USD to vulnerable countries through more than 250 projects in 51 countries. With this money more than 4.8 billion USD for climate actions was mobilized. Short term demand still exceeds however available resources. Most vulnerable countries amongst the first affected With this new contribution, Belgium wants to send a positive signal over its strong support to this fund and towards the most vulnerable countries. These countries, which are already particularly vulnerable, are often also amongst the first affected by the concrete consequences of climate change. This new financing enables the Global Environment Facility (GEF), which manages the LDCF, to invest in a number of new projects. These include for example innovations in agriculture, national adaptation plans and the build-up of resilience against climate change and natural disasters. Appreciation for Belgiums support GEFs CEO and Chairperson Naoko Ishii welcomes this new contribution from Belgium: recent weather disasters have shown all too clearly the negative impact of climate change on the poorest and most vulnerable countries and communities. I wish to thank Belgium for its additional contribution to the LDCF and commitment for adaptation measures. Belgium is an important contributor to the LDCF. Belgium has contributed a total of 87.44 million EUR to the LDCF since 2009. Other international climate financing of the Belgian federal and regional governments are channeled through contributions to international climate funds such as the Green Climate Fund and the Adaptation Fund, through the Belgian Investment Company for Developing Countries (BIO) and several bilateral programs and projects in our partner countries. \"

While there has been progress on the Paris rulebook and the design of next years stocktake of collective climate action efforts (the Talanoa Dialogue), the issue of pre-2020 climate action has emerged as the most contentious aspect of COP23 in Bonn. Greenpeace International Executive Director Jennifer Morgan said: Developing countries are rightfully concerned about pre-2020 climate action and developed countries need to show good faith by giving the issue the space it needs to discuss how to ratchet up our efforts. Emissions need to peak by 2020 at the latest. This means pre-2020 climate action is critical if were to limit global warming to the 1.5 degrees. We have a small window of opportunity and the sooner we act, the better. Germany has targeted a 40% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, but will fall far short of its target unless it ends its reliance on coal. Greenpeace is demanding Merkel signal a full coal phase out in the new coalition government agreement. Merkel cannot truly call herself a friend of the Pacific is she fails to meet her commitments at home. The time for climate sweet talk has ended. Merkel must present a plan on how to reach and go beyond the 2020 targets, Morgan added. In a year marked by a spate of destructive hurricanes, drought and floods, climate vulnerable Fiji is presiding over this years climate talks in Bonn, placing heightened focus on the threat of rising seas and extreme weather. The climate talks also coincide with new figures from the Global Carbon Project revealing CO2 emissions are expected to rise this year by about 2 % after three years of zero growth due to the slower pace of emissions cuts in the EU and US and (anomalous) higher emissions in China.We are making progress, but not fast enough. We must do more. Developing countries are right to raise the issue of pre-2020 action. All stakeholders need to pull together, Morgan said. Bonn is another crucial step in the path and all eyes are on Chancellor Merkel. The US non-state actors have shown the true face of America by their commitment to climate action here in Bonn. Merkel and others, like the EU and China, now need to do the same, Morgan said. \"

The high-level meeting to be chaired by FAO Director-General Jos Graziano da Silva will take place ahead of the Pacific leaders' participation at the UN Climate Conference COP23 in Bonn. While in Rome, the Pacific leaders will also meet Pope Francis and the Italian President Sergio Mattarella. Like many other people living in Small Island Developing States, Pacific islanders' lives are severely affected by the impacts of climate change and frequent natural disasters. At the same time many also face chronic malnutrition and other problems associated with poor diets including rising obesity. Poor diets, in turn, are influenced by existing food systems that determine availability, affordability, convenience and desirability of various foods across the regions. Pacific states also face other threats to their food security and nutrition stemming from factors such as rapid urban population growth, land degradation and decreasing food production, erosion of crop genetic diversity, coastal and coral degradation and declining productivity of fisheries. These problems are often compounded by breakdowns in traditional social safety nets.

"COP23","India","COP23_India322","Silence on US at Bonn","November 13, 2017 Monday","The Telegraph (India)","Bonn: India has decided not to criticise the US at the COP23 climate summit here for pulling out of the 2015 Paris Agreement, marking a toning down of its aggressive policy from its UPA days. Multiple Indian sources told The Telegraph that a decision had been taken at the highest level not to attack the US at Bonn for fear of annoying President Donald Trump. ""Why should we criticise the US or any other country directly? We'll only showcase our achievements on the climate front,"" an Indian official and climate-change negotiator told The Telegraph. ""India should be seen as constructive, not as an obstructionist."" India was often tagged ""obstructionist"" at earlier summits when it accused the developed countries of inaction on climate change. New Delhi's current reticence comes at a time leading US Democrats have descended on Bonn to condemn Trump's decision to pull Washington out of the Paris Agreement. A few days ago, India's environment minister Harsh Vardhan had indicated that New Delhi would only ""talk about our achievements"". ""You have to understand geopolitics. It's a very fluid situation, and India does not want to get into a hitch (sic) with the Trump government considering the China and Pakistan factors,"" an Indian official said. Environmental analysts say that India's silence on the US pullout wouldn't help the negotiations at Bonn. The ongoing summit aims to find ways of bolstering the implementation of the Paris Agreement, which seeks to cut greenhouse gas emissions to prevent global temperatures from rising more than 2AC above pre-industrial levels. ""This policy of criticising none, particularly the US, and just showcasing our own achievements will not take India far on the negotiation table,"" said Chandra Bhushan, a climate expert from the Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment. ""With the US quitting the Paris Agreement, and the European Union reluctant, India should have played a much more proactive role in global climate politics."" America's Democrats, in contrast, ripped into Trump's climate policy at several events over the weekend in Bonn. On Saturday, California governor Jerry Brown and former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg led a team of US politicians, city representatives and businessmen to pledge support for the Paris Agreement at a meeting at the US climate action pavilion. ""One man cannot decide the future of America and humanity,"" a member of Brown's team told this newspaper. ""We cannot shirk our responsibility to counter emissions."" \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India323","United States : Secretary-General, Business Leaders Identify Sectors for Aggressive Climate Action, Implementation of Paris Agreement","September 21, 2017 Thursday","TendersInfo","United Nations Secretary-General Antnio Guterres and global leaders from local governments, the private sector and civil society agreed to accelerate efforts on climate action and to implement the Paris Agreement at a meeting during the United Nations General Assembly high-level week. The discussions herald a new phase in efforts aimed at mobilizing and scaling up transformative action that will allow the world to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change. They also recognize that the coalitions that have come together to develop and adopt the Paris Agreement must now shift their focus to implementation. Leaders identified a set of sectors to aggressively push for low carbon pathways which included technology, the transition to cleaner energy, setting a realistic price on carbon and insurance, reducing the risks from disasters and the impacts of climate change. The meeting was part of a series of informal discussions organized by the Secretary-General with world leaders, from both Government, private sector and non-governmental organizations, to forge alliances between Governments and business for implementing the Paris Agreement in the run-up to a Summit he will hold in 2019. The Secretary-General will also meet with a group of Heads of State and Government on climate issues on Tuesday. Among those attending the meeting were California Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr.; Michael R. Bloomberg, United Nations Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change; former United States Vice-President Al Gore; Climate Champion Hakima el Haite, Morocco; Inia Seruiratu, Climate Champion, Fiji; Patrick Pouyanne, CEO of Total; Safa al Jayoussi, Executive Director of the non-governmental organization IndyAct, Jordan; and Manual Pulgar Vidal, from the World Wide Fund for Nature. The Secretary-General applauded the efforts of Mr. Bloomberg including with the Global Covenant of Mayors, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and the Americas Pledge initiative to lead efforts driving climate action across a wide range of society. I will lean on him as my Special Envoy to accelerate and deepen the role of sub-national actors in the implementation of the Paris Agreement in preparation of the 2019 Climate Summit. Addressing climate change requires leadership from the groups that have the most direct connection to emissions cities, regions and businesses, said Mr. Bloomberg. I look forward to supporting the Secretary-General as the United Nations brings these non-national actors to the table to drive even more ambitious climate action. Climate change, if unchecked, threatens all humanity, said California Governor and United Nations Climate Change Conference Special Adviser for States and Regions Edmund G. Brown, Jr. California, with purpose and resolve, will join with the rest of the world to decarbonize the economy. Mr. Gore said: ""We are still behind where we should be in solving the climate crisis, but we see the path forward. Mobilizing and engaging local, state and regional governments, businesses and investors and community organizers in the implementation process of the Paris Agreement is absolutely essential. Mayor Stephany Uy-Tan of Catbalogan, Philippines, welcomed the initiative to engage representatives from non-party entities. Its good to know that youre not alone in pushing for lower emissions. We cannot do this alone. This helps us move faster for our constituents and to help the lives of our people. Safa al Jayoussi, the Executive Director of the non-governmental organization IndyAct in Jordan, said: Getting all the actors in the same room as the Secretary-General is extremely important to us. It is really important as civil society to have our voices heard. The destruction and loss of life due to extreme weather events, such as the recent storms that ravage the Caribbean region and South Asia, have added an additional impetus for action. Mr. Guterres said: We count the costs in lives, livelihoods and damaged economies. Since 2008, some 20 million people a year have been forcibly displaced by floods, storms, fires and extreme temperature. Climate change is not a distant problem for future generations, Mr. Guterres said. It is here, now, and we need to deal with it. He added that Governments alone cannot handle the enormity of the challenge. The Secretary-General said the commitments under the Paris Agreement are still insufficient to limit global temperature rise to well under 2C. There is at least a 14 Gigaton gap, he said. That is why I asked you here today. We can change this situation. I hope, together, we can emphatically bend the emission curve by 2020. The Secretary-General called for boosting efforts to mobilize financing and creating bankable projects, and to intensify efforts in high-impact areas, such as in key areas that will result in the largest emission decreases and greatest efforts to build resilience to the more intense storms and impacts of climate change. This informal dialogue was the first concrete step towards the Secretary-Generals Climate Summit in 2019, the dialogue will focus on engaging Heads of State and Government for enhancing leadership and building informal coalitions in key areas, as well as outlining steps towards an accelerated transformation that continues to drive emissions reduction together with sustained economic growth. \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India324","It is now US against the rest of the world","November 8, 2017 Wednesday","Down To Earth","India, Nov. 8 -- Here's the irony. The country, which alone contributes about 15 per cent of global greenhouse emission, is also the only one opting out of the landmark Paris Climate Agreement. On June 1, when President Donald Trump announced the US exit from the climate agreement, he had Syria and Nicaragua as examples of countries that did not ratify the agreement. With Nicaragua joining the Paris deal last month and Syria announcing its intention to ratify the accord at the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ) in Bonn on Tuesday (November 8), the isolation of US is now complete. Syria, a country that contributes 0.15 per cent of global greenhouse emissions, had a change of heart despite being devastated by civil strife. Nicaragua, which contributes only 0.03 per cent of global emissions, realised that the Paris deal is ""the only instrument we have"" to address climate change. There has not been any change in the United States' position so far with the government maintaining that it is withdrawing from the deal unless it can ""re-enter on terms that are more favourable"" for the country. During his speech on withdrawing from Paris deal, he not only vilified poorer and more vulnerable countries for their ""unfair advantages"" but avoided mentioning how India and China have been performing in relation to their targets under the Paris Agreement. At a time when scientists had confirmed that the commitments made by the top polluters like the US, EU and China were not enough to keep global warming under 2 degrees Celsius, and countries that produce only a tiny fraction of global emissions are now party to the accord, Trump administration needs to reflect and reconsider its decision and join the rest of the world in tackling climate change. Under the rules of the Paris agreement, the US cannot formally withdraw until late 2020. Until then, administration officials will continue to negotiate the terms of the deal and promote coal and nuclear energy as an answer to climate change.

"COP23","India","COP23_India325","India needs over $200 bn of investment in renewable infrastructure","November 21, 2017 Tuesday","IANS-English","Bonn, Nov 21 -- India is on track to catalyse $200-300 billion of new investment in its renewable energy infrastructure in the next decade with global capital inflows playing an increasingly crucial role, a top financial analyst with a leading US-based institute foresees India's decarbonisation policy is in line with global trends which, since 2011, have been seeing investments in renewable energy infrastructure running at two-three times of that for new fossil fuel capacities, Tim Buckley, Director of Energy Finance Studies Australasia with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), said. At present, India relies on thermal power generation for 80 per cent of its electricity, while hydro supplies a significant 10 per cent and renewables just seven per cent. However, India has set an ambitious but achievable national target of 275 GW of renewable capacity installed by 2027. Changes to tap renewable resources are on the way. These developments continued into 2017 with costs of both falling by an unprecedented 50 per cent and recent tenders now pricing renewables at 20 per cent below the average price on existing Indian thermal power generation. Electricity demand in India is expected to double over the coming decade, and how this electricity will be generated is important for both India and the world. ""We present an electricity sector model out to 2027 showing how India can meet almost all of its growing electricity needs via increasingly cost-competitive renewable energy resources and numerous energy efficiency measures, while at the same time keeping its coal use in check, at perhaps no more than five-10 per cent above current levels,"" Buckley told IANS in an email response. India is the world's second-largest producer, consumer and importer of thermal coal. It's also the third largest electricity user in the world after China and the US. As a result, for the first time in India, addition of new renewable generation topped that of thermal power in 2016-17. During this period, net thermal power addition fell to just 7.7 gigawatts, well below the roughly 20 GW added annually in the prior four years, while renewable additions jumped to 15.7 GW, the report said. India's draft national electricity plan calls for renewable energy installs to average 21-22 GW annually going forward. Given the rapidly improving economics of renewable, solar's cost is down 50 per cent in just two years, for example hovering at about $0.038 per kilowatt-hour, making this an achievable target. Some in India have been concerned about rising module prices in the near term, but IEEFA pointed to the record low $0.018 and $0.021/kWh tariffs awarded in Mexico and Chile respectively this past week. Clearly India can look forward to further renewable energy tariff reductions medium term, the report said. While renewables are expected to surge, IEEFA forecasts that net thermal power capacity additions are likely to remain below five GW annually in the next decade, held in check by increased retirements of highly polluting, end-of-life sub-critical coal-fired power plants. ""We expect retirements to average more than 2.5 GW annually, but with coal-fired power plant utilisation rates averaging just 56.7 per cent in 2016-17 and little prospect of this improving over the coming decade, retirements could well accelerate to four-five GW annually,"" said Buckley. These retirements are likely to be pushed forward by the reality that solar and wind already are being deployed at tariffs below those of even existing domestic thermal power generation. India's target to all but cease thermal coal imports by the end of this decade is now the logical economic outcome, especially since plants using expensive imported coal are increasingly the high-cost dispatch option. As the second largest importer of thermal coal globally, this is a materially adverse development for nations exporting thermal coal. ""The challenges to integrating India's 40 per cent renewable energy target by 2030 are real, but the momentum over the past three years, gained through government policy and economic merit, give us confidence India will stay the course,"" the report said. India is ranked 14th in the Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI) 2018 out of 56 nations and the European Union by environmental organisation Germanwatch, an improvement from its 20th position last year, for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by opting to transform its electricity sector towards green technology. China, with its high emissions and growing energy use over the past five years, still ranks 41st, says the Germanwatch's report released last week. At the just-concluded UN Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ) in Bonn, a coalition led by Canada and Britain jointly launched the Powering Past Coal Alliance with more than 20 partners, and even a US state, to move away from coal, a major source of air pollution. A climate expert told IANS that this is a first-of-its-kind attempt to phase out the traditional coal power on such a massive scale after the 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement that aims to keep global warming within 1.5 degrees Celsius by cutting greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels.

"COP23","India","COP23_India326","Philippines : Opening Statement of Senator Loren Legarda Asia Clean Energy Forum (ACEF) on Good and Decent Jobs, Skills, and Entrepreneurship for a Just Energy ....","June 6, 2017 Tuesday","TendersInfo","Growth is difficult to imagine without energy; and energy that does not take into consideration the needs of future generations can only destroy and not build. Development, progress, and quality of life cannot be the exclusive domain of a few. In November last year, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change entered into force with the goal to limit global temperature rise within the century to well below 2 degrees Celsius and possibly not more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The Philippines has ratified the Paris Agreement and we have committed to reduce GHG emissions by 70% by year 2030 from the business as usual scenario from energy, transport, waste, industry and forestry. We may not be a major emitter of carbon dioxide, but that does not mean we have no obligation to promote environmental sustainability. We are already taking concrete steps to address our vulnerability, adapt to the impacts of extreme weather events, and gradually transition to a low-carbon economy. In the national government's budget for this year, about 210 billion pesos (or US$4.2 billion) of the 3.350 trillion pesos total budget is allocated for climate-resilient programs. It is still a small percentage but it is a most welcome development. In our own efforts, as well as through international support, we are shifting to clean energy. We are doing this gradually because as a developing nation, we aim to strike a delicate balance between meeting our energy demands and sustainability. We have a Renewable Energy Law that provides for the full development and use of RE in the country. It is said that we have one of the best RE laws in the world, and we adopted it long before other countries adopted their own. The National Renewable Energy Program has set out aggressive targets on renewable energy development from 2011-2030, aiming to increase RE capacity to 15,304 megawatts by the year 2030. There have been challenges, however, in our efforts to fast track the development of our renewable energy resources more aggressively. The Climate Change Commission has started the review of all existing energy policies to identify loopholes and recommend the necessary interventions. If we look at countries with best practices, their transition to clean energy has been supported by an environment where clean energy technologies do not face unfair disadvantages compared to conventional energy sources. Renewable energy needs to be backed up by an effective energy efficiency policy. In the Senate, I have filed a measure that will put in place an energy efficiency policy that will set in motion the country's transition into clean and efficient energy. This measure will incentivize the shift to energy efficient technologies and compel government to develop and impose energy efficiency standards and energy labeling requirements to guide our consumers. It will also ensure a supply of technically and financially capable entities that can assist in the delivery of energy efficiency related projects, among others. It is vital that strong political and regulatory support is in place to ensure the benefits and impacts of energy transition. We have a new law that grants special tax deductions and duty-free importation of capital equipment for companies that will help create a green economy for the country. Under the Philippine Green Jobs Act which I co-authored, companies that create green jobs or employment that contributes to preserving or restoring the quality of the environment, can avail of tax incentives and duty-free importation of equipment used in the promotion of green jobs of the business enterprise. While there is no single job that promises unfettered security, we need to appreciate how jobs in the clean energy sector have grown significantly over the past years. Employment in green energy grew 5 percent in 2015, to 8.1 million jobs, while 350,000 oil workers lost their jobs the same year primarily due to the slump in oil prices. IRENA estimates that if nations follow through on the climate pledges made in COP21, jobs in renewable energy will triple to 24 million by 2030. For COP23 , focus should be about progressing work on the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Ensuring universal access to affordable electricity by 2030 means investing in clean energy sources. For many developing and least developed economies, accessing technologies for clean energy will be difficult without financing options and capacity building. COP23 should focus on how we can ramp up climate action, including the delivery of climate financing commitments. It should also be about building greater resilience for all economies and communities to the impacts of climate change. Growth is difficult to imagine without energy; and energy that does not take into consideration the needs of future generations can only destroy and not build. Development, progress, and quality of life cannot be the exclusive domain of a few. Quality of life comes with a price tag--not necessarily beyond our reach. Building liveable cities and communities requires good planning. More importantly, it requires a genuine commitment to the ultimate goal of putting the Earth's and our people's survival foremost over all other concerns. The climate crisis presents the opportunity to promote green growth for the sake of humanity and the only planet we call home. We must take hold of that opportunity so that future generations would not suffer the irreversible consequences if we chose inaction. \"

The Canadian and global economies are stronger, and the environment is better protected when women are fully engaged in solutions to tackle climate change and spur clean growth. Today, during a keynote interview at the World Ocean Summit in Mexico, the Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Catherine McKenna, announced that Canada will host the Women Leaders Kicking It on Climate Summit, in Ottawaon May 16 and 17as part of Canadas engagement activities in preparation for the Environment Ministerial Meeting of its G7 presidency this year. A priority for Canadas G7 presidency is to mainstream discussions about gender. This priority will ensure that gender equality and gender-based analysis are integrated across all themes, activities, and outcomes, including on environment and climate change. The Summit will bring together high-level female influencers from the public, private, academic, and civil-society sectors to advance climate action, the empowerment of women, and gender equality. The Summit will include a dialogue on how climate action can be gender responsive and how it can contribute to gender equity and the empowerment of women. Around the world, people with less access to resources and with greater responsibility for family and community welfare are feeling the effects of climate change the most. Women farmers currently account for 45 to 80 percent of all food production in developing countries, depending on the region. In the context of climate change, traditional food sources become more unpredictable and scarce, and women face loss of income as well as harvestsoften their sole source of food and income. Of course, women play a critical role in responding to climate change. Women leaders around the world have shaped ambitious climate policies and ensured the needs of individuals affected by climate change are part of the conversation. At the local level, womens inclusion as leaders has brought improved outcomes for climate-related projects and policies. Research in India revealed that the number of drinking-water projects in areas with women-led councils was 62 percent higher than in those with men-led councils. Canada is an international champion for applying a gender lens to climate change and for supporting womens climate action and participation in international climate talks. Canada played a leading role in securing the first-ever Gender Action Plan under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, adopted last year by countries at COP23 . The Plan aims to bring more women to the negotiation table and promote more responsive climate policies at grassroots and global levels. \"

This African Development Bank (AfDB) initiative is intended to help the 54 African countries fulfil their commitments under the Paris Agreement, in other words, to put their respective NDCs into action without neglecting their own development priorities. ""This platform is a response to requests made by various African countries,"" said Amadou Hott, AfDB vice president for electricity, energy, climate change and green growth, as he unveiled the new initiative to a gathering of Heads of State, ministers, policy makers and representatives of civil society, among others, from across the continent. ""It should be seen as an ""opportunity to accelerate investment in climate action in Africa through NDCs,"" he said, noting that it will facilitate ""better coordination among partners to provide a collective and effective response"", for and by the whole of Africa. This platform should be a catalyst for concessional funding for climate-related projects in Africa which will, in turn, help raise private finance. This is a most timely initiative, bearing in mind that, US$ 4 billion will be required to implement the NDCs, according to recent studies, While all 54 African countries signed the Paris Agreement, 43 have ratified it and 53 (the exception being Libya) have submitted their NDCs, 85% of which are conditional upon financial aid from abroad while only 15% are on the basis of domestic budgets. And Africa is already the poor orphan when it comes to world climate funding, capturing less than 5% of the total. Thus, the announcement of this new platform was warmly welcomed. To date, Africa NDC Hub has 10 partners other than AfDB: the African Union Commission (AUC), the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), the NEPAD Planning and Coordination Agency, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the International Institute for the Environment and Development (IIED) and the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

"COP23","India","COP23_India333","Why the Bonn climate meet is an important one","November 3, 2017 Friday","Hindustan Times","Mumbai, Nov. 3 -- The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of the Parties 23 starts on November 6 in Bonn, Germany. The agenda of the high-powered meeting is vast - from sustainable innovation to developing the resilience of Pacific islanders who are at risk of losing their home to the rising sea level within a generation. Bonn will be a stage for states to show the progress they have made on tackling climate change, though what has happened till now is not enough. The fact that Fiji is chairing the proceedings is likely to force the conference to take a hard look if progress has been made on linking climate change action with development policies. Linking climate change adaptation with development is the new battleground for the climate change community and governments. This means making sure that people in charge of mainstream development policies recognise climate change as a reality and development policies have to be climate-proof. To make this happen, first, policymakers need data and information. Second, environmental scientists have to work closely with social scientists and statistical offices to track and understand the socio-economic impact of changing weather patterns. Third, there must be innovation in development financing. Fourth, states must work towards developing risk management strategies, which place vulnerability of people and systems at their core. This is critical because ultimately it is the people who have to learn to negotiate climate change or bear the consequences. They must have access to information and contribute to designing adaptation strategies that turn climate into an opportunity while being resilient to an extreme weather event. At an expert consultation in September, Kamal Kishore, member, National Disaster Management Authority, stated that current development efforts in India are creating risks at a much faster pace than reducing them. One of the key highlights of the consultation was that policymakers in India do have a mandate to plan for disaster risk management but they lack a practical framework to link this work to local and development plans and their implementation, undermining the capacity of government to do adaptation and build resilience. Ultimately, this matter is critical to everyone. Farmers in Bihar should know how to make the most of the changing rainfall patterns and people in cities should know how to handle and quickly reopen businesses after large floods.

That equals the carbon dioxide emitted by 125,000 mid-size cars traveling 100 kilometers. Participants at COP 23 will spend their days discussing effective ways to protect the earth's climate. Some will spend their nights not in hotels but rather in private homes generously made available to them at no cost by Bonn residents. For this reason, the calculation is a rough estimate. Nevertheless, it highlights the potential for the hotel and hospitality industry to shrink its carbon footprint. Germany's hotel industry is estimated to emit around five million metric tons of carbon each year. Yet guests increasingly want their accommodations to be sustainable. Fuel cells could not only reduce a hotel's energy costs but could also significantly increase its environmental friendliness and even make its energy use climate-neutral. Fuel cells generate electricity and heat in a combustion-free process resulting in virtually no pollutants such as nitrogen oxide or particulate matter. This year E.ON partnered with Radisson SAS to equip Germany's first hotel with an industrial-scale fuel cell. The Radisson Blu Hotel in Frankfurt can now produce the vast majority of the energy required for its operation without emitting any harmful substances. Source: E.ON \"

Scientists, who published a paper in Current Biology, have said they have found a sharp increase in plant growth in the past 50 years. Currently, plant life is 0.3 p er cent in what used to be dominated by ice. ""Temperature increases over roughly the past half century on the Antarctic Peninsula have had a dramatic effect on moss banks growing in the region,"" said co-author Matt Amesbury, of the University of Exeter, adding that if this trend continued, then the peninsula would be a much greener place than it is today. Five moss cores -- or column-like samples drilled from the Earth -- showed evidence of what scientists called ""changepoints,"" or points in time, after which biological activity clearly increased. Areas sampled included three Antarctic islands -- Elephant Island, Ardley Island, and Green Island -- where the deepest and oldest moss banks grow, said the report. ""This gives us a much clearer idea of the scale in which these changes are occurring,"" said Amesbury. ""Previously, we had only identified such a response in a single location at the far south of the Antarctic Peninsula, but now we know that moss banks are responding to recent climate change across the whole of the Peninsula."" The polar regions are warming more rapidly than the rest of the Earth, as greenhouse gasses from fossil fuel burning build up in the atmosphere and trap heat. The Arctic is warming the fastest, but Antarctica is not far behind, with annual temperatures gaining almost one degree Fahrenheit (half degree Celsius) each decade since the 1950s. The sensitivity of moss growth to past temperature rises suggests that ecosystems will alter rapidly under future warming, leading to major changes in the biology and landscape of this iconic region,"" said researcher Dan Charman, a professor at Exeter. ""In short, we could see Antarctic greening to parallel well-established observations in the Arctic."" prince charles warns Britain's Prince Charles warned on Friday that tiny island nations could be wiped off the map by climate change, at a Commonwealth gathering.

"COP23","India","COP23_India336","Caring for the planet starts with 'the ground we walk on;' UN says on World Soil Day","December 6, 2017 Wednesday 6:30 AM EST","IBNS","New York, Dec 6(Just Earth News): Soil is a major carbon storage system, essential for sustainable agriculture and climate change mitigation, the United Nations agriculture agency said on Tuesday, launching on World Soil Day a comprehensive global map showing the amount of carbon stocks contained in soil. Soil is the foundation of agriculture , it is where food begins, said Maria Helena Semedo, Deputy Director-General of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Maintaining the soils important functions and ecosystem services to support food production and increase resilience to a changing climate calls for sustainable soil management practices, she added. Soil organic matter, with carbon as its main component, is crucial to soil health and fertility, water infiltration and retention as well as food production. The worlds soils act as the largest terrestrial carbon sink, reducing greenhouse gases. Intensifying its role could significantly offset the rapid rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In an historic decision on agriculture, the 2017 UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn ( COP23 ) recognized the need for improved soil carbon, soil health and soil fertility. The Global Soil Organic Carbon Map, the most comprehensive to date, illustrates the amount of organic carbon stock in the first 30 cm of soil revealing natural areas with high carbon storage that require conservation along with regions where further sequestration would be possible. This information can prove a powerful tool to guide decision-making on practices aimed to preserve and increase the current soil carbon stocks helping win the fight against climate change. The map shows that globally the first 30 cm of soil contains around 680 billion tons of carbon almost double the amount present in our atmosphere. The degradation of one third of the worlds soils has already prompted an enormous release of carbon into the atmosphere. Restoring these soils can remove up to 63 billion tons of carbon, significantly reducing the effects of climate change. FAOs Intergovernmental Technical Panel on Soils supported the maps development, including by putting together the national carbon maps of more than 100 countries, making a concrete contribution towards Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15, Life on Earth. The next step is for countries to monitor their national soil information systems for organic carbon levels to make evidence-based decisions on how to manage and monitor their soils.

The EIB financing will support renewable energy and energy efficiency measures in a pulp mill in Timr\'e5, Sweden, the regeneration and replanting of 68 000 ha of forest - almost three times the area of Stockholm - and the construction of 4 250 km of forest roads. The project is expected to create more than 650 new jobs in the rural economy around the mill and will enable SCA to increase its production in an environmentally sustainable way to meet the growing demand for renewable forest products. EIB Vice-President Alexander Stubb, responsible for EIB operations in Northern European countries, said: ""Our loan to SCA, a major European producer of forest products, will not only decrease the ecological footprint of the pulp, wood and paper products, it will also help to make the market pulp mill energy self-sufficient and to plant thousands of trees. With all eyes on COP23 currently, this is a project that really demonstrates the EIB's firm commitment to climate-related investment."" New, advanced process technologies will be installed at the pulp mill in Timr\'e5, resulting in substantial energy efficiency gains. Additionally, the mill will be able to make use of renewable resources, like bark and by-products from the production process, for its energy generation, including both power and heat. As a result, the modernised pulp mill will not only be energy self-sufficient and increase its production capacity, but it will be able to export surplus (green) power. The mill's carbon footprint will be smaller than that of any comparable mill in the world. SCA is not only the second largest European saw mill company, but the largest private forest owner in Europe. The company's forests absorb more CO2 than the total CO2 discharged by its entire industrial and transport activities each year. SCA's forestry measures financed by the new EIB loan are expected to absorb over 44 000 additional tonnes of CO2 equivalents per year, corresponding to the CO2 emissions generated by 14 000 cars per year. The pulp mill will start up in June 2018 once the modernisation project has been completed. The forestry project and the upgrade of the forest road network will be carried out over a period of five years from 2017 to 2021.

The Global Climate Risk Index (CRI), developed by Germanwatch, was released at COP23 in Bonn on November 9. The Germanwatch Global Climate Risk Index, which has analysed the quantified impacts of extreme weather events-both in terms of fatalities and economic losses-reveals that Honduras, Myanmar and Haiti were most affected by extreme weather events between 1996 and 2015 with Dominica, Malawi and Mozambique featuring at the top of the list of the most affected countries in 2015. Despite this, the issue of climate-induced loss and damage continues to be neglected globally. Africa, the host continent of the COP22 in 2016, is severely affected by climatic events with four countries ranking among the 10 most affected in 2015-Mozambique (1st), Malawi (3rd), Ghana and Madagascar (joint 8th position). More importantly, out of the ten most affected countries (1996-2015), nine were developing countries in the low-income or lower-middle income country group. ""Industrialised nations must do more to address climate impacts that they are beginning to feel at home. Effective climate protection is, therefore, in the self-interest of these countries. For instance, the US ranks tenth in the 2016 index, with 267 fatalities and US$47.7 billion in damages in that year caused by extreme weather,"" says David Eckstein of Germanwatch. READ: By 2050, climate-related disasters could cost US $35 billion a year: audit report Going by this report, heavy rain, floods and landslides were the major causes of damage in 2015. ""A high incidence of extreme precipitation supports the scientific expectations of accelerated hydrological cycles caused by climate warming,"" the report argues. The report highlights that most of the affected countries in the bottom 10 of the long-term index have faced ""exceptional catastrophes"". ""Low-income countries are disproportionately hit. The report gives a clear message of increasing adaptation and mitigation actions,"" says Vera Kunzel, one of the authors of the report. The authors of the Global Climate Risk Index conclude that review of the UNFCCC's work on loss and damage provides an opportunity to better detail the next five years of work on loss and damage and understand exactly how loss and damage should be taken up under the Paris Agreement.

"COP23","India","COP23_India339","Did developing countries miss the trick at Bonn?","November 17, 2017 Friday","Down To Earth","India, Nov. 17 -- As UN Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ) in Bonn is drawing towards an end within scheduled timeline, a rarity during annual global negotiations in the recent times, the question hangs: did the developing countries miss a trick by going into an overdrive over pre-2020 climate action debate? Did developed countries actually win a 'bout' by surrendering a 'round'? Developing countries block, including the BASIC group to which India is part of, claimed a ""big win"" by bringing the spotlight back on pre-2020 agenda and pushed developed countries to agree on a roadmap to implement the commitments made by them in Doha five years back! After a negotiation that continued over a week and concluded just before the high-level segment with the political leaders was set to roll, a draft proposed by the President of COP22-who was coordinating the negotiation on behalf of the President of COP23 president-was agreed upon by both developed and developing countries. Push for pre-2020 agenda may not be enough Broadly, the draft proposed that developed countries would be requested to ratify Doha amendment of Kyoto protocol as soon as possible and submit a report by May 1, 2018, stating their current achievement and enhanced action prior to 2020. There would be a stocktake on pre-2020 implementation and heightened ambition on emission cut in next two COPs and discussions on climate finance. In 2012, the Parties had agreed in Doha that under extended Kyoto Protocol, countries would undertake aggregate emission cuts that would be at least 18 per cent below 1990 levels. They also agreed that developed countries would reconsider their emission reduction commitments by the end of 2014, with a view to increasing their ambition level. Nothing happened since then, till the issue was raked up in Bonn. While one cannot deny the importance of this ""political win"" for developing countries, on ground it looks hollow in terms of achieving real emission cut and keeping the world livable for coming generations. Even the intimation ""on time"" means that developed countries under Kyoto would have at most 18 months to meet their commitments, which seems improbable, particularly in context of their track record in Kyoto Protocol. Not to talk about big boys of burgeoning emission-the US, Japan, Russia and Canada-who are in any way out of contention, being out of Kyoto. Doha Amendment ratification more symbolic than effective Hence, this ratification will be nothing but a mere paper-play unless the commitment under Doha commitment is tagged with the post-2020 commitments under respective 'Nationally Determined Contributions'. The agreed draft has mentioned that pre-2020 agenda will be ""an element"" in the facilitative dialogue in 2018 and stops there! Though a section of developing countries and civil society hope that pre-2020 commitments may be tagged to Paris Agreement and expect another round of detailed debate over that during COP24 in Poland, the fact remains that representatives of developed countries, including European Union delegation's lead negotiator Elina Bardram confirmed that there has been ""no discussion"" on linking pre-2020 with Paris climate deal. ""How it can be? Paris Agreement has already been ratified . how you can change this?"" quipped one. That brings us back to the basic question: will pre-2020 agreement be able to cut emission on ground and limit temperature rise, especially in the context of recent peer-reviewed international reports, which emphatically point out that things are going from bad to worse? The answer is, as of now, an emphatic ""no"". More important agendas left on the lurch While going on an overdrive to gain this ""win"", the developing countries have perhaps lost precious time and initiative to push other key agendas; and as a result, no substantive progress could be made on long-term finance, loss and damage, transparency, adaptation finance and likewise. Former Bangladesh minister and present chairman of parliamentary committee on environment and forest Hasan Mahmud termed the negotiation ""unsatisfactory"" till Thursday (November 16) afternoon and not much has moved after that. ""Look, discussion on climate-triggered migration, an issue being part of Paris Agreement, was all but missing in Bonn,"" said Mahmud during a conversation. Ambassador Antonio Marcondes, a senior Brazil negotiator-accompanied by environment ministers and delegation heads from China, India, Brazil and South Africa-conceded publicly to a question put forward by this correspondent that ""it was regrettable as one vital week within two weeks of conference has been lost in the process (of discussing pre-2020)"" and blamed developed countries for ""standing in other side of the aisle"". ""Are they (developed nations) playing a game?""; ""At least we are not playing,"" retorted Marcondes, perhaps knowing within that they might have been taken for a ride. The debate, arguably, has also allowed the US to reclaim some of the lost ground on climate negotiation. The US, which was completely isolated by other developed countries during G20, took chance of the debate to forge some kind of solidarity with other developed countries on a common issue and subsequently, even took a key position in negotiation on other agendas like climate finance. ""There is no doubt that United States would have been more isolated if pre-2020 debate had not taken such proportions. One can understand from their body language. They were not really that active and generally held back in the initial discussions; but as the COP progressed they have become much more active and vocal,"" said a civil society expert, who has been following the deliberations closely. ""Developed countries, including the US, sucked developing countries into a debate, which actually means nothing for the latter in real terms. On the other hand, developed countries could push back the goalpost further. Have you ever seen developed countries concede a critical bargain during any earlier climate summit before the political discourse starts? It happened here,"" reminded the analyst. A big enough clue to ignore perhaps. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Down to Earth.

The Constituent Assembly of the World Alliance for Efficient Solutions took place today in the Bonn Zone of COP23 , launching its flagship action: the selection of 1000 solutions that protect the environment in a profitable way by COP24 in 2018, with H.S.H. Prince Albert II of Monaco starting the countdown on stage. The event was also attended by Patricia Espinosa, Executive secretary of UNFCCC; Maros Sefcovic, Vice-President of the European Commission; Laura Tuck, Vice President Sustainable Development, World Bank; and Erik Solheim, Executive Director of UN Environment; as well as Ministers and other representatives of high level institutions and many Members the World Alliance who officially adopted its statutes. Lastly, on this occasion Arnold Schwarzenegger became the newest Patron of this initiative. This is a major milestone for the World Alliance, which at present already counts 474 Members that together combine more than 500 potential solutions. It can now officially begin to identify and select Efficient Solutions, which it defines as products, services, clean technologies and processes, not limited to the production of renewable energy, that are profitable and sustain economic growth, while protecting the environment and optimising the use of natural resources. ""Today, thousands of solutions exist that can boost economic growth while preserving nature, but they remain unknown to decision makers and are not implemented at industry level,"" commented Bertrand Piccard, Initiator and Chairman of the Solar Impulse Foundation. ""Our goal is to select 1000 solutions that are both clean and profitable and bring them to decision-makers to demonstrate that they must urgently stop compromising for minimal targets and adopt much more ambitious environmental and energy policies."" Examples of potential solutions already submitted by Members range from deep water offshore turbines, solar desalination plants, containers to transform organic waste into energy, air filters that capture C0 2 emissions and turn them into renewable fuels, hydrogen-based devices that can be added on cars to increase fuel efficiency, to free electric car chargers. Over the next year, all submitted solutions will be assessed by independent scientific and financial Experts following a structured methodology designed to evaluate their deployability, sustainability and viability. ""We need to embrace efficient technologies, because they are much more than 'ecological', they are 'logical'. They create jobs and generate profit, while also reducing CO2 emissions and protecting the environment. Even if climate change didn't exist, they would make sense. Clean growth is much better than the dirty status quo we have today,"" added Bertrand Piccard. In addition to bringing Members from a diversity of backgrounds - start-ups, companies, governments, among others - to work together to create synergies, and facilitating match-making between solution seekers, providers and investors, the World Alliance has entered in close collaboration with several international institutions, states and cities around the world, including the City of Paris, Union for the Mediterranean, the European Commission and Clean Energy Ministerial, to accelerate the selection, funding and implementation of the 1000 solutions. The Solar Impulse Foundation offers to the World Alliance its communication and operational support, as well as the media, political and institutional relations developed during the first round-the-world solar flight. Thanks to the continued commitment of its Partners - Covestro, Solvay, Nestle, Engie, Air Liquide, BNP Paribas (Switzerland) and Schlumberger, as well as private Donors - it can fund the World Alliance for Efficient Solutions, which in turn can offer all services to its Members entirely free of charge. ""Initiatives like the World Alliance and its goal of selecting 1000 efficient solutions, are exactly what we need to further enable investors, governments, cities and citizens to harvest the rich variety of clean technologies that already exist or are under development, and accomplish the goals of the Paris Climate Change Agreement and all the Sustainable Development Goals to catalyse a healthy and prosperous future for all,"" Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary, UNFCCC. ""Europe is committed to a clean energy transition. But this can only happen if we break down silos, if all those who share this commitment work together and focus on tangible and efficient solutions. That it is why I support the World Alliance: it creates an umbrella of solution providers, government representatives, start-ups, established companies, financers, local authorities, national governments, intergovernmental organizations. I look forward to hearing about the 1000 solutions, and I can guarantee full support of the European Commission in this important journey,"" Maros Sefcovic, Vice-President, European Commission. ""The good news is that whole countries are making choices in favor of cleaner, greener and more efficient solutions to climate change. This is driving demand for green finance from the full range of financial institutions, including the World Bank. These are exciting times for new investments in climate solutions,"" Laura Tuck, World Bank VP for Sustainable Development. ""Doom and gloom won't to get us anywhere, and let's not forget that climate change is a problem that we can innovate our way out of. What we need are concrete solutions that can be applied at scale. These solutions are already out there, but many are hidden -- in places like research labs and small start-ups, or otherwise as pilot projects that never made it to scale. It's important now more than ever to put these solutions in the limelight and show what is possible when we embrace positive change,"" said Erik Solheim, Executive Director, UN Environment. \"

The investment announced by the Climate Change and Industry Minister today also includes:  4.3 million for the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) to fund five research projects at the National Oceanography Centre (NOC), and the Universities of Exeter and Southampton, to develop sensors capable of working in the ocean's extreme conditions  16.5 million for a collaborative research and development competition, run by Innovate UK, with winners set to include more than 70 businesses, 13 universities and 10 research organizations  funding of 3 million for 17 studies which focus on demonstrating how artificial intelligence can operate in extreme environments, following a separate competition run by Innovate UK Professor Philip Nelson, Chief Executive of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, said: These new Robotics Hubs will draw on the country's research talent to nurture new developments in the field of robotics and provide the foundations on which innovative technologies can be built. The resulting outcomes from this research will allow us to explore environments that are too dangerous for humans to enter without risking injury or ill-health. The Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund is helping us achieve a joined up approach to research, discovery and innovation. Ruth McKernan, Chief Executive of Innovate UK, said: These pioneering projects driven by the very best minds in UK research and industry exemplify the huge potential of what can be achieved through the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund and the long-term benefits for the UK economy. These are just the first competitions in robotics and AI, there will be further opportunities for businesses in the coming months. Professor Duncan Wingham, Chief Executive of the Natural Environment Research Council, said: These sensors will help us to better understand our oceans, helping us to manage them sustainably for the future. The projects will develop ambitious new technologies that work in hazardous and extreme environments, maintaining the UK's world-class status in marine robotics. Other industries, such as the water, aquaculture and industrial waste, are also likely to benefit from these technologies. Today's announcements follow the publication of the industry-led Made Smarter review, which predicted Britain's manufacturing sector could unlock more than 450 billion over the next decade and create thousands of jobs if it successfully embraced digitisation, robotics and artificial intelligence. Alongside the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, BEIS has also been working with Professor Dame Wendy Hall and Dr. Jerome Pesenti to establish how to grow the UK can grow and support its burgeoning artificial intelligence sector. In April, the government announced 1 billion of investment through the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund for cutting-edge technologies to create jobs and raise living standards. Other areas receiving government support include cutting edge healthcare and medicine, battery storage and satellite and space technology. Ahead of attending climate change talks at COP23 in Germany next week, the Minister also announced 16 million for research into two new smart energy innovation competitions, which build on Government's ambition to fund over 2.5 billion in clean technology innovation, as set out in last month's Clean Growth Strategy. These will focus on creating technologies which will reduce demand on the electricity grid at peak periods and to increase demand at times when low-carbon generation is at its peak, saving money and cutting emissions. This comes following the government publishing its Smart Systems and Flexibility Plan in July this year, which set out a range of measures to reduce the regulatory burdens of making our energy system more smart. The minister also announced the winners of the first phases of two energy innovation competitions looking into the feasibility of energy storage and non-domestic demand side response, with 400,000 awarded to nine companies across the UK.

The approval of this document is propitious as it echoes the on-going discussions at COP23 in Bonn, Germany to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change and achieve the Paris Agreements goal of keeping global temperature rises to 1.5C. The African continent is a minor contributor to global warming but is highly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change that threatens its economic development. However, the continent also has enormous opportunities to build resilience to climate change as well as transition towards low-carbon development. The commitment of the African continent to contribute to global solutions to climate change is demonstrated by the fact that all 54 countries have submitted their Intended National Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement, and 43 of these countries have actually ratified the Agreement. The CCAP2 is designed to incorporate the Banks High 5 priorities in the Paris Agreement, the 2030 development agenda, the Banks Green Growth Framework and the lessons learned in the implementation of the first climate change action plan (CCAP1), 2011-2015 Akinwumi Adesina, President of the African Development Bank said: The approval of the CCAP2 by the Board today sends a clear message on the Banks commitment to helping African countries to mobilize resources to support the implementation of the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions of our Regional Member Countries in a way that will not hinder their development. The strategic vision of CCAP2 is to enable the achievement of low carbon and climate-resilient development in Africa. It has four Pillars: Mitigation, Adaptation, Climate Finance and a Cross Cutting Pillar that addresses technology transfer, capacity development, institutional reforms as well as other cross-cutting activities that will create of the enabling environment for its successful implementation. Over the next four years, the AfDB hopes to achieve the objectives set out in the CCAP2, to help our member countries to be developed and resilient while keeping Africa a low-emitting continent, said Amadou Hott, Vice President of the Power, Energy, Climate Change and Green Growth Complex. The interventions identified under CCAP2 aim at bringing economic prosperity to African communities within safe planetary boundaries, including the boundaries imposed by climate change. Achieving this requires substantial investments from the Bank and its partners. \"

"COP23","India","COP23_India346","Pacific Island countries could lose 50 -- 80% of fish in local waters under climate change","November 16, 2017","Indian Agriculture News","New Delhi Nov. 16 -- Many Pacific Island nations will lose 50 to 80 percent of marine species in their waters by the end of the 21st century if climate change continues unchecked, finds a new Nippon Foundation-Nereus Program study published in Marine Policy. This area of the ocean is projected to be the most severely impacted by aspects of climate change. ""Under climate change, the Pacific Islands region is projected to become warmer, less oxygenated, more acidic, and have lower production of plankton that form the base of oceanic food webs,"" said lead author Rebecca Asch, Nereus Program alumnus and Assistant Professor at East Carolina University. ""We found that local extinction of marine species exceeded 50 percent of current biodiversity levels across many regions and at times reached levels over 80 percent."" The Pacific Islands region is the warmest of the global ocean. It's also an area where there is less seasonal variability -- it more or less feels like summer all year. Because there are no drastic seasons, the animals in the tropical Pacific may find changing conditions to be more of a shock. ""Additional warming will push ocean temperature beyond conditions that organisms have not experienced since geological time periods in this region,"" said co-author Gabriel Reygondeau, Nereus Fellow at UBC. ""Since no organisms living in the ocean today would have time to adapt to these warmer conditions, many will either go extinct or migrate away from the western Pacific, leaving this area with much lower biodiversity."" The authors examined the effects of climate change on more than a thousand species, including those that live on reefs and those that live in open-water habitats. Both groups underwent declines in local biodiversity, but the rates of decline were higher for the open-water species. These changes would be detrimental to Pacific Islanders, who are highly dependent on marine species for food, economic opportunities, and cultural heritage. Additional threats come from sea level rise and increasing major storms. Also, these are often developing countries with less resources available for societal adaptations to climate change. ""One hopeful point is that the extent of these changes in biodiversity and fisheries was dramatically reduced under a climate change scenario where greenhouse gas emissions were close to what would be needed for achieving the Paris Climate Agreement"" said co-author William Cheung, Nereus Director of Science. ""As a result, these changes in oceanic conditions are not inevitable, but instead depend on the immediate actions of all countries to materialize their commitment to limit greenhouse gas emissions as is being discussed in COP23 in Bonn, Germany, this week."" \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India347","Carbon emissions set to rise by 2% this year","November 14, 2017 Tuesday","Times of India (Electronic Edition)","BONN Global carbon dioxide emissions are set to rise again in 2017 after three stable years (2014-16) with China recording the highest increase as compared to last year. Though India too is expected to record an increase by 2% in its carbon emissions this year, the rise is much less as compared to the 6% per year average increase it notched up over the previous decade. These conclusions are part of the 2017 Global Carbon Budget, released here on Monday on the sidelines of the ongoing UN climate conference ( COP23 ). The report said the global emissions of CO2 from fossil fuels and industry were projected to rise by about 2% (with an uncertainty range of just between 0.8% and 3%) compared with the preceding year. The carbon budget report, referring to the International Monetary Fund statistics, also flagged that all nations collectively during the year would see a GDP rise of 3.6% as compared to the previous year. Citing GDP growth in the report assumes significance in view of its link to emissions. \\x93The global economy is picking up slowly. As GDP rises, we produce more goods, which, by design, produces more emissions\\x94, said Robert Jackson, a co-author of the report. In this context, the report noted that emissions of 101countries, representing 50% of global emissions, increased as did their GDP. Accordingly, Chinese emissions are projected to rise by 3.5% in 2017 as compared to last year with its GDP up by 6.8%. India will, however, report lesser emissions growth (2%) while the country is expected to record almost the same GDP growth (6.7%) during the period. The report gave credit to India for its \\x93significant government interventions in the economy\\x94 that helped it record emission rise of only 2% in 2017. It is, therefore, significantly less that the 6% per year average emission growth over the previous decade (2007-16). The US and the EU, on the other hand, are likely to report a decline in their emissions growth this year as compared to 2016. The US emissions are projected to decline by 0.4% this year when its GDP will grow by about 2.2%. Similarly, the EU emissions are expected to decline by 0.2% in 2017 when this group of 28 nations collectively posting a 2.3% increase in their GDP. The report, in fact, noted that there are 22 countries (representing 20% of global emissions) which recorded decline in their emissions during the last decade (2007-16) even as their economies grew. \\x93The return to growth in global emission in 2017 is largely due to a return to growth in Chinese emissions,\\x94 said another co-author of the report, Glen Peters. \"

Almost the entire surface of the islands - 97% - is a National Park. In order to help preserve it, DEG - Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH has co-funded a sustainable water management pilot project, using funds from the develoPPP.de programme of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). The project, during which wastewater treatment was tested with the help of two demonstration plants, was successfully completed. The private partner in this project was ATB Umwelttechnologien GmbH from Porta Westfalica, with support from WWF Ecuador. Contribution to alleviating water scarcity The impact of climate change on islands, in particular, is a key issue at the UN Climate Change Conference COP23 , currently being held in Bonn. The Galapagos Islands are exposed to weather phenomena such as El Ni\'f1o, which lead to prolonged periods of drought and are exacerbated by climate change. This puts additional strain on the islands' limited reserves of fresh water. Up to now, most of the Galapagos Islands' sewage has not been reprocessed. It either seeps almost untreated into the ground, or is piped directly into the South Pacific. Environmental knowledge transfer Over the course of the project, ATB has developed and set up two wastewater treatment demonstration plants on the island of Santa Cruz. These treatment plants use small-scale naturally-based technologies. One of them, located at a hotel, uses biological treatment in combination with a subsequent UV disinfection process. The second one treats wastewater from a fish processing plant and combines a mechanical pre-treatment process with a constructed wetland. The water recovered from both plants can then be reused, for instance in irrigation. Local technicians have been trained to manage the two installations. Sustainable designs in demand because of climate change The unique natural environment means that tourism is the islands' biggest industry, so sustainable designs that conserve resources are especially important here. Two further wastewater plants have already been built at other hotels during the course of the project. Reliable, low-cost sewage treatment is also essential for local businesses, such as fish processing. Climate and environmental protection has been a key objective of DEG for many years. In 2016 alone 562 million euros, i.e. around a third of its new commitments, were allocated to investments promoting climate and environmental protection as well as adaptation to climate change.

The agreement provides for an increase in the yearly reduction of emission allowances to be auctioned (so-called ""linear reduction factor"") by 2.2% from 2021, against the existing 1.74%; this factor will also be kept under review with a view to increasing it further by 2024 at the earliest; and a doubling of the Market Stability Reserve's capacity to mop up excess emission allowances on the market: when triggered, it would absorb up to 24% of excess credits in each auctioning year, for the first four years, thus increasing their price and pushing for less emissions. A modernisation fund will help to upgrade energy systems in lower-income member states. MEPs pushed to tighten the financing rules so that the fund is not used for coal-fired projects, except for district heating in the two poorest member states, provided that they offset the emissions produced by using an equivalent amount of free allowances (granted under a temporary derogation via article 10c of the legislation) for investments not involving solid fossil fuels. An innovation fund will provide financial support for renewable energy, carbon capture and storage and low-carbon innovation projects. Lead MEP Julie Girling (ECR, UK) said: ""Ahead of the European Parliament's delegation to COP23 , this sends an important signal to the market. The Parliament is committed to the integrity of the EU ETS and we are pleased to have achieved a strong outcome for Phase IV, giving certainty to operators and allowing stakeholders to push on to implement the goals of the Paris Agreement"".

"COP23","India","COP23_India350","India must take the lead to save the Paris agreement","June 16, 2017 Friday","Hindustan Times","New Delhi, June 16 -- The US regression from the Paris climate accord is not surprising. As a matter of concern, other developed economies like Australia and Russia, too are seen faltering on climate action. In this scenario, the world is increasingly looking east to fill the leadership vacuum in global climate governance. India and China have displayed commitment and leadership potential by taking affirmative actions in significantly reducing carbon emissions. Though China's climate action is commendable, it is not in a position yet to independently assume the leadership that climate governance requires. First, despite its aggressive efforts, China remains the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter. Second, China has often followed a hands-off approach in regional and global diplomacy. Tackling climate change and reforming global energy systems requires an assertive leadership. Third, as recently as 2011, climate scepticism dominated the national discourse in China. Between the US withdrawal and China's dubious climate credentials, immense opportunities exist for India to counterbalance the existing climate leadership equilibrium. Recent affirmations from India on staying committed to climate goals is indicative of India's decisive leadership. India is already on the path of clean energy revolution and is making significant accomplishments in achieving its pledge to the Paris Agreement. Upscaling the National Solar Mission, India has set a target of 100 gigawatts (GW) of installed solar energy capacity by 2022. This is five times higher than the original 20 GW target. India also recently became the fourth largest producer of wind energy in the world and announced plans to cancel 14 GW of coal plants. Indeed, India is currently in a strong position not only to meet, but exceed its Paris climate targets. The green power revolution is envisaged to attract millions in investment and create job opportunities, while providing a substantial boost to export of new commodities. India is a shining example for developing economies in successfully aligning climate action with development imperatives. In climate negotiations, India has taken a lead in arguing for less stringent climate restrictions for developing countries as they need more room to grow in the limited carbon space. Given the present leadership impasse, the world would be keenly following India's role on climate action in key upcoming forums such as the G20 and COP23 . As China looks for a global partner to leverage its influence at the international stage, India is poised to utilise this potential opportunity and fill the leadership void in global climate change governance.

"COP23","India","COP23_India351","Finally, a breakthrough on agriculture on the cards at Bonn","November 10, 2017 Friday","Down To Earth","India, Nov. 10 -- The theme of the day today at COP23 in Bonn was agriculture. The venue saw a day full of side events and panel discussions dedicated to informal deliberations to minimise agriculture's contributions towards climate change and the impacts faced due to it. Events throughout the day focused on the need to step up adaptation and mitigation finance to help the agricultural sector cope better and build climate-resilient agriculture to offset damages that have been increasing in recent years, especially in the global south and in countries vulnerable to climate change impacts. ""Countries now have the opportunity to transform their agricultural sectors to achieve food security for all through sustainable agriculture and strategies that boost resource-use efficiency, conserve and restore biodiversity and natural resources, and combat the impacts of climate change,"" said Rene Castro, Assistant-Director General of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). But by no means has this opportunity only just presented itself. The need for climate finance and sustainable and climate-resilient agriculture has been spoken about at every session of COP in the recent past. While ideas abound, movement in negotiations beyond this has been sluggish despite the fact that agriculture and land-use changes account for nearly one-fourth of all GHG emissions, according to the 2015 IPCC assessment report. Not only are the contributions to emissions substantial, the impacts of climate change on agriculture has also been heavy across the developing world, especially in Africa and South-Southeast Asia,where extreme weather, unpredictable climatic patterns and successive droughts have taken their toll on agricultural production and food security. After many years of neglect and languishing on the fringes of climate negotiations, activists and negotiators, predominantly from developing countries, succeeded in getting agriculture-related issues included in the agenda for discussions under the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA), which would be used to create the modalities required to deal with agriculture. Climate change impact on agriculture and economic losses One needs to look no further than India itself to glean the costs that agriculture has to bear because of climate change. With farm incomes dwindling, farmer protests have erupted across the country over the past few years. A part of the blame for this has been laid on climate change. The Indian government, for its part, has started a National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture and National Innovations for Climate Resilient Agriculture over the course of a decade to support smallholder farmers who form the majority of food producers in the country. But the projects under these missions are yet to move beyond the pilot stage for implementation. ""The focus for India is clear. We need to shore up adaptation for any negotiation to be fair to our small and marginal farmers and that shall be our priority when it comes to any negotiation on the matter,"" asserted Ravi Shankar Prasad, Union Minister of India and the country's negotiator at CoP23 in Bonn. Unfortunately, despite the heavy burden of climate change and a clear position taken by the Indian government, the latter has so far been less than enthusiastic in its pursuit of an agreement that reflects the same. No Indian negotiator was present at meetings on agriculture held during CoP22 in Marrakech, when a draft document submitted by the African nations was blocked by developed countries. No consensus on agriculture due to difference in priorities One of the major reasons for this impasse is the fairly common difference in priorities between developed and developing countries. While global warming has had a negative impact on farm productivity on most tropical countries, developed nations, particularly in the global north, have incidentally benefitted from rising temperatures. What this has meant is that while developing countries have pushed for an official recognition of the costs being borne by them in agriculture owing to climate change and reparations for the same, developed nations have been more interested in pushing for an agenda that focuses on mitigation and cutting of emissions from agriculture rather than the impacts themselves. Is a work plan for climate actions in agriculture on cards? While inclusion of agriculture as a SBSTA agenda item was seen as a success at that time, there has been little progress since. The disconnect between the conference rooms of COPs and the situation on the ground remains. However, this year, there seems to be some progress on the subject. Sources close to the negotiations have hinted at the possibility of bridging the differences and the acceptance of a work plan for climate actions in agriculture. Draft document on agriculture ""India will not be forced into accepting obligations for mitigations because the need of the hour is adaptation for us. This is a clear and strong position,"" said Prasad. This year, unlike last, India does have a representative present in talks related to agriculture and India has aligned itself to the G77+China to push forth its demands. The result has been a submission of a draft document made by Uruguay on behalf of the G-77 and China, which focuses on adaptation. Among the recommendations that 135-country group has submitted, stress has been put on assessment of risks to agriculture, a differentiation of vulnerability and actions required based on farming systems and agro-ecological zones, and the development of early warning systems. While sources close to negotiations hint at some opposition from developed nations, particularly the EU, optimism about the possibility of a decision at the end of this year's discussions is higher than in the past.""It is not easy to get so many countries on board. It is quite possible that the slow pace of negotiations is because we need to develop a system that is acceptable to many. In some cases, like this, that can take many years but there is also strength in numbers and I believe that now the required momentum has been attained and there could a decision on how agriculture can be viewed at the end of this year's conference. There is definitely more optimism about this now than in past COPs,"" says one negotiator. Final decision on the same should be clear in few days, but developing nations would hope that now it has drummed up enough support to tide over any opposition that may arise from the developed world.

He also explains how it will help in increasing global solar footprints. ISA will become a legal entity on December 6. What does this mean for India? It's very special as it's the first inter-governmental global organisation to be permanently headquartered in India. Having 121countries as its prospective members, the ISA will become a huge organisation one day. Being permanently located here, it will attract a lotof talent toIndia. The world has, in fact, been looking at India for its new role. The ISA will drive a lot of R&D activities exclusively on solar - from electricity generation to storage capacity. Once we achieve creating cost-effective storage capacity (batteries), solar power will play a significant rolein driving us towards universal energy access. ISA aims to mobilise more than $1 trillion in investments by 2030 for massive deployment of solar energy. How would it do that? We are not a bank. So, we can't lend money. But we can always facilitate and create an ecosystem so that the money flows in. We have financial partners in World Bank, European Investment Bank, Inter-American Development Bank and others. We are planning partnership with Asian Development Bank and African Development Bank as well. The idea is to persuade them to earmark at least 10% of their credit to solar power. How will the ISA celebrate its historic day? December 6 will be the ISA's foundation day. We have urged all member countries to celebrate it as 'Universal Energy Access Day'. We have also requested them to make people aware of theISA's existence, its role and how it will play a key role in providing clean energy to everyone. So far, 46 countries have signed up and 15, including France, have ratified it. What about China, Japan, the US and others? China, at various levels at the COP23 last month and even otherwise, expressed interest because essentially we are talking about $1trillion investment by 2030 on solar in member countries. It means China should be happy because a lot more solar photovoltaic cells will be used world over. (China is the leader in PV manufacturing). As far as Japan is concerned, they have expressed interest to join the ISA. The US, of course, will take more time. I hope they will take a conscious decision depending on their perception and national interest. \"

Mr Sy points out that more than 90 per cent of natural hazards are now regarded as climate-related, and demand for Red Cross Red Crescent humanitarian services is likely to surge. Writing in a foreword to the IFRCs new Framework for Climate Action Toward 2020, Mr Sy says that in the last ten years Red Cross and Red Crescent National Societies have taken great strides in integrating climate risks in their operations and engaging with governments and other partners. The IFRCs budget for the next four years provides for these Societies to continue to be supported in their auxiliary role to contribute to the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Outputs include improving early-warning systems, awareness raising, and the adoption of values and practices that are both informed about climate risk and environmentally responsible. The Framework is issued today to coincide with a cluster of side-events centred on resilience at the COP23 climate talks in Bonn. Mr Sy writes that community resilience is both our own institutional priority and The Framework document represents the IFRCs plan to keep pace with the changing operational, scientific and policy landscapes on climate, defining a stronger role for the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement both through programmes in the field, and advocacy in the corridors of power.

It sets out four main areas of work for the Red Cross and Red Crescent to focus on over the next few years, centred on knowledge, adaptation, partnerships, and mitigation and greening. It also asks governments to ensure that the needs of the most vulnerable are addressed in policy-making, to provide increased finance for adaptation and resilience, to ensure local actors play important roles always, and to practise integrated risk management that includes ecosystems. In the field of climate, as much as any other, Mr Sy adds, the Red Cross Red Crescent is the embodiment of the concept of local to global. This Framework document identifies how the Movement can make the most of its comparative advantages, mobilizing the power of humanity in the face of rising risks. \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India354","United Kingdom : Enabling a lower carbon future","November 16, 2017 Thursday","TendersInfo","Earlier this week, the worlds nations met in Bonn for COP23 to discuss how best to achieve the Paris Agreement. Set against a backdrop of fierce floods and fires alongside destructive droughts and hurricanes, its clear that climate change already affects our world and will continue to do so if we do not take meaningful action. Thats why COP23s focus on the Agreements commitment to hold the average temperature rise from pre-industrial times to well below two degrees Celsius - a threshold that is believed to avert the most severe impacts of climate change is so important. A strong and unified approach by nations and governments across the world is key. But I believe that businesses also have a vital and proactive role to play. As Head of Environment for Centrica, this is exactly what Im focused on. With around 90% of our carbon emissions arising from customer energy consumption, the greatest role we can play is to give our customers the products and services they need to reduce their energy use and carbon footprint. Im pleased that our efforts have helped UK customers save 27mtCO2e from products installed since 2008, which is equivalent to the average annual emissions of 7m UK homes. To enhance our capabilities further and contribute to a lower carbon future, were investing around 1.2bn in our Connected Home and Distributed Energy & Power (DE&P) businesses. Our pioneering Connected Home business is helping customers manage their energy and run their homes like never before. From smart plugs to smart lights, our Hives family of products is growing and with expansion into new markets like North America, weve now sold over a million Connected Home products that can help reduce energy use. For example, with just a few taps on the Hive Active Heating app, customers will never have to heat an empty home if their plans change. Through our DE&P business, were aiming to become a leader on grid flexibility and decentralised energy by revolutionising the way large-scale energy users generate, consume and manage their energy. To achieve this, we recently launched Centrica Business Solutions, a one-stop-shop for companies to achieve energy insights, asset optimisation and energy solutions. Earlier this month, we strengthened this customer offering with the acquisition of REstore, Europes leading demand-response aggregator that uses software to turn down the demand of heavy usage commercial and industrial customers to manage grid imbalance which helps bring on renewables, avoid the need to build new power stations and reward customers for their flexibility. Our battery storage scheme for Gateshead Council also supports grid flexibility by meeting peaks in local demand through storing and releasing energy when its needed. \"

The approval of this document is propitious as it echoes the on-going discussions at COP23 in Bonn, Germany to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change and achieve the Paris Agreement's goal of keeping global temperature rises to 1.5C. The African continent is a minor contributor to global warming but is highly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change that threatens its economic development. However, the continent also has enormous opportunities to build resilience to climate change as well as transition towards low-carbon development. The commitment of the African continent to contribute to global solutions to climate change is demonstrated by the fact that all 54 countries have submitted their 'Intended National Determined Contribution' under the Paris Agreement, and 43 of these countries have actually ratified the Agreement. The CCAP2 is designed to incorporate the Bank's High 5 priorities in the Paris Agreement, the 2030 development agenda, the Bank's Green Growth Framework and the lessons learned in the implementation of the first climate change action plan (CCAP1), 2011-2015 Akinwumi Adesina, President of the African Development Bank said: ""The approval of the CCAP2 by the Board today sends a clear message on the Bank's commitment to helping African countries to mobilize resources to support the implementation of the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions of our Regional Member Countries in a way that will not hinder their development."" The strategic vision of CCAP2 is to enable the achievement of 'low - carbon and climate-resilient' development in Africa. It has four Pillars: Mitigation, Adaptation, Climate Finance and a Cross Cutting Pillar that addresses technology transfer, capacity development, institutional reforms as well as other cross-cutting activities that will create of the enabling environment for its successful implementation. ""Over the next four years, the AfDB hopes to achieve the objectives set out in the CCAP2, to help our member countries to be developed and resilient while keeping Africa a low-emitting continent,"" said Amadou Hott, Vice President of the Power, Energy, Climate Change and Green Growth Complex. The interventions identified under CCAP2 aim at bringing economic prosperity to African communities within safe planetary boundaries, including the boundaries imposed by climate change. Achieving this requires substantial investments from the Bank and its partners. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Pivotal Sources.

"COP23","India","COP23_India356","Fiji : Fiji's green bond launch sees unprecedented support","November 2, 2017 Thursday","TendersInfo","Two weeks after the launch of Fijis Green Bond, the Fijian Government has announced the issuance of the first bonds on 1 November after receiving overwhelming interest both among domestic and international investors. The enthusiastic reception for this sovereign bondthe first in the Southern Hemisphere, first in an emerging economy, and just third globally after similar green bonds by the governments of France and Polandmarks a clear signal of the business communitys support for funding sustainable development in Fiji. Attorney-General and Minister for Economy Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum welcomed the unprecedented level of interest in Fijis Green Bonds as a big win for both the Fijian people and for climate adaptation financing the world over. With this issuance, weve shown that Fiji is not only leading in climate advocacy, as President of COP23 The first tranche floated FJD40 million to be offered, but the week-long tender saw an oversubscription that ballooned to more than double that amount, with FJD87.71 million subscribed. Of that total, FJD60.10 million in subscriptions were received in tenders for the offerings 5-Year maturation, with an additional FJD27.61 million received for the 13-Year tenor. Notably, the Green Bond attracted overseas investment, the first time Fiji has ever received international investment for a FJD-denominated bond. The participation rate recorded in the tender was extremely robust-- three times the rate normally associated with Fiji Government Infrastructure Bonds. Fijis domestic commercial banks also showed record support, putting in a combined FJD40 million tender-- the highest-ever amount subscribed by the industry. Because the tender oversubscribed, a total of FJD13.27 million was allotted to the banks. Additional local investors included insurance companies, the Fiji National Provident Fund, and the Unit Trust of Fiji, among others. This sizable oversubscription is a demonstrable show of confidence for the concept of sovereign green bondsa new and innovative idea--not just in Fiji, but around the world, said RBF Governor Ariff Ali. With Fijis Green Bond, investors are diversifying their investment portfolios with sustainable development funding; far and wide, investors are seeing this not only a smart a business decision, but an ethical one. As advertised, only FJD20 million for each the 5-Year and 13-Year tenor was accepted, with coupon rates of 4.00% and 6.30% per annum, respectively. There will be subsequent issues in the coming months in order to raise the total targeted amount of FJD100 million. \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India357","Report finds India on course to meet their climate targets","November 9, 2017 Thursday","Times of India (Electronic Edition)","Sixteen of 25 major carbon emitting countries, including the United States, Australia, Canada and the EU nations (counted together) are not on track to achieve their Paris pledges, says a new global report released here on Wednesday . The report, based on scientific analysis of what all the top 25 emitters have been doing to cut their emissions, noted that only nine of these countries including India and China are \\x93on track to achieve or even overachieve their self-determined unconditional\\x93 targets. This new report by the International Institute for Applied national Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) and two other institutions including New Climate Institute provides an overview of projected greenhouse gas emissions in 25 major emitting countriesregion up to 2030, taking into account the emission trajectories based on current policies and implementation of their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. The report, while highlighting how most developed countries were falling short, attributed their poor record on the higher commitments made. It noted that a country likely to meet its NDC was not necessarily undertaking more stringent action on mitigation than a country which is not on track, as this depends on the ambition level for the nationally determined target, and because countries have different policy making approaches. \\x93Nevertheless, as countries are adopting implementation measures, it is essential that the gaps between mitigation targets and current policy trajectories begin to close, in the years to come\\x93, it said while noting that the new study would provide useful information for dialogue next year. Though the NDCs are meant for actions under the Paris Agreement post-2020, it is important for countries to finetune their current policy trajectories so that they can achieve their individual targets and a common goal to keep the average global temperature rise below 2 degree Celsius by the end of this century . The report comes two days after India questioned the developed countries on their sluggish record during pre-2020 commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol. India reminded the rich nations of their previ ous commitment on the inaugural day of the climate conference ( COP23 ) and sought them to walk the talk. Besides India and China, the other countries who are roughly on track to achieve their Paris pledges include Brazil, Colombia, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Ukraine and Turkey .The countries that require additional measures to achieve their targets are: Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, Congo, Ethiopia, the EU, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Morocco, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Thailand, Philippines and USA. This report has substantiated what the United Nations environment programme had said in its 'Emission Gap Report'. It had said the national pledges on emission reduction, made by countries across the globe under the Paris Agreement, will only bring a third of what is needed to avoid the worst impact of climate change. \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India358","Smart power at play","March 15, 2018 Thursday","The Pioneer (India)","India, March 15 -- The International Solar Alliance aptly demonstrates the value of soft power in the pursuit of a specific initiative. It is India's chance to lead the climate change challenge The distribution of global power is rapidly evolving, precipitating far-reaching economic and political changes affecting nations of every size and standing, reads the introductory sentence of the The Soft Power 30 report of 2015. This comment aptly summarises the underlying power of the International Solar Alliance (ISA), a brainchild of India, that was launched along with France at the COP21 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in 2015. In just three years, the alliance has become a reality, a quick progression, generally unseen in the diplomatic community. India along with France has created an international treaty-based intergovernmental organisation that may affect the world order, at least in terms of energy and create a new developmental model. The alliance, according to the Paris Declaration on the International Solar Alliance, is open to membership from 121 solar resource-rich countries that lie fully or partially between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. Membership is on a voluntary basis with no targets or legal obligations imposed on member countries and is based solely on shared collective goals. Unlike hard power, whose stratagem focuses on military intervention, coercive diplomacy and economic sanctions to achieve international objectives, the International Solar Alliance eschews traditional foreign policy tools of the carrot (reward and punishment to induce desired behaviour) and the stick (coercion), emphasising instead on using its network, attractiveness and appeal to persuade and draw member nations into its structure. India, sitting in the driver's seat of this alliance, has the power to both steer the organisation and frame the agenda. If hard power is push, soft power is pull; and India has pulled over 60 countries to the founding summit of the International Solar Alliance hosted in New Delhi. It is interesting to note that French President Emmanuel Macron's maiden visit to India signalled stronger cooperation between the two nations. Joseph Nye, a proponent of soft power, contends that a nation can increase its soft power through engaging, informing and influencing the Governments and citizens of other countries. Drawing from this argument, India can advance its soft power status through the International Solar Alliance in three possible ways. First, a majority of the potential members of the International Solar Alliance are developing countries with large agrarian populations who face similar challenges like energy deficiency and are in need for a stronger voice in the international community. The alliance will give these nations a voice and act as a platform to share experiences and narrow technological gaps through cooperation and increased engagement between Governments, businesses and the citizenry. India will also be instrumental in shaping the International Solar Alliance's agenda as it houses the Secretariat and is a member of the steering committee - two factors that will raise India's soft power. Second, India, along with France, is driving the ""world's largest renewable energy expansion programme"", that will help transform the lives of people through simple devices like solar lanterns, cookers, water pumps and solar street lights. This soft, relatively cheaper and sustainable approach provides a positive development pathway. This may be done by skilling people and utilising indigenous renewable resources for industrialisation and employment generation. Western nations benefited from a cheap carbon-based economy to fuel their development, ushering in improvements in productivity, income and standard of living. However, the model is clearly not sustainable and the world is witnessing the ill-effects of a carbon-economy such as deforestation and climate change. Today, the International Solar Alliance can be an enabler and act as a launch pad for nations to reap the same benefits from renewable energy, but through a better and sustainable model. It can, therefore, be argued that this is an initiative that serves to demonstrate the value of soft power in the pursuit of a specific initiative. It is India's chance at climate leadership. Third, the International Solar Alliance will seek to achieve the seventh UNDP Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) to ""ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all"" by enhancing international cooperation, upgrading technology, promoting investment and increasing infrastructure by 2030. India has assumed a leadership role and has successfully created an organisation that aims to tackle this important universal goal. In fact, the International Solar Alliance is the only agency under the United Nations system that is working on achieving these goals, giving India an opportunity to demonstrate its leadership capacity, especially in the developing world. The appeal of India's soft power rests in its promise to deliver key international objectives without high costs and unpopularity associated with hard power. India has attracted the attention of the West and central African nations such as Nigera, Ghana, Gabon and Sudan, with whom it has traditionally not shared deep-rooted ties as it does with some east African countries such as Kenya and Zanzibar. India can use the International Solar Alliance as a strategic, monetary and knowledge transfer platform to smartly counterbalance other nation's aggressive and growing presence in the African continent. In this summit, India has extended a $1.4 billion Line of Credit to support 27 projects in 15 countries, of which 23 projects are in African nations. The summit witnessed the participation of 60 countries, 23 of whom were represented by Heads of States, indicating the keenness of nations to be a part of this new alliance. The success of this alliance in part hinges on India and France's credibility and willingness to take the International Solar Alliance forward. India, for its part, has demonstrated both. Its commitment to solar energy is evident from the increase in installed solar power capacity from three gigawatts in 2014 to 20 GW in 2017, as reported by Bridge to India. Moreover, India also played a crucial role in according the status of a treaty-based international intergovernmental organisation to the International Solar Alliance. Finally, the summit also signalled India's ability to engage with and attract global audiences and is proof that India has developed and communicated a compelling narrative, established an international norm and drew on key resources to allure one country to another. Indeed, this approach is soft, long-term and tangible: It is smart power at play.

"COP23","India","COP23_India359","Bonn climate talks: Finances to prioritise action on water must triple","November 10, 2017 Friday","IANS-English","Bonn, Nov 10 -- With 40 per cent of the world's population to face water shortages by 2050, financing for national climate plans with an adaptation component submitted under the Paris Climate Change Agreement prioritise action on water would need to triple to 255 billion euros (about $295 billion) per year to meet such targets This was a key message of the international water community on Friday at their action event during the COP23 UN Climate Change Conference here. ""Sustainable use of water for multiple purposes must remain a way of life and needs to be at the centre of building resilient cities and human settlements and ensuring food security in a climate change context,"" said Women for Water Partnership President Mariet Verhoef-Cohen, according to a statement. The international water community co-signed what it called a ""nature-based solution declaration"" at the opening of the Water Action Day to encourage the use of natural systems in managing healthy water supplies. Obstacles in accessing funding to meet climate change investment requirements in the water sector hinders achievement of UN Sustainable Development Goal Six (ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all), as well as endangering the Paris Agreement's goal to keep the average global temperature rise well below two degrees Celsius and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees. ""Involving both women and men in decision making and integrated water resources initiatives leads to better sustainability, governance and efficiency,"" said Verhoef-Cohen, who is also the Co-Chair of Water Scarcity in Agriculture Platform. The international water community encompasses several networks, including ClimateIsWater, Alliance for Global Water Adaptation and Global Alliances for Water and Climate. The community underlined the imperative to develop closer cooperation within the climate community, as well as the energy, agriculture, urban, health, and oceans communities. Water community experts said countries should turn their commitments into ambitious actions, notably by enhancing the efforts announced in their national climate plans - known as nationally-determined contributions. Two years after the world united around the Paris Climate Agreement and a year after its entry into force, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change's (UNFCCC) 197 parties have been reconvened for the 23rd annual climate change talks in Bonn till November 17. --IANS vg/vd \"

Making the Country Statement at COP-23 in Bonn Today, the Minister said that at times, it may be difficult to take hard measures to address climate change, as we have still not fully come to terms with the enormity of the challenge. Dr. Harsh Vardhan emphasized that India's traditional wisdom can be a beacon of light, as its glorious traditions have stood for sustainable lifestyles and care for nature for centuries. Appreciating the initiative taken by the Fijian Presidency for adopting the Bula spirit of inclusiveness for guiding climate change discussions and action, Dr. Harsh Vardhan underlined the fact that India supports an inclusive approach and believes that citizens are important stakeholders and must also be included in this process. He added that if all global citizens contribute to 'green good deeds', the challenge of combating climate change shall become more manageable. The following is the text of the Environment Minister's Country Statement at COP-23 in Bonn: ""At the outset, let me convey my sincere thanks to the COP Presidency, Government of Fiji for steering the Twenty Third Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC and Government of Germany for their warm hospitality and hosting this COP. We look forward to working closely with the COP Presidency towards achieving a meaningful and balanced outcome at COP 23 . COP 23 is extremely crucial as it would set the stage for the 2018 Facilitative Dialogue, accelerate pre 2020 action and firm up the modalities for implementation of the Paris Agreement. India has deep cultural and historic ties with Fiji. Like Fiji, India has a long coastline of 7,517 Km spread over 9 States and 4 Union territories. It has 1382 islands, some of which are quite large. The coastal areas support a number of economic and strategic activities and are highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. Our countries, have had a history of shared challenges and long standing cooperation. I assure you of our highest commitment to support you in your efforts for charting out a strong and holistic approach to combating climate change. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the world leaders and everyone gathered here today for their resolution to uphold the Paris Agreement in form and spirit and once again demonstrate the success of multilateralism. However, this is only the beginning. The task ahead is its effective operationalization in accordance with the agreed principles of Equity and Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC). We must also address the issue of climate justice. The climate change challenge that we face today is result of unsustainable lifestyles and consumption patterns which are not necessarily linked to higher levels of well-being. We may at times find it difficult to take hard measures to address climate change as we still have not fully come to terms with the enormity of the challenge. It often takes a hurricane, a massive hole in the Antarctic ice sheet, a devastating forest fire or an extreme flood event, to humble us, and remind us of our role in the current crisis, and nudge us to take action. We need not always wait for scientific reports to act. Additional and early Pre -2020 actions by developed countries under Kyoto Protocol and provision of Finance, Technology Transfer and Capacity building support to developing countries are critical for limiting the global temperature rise to 2\'b0C by end of century while keeping the door open to keep it below 1.5\'b0C. India's climate actions are synchronized with its development goals and simultaneously reflect its bold vision for combating climate change. India has undertaken ambitious mitigation and adaptation actions in the field of clean energy, especially renewable energy, enhancement of energy efficiency, development of less carbon intensive and resilient urban centers, promotion of waste to wealth, safe, smart and sustainable green transportation network, abatement of pollution and efforts to enhance carbon sink through creation of forest and tree cover. Planned actions and economic reforms have contributed positively to the rapidly declining growth rate of energy intensity in India and steps are being undertaken to de-couple the Indian energy system from carbon in the long run. However, poverty eradication remains an overriding priority for us as we strive to ensure housing, electricity and food security for all. India has taken ambitious targets in its NDC and is on path for achieving those. This is in line with all our glorious traditions which have for centuries stood for sustainable lifestyles and care for nature. In fact India's traditional wisdom can be a beacon of light at this stage. We appreciate the initiative by the Fijian Presidency for adopting the Bula spirit of inclusiveness for guiding climate change discussions and action. India supports an inclusive approach and believes that citizens are important stakeholders and must also be included in this process. I think if all global citizens contribute to 'green good deeds', the challenge of combating climate change shall become more manageable. Going forward, we expect that the COP 23 outcomes are balanced and reached upon through a party-driven process. They should not result in reinterpretation of the Paris Agreement and equal progress should be made on all pillars. At COP 21 in Paris, Mr. Narendra Modi, Indian Prime Minister and Mr. Francois Hollande, French President released a book 'Ecology of our worlds: views on climate and the environment'. It highlighted the wisdom of ancient and contemporary thinkers on the environment and climate, to serve as guidance to inspire the necessary transformation and pave the way for harmonious co-existence between humans and nature and a communion between our inner self and outer life. It is in this spirit that we are organizing sessions on Yoga at the India Pavilion here in Bonn. I welcome you all to come and benefit from this ancient Indian practice, the spiritual aspects of which, can address lifestyle related issues and provide a solution to climate change. UN Secretary General U Thant, in his address at the 7th General Assembly held in New York in 1970, pondered what a future universal historian on another planet would say about us 'With all their genius and with all their skill, they ran out of foresight and air and food and water and ideas.' This is not a future we wish to leave for our children. This is our chance to act fast and do more to save the only planet that we have got. Let us make ourselves proud. \"

Following meetings this week with world and business leaders, state and city representatives, and civil society, the two leaders pointed to the urgency for climate action and the need for a massive ramp-up of investment. Countries are successfully reducing emissions and building resilience to climate change, but getting to the level of action needed to reach the global goals set in Paris two years ago will require a huge leap in the flow of financing and investment for implementing the National Determined Contributions, said Secretary General Guterres. The disasters we are currently seeing including storms, floods and drought are also demonstrating just how urgent the need is especially for the Small Islands Nations. President Kim speaking during the Bloomberg Global Business Forum said: There are vast opportunities in developing countries in areas like clean energy and climate-smart agriculture that will lay the groundwork for a more prosperous and sustainable future. Our challenge is to create the conditions for investment to flow, and to get all forms of finance working together for maximum impact. The new Invest4Climate platform is designed to bring together national governments, financial institutions, private sector investors, philanthropies, and multilateral banks to support transformational climate action in line with the Paris Agreement. The platform will bring together investors with high-impact opportunities in developing countries such as large-scale development of battery storage, electric cars, and low emission air conditioning. It will also facilitate such investments through the development of risk mitigation instruments and, based on demand, will work with national governments to improve policy environments. Cities are leading the way in confronting climate change, and they would be doing even more, even faster, if they had greater access to funding, said Michael R. Bloomberg, UN Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change. This is a big challenge that we can start to address with practical steps, like helping cities improve their credit rating, measure their funding needs, and connect specific projects with lenders. The World Bank and UN are taking an important step forward by bringing people together who are in a position to help achieve those goals."" Invest4Climate will be supported by national finance ministers, climate thought leaders, chief executives of firms, foundations and financial institutions, as well as senior representatives from the UN and the World Bank Group. It will not have its own funding sources but will complement existing climate and development finance initiatives and institutions. The platform will be further developed in close collaboration with partners at the forthcoming World Bank/IMF Annual Meetings and COP23 . The first Invest4Climate initiatives are expected to be announced at the Climate Summit in Paris in December 2017. \"

The Summit, the focus of which was on drawing participation of various actors related to climate funds, brought together some 4,000 people, including government leaders of Canada, the UK and other 50-odd countries; such heads of international organizations as Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Chairman Lee Hoe-sung of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and Executive Director Howard Bamsey of the Green Climate Fund (GCF); Bill Gates and other entrepreneurs; and Governor Jerry Brown of the US state of California. The Summit consisted of four panel discussions on scaling up finance for climate action, greening finance for sustainable business, accelerating local and regional climate action, and strengthening policies for ecological and inclusive transition, as well as a high-level segment. In the high-level segment, President Macron highlighted the importance of commitment of state actors, provincial governments and diverse other stakeholders; welcomed the initiatives and pledges (for phasing out coal and for clean transportation) announced by governments and private sectors at the Summit; and spoke of the plan to set up an on-line platform where stakeholders can share among themselves progress in the implementation thereof. UN Secretary-General Guterres underscored the need to fulfill the pledge to raise 100 billion US dollars in climate fund by 2020; pointed out that proper policies should be put in place in order to attract private capital to climate fund coffers; and stressed that the GCF should become an effective and flexible system. Former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, mentioning that the world had entered a new era in the wake of the adoption of the Paris Climate Change Agreement, stressed that the international community should double efforts to build a sustainable future and, particularly, be more united in raising and employing climate funds to facilitate the implementation of the Paris Climate Change Agreement. The One Planet Summit is seen to have served as an opportunity for the international community, as it had done at the 23rd session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP23 ) to the UN Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in November, to express its shared political commitment to faithfully implement the Paris Climate Change Agreement. In addition, with central and provincial governments as well as private sectors having shared among themselves relevant experiences and announced initiatives, the event is seen to have played a role in prompting diverse actors to take climate action. \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India365","Bonn Climate Conference: Demonstrators walk out of US organised pro-coal event","November 14, 2017 Tuesday","India Blooms","Bonn, Nov. 14 -- As the second highest emitter in the world after China and the highest historically, US will, ironically, be the only country in the world to be out of the agreement - as Nicaragua and Syria express their intent to join the treaty. Following the walkout, protestors continued the demonstrations outside the hall. Panelists, meanwhile, presented to a near empty hall. The speakers at the event argued that coal would be used for some time to come and the way to go was to explore clean coal, which includes a system of technologies to clean up the emissions from coal, including Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), and the potential of small nuclear plants. The arguments were supported with reports published by energy think tanks, including the International Energy Agency (IEA). Released at an opportune time, the Global Carbon Budget Report stated that the world's carbon emissions will go up by 2% by end of 2017. This will be the first increase in global emissions since 2014, and is mainly attributed to increased coal use in China; the rise has been recorded at a time when the world needs to drive down its emissions rapidly. The member states, on Monday, finally reached a decision on how to deal with agriculture at COP23 in Bonn, Germany. The final decision, which was read out to the group of negotiators and observers, was met with congratulations and jubilation; and parties have been invited to submit adaptation assessment methods for improvement of soil health, soil carbon and soil quality. Even as negotiators consider the decision a small step towards a larger goal, developing countries, including India, that have been reeling from agricultural losses due to unpredictable extreme weather and successive droughts have a reason to rejoice. However, considering India's sincere efforts to address climate change, the country, unfortunately, failed to articulate its successes with regard to the 2020 commitments at the conference, losing a significant opportunity to rightfully demand enhanced action and efforts from other developed countries. As latest reports state, India is ""likely to over-achieve"" its target for 2020 and is among the small group of countries on track to achieve their self-declared climate targets under the 2015 Paris Agreement, it was noted that stressing on such successes would have positioned India as a sincere player and the country needed a stronger narrative to push its climate goals. Unlike EU and China though, India showed reluctance in taking up the leadership role after US's announcement of its decision to pull out of the Paris climate pact.

"COP23","India","COP23_India366","India : India Pitches for Strong Pre-2020 Climate Action by Developed Countries","November 7, 2017 Tuesday","TendersInfo","The opening plenary of the 23rd Conference of Parities (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) provided a flicker of hope to the poor and vulnerable people in the developing countries who are most at risk to the adverse impacts of climate change. The much forgotten, pre-2020 agenda, under which developed countries are to ratify the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (KP II) to undertake greenhouse gas emission cuts and also provide finance and technology support to developing countries for enhancing their ambition, found a place in the COP 23 agenda. Meeting the long-term temperature goal of limiting the temperature rise to 2C by the end of century requires strong short-term action. Enhanced pre-2020 action will reduce the overall costs and economic challenges for making a transition to low carbon growth pathway and also reduce climate risks and help realize immediate co-benefits such as improved public health as a result of lower air pollution, improved energy security, reduced crop yield losses among others. India along with the Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDC) group strongly voiced the need for urgent time bound action on climate change by developed countries in the pre-2020 period to build trust and confidence for ambitious climate action in post 2020 era. In his intervention, Chief Negotiator of India on Climate Change, Mr. Ravi S. Prasad, called for early time-bound ratification of KP II by developed countries to ensure the highest possible mitigation efforts under the Convention by all Parties. He further added that this agenda is of utmost importance for developing countries and is not new but was agreed upon and under discussion since 2007. While action on Post-2020 period under the Paris Agreement has gained momentum, the discussions on Pre-2020 actions have lagged behind. COP 23 is critical and maybe the last chance for the developing countries to fight for their right to development and the global carbon space by ensuring that the developed countries act on their pre-2020 commitments. It is the foundation upon which climate action should be built after the year 2020. \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India367","Paris pledges only a third of what is needed to avoid worst impacts of climate change, says UNEP emission gap report","November 1, 2017 Wednesday","The Times of India (TOI)","NEW DELHI: National pledges on emission reduction, made by countries from across the globe under the Paris Agreement, will only bring a third of what is needed to avoid worst impact of climate change, says a report of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Released in Geneva on Tuesday, the report notes that even full implementation of current unconditional and conditional national climate actions makes a temperature increase of at least 3 degree Celsius by 2100 - meaning that the governments need to deliver much stronger pledges when they are revised in 2020. The Paris Agreement, approved by 195 countries in December, 2015, aims to limit global warming to under 2 degree Celsius, with a more ambitious goal of 1.5 degree Celsius also on table. The countries had, therefore, pledged to take their voluntary climate actions including emission reduction through multiple measures to meet the target. It is expected that meeting these targets would reduce the likelihood of severe climate impacts that could damage human health, livelihoods and economies across the globe. The UNEP report has, however, found that these pledges would only bring a third of the reduction in emissions required by 2030 to meet climate targets. It, therefore, pitched for an urgent need to increase the ambition by both governments and non-state actors.The report - UNEP's Emission Gap Report - was released just days ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ) in Bonn where the member countries including India will during November 6-17 Conference discuss guidelines to implement actions under the Paris Agreement which had come into force in November last year.The Emission Gap Report finds that current Paris pledges make 2030 emissions likely to reach 11 to 13.5 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) above the level needed to stay on the least-cost path to meeting the 2 degree Celsius target. One gigatonne is roughly equivalent to one year of transport emissions in the European Union (including aviation). The emission gap in the case of the 1.5 degree Celsius target is 16 to 19 GtCO2e. ""One year after the Paris Agreement entered into force, we still find ourselves in a situation where we are not doing nearly enough to save hundreds of millions of people from a miserable future"", said Erik Solheim, head of UNEP. ""This is unacceptable. If we invest in the right technologies, ensuring that the private sector is involved, we can still meet the promise we made to our children to protect their future. But we have to get on the case now"", he said while pitching for urgent actions in view of the emission gap between the target and current pledges under the Paris deal.The report claims that the carbon dioxide emissions have remained stable since 2014, driven in part by renewable energy, notably in China and India. However, it warns that other greenhouse gases, such as methane, are still rising and a global economic growth spurt could easily put CO2 emissions back on an upward trajectory.

"COP23","India","COP23_India368","South Africa : National Stakeholder Consultation in preparation for International Climate Change Talks","October 5, 2017 Thursday","TendersInfo","Distinguished ladies and gentlemen. It is my pleasure to be with you today as we finalise our negotiating position and key messages that will guide South Africas delegation in the negotiations at the twenty third session of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to be held in Bonn, Germany in November 2017. I am particular pleased to see a number of women and youth represented in this meeting from different organizations. Now allow me to share some thoughts on this subject, that is notably the biggest challenge facing humanity in the 21st century. The recent unprecedented hurricanes in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico, and floods and droughts in Sierra Leone and Ethiopia, remind us that the impacts of climate change are being felt today. We are confronted by a reality that compels us to invest far more seriously in adaptation, ensure investment in climate friendly technologies, and addressing loss and damage from both slow onset and extreme weather events. The recent catastrophes also make it clear that there can be no turning back on the collective effort in the fight against climate change, and as such the hard-won consensus in Paris cannot be re-negotiated. We must maintain the political momentum and demonstrate through our collective actions that we will stay the course, honour our commitments, and deliver future cycles of progressively more ambitious contributions. We therefore encouraged the United States of America to reaffirm its commitment to the Paris consensus, and to further play its key role in addressing climate change, which is one of the most serious and pressing challenges facing humanity in our times. I am of the view that it will be important to keep the Bonn Climate Conference in November 2017 ( COP 23 I will address some key points in the South African negotiating position that we encourage you to engage on in preparation for COP 23 in Bonn, Germany. The outcome for the Bonn Climate Change Conference should: Allow me to say a few words on Adaptation and limits to adaptation which is a key priority for Africa. Limits to adaptation (Loss and damage) It is generally agreed that COP 23 will be a technical COP but most importantly a Loss and Damage COP with Fiji being the COP President. It is in this context that South Africa express its concern about the increasing devastating events associated with the adverse effects of climate change on the African continent. We therefore call for the enhancement of institutional arrangements and support, in terms of finance, technology and capacity-building, in order for the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with climate change impacts to achieve its mandate and fulfil its functions. We further call for the expeditious completion of the five-year work plan of the Executive Committee of the Warsaw International Mechanism, which should take into consideration the priorities identified by developing countries to assist them in preparing and implementing plans and strategies that address current and anticipated losses and damages in the light of the agreed temperature goal, and the associated financial resources. South Africa call for the operationalization of the global goal on adaptation, including the development of indicators to enable tracking the collective efforts towards achieving it. Furthermore, we call for the finalisation of the guidance on minimum information to be communicated under adaptation communications by all countries, including as a component of nationally determined contributions, by COP 23 , in a manner that takes into account information on developing countries needs and associated costs, including the support needed to implement adaptation action. \"

The French minister was here to prepare for President Emmanuel Macron's visit to India in December. Excerpts from an interview to TOI: How do you look at the US decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement? Is it not a setback to global efforts to face the challenges of climate change?The decision of the US is a challenge for the international community , particularly for those in the poorest countries and small Island states. Yet, I still believe that the fight against climate change is going on, even in the US.When President Donald Trump announced that the US would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, we saw many companies, mayors, and governors say , \\x93Paris Agreement: we are still in\\x93. What would be the fate of the Paris Agreement now when the second biggest carbon emitter, the US, is out of the deal three years from now?The Paris Agreement is not under threat. First of all, thanks to announcements by leaders such as President Emmanuel Macron and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the international community sent a clear signal that the Paris Agreement is non-renegotiable and irreversible. But a second parameter demonstrates that the Paris Agreement remains and will remain the cornerstone of climate action. The corporate and industrial world as well as citizens support climate action and the Paris Agreement because they know that this is the only way to bring growth, create jobs while eradicating poverty , and enhancing the quality of life of all the citizens of the world. Will France or the EU together fill the gap in efforts as far as scaling up climate action ambitions are concerned?In July, France published a new climate plan to enhance its contribution to the Paris Agreement. The same plan announces that we will introduce a bill in Parliament in September to ban all new permits for fossil fuel exploration in France. How would you interpret the possibility of renegotiation of the Paris Agreement, what the US administration hinted?The Paris Agreement is the most balanced and comprehensive universal agreement on climate change. As various leaders have stated during the G7 and G20 summits, it's not renegotiable. What are your (France) expectations from the upcoming COP23 in Bonn, specifically when the US has decided to join it despite announcing that it will not be part of the deal?Bonn will be a working COP, to progress on rules of implementation for the Paris Agreement, but also consolidate the universal alliance of all of those who want to do more for climate change mitigation. It was in this spirit that President Macron announced that France would host a summit on December 12 to celebrate the second anniversary of the Agreement, and make it an opportunity to mobilize finance for supporting innovation and more ambitious action. \"

We dont want to speak only about climate change but about climate catastrophe [] What can we do? There are alternatives, especially from the indigenous peoples, especially from the wisdom of indigenous women, said Roberto Espinoza, Advisor for the Interethnic Association for the development of the Peruvian Rainforest (Asociation Interetnica de Desarrollo de la Selva Peruana AIDESEP), at a press conference. Rosalia Yampis, Director of the Womens Program in AIDESEP, also highlighted the very important role indigenous women can have in climate adaptation. Women have this ancestral knowledge about seeds and what we have to sow, she told the press conference. She added that indigenous peoples are providing input to Perus national contribution to the Paris Agreement in protecting the watershed. There are about 13 million indigenous peoples in Peru. As a national indigenous rights organization, AIDESEP works to improve the health, education and housing of these peoples. It is a member organization of the Coordinator of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon River Basin (COICA). According to AIDESEP, it is amply demonstrated that indigenous territories are fundamental for the conservation of forests. In them, generally, deforestation is minimal, even less than in some protected natural areas. Therefore, on Tuesday, one of the main strategies to counteract the loss and degradation of forests in the Peruvian Amazon is to ensure the safety and sustainable management of these territories, explains the organization on its website. There are alternatives with the wisdom and knowledge of our peoples. We, as indigenous peoples, are working on these alternatives, said Janio Sangama, from the region of San Martin, which is mostly located in the upper part of the Peruvian Amazon rainforest. When we speak about sustainable development, we are looking after the management of our resources in a more orderly way. We worry about deforestation, he added. In San Martin, we had a big flood. We have a proposal called hand in hand with Government to confront these natural catastrophes. He said that the indigenous peoples have begun sustainable production or orderly production with technologies from communities. We have been managing alternative crops in our territories. We are not destroying our forest, he underscored. Roberto Espinoza said that water is being reduced because of deforestation. So we are sowing water even if it sounds bizarre with some special plants indigenous people know that can enhance the water cycle underground, he added. Regarding reforestation, Jammek Manikusi, a member of AIDESEP, said indigenous people are concerned about the use of exotic plants, like pine and eucalyptus. These plants have impacts on the soil. We want a natural reforestation with natural wisdom of the peoples, with more proper methodologies, more adapted to natural regeneration of soils in the Amazon.

The two countries produce nearly two-thirds of the worlds annual supply of cocoa. The far-reaching joint Frameworks for Action, led by the World Cocoa Foundation, was announced today at the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ) in Bonn, Germany. Cocoa is one of General Mills' 10 priority ingredients, which the company has committed to 100-percent sustainably source by 2020. More than 70 percent of the cocoa General Mills buys is grown in West African countries including Cote dIvoire and Ghana. Deforestation is a significant challenge, but by aligning and working together we can help put a stop to it and positively impact climate change by rehabilitating the land, said John Church, chief supply chain officer for General Mills. We also recognize there are systemic labor issues in the cocoa supply chain, and we understand it will take industry-wide collaboration to make improvements. Having the national and local governments, who are key to addressing the issues, at the table from the beginning is key. The Frameworks for Action was developed through an extensive, multi-stakeholder process that brought together two national governments, private sector - including farmers and farmers organizations - national and international civil society organizations, development partners, and other stakeholders in Cote dIvoire, Ghana and globally. The Frameworks for Action announced in Bonn, and signed by visionary companies including General Mills, protects and restore forests that have been degraded, accelerates investment in agricultural productivity and engages communities about the importance of this work to their long-term well-being, said Richard Scobey, president of the World Cocoa Foundation. Most of the deforestation in the cocoa sector in West Africa is a result of poor farmers trying to earn a living by going into protected areas to cut down trees to grow cocoa. This means that we must focus on community development, community empowerment, and making sure that farmers' livelihoods are taken in to account and respected. The Framework is centered around three themes: Sustainable production and farmers livelihoods: This covers sustainable intensification and diversification of production to increase farmers yields and income to reduce pressure on forests. Community engagement and social inclusion: This covers social safeguards through civil society and community engagement. This framework will help advance much of the work that we are already doing in these regions to improve the sustainability of cocoa production and foster greater economic vitality for cocoa-growing communities, said Church. It is our view that a greater share of the benefit of more socially and economically sustainable cocoa production practices should accrue to the people who produce the crop. This framework will help better implement that across the region. \"

In partnership with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and co-hosts, the Permanent Missions of Madagascar and Ecuador, the event provided an opportunity to contribute to the conference goal of supporting the implementation of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. The Permanent Mission of Fiji also participated, providing opening remarks as the co-president of the Ocean Conference. Permanent Secretary for Indigenous Affairs, Naipote Katonitabua, noted that the ocean is part of everyday life in Fiji they are not only linked to livelihoods but are also an integral part of our cultural heritage. Moderated by Rosiland Jordan, UN Correspondent for Al Jazeera, the event included a diverse audience of Member State representatives, civil society, academics, scientists, journalists, and NGOs. Presentations by panelists including John Tanzer (WWF), Jean Randrianantenaina (Regional Maritime Information Fusion Center, Madagascar), Francoise Gail (Scientific Advisor, Ocean and Climate Platform), and Mariam Chazalnoel (IOM), covered key issues including direct consequences that climate change-related modifications to the global ocean have on island and coastal populations as the environment, economy and livelihoods of many of these communities depend on oceans. Practical examples were provided regarding how these negative impacts influence the migration patterns of affected communities as well as the daily lives of communities receiving migrants. Ashraf El Nour, Director of the IOM Office to the United Nations, expressed concern about the displacement of communities and impact on human settlements who live near and rely on the worlds oceans for their livelihoods. He noted that, according to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), 24.2 million people last year were displaced due to natural disasters in the world, principally floods and storms, many of them made worse by the climate change impacts in oceans coastal areas. Slow environmental degradation in coastal areas, such as sea level rise or coastal erosion, are also expected to have long-term impacts on migration as people move preemptively to find alternative livelihoods or are forced to relocate inland. The thematic focus of the event was directly relevant to several Partnership Dialogues (PD) of the Ocean Conference: PD 2 (Managing, protecting and conserving marine and coastal ecosystems), PD 3 (Ocean acidification), PD 4 (Making fisheries sustainable), and PD 5 (Increasing economic benefits to Small Islands Developing States and Least Developed Countries). Partnership Dialogues are interactive and multi-stakeholder in nature, focusing on recommendations to support the practical implementation of SDG 14. The Ocean Conference is a key opportunity to bring questions of migration and oceans to the fore, especially as the international community prepares for the COP23 climate negotiations in Bonn, Germany, this November 2017. \"

With the aim of reaching net-zero emissions by the same year, through both campaigns, the company has an immediate opportunity to accelerate the roll-out of renewables and EVs through its own purchasing decisions and by influencing peers to also take action. Through its wholly owned subsidiary and delivery arm ASKUL LOGIST, ASKUL will transfer 200 vehicles to EVs by 2030. This builds on 10 EVs purchased by the company last year. Additionally in the next year, ASKUL intends to source renewable power for logistics centers across Japan. The news was announced today at the ASKUL Environment Forum event in Tokyo, which brings together some 400 participants to discuss ideas for climate action, and comes two weeks after UN climate negotiations at COP23 in Bonn, which highlighted global corporate leadership on climate change. Helen Clarkson, CEO, The Climate Group, said: Its exciting to see ASKUL joining EV100 and RE100 at once. Delivering on these ambitious commitments will inspire other Japanese companies to follow suit, accelerating the roll-out of electric vehicles and renewable energy nationwide. Were witnessing exciting momentum on corporate action in Japan, made possible through our partnership with Japan-CLP. It makes business sense transitioning to electric vehicles and renewable power are two positive steps that companies can take to future-proof their operations and retain a competitive edge. There are currently low proportions of renewable energy and EVs in Japan, but the government is actively growing each market. 71% of total electricity consumption is based on fossil fuels, but with the reform of J-Credits earlier this year and the announced introduction of non-fossil attribute certificates in 2018, renewables are becoming more accessible. Similarly, only 200,000 EVs were on Japan's roads in 2016, but Japan has set a target of 1 million EVs by 2020. Shoichiro Iwata, CEO, ASKUL Corporation, added: Worsening climate change impacts mean businesses must take faster action. Thats why ASKUL is transitioning to electric vehicles and renewable power through The Climate Groups global campaigns. By joining EV100 and RE100, we want to show suppliers that there is demand for delivery use of EVs, and ultimately, that renewable energy could be more readily available to power them. This will help us to shift the market, while delivering on our goal of reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2030, and showing our customers our commitment to sustainable operations. Earlier this month, Japanese shopping mall developer AEON Mall also joined EV100. AEON Mall is encouraging the uptake of EVs by its customers by installing hundreds of charging facilities at its malls in Japan and China. The announcements follow those of leading Japanese house-builder Sekisui House, and Japan-based electronics company Ricoh earlier this year, committing to source 100% renewable electricity by 2040 and 2050 respectively through RE100. \"

""Earlier, we used to plant and protect to improve the condition of a given forest while in the ecosystem approach a holistic approach was adopted in which steps were taken for soil and water conservation allowing the natural green cover to take over under improved conditions,"" Shukla explained. ""So, not only trees came up but also various herbs and shrubs, adding to the biodiversity index."" One major outcome was reduction in the number of forest fires in the state, thanks to the high moisture content. ""Forest fires lead to emission of carbon dioxide in the environment. Our efforts resulted in lessening their number and thus less emission of the carbon dioxide. This was appreciated by the participants at the COP 23 ,"" Shukla said. Sources in the environment and forest department said steps for soil and moisture conservation were started in Nalanda and Banka districts in 2012. ""Later the same practice was replicated across the state which resulted in improvement in water and soil conservation over 1.58 lakh hectares of forest area and in the biodiversity index,"" a source said. \"

The much forgotten, pre-2020 agenda, under which developed countries are to ratify the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (KP II) to undertake greenhouse gas emission cuts and also provide finance and technology support to developing countries for enhancing their ambition, found a place in the COP 23 agenda. India along with the Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDC) group strongly voiced the need for urgent time bound action on climate change by developed countries in the pre-2020 period to build trust and confidence for ambitious climate action in post 2020 era. In his intervention, Chief Negotiator of India on Climate Change, Mr. Ravi S. Prasad, called for early time-bound ratification of KP II by developed countries to ensure the highest possible mitigation efforts under the Convention by all Parties. He further added that this agenda is of utmost importance for developing countries and is not new but was agreed upon and under discussion since 2007. While action on Post-2020 period under the Paris Agreement has gained momentum, the discussions on Pre-2020 actions have lagged behind. COP 23 \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India378","Countries need to take action to limit global warming: UN Environment","October 31, 2017 Tuesday","Zee News","New Delhi, Oct. 31 -- Nearly 200 countries need to take urgent action to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit global warming, UN Environment said on Tuesday. The eighth edition of UN Environment's Emissions Gap report released ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ) in Bonn, found that national pledges only brought a third of the reduction in emissions required by 2030 to meet climate targets. The private sector and sub-national action not increasing at a rate that would help close this worrying gap. Fossil fuels and cement production still account for about 70 per cent of greenhouses gases. ""One year after the Paris Agreement entered into force, we still find ourselves in a situation where we are not doing nearly enough to save hundreds of millions of people from a miserable future,"" an official statement quoting head of UN Environment Erik Solheim said. ""This is unacceptable. If we invest in the right technologies, ensuring that the private sector is involved, we can still meet the promise we made to our children to protect their future. But we have to get on the case now."" Meeting these targets would reduce the likelihood of severe climate impact that could damage human health, livelihoods and economies across the globe. As things stand, even full implementation of current unconditional and conditional Nationally Determined Contributions makes a temperature increase of at least three degrees Celsius by 2100 very likely, meaning that the governments need to deliver much stronger pledges when they are revised in 2020. Should the US follow through with its stated intention to leave the Paris Agreement in 2020, the picture could become even bleaker. However, the Emissions Gap report does lay out practical ways to slash emissions through rapidly expanding mitigation action based on existing options in the agriculture, buildings, energy, forestry, industry and transport sectors. Strong action on other climate forcers such as hydrofluorocarbons, through the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, and other short-lived climate pollutants such as black carbon could also make a real contribution. One gigatonne is roughly equivalent to one year of transport emissions in the European Union, including aviation. The emissions gap in the case of the 1.5 degrees Celsius target is 16 to 19 GtCO2e, higher than previous estimates as new studies have become available. ""The Paris Agreement boosted climate action, but the momentum is clearly faltering,"" Costa Rica's Minister of Environment and Energy and President of the 2017 UN Environment Assembly Edgar E.

Investors and businesses are becoming increasingly aware of the need to understand and manage the risks associated with climate change. In order to explore options for addressing these issues, the EBRD and GCECA will organise a conference entitled Towards a Resilient Financial Sector: Disclosing Physical Climate Risk & Opportunities, to be held at the EBRDs London Headquarters on 31 May 2018. The conference will bring together the financial, technical and policy perspectives to shape market action on climate resilience. The focus will be on improving financial sector awareness of climate risks and their impacts on investments, as well as facilitating the emergence of climate risk and resilience metrics, and identifying ways on which investors and businesses can integrate climate change intelligence into their business strategies and investment planning. Announcing the cooperation, Josu Tanaka, Managing Director, Operational Strategy and Planning, Energy Efficiency and Climate Change, said: We are very pleased to partner with the GCECA, the first international institution with a specific focus on climate change adaptation. Building climate resilient economies requires broad market action by businesses and investors, alongside effective government policies. We see great opportunities for working with the GCECA and a wider range of other stakeholders to enable businesses and investors to realise the value that can be created through building climate resilience. We are grateful that the Paris Agreement has put Climate Adaptation on a par with mitigation but there is a long way to go. Understanding Climate Adaptation is crucial if we want to put paper into practice. Christiaan Wallet, Operations Director of GCECA. The announcement was made today in Bonn at the COP23 climate conference which this year is focussing on the implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. The EBRD is organising four panels on key climate issues and Bank representatives are also taking part in many more events. The EBRD is a major investor in climate finance in many of the 38 emerging economies where it works, a driving force in energy efficiency projects, a pioneer in the development of renewable energy sources and an increasingly important player in adaptation to climate change, having signed almost 180 climate resilience investment since 2011. Under its Green Economy Transition (GET) approach, the EBRD aims to dedicate 40 per cent of its annual investment to green finance by 2020 and is well on the way to achieving this objective. The Global Centre of Excellence on Climate Adaptation helps countries, institutions and businesses to adapt to a warming climate, which is increasing the frequency of natural disasters and causing economic disruptions. It is bringing together international partners, including leading knowledge institutes, businesses, NGOs, local and national governments, international organisations and financial institutions.

As part of the transition to a low carbon business model, BT had previously set itself a target in 2008 of an 80% reduction of its carbon emissions by 2020. After reaching this target four years ahead of schedule, BT has set a new 2030 target, approved by the Science-Based Targets Initiative, which is aligned with the most ambitious aim of the COP21 Paris Agreement. This aim seeks to limit global warming to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit it even further to 1.5C by the end of the century. To meet this ambitious goal BT will be targeting innovative ways to further reduce its dependency on fossil fuels, for example through the adoption of low carbon vehicles in its fleet and reducing the carbon intensity of buildings. Announcing the target BT Chief Sustainability Officer, Niall Dunne, said: The role that technology can play in creating a more resource efficient world is both profound and exciting. The benefits of leading climate action extend to our customers, suppliers and people. Our commitment to this 1.5C target will help create partnerships and coalitions that continue the unstoppable momentum enabled by the Paris agreement. Tom Delay, Chief Executive, the Carbon Trust commented: Over the past two decades BT has made impressive progress in reducing carbon emissions. To continue this journey, our recent work together has mapped out the steps the business will need to take over the coming decades to become a truly low carbon business. The ambition contained within the Paris Agreement gives us hope that we might avoid the most dangerous impacts of climate change. If we are going to deliver on this ambition then this is exactly the sort of leadership we need to see. As part of its wider energy programme, BT has already made significant strides in reducing its end-to-end carbon footprint which has helped to deliver a total of 221m of energy savings since 2009/10. BT is also well on its way to achieving its commitment to purchase 100% renewable electricity for its operations by 2020, where markets allow, sourcing 82% renewably last year. In addition, BT also promotes energy efficiency by providing products and services that enable its customers to reduce emissions. As part of its 2020 ambitions, BT aims to help its customers cut their carbon emissions by at least three times our own end-to-end carbon impact. So far its reached 1.8 times, enabling customers to avoid 10 million tonnes of carbon in 2016/17, up 32% on the previous year. These carbon-abating products and services represented 5.3bn, or 22%, of BTs total revenue last year. BTs commitment to reducing its carbon intensity will help the UK Government meet its carbon reduction targets. International climate negotiations will continue at COP23 in Bonn this November. \"

Two years since the Paris Climate Agreement signalled the intent to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, Greenpeace said leaders meeting in Bonn must now achieve real progress on the Paris Agreements implementation guidelines (the rulebook). Leaders must also set the groundwork for raising climate ambition and ending the injustice of inaction ahead of the first stocktake of collective efforts in 2018. Greenpeace International Executive Director Jennifer Morgan said: We have no time to waste. Our climate is changing, putting people and communities increasingly at threat, from Suva to Washington or anywhere, but we have a window of opportunity to take fast, bold action to deliver true security and justice for every one of us. At this years COP, leaders can start fulfilling the promises they made in Paris and signal their intent to seize the opportunity and the obligation of our time by ramping up climate action. Dubbed the Pacific COP because it is being presided over by Fiji, it will be the first time the global community has met since US President Trump announced Washington would withdraw from the Paris agreement. Fiji has called for Bonn to become a visionary summit and a reaffirmation of climate action. Trumps decision to back out of Paris has backfired spectacularly, sparking a groundswell of support for global climate action. There is no turning back and there will be no renegotiation and that message must be made clear at COP23 . We expect new leaders to emerge in Bonn and the eyes of the world will be on the EU, China and others to step up, Morgan added. The continued hypocrisy of Paris signatories is also being exposed as people around the world take matters into their own hands. On November 14, the Norwegian governments Arctic oil drilling agenda will be challenged in court as part of a global wave of people litigating to hold governments and big polluters to account. (2) Negotiating for global climate action in Bonn while planning to open up the Arctic for oil drilling is simply incompatible and when politicians put oil before people, they need to be held accountable. This is why we are taking Arctic oil to court, Morgan added. In Germany, summit co-host Angela Merkel must also bring substantial climate commitments to the Pacific COP if she is to reclaim her climate-chancellor badge. Greenpeace Germany Executive Director Sweelin Heuss said: Coal is still a major part of Germanys energy mix threatening the nations targeted emissions cuts, while CO2 emissions from the transport sector continue to rise despite the promises of cleaner, more efficient cars. What authority does a COP host hold if it fails to deliver on its own promises? Germany must now kick its coal habit and signal the end of the line for the combustion engine. \"

The EIB financing will support renewable energy and energy efficiency measures in a pulp mill in Timra, Sweden, the regeneration and replanting of 68 000 ha of forest almost three times the area of Stockholm and the construction of 4 250 km of forest roads. The project is expected to create more than 650 new jobs in the rural economy around the mill and will enable SCA to increase its production in an environmentally sustainable way to meet the growing demand for renewable forest products. EIB Vice-President Alexander Stubb, responsible for EIB operations in Northern European countries, said: Our loan to SCA, a major European producer of forest products, will not only decrease the ecological footprint of the pulp, wood and paper products, it will also help to make the market pulp mill energy self-sufficient and to plant thousands of trees. With all eyes on COP23 currently, this is a project that really demonstrates the EIBs firm commitment to climate-related investment. New, advanced process technologies will be installed at the pulp mill in Timr, resulting in substantial energy efficiency gains. Additionally, the mill will be able to make use of renewable resources, like bark and by-products from the production process, for its energy generation, including both power and heat. As a result, the modernised pulp mill will not only be energy self-sufficient and increase its production capacity, but it will be able to export surplus (green) power. The mills carbon footprint will be smaller than that of any comparable mill in the world. SCA is not only the second largest European saw mill company, but the largest private forest owner in Europe. The companys forests absorb more CO2 than the total CO2 discharged by its entire industrial and transport activities each year. SCAs forestry measures financed by the new EIB loan are expected to absorb over 44 000 additional tonnes of CO2 equivalents per year, corresponding to the CO2 emissions generated by 14 000 cars per year. The pulp mill will start up in June 2018 once the modernisation project has been completed. The forestry project and the upgrade of the forest road network will be carried out over a period of five years from 2017 to 2021. We are carrying out a unique project that will bring the strand pulp mill to a leading position in every respect production, quality, environmental performance, says Toby Lawton, CFO of SCA. Were very pleased with the cooperation with EIB, which contributes to the sound and competitive financing of SCA. The European Investment Bank is the worlds largest lender for forest-related investment and over the last five years it has provided EUR 4.5bn for investment in forests around the world. This forest engagement and role as a public bank ensures that only projects with the greatest environmental and economic potential can be supported. Sweden has some of the best and fastest-growing forests in the world and unlocking new investment in forestry is crucial for both the rural economy and the environment. This impressive new investment will both support employment and enable better use of renewable resources. \"

Other countries, including even non-EU nations, too joined the momentum and announced to phase-out coal under a global alliance led by UK and Canada. Besides France, New Zealand, Finland, Denmark, Portugal, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium and Italy are among the 20 countries who joined the alliance to gradually close-down their coal-fired electricity facilities which are among the world's largest sources of air pollution. Referring to the US decision to withdraw the $2 million annual donations to the international body which assesses science related to climate change, Macron said,""I can guarantee that starting from 2018, the IPCC will have all the money it needs and that it will continue to support our decision-making. They will not miss a single euro."" Delivering his country's statement at the inaugural day of the high-level segment here during the ongoing UN climate conference, the French President on Wednesday proposed that Europe replaces America and said, ""France will meet that challenge. I would like to see the largest number of European countries on our side. Altogether, we can compensate for the loss of US funding.""His bold remarks sent quite an encouraging signal to participants as the US President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and also from all future funding to the IPCC put a big question mark on future of the global deal. Underlining French commitment to withdraw from fossil fuels, Macron said that his country had already taken the decision to close all coal-fired power stations by 2021. ""Also, a new law was voted in the national assembly banning all new permits for the exploitation of hydrocarbon sources in our country.

We have decided this because it is vital for us to meet the challenge for the climate and the transition that we want"", said the president amid applause from every corner of the plenary hall.As the conference entered the last leg of the high-level segment, other developed countries too chip in with positive steps. UK and Canada committed to phase coal out of their electricity generation by 2025 and 2030, respectively. Much to the disappointment of countries who have been pitching for decarbonisation of their economies, the co-host of COP23 Germany has, however, not joined the coalition to end use of coal.German chancellor Angela Merkel was, in fact, quite guarded in her statement on coal use issue while delivering her country statement on Wednesday. Around 40% of Germany's energy comes from coal.

The brewery in Falkenberg is now 100% powered by biogas and green electricity. Earlier this year, the Carlsberg Group launched a new sustainability programme - Together Towards Zero. One of its four ambitions ""Zero Carbon Footprint"" is supported by a target to eliminate carbon emissions from all breweries1 and achieving a 30% reduction in the beer-in-hand carbon footprint2 by 2030. To achieve the ambitious targets, Carlsberg Group's breweries will use 100 percent renewable electricity and eliminate coal as a source of energy by 2022. As part of this journey, Carlsberg Sverige's brewery in Falkenberg is now fuelled 100% on biogas and green electricity3, which reduces the brewery's carbon emissions from thermal energy and electricity to zero. The brewery has been using green electricity for many years, and 26 percent of the thermal energy comes from biogas generated from the brewery's own waste water. The remaining 74 percent have so far been natural gas, which has now, in cooperation with energy supplier OErsted AB, been converted to biogas4 with certificates ensuring that the biogas supplied to the grid has replaced an equivalent amount of natural gas. ""For many, many years we have been working to create a more efficient brewery with as little impact on our environment as possible. This is clear when looking at how much we have reduced our energy consumption over the years. It is motivating that we now take a big step forward and use solely carbon neutral energy sources"", says Ted Akiskalos, MD Carlsberg Sverige. In Sweden, the well-functioning infrastructure and availability of biogas from the grid makes it possible to convert to fully renewable sources by buying green energy, while other solutions will be deployed for markets where this is not an option. As part of its Together Towards ZERO programme, Carlsberg Group has said it will rely on the best available options for developing and sourcing sustainable energy, including the establishment of solar panels and purchasing renewable energy where possible. Through the Science-Based Targets initiative, Carlsberg Group has set an industry-leading 1.5 degree ambition compared to the Paris agreement's base-level 2-degree goal. The Carbon Trust highlights Carlsberg among only three major companies having set and approved targets with this level of ambition. ""Our work with Carlsberg has explored the range of options they will need to adopt in the coming years to evolve to a zero carbon brewer. This will include adoption of innovative energy efficiency technologies, own renewable electricity and heat, as well as sourcing of renewable energy, such as biogas. Seeing this first Carlsberg brewery make this transition so soon is very encouraging and should be seen as a demonstration of how industries can embrace new technologies to mitigate climate change"", says Tom Delay, Chief Executive, the Carbon Trust. ""Climate change is perhaps the most important issue for our society today, both for citizens, governments and companies all over the world, and we are very pleased with the positive development in Carlsberg Sverige. This underlines our willingness to contribute to tackling climate change at the same time as governments are focusing on scaling and speeding up impact at the COP23 in Bonn these weeks. Carlsberg Group will continue to chase our ambitions and targets, as we strive to brew for a better today and tomorrow"", says Simon Boas Hoffmeyer, Sustainability Director, Carlsberg Group.

There are alternatives, especially from the indigenous peoples, especially from the wisdom of indigenous women,"" said Roberto Espinoza, Adviser for the Interethnic Association for the development of the Peruvian Rainforest (Asociation Interetnica de Desarrollo de la Selva Peruana - AIDESEP), at a press conference on Tuesday. Rosalia Yampis, Director of the Women's Program in AIDESEP, also highlighted the ""very important role"" indigenous women can have in climate adaptation, the UN News added. ""Women have this ancestral knowledge about seeds and what we have to sow,"" she told the press conference. She added that indigenous peoples are providing input to Peru's national contribution to the Paris Agreement in protecting the watershed. There are about 13 million indigenous peoples in Peru. As a national indigenous rights organization, AIDESEP works to improve the health, education and housing of these peoples. It is a member organization of the Coordinator of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon River Basin (COICA). ccording to AIDESEP, ""it is amply demonstrated that indigenous territories are fundamental for the conservation of forests."" In them, generally, ""deforestation is minimal, even less than in some protected natural areas. Therefore, today, one of the main strategies to counteract the loss and degradation of forests in the Peruvian Amazon is to ensure the safety and sustainable management of these territories,"" explains the organization on its website. ""There are alternatives with the wisdom and knowledge of our peoples. We, as indigenous peoples, are working on these alternatives,"" said Janio Sangama, from the region of San Martin, which is mostly located in the upper part of the Peruvian Amazon rainforest. ""When we speak about sustainable development, we are looking after the management of our resources in a more orderly way. We worry about deforestation,"" he added. ""In San Martin, we had a big flood. We have a proposal called 'hand in hand with Government' to confront these natural catastrophes."" He said that the indigenous peoples have begun sustainable production or orderly production with technologies from communities. ""We have been managing alternative crops in our territories. We are not destroying our forest,"" he underscored. Roberto Espinoza said that ""water is being reduced because of deforestation. So we are sowing water - even if it sounds bizarre - with some special plants indigenous people know that can enhance the water cycle underground,"" he added. Regarding reforestation, Jammek Manikusi, a member of AIDESEP, said indigenous people are concerned about the use of exotic plants, like pine and eucalyptus. ""These plants have impacts on the soil. We want a natural reforestation with natural wisdom of the peoples, with more proper methodologies, more adapted to natural regeneration of soils in the Amazon.""

"COP23","India","COP23_India390","Morocco : Climate Change: Morocco Convenes Meeting in New York on South-South Cooperation","September 25, 2017 Monday","TendersInfo","Morocco convened on Tuesday in New York a meeting on South-South cooperation with the objective of further strengthening this cooperation in line with the commitments made at COP22 in Marrakech. The meeting was jointly organized with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and was attended by several public and non-state actors, regional and international organizations and representatives of the private sector and of developing countries. Speaking on this occasion, Josefa Leonel Correia Sacko, African Union Commissioner for Rural Economy and Agriculture, thanked Morocco for this commendable initiative and its efforts to promote South-South cooperation to address the challenges of climate change. Correia Sacko affirmed that the African Union Commission is ready to support this initiative, given that climate change is a global issue that requires joint efforts, including by countries of the South, which are the most affected ones by this phenomenon. ""We can share experiences, transfer technology and take a collective approach to the impact of climate change,"" she told MAP. For the African official, dialogue and multilateralism have become an absolute necessity to achieve the development and transformation of Africa and to reach the objectives on the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union 2063 Agenda. Ambassador Amena Yauvoli, COP23 special representative for the Pacific region, said he was ""pleasantly surprised"" by the relevance of this Moroccan initiative and its great potential to promote cooperation between countries to fight the effects of climate change. For him, South-South cooperation as advocated by Morocco ""can turn these challenges into opportunities"". ""Climate challenges are constantly increasing, and no country can confront them alone,"" he noted, stressing that successful experiences such as the Moroccan one are very useful for other countries in the south. UNFCCC spokesperson Nick Nuttall welcomed Morocco's initiative, noting that the Moroccan presidency of COP22 contributed to the emergence of a South-South cooperation action in this area. Nuttall underlined the importance of strengthening cooperation in order to fight the impact of this phenomenon. In his turn, COP22 President Salaheddine Mezouar said that this meeting shows the importance given by the Kingdom to South-South cooperation, which is at the heart of its international and regional action. ""For Morocco, this dimension of South-South partnership is a vision of strategic importance aimed at providing concrete answers to real problems,"" he told reporters. Moroccos Secretary of State for Sustainable Development, Nezha El Ouafi, stressed that the Kingdom remains convinced that ""multilateralism is the right choice to put into place our actions and move forward."" This initiative can serve as a Moroccan-African platform to fight counter the effects of climate change, she noted. Director General of the Moroccan Agency for International Cooperation (AMCI), ambassador Mohamed Methqal underlined the personal commitment of HM King Mohammed VI to South-South cooperation, recalling in this regard the organization last year in Marrakech of the Africa Action Summit in the margins of COP22. Methqal also pointed out that the AMCI's actions remain mainly oriented towards the African continent, with almost 80 pc of its initiatives related to African countries. \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India391","REC Group on Stage at the 10th Singapore International Energy Week","October 30, 2017 Monday 6:30 AM EST","Contify Energy News","Oct. 30 -- REC Group, a leading vertically integrated solar energy company with operational headquarters in Singapore, proudly demonstrates its high-quality solar panels and its vision of solar energy at the 10th Singapore International Energy Week (SIEW). ""Solar energy will be powering all our needs at home, business and on the way."" Steve O'Neil, CEO at REC Group From October 23-27, the SIEW is an annual platform for energy professionals, policymakers and commentators to discuss and share best practices and solutions within the realm of global energy. This year's key theme ""Rethinking Energy; Navigating Change"" demonstrates Singapore's top-level push for a transition to clean energy across the whole Asian continent and beyond. REC's CEO, Steve O'Neil, was for the third time on stage of the Clean Energy Leaders Dialogue as part of the Asia Clean Energy Summit to share some remarkable forecasts on solar's future: ""During the past 40 years, each time the solar capacity has doubled, costs dropped by approximately 30%. Solar has become cheaper than retail electricity prices in around 50 countries worldwide and is even beating new coal installations in some regions already today. Solar PV is becoming part of a larger ecosystem, including storage, transport, buildings, power and infrastructure. It will be powering all our needs."" The Asia Clean Energy Summit is a thought-leadership forum during the SIEW and is organized by the Sustainable Energy Association of Singapore (SEAS). The non-government and non-profit business association represents the interests and provides a common platform for companies in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and financial institutions. According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, solar will make up 27% of all new investments in energy generation assets from 2017 to 2040. In the Asia-Pacific region, this represents around USD 1.6 trillion of investments. Analysts predict that solar will be the world's most common energy source by 2050, powering 40% of the world's electricity needs. ""We will see solar panels not only at ground level or on rooftops, but also fully integrated into zero-energy buildings, charging our vehicles and even floating on bodies of water. The digitalization of the energy sector will play a crucial role. For energy management, it will allow much more flexible and less vulnerable infrastructures, such as so-called smart grids or virtual power plants at local, national and even international levels,"" adds O'Neil. In light of the upcoming UN Climate Change Conference, Cop23 , taking place in mid-November in Germany, REC calculations demonstrate the immense potential for solar's future: Roughly an additional 4,800 GW of new PV installations need to be installed between 2016 and 2025 in addition to the current trend, for solar energy to contribute to closing the emissions gap and thereby limiting the global temperature rise to below 1.5C. Annual demand of new solar PV installations is forecast to exceed 100 GW before 2018 concludes, with China (around 45% share), the USA (around 12% share) and India (around 10% share) being the largest markets. Other emerging markets in Asia, such as Southeast Asian countries, also see the opportunity to realize solar's global competitiveness by developing renewable energy sources, and thereby reducing their reliance on both fossil fuel subsidies and fossil fuel imports.

"COP23","India","COP23_India392","Four Indian companies among 100 global businesses with highest carbon footprint","November 16, 2017 Thursday","Down To Earth","India, Nov. 16 -- A small group of companies across the world is responsible for one-third of global annual emissions, revealed a Thomson Reuters report titled 'Global 250 Greenhouse Gas Emitters'. Released ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ) at Bonn, the report features 250 global companies-operating mainly in oil, gas, utility, automotive, aircraft, manufacturing, steel, mining and cement sectors-that make large contribution to global greenhouse gas emission. Coal India tops the list of 100 businesses with the highest CO2 emission. However, it has seen a reduction in emissions from 2,076 million tonne (MtCO2) in 2015 to 2,014 MtCO2 in 2016. Even then, the emission of a single state-owned business is about 86 per cent of the country's total CO2 emission. Two other state-owned Indian companies feature in the list: NTPC Ltd 185.6 MtCO2 and Oil & Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) 149.8 MtCO2. The only privately-owned Indian company to join the league of top 100 emitters is Reliance Industries with an estimated CO2 emission of 263.3 MtCO2 NTPC Ltd. Out of the top 15 highest GHG-emitting companies, five of them saw substantial increase in emissions in 2016 when compared with the previous year. The US-based oil and gas company, Exxon Mobil Corporation, which ranked third in 2016, has seen an increase in CO2 emission. China Shenhua Energy, the largest state-owned coal mining enterprise in Mainland China featuring among top 15 CO2 emitters, has also seen a rise in emission from 643.8 MtCO2 in 2015 to 665 MtCO2 in 2016. This is larger than the total CO2 emission of Saudi Arabia in the same year. According to the report, the top 15 companies, which are ranked based on total emissions, account for about 10 per cent of global annual emissions. ""Without continual reductions in emissions from this group of companies, effectively mitigating the long-term risks of climate change is not possible,' the report argues. China, US collectively have 40 companies in the list of top 100 On looking at the country-wise concentration of these carbon-intensive businesses, it appears that 14 out of the top 100 companies are from China with names like China Coal Energy and Yanzhou Coal Mining featuring in the list. As the report reveals, 26 companies from the US, which is historically the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, feature in the list. This is the highest for an individual country. The list if mostly dominated by energy and automobile business such as General Motors, General Electric, Boeing and Ford. The Dow Chemical, which acquired Union Carbide Corporation (UCC)-a company responsible for the Bhopal Gas Tragedy-emitted 120.3 MtCO2 in 2016. It is more than Nigeria's total carbon emission in 2016. While total global emissions remain stable, it still means that millions of tonnes of GHGs are being added to the atmosphere every year, making it more difficult to keep global warming to 2 degree Celsius as expressed in the Paris Agreement.

"COP23","India","COP23_India393","FAO launches Climate-Smart Agriculture web platform","November 10, 2017 6:30 AM EST","Rural Marketing","In order to help steer food systems in a sustainable direction, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has produced a new sourcebook for how to implement ""climate-smart"" approaches to agriculture, launched today at the Agriculture Action Day on the sidelines of the COP23 climate summit in Bonn, Germany. ""Hunger, poverty, and climate can be tackled together through approaches such as Climate-Smart Agriculture that recognise the critical linkages between sustainable agriculture and strategies that promote resource-use efficiency, conserve and restore biodiversity and natural resources, and combat the impacts of climate change,"" said Rene Castro, Assistant Director-General of the Climate, Biodiversity, Land and Water Department of FAO. Ultimately, the world needs to produce 50 percent more food to feed nearly 10 billion people in 2050, and to find a way to do so with only a quarter of current per capita carbon emissions, Castro noted. The online Climate-Smart Agriculture Sourcebook - Second Edition 2017 is the result of one of FAO's major areas of work that comes on the heels of the recently launched FAO's Climate Change Strategy, an FAO press release says. It comprises a wide range of knowledge and expertise to help guide policy-makers, programme managers, academics, extension services and other practitioners make the agricultural sectors more sustainable and productive while also contributing to food security and lower carbon intensity. The second edition of the sourcebook adds new modules addressing climate change adaptation and mitigation, integrated production systems, knowledge-support systems for rural producers, the role of gender and how to improve implementation, the release says. Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) has garnered increasing attention. Some 32 countries, half of them least-developed countries, and three-fourths of them in sub-Saharan Africa, specifically refer to CSA in their Nationally Determined Contributions to achieving pledges made under the Paris Agreement. Climate-Smart Agriculture is one of the approaches to steer the needed transformation in the world's agriculture and food systems in ways that are both productive and sustainable and contribute to adaptation to and mitigation of climate change. Many contexts, many factors The Sourcebook offers a deeper understanding of the CSA approach and the related five-step process geared to identifying and analysing suitable outcomes. This involves building the evidence base, strengthening national and local institutions, supporting enabling policy frameworks, enhancing financing options - available at the local, international and multilateral levels - and implementing practices at the field level. It focuses on production issues related to crops, livestock, forestry, fisheries and aquaculture and integrated systems, as well as on the use of resources such as water, soils and land, genetic resources and energy. Food systems and value chains - bringing in factors ranging from fertilisers to refrigeration - are also incorporated as potential areas for optimisation, while factors such as gender and social protection are also considered. A key element for CSA is the landscape approach, which allows for a wider range of land use and conservation options to be pursued as flexible solutions. \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India394","Denmark : Climate projects need to be cross-disciplinary","November 18, 2017 Saturday","TendersInfo","Many solutions contribute to a low-carbon energy transition, but experience shows that you get the best results if your approach is cross-disciplinary. That was a main conclusion from Ramboll CEO Jens-Peter Saul at todays sessions at the World Climate Summit held in Bonn, in connection with the UNs Climate Conference COP23 : We need to move on from a silo mentality towards holistic masterplanning. We need to forge connections between the technical solutions, the governance structure and the social and cultural offerings, if you are to create cities that are sustainable and liveable, Jens-Peter Saul stated. For several years, Ramboll has worked with the city of Copenhagen on cross-disciplinary climate solutions that do not only include for example hydraulic expertise but are also optimised socially, environmentally and economically.This broad sustainability approach has led to New York City choosing Ramboll on a similar climate project in Queens. Jens-Peter Saul participated in the opening ceremony Building a New Coalition - The Role of Alliances and Bottom-Up Actions in the New Era of Climate Leadership with H.R.H. Princess Abze Djigma from Burkina Faso and Director-General Thorsten Herdan from the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy in Germany among the other participants. A flexible power grid Rambolls CEO was also key speaker at a Roundtable Discussion with Danish companies Danfoss and Kamstrup on How to combat climate change with digitalization and low temperature district heating. At the roundtable Jens-Peter Saul shared the Danish success story about decarbonisation: Denmark has enabled a green transition while securing continued socio-economic growth, thanks to an increased use of high-efficient district energy among other things. The Greater Copenhagen part of the district heating system now supplies heat to a floor area of more than 70 million m2 with more than one million citizens connected and a 2025 carbon neutral target. The system is moving towards the 4th Generation District Heating system, fully integrated with the district cooling, thermal storage capabilities and the power system. The power grid of the future is very flexible. It will absorb, transmit and distribute heat and power from various sources in most cost effective way, depending on generation and demand, storage capabilities, market prices, the weather, the season and the time of day, Jens-Peter Saul said. Digitalisation raises efficiency He highlighted two innovative elements of this model: Large thermal storages and a huge fleet of heat pumps help optimize the production from fluctuating renewable energy sources in particular. And digitalisation, where distributed energy generation systems in the future, will form Energy Cells that connect to each other and operate like an 'internet of energy' - based on a secure and reliable energy supply. So while the Paris Agreement and local climate goals are putting pressure on energy planning, there are also solutions underway that address the issue at scale. And solutions such as these are necessary for countries, regions and cities that are concerned with the big question: how to get on the path to a low-carbon society in the most cost-efficient way while also taking energy security into account, Jens-Peter Saul pointed out. \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India395","International Solar Alliance: India's brainchild to become a legal entity on Dec 6","November 15, 2017 Wednesday","The Times of India (TOI)","BONN (Germany): The International Solar Alliance (ISA), which will become a legal entity on December 6, has planned to add 1,000 gigawatt (GW) of solar power across the globe by 2030. It is estimated that the plan to create 1000 GW of solar power capacity will need an investment of nearly 1,200 billion Euros by 2030. Announcement of the ISA's future plan was made here in Bonn on sidelines of the ongoing UN climate change conference ( COP23 ) on Tuesday. India was earlier wanted to make the plan public next month during the Alliance's first global summit in Delhi. The inaugural summit has, however, now been deferred due to postponement of the French president Emmanuel Macron's India visit. Macron was earlier expected to attend the summit on December 9 during his India visit. The mega meet is now expected to be scheduled early next year, depending on availability of Macron and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Alliance, India's brainchild to bring 121 solar rich countries on a single platform to give push to solar energy, was jointly launched by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the then French President Francois Hollande in Paris on November 30, 2015. Since France had been quite active on this Indian initiative to forge a global coalition to harness solar energy, India is keen to have Macron on board during the ISA's inaugural summit. ""We have had discussion on the issue here with the French government's special envoy for implementation of the ISA, Segol\\xE8ne Royal. Fresh dates are being explored, keeping in mind the availability of Prime Minister Modi and President Macron. The summit is likely to be held early next year"", said Anand Kumar, secretary in the ministry of new and renewable energy, on Tuesday. Announcing the ISA's future plan, Kumar said the Alliance member countries had been proactively working on their solar goals and achieving the target of 1,000 GW by 2030 would be a collective goal. The current installed global capacity of the solar power is around 303GW including over 12GW in India. Nearly 75GW of solar power was added globally in 2016. India had in 2015 revised its solar power target from 20GW to 100GW by 2022. This is part of the country's total renewable energy target of 175GW by 2022.So far, 44 countries have signed the framework agreement of the ISA. The Alliance had got the required number of ratification (by 15 countries) on November 6. It will now become an international legal entity on December 6 -- 30 days from the deposit of the 15th instrument of ratification. The 15 countries which have already submitted their instrument of ratification include India, France, Mauritius, Niger, Nauru, Tuvalu, Fiji, Somalia, Ghana, Mali, Seychelles, South Sudan, Bangladesh, Comoros and Guinea. Two more countries - Sudan and Togolese Republic - have ratified it, but they have been waiting for other formalities before submission of their instruments. Idea of the Alliance is to present solar-rich nations as an effective group to get financial and technological support from investors. Most of the 121 member countries, lying fully or partially between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, get nearly 300 days of good sunshine in a year and are therefore most suited to move on the solar energy path.

"COP23","India","COP23_India397","SEforALL and IHA to Partner on New Hydropower Preparation Facility Model","November 17, 2017 Friday 6:30 AM EST","Contify Energy News","Nov. 17 -- The International Hydropower Association (IHA) is partnering with Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL) to explore options for a new model which would accelerate sustainable hydropower development worldwide. The two organisations signed a partnership agreement this week at the COP23 climate change conference in Bonn, Germany. It will see them consult on the concept of a Hydropower Preparation Facility (HPF), which would work with national governments to prioritise potential hydropower project sites according to their sustainability. The concept could see Hydropower Preparation Facilities established in countries and regions across the world, which would help governments select and prepare hydropower projects before putting them out to tender to the private sector. Under the model, a project 'blueprint', guided by the latest international industry good practice in sustainability, would be created by the facility and then auctioned off. The successful developer would subsequently repay the preparation costs when the project is commissioned, reducing the costs and risks to prospective developers. The facility itself would be resourced through a revolving donor-sourced fund. The International Hydropower Association has been engaging with governments, financial institutions and NGOs to bring forward the HPF concept following the strong support it received from stakeholders at the World Hydropower Congress in May 2017. Richard Taylor, Chief Executive of IHA, said: ""The initiative is about getting the right projects built in the right place, and delivering services where they are needed most, especially in developing countries. The aim is to accelerate sustainable hydropower that fits well with local, national and regional strategies - contributing to cleaner energy systems, responsible freshwater management and climate-change solutions. The partnership with SEforALL represents a significant milestone in making this concept a reality."" Rachel Kyte, Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General and CEO, Sustainable Energy for All, said: ""We can only reach universal energy access by 2030 if the shift to renewable energy moves at speed and scale. Best practice hydropower can deliver renewable energy and storage opportunities - offering much needed flexibility. By partnering together, we can help IHA share their leadership and expertise with a much wider audience of sustainable energy policy makers and practitioners. Together, we can go further, faster towards Sustainable Development Goal 7."" Hydropower Preparation Facilities could assist in defining the energy and water benefits required from a hydropower project by utilising local stakeholder knowledge and public-private partnerships at the early stage, and by checking the viability and sustainability of the project before auction. The HPF concept avoids the risk premium associated with a private developer attempting to bring forward a project with costly, often complex, assessments and planning, with no certainty that it will be permitted to proceed. By taking a system-scale approach and working closely with host governments and local communities, projects would also have a strong strategic fit within their region. IHA and SEforAll plan to hold a series of meetings and events over the coming year with key stakeholders to identify a proof of concept for the HPF model. In particular they will assess how HPFs could be driven by revolving funds and utilise refinancing models aligned with the key stages of project development.

The CCAP2 is designed to incorporate the Bank's High 5 priorities in the Paris Agreement, the 2030 development agenda, the Bank's Green Growth Framework and the lessons learned in the implementation of the first climate change action plan (CCAP1), 2011-2015 As part of its wider mandate under the New Deal on Energy for Africa, the Board of Directors of the African Development Bank on December 15, 2017, approved an investment of US $20 million in the Evolution II Fund ?a Pan-African clean and sustainable energy private equity fund. The Bank's investment in Evolution II Fund reflects the High 5 development priorities of the Bank, the agenda to light up and Power Africa, and the Bank's commitment to promote renewable energy and efficiency in Africa. In line with its commitment to renewable energy and ongoing institutional reforms, in the first quarter of 2017, the Bank appointed Ousseynou Nakoulima as the Director for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency. He brings global experience in developing and managing programs and partnerships for driving renewable energy, from his work at the Green Climate Fund.

While Paris represented one of those moments where the best of humanity achieved an agreement so important to our collective futures, Bonn represents how we will move forward to fulfill its promise, said the Executive Secretary of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Patricia Espinosa, on the margins of a ministerial meeting in Fiji on 17 October 2017 to prepare for the Bonn Conference of the Conventions States Parties. We are running out of time to turn things around. To do so, we must significantly increase our efforts to reduce emissions and our carbon footprints, she added. The Paris Agreement, which was adopted by the 196 Parties to the UNFCCC in December 2015 in the French capital after which it is named, calls on countries to combat climate change by limiting the rise of global temperature below 2 degrees Celsius and strive not to exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius. A year ago, the Marrakech Climate Conference concluded with the Marrakech Action Proclamation, for our climate and sustainable development, in which the UNFCCC States Parties affirmed their commitment to the full implementation of the Paris Agreement. On Friday, 169 Parties have ratified the Agreement. At the Bonn Conference, informally known as COP 23 , countries will seek to move forward in completing the rule book for operationalizing the Paris Agreement. The Conference, which runs until 17 November, is chaired by Fiji, an island State particularly affected by the impacts of climate change. Never has our work been more necessary. We see this with respect to the extreme weather events affecting almost every continent throughout the world, said Espinosa. COP 23 President and Fiji Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama agrees.

A week before the opening of the Bonn Conference, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) announced that the levels of carbon dioxide (C02) surged at record-breaking speed to new highs in 2016. The Bonn Conference will feature a series of meetings and events, including the high-level segment, on 15 November and 16 November, attended by Heads of State and Government, Ministers, and UN Secretary-General Antnio Guterres. Guterres has invited leaders to consider championing six high-impact areas at a special Climate Summit in 2019. These areas are investment in clean technology, maturing carbon pricing, enabling the energy transition, risk mitigation and building resilience, augmenting the contribution of sub-national actors and business and mobilizing climate finance. Increasing ambition is the only way to keep the global temperature rise well below 2 degrees Celsius this century, and as close to 1.5 degree as possible. By focusing on these sectors, we can substantially reduce the gap between where we are and where we need to be, said UN Deputy Secretary-General, Amina Mohammed, at the pre-COP meeting in Fiji.

"COP23","India","COP23_India402","Climate change and small islands","January 2, 2018 Tuesday","Down To Earth","India, Jan. 2 -- This time the Conference of Parties ( COP ) 23 was presided over by the Prime Minister of Fiji, a country comprising 300 islands. The event attracted much global attention and called for real action to help vulnerable island nations cope up with the effects of global warming. Questions may be raised also from countries like India about the vulnerability of Andaman & Nicobar and Lakshadweep, islands totaling 611 in number, of which only 46 are inhabited. There are also islands in the Indian Sundarbans Delta. Inhabited by nearly 4.5 million people, even after 70 years of Independence the place is without proper roads and surface transport, drinking water, sanitation, healthcare and small-scale and medium enterprises. Fishing and farming are the main occupations here. To augment family income, women stand in neck-deep water and draw drag nets to collect prawn seeds for selling in the market. No skill institutes There is not a single technical training school for skill development in the Sundarbans. The islanders depend on the mainland for all essential commodities. Local products are sold at 1/3rd the price compared to Kolkata as there is no co-operative movement to ensure fair price of these products. After the devastating Aila on May 25, 2009, 1,300 km of earthen embankment was damaged. A total of Rs 5,000 crore was sanctioned but not even 20 per cent has been used as the Early Warning System is still to come up. New cyclone shelters have hardly been built as has been done in coastal Odisha. People remain at the mercy of nature here. Climate change is happening now. So, there is no point of waiting till 2030 when 1.2 million people have to be moved out from eight vulnerable blocks of the Sundarbans. Despite the Delta Vision Document published in 2011, no evidence of action is seen as yet. How the farmers and fishermen will cope up in far-off states? There is no doubt they need additional skills. There is no programme for skill development for future environmental refugees from these riverine islands of the largest delta in the world shared between India and Bangladesh. There is also no future plan for resettlement of climate-induced refugees in pre-designated areas. It is a paradox that these people who contribute no carbon dioxide or greenhouse gases are set to become the worst victims of climate change. COP 23 remains unknown to these people. Verbose discussions will not help. It is high time to stop rhetoric take real action. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Down to Earth.

"COP23","India","COP23_India403","More than meat: Shaping the future of livestock","January 22, 2018 6:30 AM EST","Rural Marketing","The livestock sector is a mainstay for food security and rural livelihoods and the international community must work together to make sure it achieves its potential contribution to sustainable development, Jose Graziano da Silva, Director-General, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) said at the 10th Global Forum for Food and Agriculture in Berlin on Saturday. FAO estimates that more than half of the world's rural poor are livestock farmers and pastoralists. Among the poorest of the poor, they rely on livestock that play a vital role in their livelihoods. While animal products make large contributions to nutrition and the fight against poverty, they also entail outsized impacts on the climate and environment and assuring animal health is increasingly critical for human health, he said. Livestock and livelihoods As demand for meat and other animal products grows robustly, especially in developing countries, the question of equity and efficient distribution grows in importance. More than half the world's rural poor rely on livestock, and they must be provided with appropriate skills, knowledge and technologies to participate in and benefit from that expected growth rather than ""pushed aside by expanding large capital-intensive operations"", Graziano da Silva said. Increased consumption of animal products will enhance nutrition, especially for younger children in developing countries whose cognitive and physical development requires crucial micronutrients such as zinc and iron he said, waring that excess consumption also poses risks. ""We have to focus on healthy and balanced diets,"" he said. He also noted that alternative sources of protein - such as fish and pulses - are available and should be explored. Lowering carbon footprints As livestock generates more greenhouse gases than other food sources - around 14.5 percent of all anthropogenic emissions - the sector's expansion poses challenges to biodiversity, sustainable access to water and, notably, the goals of the Paris climate agreement's pledge to limit how high average global temperatures rise, the UN agency has said. However, ""a low-carbon livestock sector is possible to achieve,"" Graziano da Silva said, pointing to FAO estimates that methane emissions can quickly be cut by 20 to 30 percent across all production systems by the adoption of known husbandry practices such as regenerative grazing, forage selection and better recycling of nutrients and energy from livestock waste. Better management of pasture-lands and the health and carbon-storing capacity of their soils is also essential for increased livestock production not to require further deforestation, he added. ""With improved and climate-smart practices, we can quickly put in place more sustainable and 'greener' livestock supply chains,"" Graziano said. He urged to seize the opportunity after last year's climate summit in Bonn COP23 specifically indicated improved livestock management systems as a priority. Animal health Graziano da Silva also focused on animal and human health issues, warning that ""the emergence of diseases will likely intensify in the coming years, as rising temperatures favour the proliferation of insects."" FAO has a long track record in tackling transboundary animal diseases, including leading the successful eradication of rinderpest and a new global campaign to eradicate peste des petits ruminants. FAO also recognises the need to tackle antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a major threat to human health that is exacerbated by the abuse, overuse and misuse of anitibiotics in livestock, which globally consume three times more of such products than humans do. The Director-General emphasised that FAO's recommendations are that the use of antimicrobial medicines to promote animal growth should be phased out immediately, and that they should only be used to cure disease and alleviate unnecessary suffering, while their preventive use should be deployed only under strict circumstances. FAO is helping many countries develop and implement national AMR action plans, Graziano da Silva said. \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India404","United Kingdom : Environment Minister speaks at the UN Climate Change Conference","November 14, 2017 Tuesday","TendersInfo","I am delighted to be here at COP23 , working with other nations, international organisations and of course Peter Thomson. I thank Fiji for their leadership in the Presidency and Germany for being great hosts. We have had feedback that the UK can play a greater role globally and we are happy to do that. Oceans make up around two thirds of our planet and our lives are inextricably linked with our blue seas. However, our oceans are changing and we must take action to save them. We now have nearly 300 Marine Protected Areas in UK waters, and by 2020 we will deliver a network of Marine Protected Areas that will cover 25 per cent of the UKs Exclusive Economic Zone. In addition, the UK is on track to protect 4 million square kilometres of ocean across its Overseas Territories by 2020. The UK continues to be a global leader in protecting oceans and marine life. Action on plastic bag use has been taken across the UK, for instance, the 5p plastic bag charge in England has cut the use of plastic bags by over 80 per cent, or over 9 billion in just one year, and our microbead ban will be one of the toughest in the world. We recognise the particularly damaging effects of climate change on developing countries. That is why the UK has committed at least 5.8 billion of international climate finance between 2016 and 2020 to help developing countries mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change. One example of this is the 10 million we have committed to tackle mangrove loss in Madagascar that will benefit over 100,000 people in coastal communities by providing protection against natural disasters and supporting their livelihoods. It will deliver around 13 million tonnes of CO2 savings. It is only by collaboration on a global scale that we can truly address marine climate issues, including ocean acidification. We have already seen the devastating impact of rising sea levels on our coastal communities. We should be clear that ocean acidification could threaten the very basis of life itself. I say that because acidification threatens the whole basis of the marine ecosystem, as it literally attacks the building blocks of life as key organisms fail to develop fully, which is starting to disrupt the food web. Earlier this year we published a synopsis of our UK Ocean Acidification Research Programme and, based on current projections, cold water corals will be 20-30 per cent weaker, causing reef disintegration and losing the rich biodiversity that they support. The programme provided an extremely successful collaborative science partnership across the UK and internationally, particularly with the EU European Project on Ocean Acidification and the German BIOACID programme. Science is the spur to action and the more we can collaborate across nations, the more we can innovate. The UK set up the Marine Climate Change Impacts Partnership (MCCIP) to provide verifiable evidence of the effect of climate change. This brings together scientists, government, its agencies and NGOs and has just published Marine Climate change Impacts - 10 years experience of science to policy reporting. However, there is more that we can do. This is why the UK Government is committed to a new United Nations Agreement for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction, which will deliver real protection across the worlds oceans. Oceans Action Day reminds us of the importance of the two thirds of our world and that our blue spaces are just as precious as our green spaces - and that actions on land have consequences for all parts of this blue planet, especially those actions which are altering our climate. That is why I am pleased to announce that the United Kingdom will today sign up to the Because the Oceans declaration and I encourage others who have not done so, to do the same. \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India405","Finally, a decision on agriculture comes through at Bonn climate talks","November 13, 2017 Monday","Down To Earth","India, Nov. 13 -- After years of failure to arrive at a consensus, the member states finally reached a decision today on how to deal with climate actions in agriculture at the 23rd session of the Conference of Parties ( COP23 ) in Bonn, Germany. Consensus on the text of the decision was reached at the last minute; just before the final meeting on the subject was convened even as parties feared that another year would pass without anything substantial being agreed upon. It was only on Saturday (November 11), as parties failed to reach any agreement, dismayed members of the Africa Group of countries reportedly walked out before the meeting was even concluded. The decision, drafted after years of consultation, has relied heavily on the draft document prepared by the G77 and China group of countries that was presented by Uruguay on behalf of the group last week for discussions and consideration. The final decision was also read out to the group of negotiators and observers who were present by the representative from Uruguay and was met with congratulations and jubilation across the table. What's next? Parties are now required to submit views and recommendations on the modalities for the implementation of outcomes from five workshops held on matters related to agriculture during the years of negotiations. Parties have been invited to submit adaptation assessment methods for improvement of soil health, soil carbon and soil quality as well as considerations for the improvement of nutrient use and manure management. Finally, the members will also have to report on socio-economic and food security dimensions of the impact of climate change on agriculture. Finance remains a matter of concern Actions on the above subjects have been listed as subject to availability of finance, which remains a huge question mark, while it has been decided that stock taking on actions undertaken in agriculture will be done during the 26th session of COP due to be held in 2020. The decision is being touted as a historic one in the often-neglected and slow-moving subject of agriculture. ""More than anything, there is a sense of relief among all parties. This has been many years in the making and it is natural for this relief to set in,"" said one negotiator from a developing country where agriculture has been a major talking point. Although the negotiator was quick to add that the decision is simply a small step in the right direction and a lot of work is still required to carry forward the agricultural agenda. It is not difficult to see what the delegate means, as the final text of the draft decision does not mention assessment of risk and vulnerability, the development of early warning systems, differentiation based on tradition, geography and ecology or the matter of transfer of technology or the explicit consideration of gender in dealing with the subject-all of which had found space in the draft document scripted by G77 and China. Significant victory despite shortcomings Despite this, the decision is being viewed as a small but significant victory, especially for South Asian and African nations which have been reeling from agricultural losses due to unpredictable extreme weather and successive droughts over the past decade. ""Although some matters have not been mentioned, they will continue to be discussed at SBSTA meeting on the work plans when specifics on such matters, which have been left out, can be thrashed out,"" said one negotiator. Although there are shortcomings, one outcome that people in developing countries like India can be happy about is that agriculture, from a predominantly adaptation-oriented perspective, has finally found a place on the map of climate negotiations and action.

""The reality is that the United States will remain party to the Paris Agreement at least through 2020, so I am confident that despite the artificial headwinds caused by the President's rhetoric and actions America will meet its obligations because of the tremendous commitments made by governors, local government leaders, environmentalists, and the private sector,"" Senator Cardin said. ""Fighting climate change is not just the right thing to do for the long term health of our planet, it is an American economic and national security imperative. The American people want the United States to continue to be a leader in fighting global climate change."" ""In Bonn, we saw that the world is not turning a blind eye to climate change. It's confronting it head-on. That is a very hopeful sign,"" Senator Whitehouse said. ""I was also glad we delivered a message -- while our President and his administration have bound themselves to the interests of fossil fuel polluters, the American people and our institutions have not.

WATCH VIDEO (Governor Brown speaks at 40:20) With the Trump administration's retreat from the Paris Agreement and the Clean Power Plan, the governors used the panel, titled Leadership for 2050: Subnational Action with a Long-Term Vision, to discuss how they are moving forward in building a robust clean energy economy with or without federal leadership. The leaders detailed their collaborative efforts, in coordination with the private sector and other stakeholders, to reduce carbon pollution, integrate the region's power grid, develop an interstate electric vehicle charging network, combat ocean acidification, and encourage innovation and job growth. Oregon, California, Washington, and British Columbia are members of a regional partnership called the Pacific Coast Collaborative (PCC) , which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, decarbonize the economy, and build thriving sustainable communities through the adoption of clean energy policies, sharing of expertise and resources, and collective action. The PCC represents the world's fifth-largest economy, a region of 55 million people with a combined GDP of $3 trillion. This collaborative is the biggest, most advanced attempt to create a low-carbon future of any transboundary region in the world. The PCC's progress is detailed in this year's report card . Since 2005, regional nominal gross domestic product has grown by 20 percent while total region wide emissions have declined more than six percent. Public and private-sector cooperation is transforming key economic sectors, putting the region on a path toward reducing emissions 80 to 95 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. Since passage of California's signature climate change and clean energy law, AB 32, in 2006, per capita emissions in the state dropped by 12 percent while GDP grew by over 20 percent, and the number of workers in the labor force jumped by nearly 9 percent. In 2015, Oregon's GDP was 30 percent higher than in 2005 while total statewide greenhouse gas emissions were down 6 percent. Washington's per capita GHG emissions decreased by 4.5 metric tons from 1990 to 2014. From 2007 to 2014, British Columbia's real GDP grew by over 12 percent while GHG emissions declined. Over 350,000 zero-emission and low-emission vehicles are on the roads in a fast-growing West Coast market. Across the region, sales rose an average of nearly 25 percent per year in the last three years. Through investment and policies like Renewable Portfolio Standards, power supplied by renewable energy, beyond hydroelectric, has increased more than 250 percent from 2005 to 2015, averaging around 14 percent growth every year. Quotes from Governors Jerry Brown and Jay Inslee: The West Coast offers a blueprint: this is how you build a thriving, innovative economy that combats climate change and embraces a zero-emission future, said Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington state. We know it's possible because we're doing it. \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India409","Bonn: Participants at UN conference examine human mobility in an era of climate change","November 9, 2017 Thursday 6:30 AM EST","IBNS","New York, Nov 9(Just Earth News): As the number of people displaced worldwide due to climate change-related events continues to grow, the United Nations and its partners are focusing on regional approaches, framed by existing international practice, to respond to the issue of 'climate refugees.' The number of disaster displacements on annual average between 2008 and 2016 amounted to 25.3 million, according to figures released by the Norwegian Refugee Council. The five countries globally that have the highest proportion of their population affected by displacements are all island States: Cuba, Fiji, Philippines, Tonga and Sri Lanka. During this hurricane season alone for example, we saw the displacement of 1.7 million people in Cuba thats the equivalent of 15 per cent of its population, said Camila Minerva, Humanitarian Programme Manager with Oxfam in the Dominican Republic, during a press conference on human mobility and climate change at the UN Climate Conference ( COP23 ), in Bonn, Germany. The poorest and the most marginalized are five times more likely to be displaced and to remain so for longer time than people in higher income countries and it is increasing with climate change, she added. Mariam Traore, Migration, environment and climate change specialist with the UN Migration Agency (IOM) said that it is also important to remember that the slow onset effect of climate change makes people move and migrate, sometimes in a forced way. In a country like Bangladesh, we did a survey last year and 40 per cent of the households we interviewed told us that climate change contributed directly to their decision to migrate, she added. In this context, some have suggested to create a climate refugee status, protecting those forced to leave their country because of the impacts of climate change. The refugee legal status is provided by the 1951 Refugee Convention, which is very clear on what [basis refugee status is conferred], which is basically persecution, said Marine Franck, Programme Officer (climate change), Division of International Protection, in the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). In the context of climate change displacement, there might be cases where there is persecution involved where this refugee status could apply but in most cases, it doesnt, she added. She recalled that in 2011, States had suggested that UNHCR create a new status of refugee for people displaced because of climate change. But some States were not ready at all for that, she stated. Franck stressed that this issue of broadening the scope of refugee protection is not necessarily desirable, because there is a risk of undermining the refugees fleeing persecution and violent conflict. Moreover, she explained: We would need also to renegotiate the Convention and there is no appetite for that from States and it might not be the most effective protection tool. UNHCR thinks it is better to look at what exists at the regional level and try to have a bottom-up approach with broadening at the regional level using practices that are effective. She mentioned humanitarian protection visas, temporary protection and stay arrangements, as well as migration laws that can provide real protection. It is much more effective because States are going to look at what their neighbours are doing and may adopt the same kind of procedures, rather than if we adopt a global convention or a new category [] it might not be easy to negotiate and it is not also sure that States will then implement it properly, Franck said.

"COP23","India","COP23_India410","The right tech, and smart thinking - Scania's approach","November 22, 2017 Wednesday","Pivotal Sources","Sweden, Nov. 22 -- We need the right technology, not new technology and, essentially a systemic mindset to realise a sustainable transport system. That was the message delivered by Scania at this year's UN Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ). ""My first line is always that the technology is not the problem, we have the technology. The problem is that procurers, cities and decision makers are not asking for cost-efficient technology, they are only asking for the next technology,"" he says. Systemic approach to sustainable transport Speaking during a seminar on public transport Stromberg emphasised the necessity to use several solutions with the technology already present. He also underlined the need to approach sustainable transport systematically. ""We shouldn't only be looking at the city but also to whole regional transport patterns. Different solutions are needed for different areas, and procuring whole systems of vehicles, infrastructure and clean fuels makes it possible for us in the industry to offer really cost-efficient solutions."" Considering the whole transport system Stromberg explained that a change in mindset when it comes to procurement is fundamental. ""To understand the situation you need to understand the operators, the customers, and the cities. This is why one of our key messages was when you undertake procurement you must consider the whole transport system in a systematic way."" He also spoke of the need for CO2 taxation. ""We believe you really have to have a global CO2 tax otherwise nothing will change."" Replacing fossil fuel A CO2 emissions tax has transformed Sweden. In 1970 the nation was the most oil-dependent nation per capita of all the European countries. Now, apart from the transport sector, oil has been phased out everywhere. However, the transport sector is changing fast. Sweden has the highest replacement of fossil fuel systems in the transport sector of any country. A good example of this is Stockholm county's 2,300 strong bus fleet. Only one bus, on a small island in the archipelago, is still run on a fossil fuel - diesel - and it is soon to be replaced. For 15 years, public transport procurement in Sweden has been demanding CO2 efficiency, not necessarily new technology. It is the most cost-efficient solution and has reduced CO2 by over 90 percent. All this has been achieved with ""off-the-shelf"" technology, nothing new. Scania's biogas buses in the UK are another good example of a cost-effective sustainable solution. They reduce 90 percent of emissions by 80 percent the cost of diesel. Making transport more efficient While on a panel with Business Sweden, Urban Wastljung, Senior Adviser, Public and Sustainability Affairs at Scania was encouraged to see united political opinion on a sustainable future. ""The strength of Swedish and Nordic climate policies is the big consensus of opinion between the opposition parties and the governing parties that we need to do more to get a sustainable society and to de-carbonise. Therefore, whatever happens in the next election, this development will continue and this is important for industry."" Wastljung underlined the importance to the panel of making the transport of goods more efficient, telling them that ""one of Scania's goals is to reduce CO2 emissions by 50% from our land transport by 2025.""

"COP23","India","COP23_India411","Malta : Agreement reached between EU Member States to ratify the Doha Amendment by the end of this year","November 17, 2017 Friday","TendersInfo","While attending the COP23 conference organised by the United Nations in Bonn, Germany, which was attended by both the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the French President Emmanuel Macron, Minister for the Environment, Sustainable Development and Climate Change Jos Herrera announced that Malta has already concluded the national ratification process regarding the Doha Amendment in relation to climate change. In December 2012, at the Doha Conference on Climate Change, the 192 parties at the Kyoto Protocol adopted an amendment known as the Doha Amendment. This amendment establishes the parties commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 18%when compared to 1990by 2020. Minister Herrera said that Malta is showing this commitment together with the ratification of the Treaty of Paris, where Malta was among the first countries to ratify the treaty, with the country sending out a strong message that Malta wants to become a major player against climate change. During this meeting, an agreement was reached between EU Member States in order to ratify the Doha Amendment by the end of this year. The Government of Malta is taking various initiatives against climate change such as incentivising low-emission practices, introducing unprecedented measures to use gas and bio-diesel, and working on reforms in public transport, said Minister Herrera. Climate change affects every town and village throughout the world. This includes extreme changes in nature such as those affecting ice sheets, sea level rise, extreme weather and temperatures, rain, and drought. All this is impacting not only undeveloped regions but also the health of human beings. Minister Herrera said that Malta is not an exception where, even though its contributions to climate change are minimal (0.01% of world emissions), it is still its political and moral duty to take part in this discussion and give our contribution. The Minister stated that Malta country is adopting various policies to achieve such goals. It was also mentioned that amongst other initiatives the Maltese Government is committed to introducing a nationwide project by next year in waste management to collect organic bag across Malta and Gozo. This will result in lowering greenhouse emissions, thus Malta will be reducing the amount of waste going processed by landfills. Minister Herrera said that in Malta, despite the increase in economic growth, there is still a determination to switch the economy to one that depends on low-carbon practices. This is being done in the energy sector, where radical changes are being made for the benefit of the environment and the good of our health. The government began discussing and giving incentives for more people to invest in electric vehicles so as to replace those operating with fuel, including tax exemption and free road licenses. Furthermore, the government introduced a number of measures, included in the last budget, to incentivise the use of public transport and alternative means to private cars, continued Minister Herrera. Other measures being taken include those in the field of agriculture such as the implementation of the nitrates action programme to reduce the impact of agriculture on the level of nitrates in water, as well as the management of emissions from our landfills. On governance, the Minister recalled that climate change is a separate act, while on the countrys finances the government remains committed to honouring its obligations to help developing and less developed countries address these challenges. With respect to financial contributions, the Minister emphasised that earlier this month, he had announced the extension of the current scholarship programmes that his Ministry has with the University of Malta in order to help more students coming from countries vulnerable to the alteration in climate.? \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India412","United States : More Countries Are Putting a Price on Carbon But Stronger Action Is Needed to Meet Paris Targets: New World Bank Report","November 2, 2017 Thursday","TendersInfo","More and more countries and sub-national jurisdictions are putting a price on carbon but the level of action must ramp up significantly to help the world meet its Paris Agreement targets, says a new World Bank report. Launched just ahead of the UNFCCCs Climate COP23 in Bonn, the annual review: State and Trends of Carbon Pricing 2017, presents good and not-so-good news. On the positive side, the value of carbon pricing initiatives including emissions trading schemes (ETS) and carbon taxes - reached $52 billion, an increase of 7 percent compared to 2016. And with eight new or enhanced carbon pricing initiatives in place since early 2016 - three quarters of them in the Americas (Colombia, Chile, and several Canadian provinces) there are now 42 national and 25 sub-national jurisdictions putting a price on carbon emissions. Together, these jurisdictions raised revenues from carbon pricing of more than $20 billion for the second consecutive year, with the potential to raise much more. The report says revenues could increase to over $100bn a year if existing carbon pricing schemes adopted prices consistent with the Paris Agreement temperature targets. On the less positive side, the report finds that 85 percent of emissions are still not covered by carbon pricing, and that most current carbon prices are significantly lower than the $40-80/tCO2 by 2020 and $50-100/tCO2 by 2030 that the Stern-Stiglitz High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices found to be consistent with the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. A well-designed carbon price is an indispensable part of a strategy for efficiently reducing greenhouse gas emissions while also fostering growth, said John Roome, Senior Director for Climate Change at the World Bank. While weve seen progress over the past year, action to expand carbon pricing coverage and to increase prices to deepen its impact has to accelerate. The report highlights key areas of progress made since early 2016, including: Chile and Colombia launched carbon taxes; Three Canadian provinces (Alberta, British Columbia, and Ontario) and one US state (Washington) introduced new or enhanced carbon pricing schemes; Mexico is starting a one-year ETS simulation to create awareness on carbon pricing and prepare for the launch of a pilot ETS in 2018; and China is gearing up for the commencement of its national ETS, potentially the largest carbon pricing initiative in the world. The report estimates that an additional US$700 billion a year will be needed annually by 2030 to finance the transition to low-carbon economies. The report builds a vision for an integrated approach that links climate-focused domestic policies and carbon pricing, complemented by effective international cooperation through climate finance from donors and new climate markets, to mobilize resources at the speed and scale required to deliver low-carbon growth, jobs and innovation. According to the report, domestic resources will need to make a significant contribution, enabled by improved national policy environments -- including carbon pricing -- to catalyze increased private sector investment. International climate finance will remain important and could be targeted where it is most effective at supporting the low-carbon transition and to promote the development of climate markets. As climate markets develop, they could play a larger role in mobilizing resources for low-carbon investments. Results-based climate finance could support this transition by piloting programs based on the principles of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, providing lessons and building capacity for the implementation of international climate markets. \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India413","France : La Runion joins Under2 Coalition and commits to bold climate targets","October 7, 2017 Saturday","TendersInfo","La Runion has become the latest member of the Under2 Coalition of leading sub-national governments that are working together to fight climate change and support the Paris Climate Agreement. The Coalition, for which The Climate Group acts as Secretariat, brings together states, regions and cities as well as national governments, committed to reducing their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions towards net-zero by 2050. Didier Robert, President of the Regional Council of La Runion, signed the Under2 MOU on Friday during a meeting with Helen Clarkson, CEO, The Climate Group at the International Conference on Climate Change Adaptation being hosted by the small island region. It is the eighth region of France, a national endorser of the Under2 Coalition, to sign. Clarkson congratulated La Runion - an island in the Indian Ocean, east of Madagascar - saying: We are delighted to welcome La Runion to the Under2 Coalition. The signing of La Runion, a small island region, is a significant moment as we build towards COP23 in November hosted by fellow small island state Fiji. ""Members of the Under2 Coalition are demonstrating global leadership and commitment on the defining challenge of our era. In signing the Under2 MOU, La Runion has adopted it as a guiding principal for its ambitious climate actions. SUB-NATIONAL CLIMATE LEADERSHIP Signatories make a public commitment to reduce their GHG emissions by 80-95% on 1990 levels, or two metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent per capita, by 2050. La Runion has become the 188th member of the Coalition. The Coalition was founded in 2015 by California and the German state of Baden-Wrttemberg to galvanize ambitious climate action from sub-national governments in the build up to the COP21 climate summit when the historic Paris Agreement was reached. Coalition members include sub-national governments from around the world and it is also endorsed by 17 nations with the Marshall Islands becoming the latest endorser at Climate Week NYC in September. Other small islands that have signed or endorsed the Under2 MOU include the Azores, Madeira, Sardinia and Fiji. President Robert, who attended the Under2 Meeting at Climate Week NYC 2017, said: The French and European territory of La Runion in the Indian Ocean, along with other small island economies in this part of the world, is one of the first sentinels of climate disruption. We are heavily impacted and have no other real alternative than to take action. For several years in La Runion, we have committed ourselves fully to the concept of positive initiative. Sustainable development, the fight against global warming, and the protection of biodiversity are at the heart of the public policy and innovative actions that we promote. COLLABORATIVE APPROACH La Runion is aiming to develop an ecological tourism sector, with the objective of welcoming 600,000 tourists by 2020. The local economy's primary sector is dominated by sugarcane, the secondary sector's main added value is provided by the agriculture and food industry, and the island's tertiary sector has become its main employer. Currently, nearly half (47%) of the islands power is generated by coal-fired power stations. However, owing to its rich natural environment, La Runion has exceptional potential for renewable energy generation (solar energy, marine energy, wind energy and biomass). The region has adopted a strategy for sustainable development which is largely based on renewable energy sources, and it aims to attain energy autonomy by 2030. In order to reach these goals, La Runion has implemented a new Energy Governance since 2013, led by the Regional Council and including energy stakeholders from both the public and private sectors. With this collaborative working platform, La Runion aims to be the first territory in the world where all low carbon innovations are integrated into society, by 2030. The topics developed by the governance and its working committees include transport, tourism, energy production, storage and use, town planning and construction. \"
"COP23","India","COP23_India414","Time to Share the Burden","November 10, 2017 Friday","The Telegraph (India)","Nations have reassembled in Bonn this week to finalize the Paris climate accord, which came into force last year. This is the first 'Islands COP', marking the debut of Fiji as the leader of COP 23 , a landmark event in the history of climate talks. Given the host of non-traditional security threats, the geopolitical game of nation states plays a pivotal role in determining the environmental agenda. History bears witness that the burden-sharing scheme of reducing the global mean temperature developed by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change - be it the Kyoto Protocol or the Paris agreement - did not go down well with the developed bloc. The American decision to withdraw from the Paris pact has negated the Kyoto Protocol too. In the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, Washington's approach towards environment stands as a glaring paradox. In the wake of such disasters, it is evident that Trump's £nti-climate policies' are certainly changing the political environment; the move to abandon the Clean Power Plan is one example. In a bid to downplay Barack Obama's legacy, the Environmental Protection Agency emphatically remarked how 'the war on coal is over' by eliminating the CPP. Considering Trump's vast supporter base, his policy overhauls are certainly headline-grabbing but they still remain short of fulfilling their objectives. Experts, however, believe that such a step by Trump could just be the defining moment for New Delhi and Beijing to prove their potential in mitigating climate change. Interestingly, China and India have stepped up the ante in ensuring a constructive green energy mix. Considering India's remarkable progress in solar installations, the country possesses enormous potential to develop a firm climate agenda and an even sturdier energy mix. It is expected to add 9.4 GW of solar power capacity by this year, overtaking Japan in the global solar market as the third biggest producer. An ambitious renewable energy project of 175 GW by 2022 is also in the fray. Combine these factors and it appears to be a win-win situation for New Delhi. The challenge is to sustain the momentum. Financing is another key area wherein New Delhi is likely to attract some promising investors in Bonn. Developing a green climate fund to finance mitigation and adaptation projects would be the highlight at Bonn. Interestingly, the $50 million sovereign green 'climate bond' generated by Fiji with the assistance of the World Bank ahead of the conference imparts a sense of confidence for India to keep up its march for a carbon-free economy. Fiji is certainly establishing a strong narrative in climate negotiations. Following the US pull-out, it is essential that member states slowly inch towards one straight line of priorities and targets. However, COP 23 \"

Success stories, action and new commitments shared during Energy Day at the UN Climate Change Conference named COP23 here from businesses, states, cities and forward-thinking countries continue to show ambition to ensure the clean energy transition is not only underway but is irreversible. ""Our pledge to leave no one behind is a critical component of the Paris Agreement. The energy transition that we can see is underway and must be a transition towards energy systems around the world that secure sustainable energy for all,"" said Kyte, who is also the CEO of Sustainable Energy for All. International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) Director-General Adnan Z. Amin said: ""Two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions stem from energy production and use, which puts the energy sector front and centre of global efforts to combat climate change."" ""Our analysis shows that renewables and energy efficiency can together provide over 90 per cent of the mitigation needed in the energy system by 2050 to achieve the ambitions of the Paris Agreement, while also boosting the economy, creating jobs and improving human health and well-being,"" he said. International Energy Agency Executive Director Fatih Birol said: ""The transition of the energy sector in the next decades will be critical to meeting shared climate and sustainable development goals. Widespread action by governments and private sector alike has helped keep global energy-related emissions flat the last three years."" The central goal of the 2015 Paris Agreement is to keep the average global temperature rise well below two degrees Celsius and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees. About one degree of that rise has already happened, underlining the urgency to progress much further and faster with the global clean energy transformation. Energy Day was organized by the Climate Group, International Energy Agency, IRENA and Sustainable Energy for All as part of a series of thematic action days held under the auspices of the Marrakech Partnership. It suggests there is substantial scope for countries to cost-effectively increase the renewable energy ambitions set forth in their Nationally Determined Contributions so that they are aligned with the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement. Two years after the world united around the Paris Climate Agreement and a year after its entry into force, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change's (UNFCCC) 197 parties have been reconvened for the 23rd annual climate change talks in Bonn till November 17. The Bonn talks, which began on November 6, are expected to take a number of decisions necessary to bring the Paris Agreement to life, including meaningful progress on the agreement implementation guidelines, to achieve a goal of keeping global warming within 1.5 degrees Celsius with an aim to cut greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels. --IANS vg/vd \"

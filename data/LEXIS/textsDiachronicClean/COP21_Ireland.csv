"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland1","Ireland to seek lower EU climate targets; Government to cite recession in lobbying EU for less demanding cuts for 2030","October 9, 2015 Friday","The Irish Times","The Government is to lobby the EU for a lower cut in the State's greenhouse emissions than the proposed 40 per cent target Brussels is seeking. While the EU has committed to an overall 40 per cent cut in emissions by 2030 compared to 2005, the reduction for each member state will vary and will be individually negotiated next year. As pioneering climate change legislation completes its passage through the Oireachtas this week, senior Government sources have said it would be difficult to achieve the target due to Ireland's dependence on agriculture and the impact of the recession. ""We will have difficulty meeting our targets for 2020 as it is [20 per cent compared to 2005],"" said a source. ""We are not well placed for 2030 as things stand.""In March this year the EU agreed on a new overall 2030 framework for climate and energy which was submitted to the United Nations. This is ahead of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 21), which begins in Paris in late November. COP21 hopes to get commitments from more than 190 countries to keep global warming below 2 degrees.\~Climate Bill The report stage of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill was debated in the D\'e1il yesterday, the last phase of the legislation. While the Bill has been sharply criticised for setting no targets for 2050, significant amendments have been accepted by Fine Gael, including a commitment to ""climate justice"" as well as the guaranteed independence of an expert advisory committee on climate change. It also commits the Government to abide by targets agreed at EU level. In its negotiations with the EU, the Government will argue the EU should have regard for the recession and the constraints it placed on investment to reduce emissions. The latest estimate is that Ireland will fall short of the 2020 target by 6 per cent. The inclusion of a ""climate justice"" clause came as a surprise as Fine Gael had originally argued against it. However, Taoiseach Enda Kenny agreed with Independent TD Maureen O'Sullivan in the D\'e1il last month that such a clause should form part of the Bill. Climate justice attempts to address perceived injustices caused by climate change. Its addition is seen as a concession by Fine Gael to Labour. Ois\'edn Coghlan of Friends of the Earth said the Bill had improved but remained weaker than it should be.""While the biggest gap is the absence of an explicit 2050 target, the Bill does refer to the Government's national policy objective of 80 per cent reductions in emissions from electricity, transport and buildings and carbon neutrality in agriculture. Meanwhile . . . this Government will go through its term without adopting a national action plan to reduce emissions.""Paris conference Objectives The United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21To that end, it seeks a commitment from each country to ensure that global temperature will not increase more than 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels.Last weekend, the diplomat heading the French secretariat to COP 21, Laurence Tubiana, said she was 70 per cent confident agreement could be reached in December. \l"

When what was to become the Kyoto Protocol was agreed in December 1997, there was a similar outburst of exhilaration and frustration among the participants. But we had momentum and early instruments that allowed the progression, often hesitant, of what has come to fruition in Paris last week.Today we have an extraordinary agenda to develop and we need to focus on the policies and measures that will be implemented by governments and peoples to achieve climate balance in a more just and sustainable future. We have a unique convergence on what our final destination is. We are much better equipped for the journey than we were 18 years ago. Since we are not in a ""command and control' world, we will only arrive with the consent of public opinion across the world. To create this support we need to respect the genuine differences in means and policy options and to create a fellowship on our journey that will maintain the critical political and social momentum needed in the difficult years ahead .

These greenhouse-gas emissions will need to fall to zero by 2100 if we are to have any chance of limiting global warming below the potentially dangerous threshold of 2 degrees. The period from 1983 to 2012 was likely the warmest 30-year period of the past 1,400 years in the northern hemisphere, while last year alone was the hottest worldwide since records began. Tackling climate change will require ""substantial and sustained reductions"" in emissions to limit risks of ""severe, widespread and irreversible impacts"" globally by 2100, the scientists say. As predicted by the economist Nicholas Stern, in an analysis for the British government in 2006, the IPCC says delaying action will ""substantially increase the challenges"" to limit global warming below 2 degrees. Heatwaves are likely to occur more often and last longer, and extreme precipitation events - such as devastating typhoons in Southeast Asia - will become more intense and frequent, the IPCC says. If the average temperature were to rise by more than 4 degrees, ""substantial species extinction"" would occur, as well as food insecurity, slower economic growth, endemic poverty and mass migrations. Emissions can be ""substantially reduced"" through changes in consumption patterns, switching to renewable-energy sources, such as solar or wind, and adopting simple energy-saving measures.'The Irish Times' at COP21 Daily reports from Paris The 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, aka COP21, takes place at Le Bourget, just outside Paris, from November 30th to December 11th.

Now, as Paris prepares to host the United Nations , which starts on November 30th, Irish nongovernmental organisations are uniting for a series of People's Climate Marches in Dublin, Belfast, Cork and Galway on Sunday, November 29th. Groups such as Tr\'f3caire and Oxfam, which are chiefly concerned about the impact of flooding, drought, disease and food scarcity on developing countries, will join Friends of the Earth and Stop Climate Chaos campaigners. Together they are seeking community renewable-energy projects, sustainable, liveable cities, the phasing out of fossil fuels, and ""decent work for all in the transition to a low-carbon society"". Trade unionists, church-goers and youth groups will walk the streets together, calling for national and international action on climate change. ""The crucial thing is that we are the last generation who can do something to limit the amount of greenhouse-gas emissions to keep global temperature below the catastrophic 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels,"" says Bernie Connolly of Cork Environmental Forum, one of the main organisers of the People's Climate March in the city. ""The pope's encyclical on climate change, Laudato Si', has meant that we are reaching a much wider constituency through Eco-Congregation Ireland"" - an interdenominational group that helps churches be environmentally aware in the context of their Christianity - ""and parishes who want to do something positive to limit the damage we are all causing.""The marches in Ireland will help to create an impetus for the smaller group of campaigners that will then travel to Paris, either to observe negotiations or to protest. Ciara Kirrane of Stop Climate Chaos, a coalition of civic-society organisations, says, ""We see Paris as a beginning rather than an end. It's an opportunity to start connecting people's demands for justice, equality, food, jobs and rights and to strengthen the movement, to force governments to listen and act in people's interests and not in the vested interests of elites.

"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland5","COP21 climate change summit","December 10, 2015 Thursday","The Irish Times","Sir, - Since the COP21 global summit in Paris started, some of the coverage amounts to little more than laying most of the blame on the farmers. If they got rid of their belching cows everything would be all right, or so the argument goes. Surely there is more to the debate than that.The agri-food sector in this country involves over 230,000 jobs. It includes approximately 600 food and drinks firms throughout the country that export 85 per cent of our food and seafood to more than 160 countries worldwide. Those exports are worth EUR 10 billion or more to the citizens of this country.If we are to curtail that industry in order to meet our global targets, as advocated by many non-agrifood lobbies, then the consequences in terms of the economics, the employment and the social infrastructure of many areas in this country need to be examined. - Yours, etc,A LEAVY,Dublin 13. Sir, - In his article ""COP21: Five technologies that could help - and five that will not"", December 9th), Paddy Woodworth rightly says that ""if ecology teaches us one lesson, it is that everything in our world is connected to everything else"".Microbes are what connects ""everything"" to, well, everything else in ecology.Understanding, and harnessing, the microbial world is a critical component in addressing our energy and climate problems (""Human waste biogas could power millions of homes, says UN study"", November 3rd), but they are rarely mentioned in the climate debate. - Yours, etc,Dr GAVIN COLLINS,School of Natural Sciences,NUI Galway.Sir, - I agree wholeheartedly regarding the need for a genuine effort by Ireland to decarbonise our society. Indeed we have practical examples to follow in the cases of France, Sweden and Ontario. All of the above decarbonised their energy systems by scaling up nuclear power for electricity production. No examples exist where renewables have achieved the same outcome . Dr James Hansen, formerly chief climatologist with the Nasa Goddard Institute, has made a submission with other climate experts at Paris for the adoption of a strongly pro-nuclear policy in our battle with climate change and ocean acidification. In fact at this point it is fair to say that an anti-nuclear environmentalist is an oxymoron. - Yours, etc,Dr PAT MORRISSEY,Adare, Co Limerick . \l"
"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland6","COP21 climate change conference","December 3, 2015 Thursday","The Irish Times","Sir, - Taoiseach Enda Kenny calls the European Commission's target for a 20 per cent reduction in emissions in 2020 compared to 2005 ""unrealistic"" and ""unachievable"" (""COP21: Kenny criticises 'unrealistic' climate targets"", December 1st). However, the most recent research by the European Commission projects the region will achieve a 24 per cent reduction. Unfortunately, Ireland is just one of four countries projected to fail to meet its burden-sharing target.Mr Kenny also blames the previous administration, which included the Green Party, for this failure. Again, however, the facts suggest otherwise. The European Commission and the European Environment Agency's 2015 report on climate targets notes that in Ireland ""current policies appear to be insufficiently effective at overcoming obstacles to generate sufficient emissions reductions"". By contrast, when Mr Kenny took office in 2011, the same organisations found that the country was on track to meet its 2020 target.It is not surprising that Mr Kenny would choose to play politics and try to deflect blame for his administration's failings both on the European Commission and on the previous government. It is disappointing, however, that he would choose to do so with a matter as important as climate change. - Yours, etc,PAUL SAMMON,Islington, London.Sir, - I see we are again aiming to ""save the planet"", according to many media outlets.

More than 150 national leaders made speeches filled with pledges, aspirations and warnings. While their speeches gave a good indication of where each country stands in its attitude to tackling climate change, the real work will take place over the coming days.Global warming has already increased by 1C and the effects are being felt, especially by poorer nations of the world, interfering with food production and with storms, droughts and floods causing devastation they cannot afford.Mr Kenny focused in on agriculture, but with a very different problem from that of poorer countries. While this conference is expected to agree to cut greenhouse gasses, the EU has said it will cut them by 40% by 2030 and the individual national cuts will be decided at the EU level.Ireland and three other countries were set the highest targets for 2020 of cutting by 20%, something Mr Kenny said was an over estimate of what could actually be delivered given a third of the country s emissions come from agriculture, mainly the national herd.However, because of the unrealistic target and the economic crisis Ireland is not in a position to reach the goal and if another target is to be added to that for 2030, that will create a real problem, he said.Under the EU rules if Ireland fails to achieve the targets it would have to buy carbon credits to make up for them, which could be very costly. The European commission is now discussing the targets for the individual countries which will be released next year.Mr Kenny said that the country is now among the most advanced in carbon foot-printing its beef and dairy farms, driving economic and environmental efficiency, and contributing to research including feed that can be shared with other countries, he said.Ireland maintained its humanitarian aid, and will contribute to the Green climate Fund next year, Mr Kenny added.\l"

The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) says that while the economy grew by 5.2pc last year, energy consumption fell by 0.5pc with emissions down by 1.2pc.The use of renewables to produce electricity has avoided spending (EURO)255m a year on fossil fuels, the 'Energy in Ireland 1990-2014' report says, and has helped reduce emissions by 2.6 million tonnes a year.UN conference on climate change, COP 21""The analysis shows us clearly where we are still too dependent on fossil fuel fuels and where we are becoming less so,"" he said.

Never before have all 195 countries in the world - large and small, rich and poor - pledged that they would fight global warming together, for the sake of future generations ""in a world we will not see"", as French president Fran\'e7ois Hollande eloquently put it. After 20 years of UN climate conferences, two weeks of hard negotiations in Paris - led with great finesse and determination by French foreign minister Laurent Fabius, as COP21 president - and many sleepless nights, a deal that everyone involved could live with was finally struck. Its most important element is the highly ambitious long-term goal to hold the rise in average global temperatures to ""well below 2 [degrees] above pre-industrial levels"" and even to ""pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees.""Of course, the Earth will not be ""saved"" from the ravages of runaway climate change by the adoption of this overarching goal alone, without the means to achieve it. Disappointingly, no specific targets have been set to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by quantified amounts between now and 2050; instead, parties aim to reach global peaking of emissions ""as soon as possible"" and to achieve what would amount to carbon neutrality ""in the second half of this century"".But the temperature target - a considerable victory for vulnerable small island states and other low-lying countries threatened by rising sea levels - carries its own clout; it will become the benchmark by which the voluntary pledges made by countries to cut their emissions will be judged over time. So far, 189 of these ""nationally determined contributions"" have been submitted to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change secretariat, and they will now have to be updated every five years under the Paris Agreement.Furthermore, $100 billion per year in aid by 2020 to help poorer nations cope with the challenges - first promised by developed countries at the abortive Copenhagen climate summit in 2009 - has now been set as the ""floor level"" for this flow of funding, to be reviewed in 2025. Also significant is the survival in the Paris Agreement of a ""loss and damage mechanism"" to help deal with displacement of people in the least developed countries as a result of severe storms and other extreme weather events. Overall, the Paris Agreement sends out a clear signal to the wider world, including capital markets, that we are now witnessing the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era and the transition to a cleaner energy future, already under way. \l"

""Implementing proven interventions to reduce emissions of short-lived climate pollutants, like black carbon and methane from achieving higher vehicle emissions and efficiency standards, would be expected to save approximately 2.4 million lives a year and reduce global warming by about 0.5C by 2050.""It is predicted that climate change will cause an additional 25,000 deaths per year from malaria, diarrhoea, heat stress and under-nutrition between 2030 and 2050. Children, women and the poor in lower income countries will be the most vulnerable and most affected, widening health gaps.""While countries have committed to reducing emissions in advance of the talks, the United Nations says they are not sufficient to limit warming to 2C, which scientists consider a tipping point.""If countries take strong actions to address climate change, while protecting and promoting health, they will collectively bring about a planet that is not only more environmentally intact, but also has cleaner air, more abundant and safer freshwater and, as a result, healthier people."" it said.WHO has launched a set of climate change and health country profiles for 14 nations, which show that an additional seven million people in Bangladesh will be exposed to coastal flooding each year between 2070 and 2100 as sea levels rise, but this would reduce to 14,000 with strong action.In Nigeria, some 70,000 premature deaths from outdoor air pollution could be prevented from 2030 onwards, it global emissions fall.

Some of us were saying 20 something years ago that if we didn t tackle these issues you would see ever greater conflict over scarce resources and ever greater difficulties over drought, and the accumulating effect of climate change, which means that people have to move. And, in fact, there s very good evidence indeed that one of the major reasons for this horror in Syria, funnily enough was a drought that lasted for about five or six years, which meant that huge numbers of people in the end had to leave the land. Asked if there was a direct link between climate change, conflict and terrorism, he added: It s only in the last few years that the Pentagon have actually started to pay attention to this. I mean it has a huge impact on what is happening. The difficulty is sometimes to get this point across that if we just leave it and say, well there are obviously lots of, there are endless problems arising all over the place therefore we deal with them in a short-term way, we never deal with the underlying root cause which regrettably is what we re doing to our natural environment. The interview came ahead of Charles travelling to Paris to deliver a keynote speech at the November 30 opening ceremony for , the UN conference on climate change which will attempt to reach a new international agreement to help limit global warming to no more than two degrees.Charles has been a strong advocate of taking action to protect the environment for many years.In 2007 he set up the Prince s Rainforest Group to find a solution to save the world s threatened forests.He addressed a UN international climate summit in Copenhagen in 2009 and the following year he gave a keynote speech to the Oslo Climate and Forest Conference.\l"
"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland14","Looking for a beacon of hope on climate change; The Cop21 climate summit in Paris offers us a truly historic opportunity for a global energy revolution","November 23, 2015 Monday","The Irish Times","As Paris recovers from the shock of the recent horrific attacks, the City of Light also stands as a beacon of hope for the world as it prepares to host a historic meeting of world leaders. This event provides a level of optimism not witnessed before, providing the possibility of a global energy technology revolution over the next 40 years.The much-anticipated United Nations conference on climate change, which runs from November 30th-December 11th, will see global leaders and thousands of others (up to 30,000 people are expected) to gather in Paris. It is called Cop21 as it is the 21st gathering or ""Conference of the Parties"" to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. According to the UN, Cop21 is where governments will reach a new and universal climate change agreement.While uncertainties remain regarding the precise impact - in time and place - of climate change, the growing body of scientific evidence has demonstrated that climate change is happening, and that it is being caused by human activities - notably our addiction to fossil fuels such as oil, coal and gas to provide our heating, transport and electricity needs. The energy transition required to limit the damage caused by climate change offers huge potential for innovation, a technology revolution, economic activity and resulting jobs. We have had agreements before so why is this one so significant? At the first such event in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 (subsequently called the Earth Summit), 154 countries signed a contractual agreement to collectively prevent dangerous, human-induced climate change. This has now been signed by 195 countries (Parties to the Convention).At the (Cop3) meeting in Kyoto in 1997, industrialised countries (including Ireland) agreed specific limits to the growth of harmful greenhouse gas emissions by 2012 (caused when we burn fossil fuels, as well as from belching cattle and other sources). This agreement was called the Kyoto Protocol but some significant countries were not included - the US, China and India. It was at the Cop16 event in Canc\'fan in 2010 that world leaders committed to a specific limit for global warming, ie limiting climate change so that global warming caused by human activity does not increase by more than 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels. But it is during Cop21 in Paris that the ambition agreed thus far is expected to become real and significant, moving from agreed aspiration to a negotiated plan to deliver. The hope is that we will achieve a deal on the 'how' part, ie a global agreement on who does what in order for the limit in global warming to be achieved. This is the focus of Cop21. We have previously seen expectations build up only to result in disappointment, most notably the Cop15 meeting in Copenhagen in 2009 which failed to deliver. Why is Cop21 different?Firstly, recent evidence of changes happening on the ground around the world is striking. In 2014 energy-related greenhouse gas emissions did not increase, despite a 3 per cent growth in economic activity. Also, nearly half of all newly installed electricity-generating capacity came from renewable energy, in other words more additional power coming from wind, hydro and solar than from coal or natural gas. This was led by growth in China, the US, Japan and Germany. More significantly, the UN has received this year, in advance of the Cop21 event, pledges (Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, or INDCs) from 168 countries around the world for emissions reduction. This is unprecedented, being the first time that so many countries have declared what their own specific ambition is for a low-carbon future and how they plan to deliver on it. It provides a much stronger political basis for the two weeks of negotiations than any previous climate change event. The anticipated Cop21 climate change agreement will cover many dimensions, including targets for 2030; plans for how to transition to a low-carbon future; the mechanisms for investing in low-carbon technologies; cost-sharing between those who have been polluting for many years and those who wish to ensure the correct balance is struck between countries' competing goals.The opportunity is huge. The International Energy Agency estimates an investment of nearly EUR 13 trillion is needed between now and 2030 to facilitate the energy part of the transition to a low-carbon world. For Ireland, this is a challenging and exciting development. The time to plan is now. The time is also right to tease out where the specific opportunities lie for us from this global opportunity - to tap into the growing potential for energy efficiency solutions, for renewable energy technologies, for communities to benefit, to move beyond the buzzwords of smart energy systems and big data towards harnessing the potential that the energy transition provides.

As president of the conference, France's foreign minister Laurent Fabius has staked his legacy on its success.""My task is to achieve an ambitious compromise, and the two words must be taken together,"" Fabius said in his office on the quai d'Orsay. ""It must be a compromise for everyone to accept it, but it has to be ambitious, because if we compromise at the expense of our goals we will not have done our job.""Fabius is caught in a contest of wills between the resentful but often justified demands of the developing world, and rich countries reluctant to sacrifice in the interest of the planet. He is helped by the Peruvian environment minister Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, whose mandate as president of COP20 technically runs until November 30th. ""It's extremely useful having one country from the north and one from the south,"" Fabius said. Tension between the G77, comprised of 134 developing and emerging countries, and the developed countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), came to the fore when 1,500 negotiators of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action - known as the ADP - met in Bonn from October 19th-23rd. It was their last chance to approve a draft treaty before COP21.""The G77 said the text was 'unbalanced' and to the detriment of developing countries,"" Fabius said. ""That was their principal argument. We had to build a new text which is longer and with more options, but the structure of the first text is preserved . . . Ideally, we would have put forward a very short project with few options left to be decided.""The final pre-COP21 draft treaty runs to 51 pages. Where negotiators could not agree, options are presented in brackets. Some paragraphs in article 3, regarding the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, contain 16 different options. When ADP negotiators resume work in Paris on December 1st, they will have one week to boil down the unwieldy text. They will present it to Fabius, who will work with ministers for foreign affairs and the environment to agree on a final treaty by December 11th. Some 80 ministers will attend a ""pre-COP21"" summit in Paris from November 8th-10th. Asked whether it would not be preferable to abandon the ADP process, Fabius replied ""there is nothing wrong with being a little diplomatic"".Eighty heads of state and government have accepted an invitation from President Fran\'e7ois Hollande and himself to attend the opening day of COP21 on November 30th, Fabius said. Their presence is supposed to create ""political impetus"" for the negotiations that follow. Barack Obama, the Chinese and Indian leaders Xi Jinping and Narendra Modi, Angela Merkel, David Cameron and Matteo Renzi have accepted. Vladimir Putin has not yet replied.Despite its disappointing results, the last Bonn session made progress on important issues, Fabius says. The mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation, away from carbon fuels and towards more reliance on renewable energy, are the two pillars of the fight against global warming. The OECD estimates only 16 per cent of finance has been devoted to adaptation. As the developing countries demand, ""Bonn arrived at a broad consensus on the necessity of devoting more resources to adaptation"", Fabius said.In advance of COP21, 155 of 195 countries have submitted ""intended nationally determined contributions"" or INDCs, indicating how they will reduce their carbon output. Together, the 155 account for 90 per cent of global emissions. But when added up, their promised cuts will not limit the rise in the world's temperature to 1.5 or 2 degrees by 2100. The Paris treaty will avoid the ""catastrophic scenario"" of a 4, 5 or 6 degree rise in temperature, but at present levels of commitments, the temperature is still likely to rise 3 degrees, Fabius said.This has strengthened the French foreign minister's argument for periodic, upward revision of INDCs. ""I have personally insisted for a long time on the necessity of a revision clause,"" he said. ""Bonn strengthened support for this mechanism, which is important."" Fabius said there was also ""a move towards convergence"" on follow-up to assess whether countries fulfil commitments to reduce emissions. However, he added, the expression ""non-intrusive mechanism"" comes up often.Binding agreement Asked what would represent a successful conference outcome for him, Fabius said, ""The first criterion of success is a legally binding agreement, approved by all 195 countries - which has never happened - saying we commit ourselves not to go beyond 1.5 or 2 degrees.""The above-mentioned revision clause is Fabius's second criterion. The manner, date and periodicity of revision are all under discussion. ""We would be extremely disappointed if the question was not resolved positively,"" he said.Developing countries have stated they will not sign up to an agreement if the $100 billion which developed countries promised in annual aid for adaptation is not forthcoming, or if it is not extended beyond 2020. The OECD reported this month that developed countries spent $61.8 billion on helping the developing world adapt to global warming in 2014. The G77 contested the validity of the OECD study. Though finance and the transfer of technology may not be included in the Paris treaty, they are a prerequisite for its success, Fabius said. Carbon pricing and the need to diminish $500 billion in annual subsidies to the fossil fuel industry will not figure in the treaty either, but they will be discussed in Paris.\l"

Local weather systems According to Fran\'e7ois Englebrecht, the CSIR project's lead scientist, by the end of the century both zones could witness further warming of at least 1\'bd times the global rate because of how climate change is expected to interact with the local weather systems.""In our modelling we look at the evidence and temperatures over the last five decades and it shows that climate change is already taking place in Africa at a rapid rate compared to the global rate,"" he says.Englebrecht also says data analysed by his team show Africa's subtropics' temperatures are rising by at least 2 degrees per century over the review period when globally surface temperatures increased at a rate of up to 1 degree per century (see panel). The African subtropics are warming up more quickly than everywhere else because of how climate change interacts with the region's semi-permanent high pressure weather systems, Englebrecht says. ""When increased climate change is added to this type of weather pattern, the effect is that cloud-making is suppressed. This reduction in cloud cover over the land means more sunlight is reaching the surface area and drastically increasing its temperature,"" he says.While the subtropics of Australia and South America have a similar weather situation in terms of increasing surface temperatures, Africa's experience is more severe because its affected land mass is much bigger the others.The average temperature in Africa's subtropics is 30 degrees. Englebrecht says that, under a scenario where global temperatures rose by 3 degrees or more, parts of the continent were looking at a future where the average temperature is as high as 36 degrees.The impact of such increases on the agricultural and biodiversity sectors would be significant, says Englebrecht, and they will stem from extreme events such as heat waves, wild fires and drought. According to crop modelling, which helps to estimate yields when certain weather and soil conditions are applied, drought will decimate staple foods under a low mitigation future, especially important ones such as maize, which are needed for food security.Wild fires The enhanced temperatures expected in Africa imply the continent will have more wild fires. These usually happen in the savannah which provides grazing for domestic and wild animals.""Wild fires release CO2 into the atmosphere and trees thrive on this gas much more than grass does. So in the savannah trees are getting the upper hand at the expense of grassland, which adversely affects agricultural animals' and wildlife's grazing potential,"" he says. Englebrecht and his co-authors also say in their paper that general reductions in soil moisture across the continent as a result of the increased levels of evaporation that occurs in response to rising surface temperatures is a plausible reality in the future.""In the subtropics, this effectively implies a longer burning season and a shorter growing season,"" he says.If world leaders fail to secure a legally binding framework and emissions agreement in Paris that fully responds to Africa's more precarious position when it comes to rising temperatures, the continent's future looks bleak.""The decisions we make now will determine our energy future,"" says Englebrecht. ""They will lock us into a certain type of climate future for the next century or more.""\l"

Lack of long-term funding for the Mace Head atmospheric research station is forcing reliance on goodwill to provide data underpinning the science at COP21.Currently it has less than one full-time technician from NUI Galway (NUIG), and relies on PhD students and transient researchers to fulfil an escalating body of work. Critics say it falls between funding models due to a State policy which demands commercial job generation at the expense of basic research.The 56-year-old observatory, perched on the edge of the Atlantic, is one of a network of eight such ""super-sites"" in Europe ranging from the Alps to north Finland. However, Mace Head's isolation means it measures some of the continent's cleanest air.Regarded as one of the most sophisticated facilities of its kind in the world, it provides climate and air pollution data in ""real time"" every 10 minutes, and its information on volcanic eruptions like that of Iceland's Eyjafjallaj\'f6kull in 2010 has been crucial to safe air travel. The work of its scientists - among the world's most influential - is published regularly in journals lsuch as Nature. As Prof Colin O'Dowd and Prof Andy Shearer of NUIG's school of physics explain, the pressure on Mace Head to fulfil research contracts has escalated in recent years. Instrumentation ""We have over EUR 10 million worth of instrumentation, and we are attracting EUR 2 million annually in research grants,"" they said.

The greatest danger is not that we aim too high and we miss but that we aim too low and only do that. Christiana Figueres, executive director of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change: Never before has a responsibility so great been in the hands of so few.

Prince Charles: If the planet were a patient, we would have treated her long ago.

Ireland has an ICT skills base, significant natural resources, and a vibrant entrepreneurial environment, and we have the benefit of an all-island market to test technologies on our grid.The question remains how to best engineer a transition to a low-carbon economy. Economists will argue for having an appropriate carbon tax, but pricing itself has historically rarely, if ever, driven large-scale energy transition. Europe's, and Ireland's, industrial base needs to be phased out and replaced with new technologies and practices that require a suite of policies, regulatory reforms and investments to spark this shift. A proactive government stimulating the development and diffusion of such clean technologies is required.Yet, while Europe leads the world in variable renewable energy, investment has stalled, providing a significant gap between the promises made at the COP21 global climate summit in Paris and the action that needs to implemented. Clean energy investment in Asia is thriving to the point where developing countries are out-investing developed countries in terms of clean energy technologies. Europe has an excellent research base but is not transferring its research into products.As Ireland moves to domestic ratification of the climate treaty, it must seize the opportunities from full implementation. This requires an acknowledgement that the challenges are interdisciplinary, and require collaboration across academia and with industry. Applied research remains critical to Ireland's ability to meet its future commitments arising from COP21. Irish academic institutions are reorganising and cross-pollinating discipl"

After decades of struggling negotiations and the failure of a summit in Copenhagen six years ago, some form of landmark agreement appears all but assured by mid-December.Warnings from climate scientists, demands from activists and exhortations from religious leaders such as Pope Francis have coupled with major advances in cleaner energy sources like solar power to raise pressure for cuts in carbon emissions.Most scientists say failure to agree on strong measures in Paris would doom the world to ever-hotter temperatures, bringing with them deadlier storms, more frequent droughts, and rising sea levels as the polar ice melts. Facing such projections, the leaders of nations responsible for about 90% of the world s greenhouse gas emissions have come bearing pledges to reduce their carbon output.Over the next two weeks, negotiators will hammer out the strongest international climate pact yet. What should give us hope that this is a turning point, that this is the moment we finally determined we would save our planet, is the fact that our nations share a sense of urgency about this challenge and a growing realisation that it is within our power to do something about it, said Mr Obama.Security has been tightened after Islamist militant attacks killed 130 people on November 13, and Mr Hollande said he could not separate the fight with terrorism from the fight against global warming .Leaders must face both challenges, leaving their children a world freed of terror as well as one protected from catastrophes .On the eve of the summit, an estimated 785,000 people from Australia to Paraguay joined the biggest day of climate change activism in history, telling world leaders there was no Planet B in the global warming fight. The US and China have both determined that it is our responsibility to take action , Obama said after meeting Mr Xi.That partnership has been a balm for the main source of tension that characterised previous talks, in which the developing world argued that countries that grew rich by industrialising on fossil fuels should pay the cost of shifting all economies to a renewable energy future.Now even China, once a leading voice of that club, has agreed to contribute to a Green Climate Fund that hopes to dispense 94.5bn a year after 2020 as a way to finance the developing world s shift towards renewables.\l"

""There willFigueres spoke at a press conference with France's foreign minister Laurent Fabius, who will preside over COP21, and the Peruvian environment minister Manuel Pulgar Vidal, who ran last year's COP20 in Lima. Reports published during the ""pre-COP"" had driven home the gravity of the situation, Fabius said. He quoted the World Bank's finding that 100 million more people are in danger of falling into extreme poverty by 2030 unless there are immediate reductions in carbon emissions and the report by the World Meteorological Organisation that greenhouse gas emissions broke all records last year. Before 2020 The ""pre-COP"" addressed four themes: the level of ambition of the Paris accord; the issue of equity and differentiation between industrialised and developing countries; continued financing to help developing countries elaborate low-carbon strategies once the Paris accord comes into force in 2020; and action to be taken before 2020.Fabius said the ambiance at the ""pre-COP"" was ""excellent"" and that it made progress on five issues. Climate financing for the developing world and promises to reduce carbon emissions will be reviewed every five years. The idea, contained in a recent Franco-Chinese joint statement ""has moved ahead to the point where it is accepted by everyone,"" Fabius said. There was also agreement on the principle that there can be ""no back-tracking"" by any country on its ""intended nationally determined contributions"" (INDCs), which must be increased over time.Regarding the goals of COP21, ""everyone agrees on an objective of 2 degrees"", Fabius said, referring to the promise not to allow global temperatures to rise more than 2 degrees by 2100. Vulnerable countries complain that even at 2 degrees, the consequences will be drastic. Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Sudan marked the ""pre-COP"" by submitting their INDCs, meaning that 160 of 195 countries have now made voluntary commitments. ""With the INDCs, we've avoided the scenario of a 4, 5 or 6 degree rise in temperature,"" Fabius said. ""We're at around 3 degrees. We must go downward, towards 2 degrees, and ideally towards 1.5 degrees.""Developing countries have pledged to increase the funds they donate to climate adaptation in the developing world annually, reaching $100 billion (EUR 93 billion) in 2020. ""The question is still open for after 2020,"" Fabius said. ""The notion that $100 billion has become a kind of threshold and that there can be new sources of finance was something we hadn't discussed in such a clear way before."" Accord text Finally, the ""pre-COP"" agreed on the schedule for the conference: 117 heads of state or government have promised to attend the opening session on November 30th. Negotiations on the text of the accord will resume that evening. Fabius has asked that UN negotiators give him their draft text by noon on December 5th. He and national environment and foreign ministers will then have six days to resolve outstanding details.President Fran\'e7ois Hollande's proposal for an ""environmental security council"" during a seminar at the Coll\'e8ge de France on Tuesday was not likely to reassure countries that are wary of meddling in their internal affairs. Hollande said he hoped that ""binding rules"" would emerge from the Paris agreement. ""The next step is to have an organisation, a form of environmental security council, to decide what is acceptable, that your behaviour is dangerous . . .,"" Hollande said. ""If the climate is such a danger for mankind, then we need an international body to take decisions . . . Which also means what sanctions we will apply when a country or a group, industrial or other, goes against what we have decided. The next step is to organise laws . . .""Asked about the president's proposal, Fabius said that while ""France supports strengthening world governance on the environment, this is not a subject for this COP. Our priority is to reach a universal accord in Paris.The Paris accord will, however, include a control mechanism, Figueres said. ""It's called MRV - monitoring, reporting and verification. It's going to be a peer-based system where countries will report their compliance with INDCs to their colleagues.""Old-fashioned selfishness may be the greatest motivator. ""The INDCs are in the interest of the countries presenting them,"" Figueres said. ""National interest is more powerful than a punitive system or legally binding compliance. The law is good, but self-interest is just as good or sometimes better."" Achieving transition Fabius and Figueres both emphasised the importance of civil society in achieving a transition to carbon-free development. The UNFCCC's Nazca (Non-State Actor Zone for Climate Action) portal has registered more than 6,000 commitments to climate action by companies, cities, subnational regions and investors. A whole day of the conference - December 5th - will be devoted to ""non-state actors"" and Fabius predicted ""extremely spectacular commitments"".""There is no such thing as 'Waiting for Godot,'"" Figueres said. ""Godot is already here. The turning point is already under way. The Paris agreement will only mark and accelerate it.""\l"

The world's developing countries produce 80pc of carbon emissions and neither India nor China, the two greatest polluters, are going to do anything to endanger their massive economic and industrial growth - a fact proved by the news that they will face no consequences if they breach their already generous carbon allowances.Instead, 14 days will be spent on hearing submissions from groups like the Women's Earth and Climate Action Network, which promises such delights as: ""Powerful women from around the world sharing stories, struggles, solutions and action plans on climate justice mobilisation.""That's all very worthy, I'm sure. But as recent opinion polls show that the general public's patience with climate scaremongering is wavering, it appears that fewer people are unthinkingly swallowing the climate-change Kool Aid than previously.There is the inevitable hypocrisy, of course, but that is to be expected - with an average round trip to Paris of 14,000km per delegate, the two-week shindig will produce 300,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide and even the most ardent climate change activist would surely admit that there is something grimly amusing about all that hot air being used to discuss the problems caused by hot air.But this conference is ultimately nothing more than a distraction; a way for governments to pretend that they are doing something when they are actually doing nothing.People are perfectly entitled to think that climate change is a greater threat to world peace and security than global terrorism.But they are wrong and deep down, they must realise that fact.But it is a lot easier to gather so many countries together and then angrily shake your fist at a problem that has no obvious villain - apart from the nasty West, obviously - than it is to confront the clear and very present danger posed by terrorists and expansionist Islam.It was quite striking to see the most disappointing US president in living memory display so much emotion and passion during his speech on this topic when he has proved to be so aloof and removed from virtually every other problem he faces, particularly ones where he might be forced to make a moral judgment.The Obama who spoke the other day looked like a president on a mission - what a pity he has picked the wrong mission.People are justifiably more concerned about their safety than they are about reducing emissions, that out is either denounced as a 'climate denier' (which some countries want to criminalise, the way Holocaust denial is already a crime in Germany) or a racist who is simply terrified of foreigners with dark skin.This has been Obama's finest achievement - a monumental, global, three-card trick which allows him to spout the platitudes in which he so revels while parts of the world are literally burning.In a largely secular West, the rigid dogmatism of climate change consensus is as close to an organised religion as we have and anyone who dares to question the official orthodoxy is denounced as a heretic.Most people can accept that fluctuating climate patterns are, to one degree or another, man-made.But that position also fails to take account of the fact that industrialisation is the route to prosperity for developing nations and more industrialisation means more pollution and carbon emissions.So - protecting the earth or saving the starving? The two, unfortunately, are mutually exclusive.In the meantime, Isil having been warned by Obama that COP21 would be £ severe rebuke' to their activities, have presumably laid down their weapons and decapitation-swords to have a long, hard think about the damage they have done to Mother Earth.So - protecting the earth or saving the starving?

UK prime minister David Cameron said they could not argue cost, since the coming generations would compare the required $100bn ( 94.6bn) climate fund to the $5tn ( 4.73tn) under management in the City of London.The mood music from Xi Jinping, the president of China, now the world s leading carbon emitter, was also more positive, driven by pressure from his own people, suffering the effects of pollution in its major cities.He and Mr Obama gave a joint press conference where the latter said they were both in agreement that it is our responsibility to take action .Some countries, led by India, are not so positive, as they say they were not the historical creators of climate change and so, developing countries should not have to take action that would limit their economic growth.There will be announcements from businesses, and the likes of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, pledging to invest in developing technologies to help fight climate change.News: 4 World: 10Editorial: 12\l"

A group of NGOs submitted a petition yesterday to Christiana Figueres, the executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It wants big polluters to be ""kicked out"" of climate policy-making in much the same way that a firewall was established between public health officials and the tobacco industry.Activists question Figueres's impartiality. She was climate change adviser to Latin America's largest energy company, Endesa, before she became the UN climate chief in 2010, and strongly believes in working with the fossil fuel industry.Figueres's spokesman Nick Nuttall, said it was ""totally unfair"" to reproach her for having worked for Endesa. He acknowledged that Figueres ""will constantly try to engage with the fossil fuel industry"".""We have to deal with the reality of the world in which we live, and therefore we have to deal with the reality of the corporations that operate on this planet, and bring them all in common cause towards bringing down emissions.

Their logos are displayed throughout the conference site. Environmentalists particularly object to the presence of Air France, the mostly state-owned electricity company EDF, the gas company Engie and BNP Paribas bank.Aviation is the fastest growing sector for emissions, and Air France, along with the International Air Transport Association IATA, lobbies against stricter climate regulations.EDF is a giant in nuclear power. Sabido says, contrary to its claims, nuclear power is not a low-carbon industry.Engie is deeply involved in the coal and gas industry, and lobbies for the development of shale gas and oil in France.Fossil fuel companies now claim that natural gas, including shale gas released by hydraulic fracturing or ""fracking,"" is ""low carbon"".Not so, says Sabido. Methane leakage from gas is more destructive to the atmosphere than coal. Power plants There has been a rush by banks and other investors to get out of coal. However, BNP Paribas - a sponsor of COP21 - persists. The Pinocchio Climate Awards, organised by Friends of the Earth France, cites BNP Paribas's role in the construction of the Medupi and Kusile coal-fired power plants in South Africa. ""Together they will emit 60 million tonnes of carbon every year, increasing South Africa's greenhouse gas emissions by 17 per cent,"" notes the group's website. Sabido predicts that the ""carbon bubble"" will burst in spectacular fashion, not unlike the housing bubble in 2008. ""If 80 per cent of fossil fuels have to be left in the ground, assets will lose all their value."" COP21To improve their image and forestall disinvestment, companies including BP, Shell, Statoil, Total and Saudi Aramco launched their Oil and Gas Climate Initiative at the UN in September 2014. The French oil company Total was centre stage at a business and climate summit at Unesco last May. But the two largest oil companies in the US, ExxonMobil and and Chevron, want no part of ""greenwashing"".""We don't intend to participate in that coalition,"" Chevron's chairman John Watson told a shareholders' meeting in May. ""We're not going to be disingenuous about it. We're not going to fake it,"" Exxon chairman Rex Tillerson told reporters in Dallas, also last May. He strongly implied that his European competitors were ""faking"" their newfound ecological fervour.For environmentalists such as Sabido, the presence of a ""Gallery of Solutions"" - a business trade show - at COP21, and ""Solutions COP21,"" which will open at the Grand Palais in central Paris today, are further examples of greenwashing. For fees ranging from EUR 30,000 to EUR 250,000, companies can display their climate change credentials before the public. Defence systems Some 200 companies from 17 countries are exhibiting at the Gallery of Solutions. Thales, a French company which specialises in defence systems but also in software for civil aircraft, trains and satellites, is at COP21 to explain its research to decrease carbon dioxide emissions by aircraft.Jui Wen Chen, an inventor from Taiwan, shows his system for filtering carbon dioxide and other pollutants from air and rain water. The system is used in hundreds of towns in Taiwan and the People's Republic.Environmental groups argue that such innovations are false solutions intended to distract attention from the big polluters. The question is put to Olivier Lavastre, a French scientist who is working with the Taiwanese company JW Pavement Eco Technology. The battle on climate change must be an accumulation of small steps, he replies. ""Little streams come together to make a big river.""\l"

Padraic opened the talk with a retrospective look at the whole issue of climate change. The first real acceptance of the presence of global warming as a consequence of human activities was seen early in the last century. Scientists were aware in the early 1900s that increased levels of CO2, Methane and Nitrous Oxide in the atmosphere might lead to global warming through the process of 'heat trapping'.Fast-forward to the 1970s and we have experts acknowledging that there will be further global warming - a rise of 4 degree Celcius on pre-industrial levels is seen as being the worst case scenario. One consequence of global warming is melting of the polar caps contributing to drastic increases in sea levels, anything up to five metres.George Hussey took a different tack to Padraic in looking at the business of formulating and implementing agreements on climate change. George, a statistician in the Climate Policy Section of Department of Environment, and a member of the Irish delegation to COP21, is a battle-scarred veteran when it comes to such events.He spoke of the protocol, the pecking order, the pleadings, the compromises, the frustrations and the late nights.

On the eve of the publication of the Government's White Paper on energy, which will set out the energy policy roadmap for the next decade, it is understood solar farms will form part of the complex range of renewable energy solutions designed to replace the State's high dependence on fossil fuels.Most of the farms are expected to be located in the southern half of the country.

This is interesting on several fronts.\~It shows Irish farmers want to cut carbon emissions, want to share the costs of eco-action, and, at the same time, want to increase awareness of how these eco-actions will impact on the livelihoods of food producers.And those companies are echoing the global desire of consumers to minimise the environmental impacts of their consumption choices.\~Viewed in this context, the ICSA in calling for better supports for low-profit biofuel crops, like miscanthus is batting the ball back to the rest of society. If all of these eco-exercises are to be more than posturing, then all sides must share the cost.Nobody expects big food firms to keep rolling out higher-cost, organic, low-emissions products, if the consumer keeps choosing the cheaper, longer-life, additive-laden, eco-unfriendly option every time.\~And nobody expects the farmer to pick up all of the costs relating to heightened social awareness.The 196 signatories to COP21 have made pledges, and set targets to be reviewed every five years.Developed countries have vowed to give at least US$100bn per year, from public and private sources, to help developing countries mitigate, and adapt to, climate change by 2020.The food industry is responsible for a third of global GHG emissions between agriculture, food production and food waste.\~But is there a risk that food companies will seek to kick the can, and the blame, onto the producer?Already, some food groups have said their suppliers are responsible for two-thirds of their total-product carbon footprint.\~Their vow, to focus on supplier sustainability and sustainable sourcing , may not bring any comfort to farmers. But at least farmers are not taking all the blame.A post-COP21And they are not kicking the can into the developing countries where most palm oil is produced. This is where the $100bn annual fund comes in. It is to be spent helping developing countries mitigate, and adapt to, climate change. This will help companies to address climate-change risk in their agricultural supply chains and drive down their global carbon footprint, states Paula Savanti.\~ But it is clear extra financing will be required in moving towards the sustainable sourcing of commodities, much of which is in developing countries. Savanti also expects food manufacturers and retailers to cut back on the 1.3bn tonnes of food which is lost, and wasted, annually, between farm and fork, producing the equivalent of 3.3 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide each year.

The commission also raised questions about the interpretation of the deal, according to officials. France deployed 120,000 security force personnel nationwide for the duration of COP21. Nearly 3,000 police are stationed at the summit site at Le Bourget. The French government had hoped to avoid violent demonstrations by invoking the state of emergency declared in the wake of the November 13th attacks. But dozens of men wearing dark clothing and hoods threw stones, bottles, flower pots and candles that had been left at a memorial for the November 13th victims at riot police, who used tear gas and charged the demonstrators. More than 170 people were detained overnight.An unprecedented urgency surrounds the 12-day conference, because if action is not taken, it will become impossible to limit the rise in global temperatures to two degrees compared to the pre-industrial era.""This COP21 will not be a real success unless the 195 countries gathered in Paris reach a universal and legally binding accord on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions,"" said Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister and president of the conference. ""That is the most complicated part.""The word ""binding"" has created friction with the US and other parties to the conference. President Barack Obama would face stiff opposition from Republicans in Congress to a compulsory treaty requiring ratification. ""The fact the accord must be 'legally binding' is not contested,"" Mr Fabius said, ""even if there can be different degrees of obligation.""Committed The Taoiseach is one of more than 150 heads of state and government attending the opening of opening of COP21. In his speech, Mr Kenny will confirm Ireland is fully committed to the EU target of a 40 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030. However he will insist the accord not ""compromise our capacity for food production"". Agriculture accounts for 30 per cent of Irish emissions.In what was hailed as a significant breakthrough for the Government, Ireland secured commitment at the EU summit of October 2014 that the ""multiple objectives of the agriculture and land use sector, with their lower mitigation potential"", should be acknowledged in EU targets on climate change.Ireland argued that the country's forests, boglands and other habitats that absorb carbon should be accounted for in the calculation of emissions to compensate for the high level of agricultural emissions.\l"

He told COP21 that Ireland was committed and called for the conference to ""send the signal the world is waiting for"".But just hours earlier he told reporters that while the Government would step up to the plate, it would not be to the detriment of our growing agriculture sector.He added, in effect, that the economic collapse caused by the previous administration meant we were too poor to commit to meaningful action.As Oisin Coghlan, director of Friends of the Earth Ireland, noted, it was a classic example of doublespeak.""It was a case of one story for Paris, and one story for Paddy. If other leaders are saying one thing in the conference hall, their fine words won't translate into world action,"" he says.""I don't think anything make or break happened at a global level. The signs are it was the right decision to get the leaders to come at the beginning.""We can only hope their messages of concern and commitment will translate into their negotiators doing a deal.""COP21 is among the biggest-ever gathering of world leaders, and their visit to Paris is a positive step. But the heavy lifting has only started.Key issues include financing adaptation measures in poorer countries, and how much each country will contribute.There's the question of mechanisms to verify emission reductions - will the US, Russia and China allow for independent checks? - and, crucially, the question of climate justice.Eamonn Meehan, executive director of Trocaire, says the last point is among the most important. ""One of the worrying things is there seems to be a dumbing down around human rights and food security. ""There needs to be a clear and strong statement on human rights. It's not about greening the economies of wealthy countries, it's about ensuring people have a right to food, a home and their environment.""But there's quite a bit of opposition to human rights being included ... and that would be a worry.""Whatever about Ireland producing food more sustainably than other countries, our beef and dairy won't feed the world's poorest. Around 80pc of global food is currently produced by small-scale farmers, and it's that sector which needs help to solve the global food crisis.""It's one thing for rhetoric about the poor needing a future, but that requires action,"" he says.""There's also been a lot said about food production, but what is much more important is the concept of food security.""Climate legislation hasn't even completed its journey through the Oireachtas, and we're being prepared by the Taoiseach to be treated as an exception. If you listen to the Taoiseach, we don't want to be leaders on climate change. We're probably going to be dragged (into this) kicking and screaming.""The stance taken by developing nation India, one of world's highest emitters, will be crucial to the success of .Unlike China and the US, there has been no pre-arranged deal to reduce carbon. Oisin Coghlan makes the point that India is insisting richer countries, which have caused most pollution, should move first.French sources said it remained committed to striking a legally-binding agreement, but it could prove problematic.""We won't compromise ambition, but a legal form of deal may be difficult,"" one said.""But the President of COP21 (and French Foreign Affairs Minister), Laurent Fabius, has taken the subject as 'his' - and he's a heavyweight.""He's a former Prime Minister and won't have second thoughts to call on leaders if needed.""Whatever will be needed, he will do it.""\l"

The train emerges above ground after the Gare du Nord. Satellite dishes sprout like mushrooms from high-rise housing projects. Walls are covered with graffiti. The path to Le Bourget is littered with burned-out cars and uncollected rubbish.I briefly wondered why the French government had not embarked on a massive beautification campaign, like those Third World dictatorships who prettify slums along the airport road in preparation for visits by foreign dignitaries.The Le Bourget exhibition park, the site of the Paris air show every second year and home to the national aviation and space museum, is two stops after the Stade de France, where three suicide bombers blew themselves up on November 13th. It is also just a few kilometres from Saint-Denis, where three people, including the alleged mastermind of the Paris attacks, were killed when security forces stormed a jihadist hideout on November 18th.The shuttle bus that takes you from the RER train station to the conference passes Turkish and Pakistani restaurants, women in long robes and headscarves and the occasional man wearing Salafist attire. Local residents are mostly African, Arab and Asian, like many of the passengers on the shuttle buses. Except that the locals are poor immigrants, while passengers in the brand new hybrid buses are members of the global elite, a caste of well-travelled diplomats, journalists, academics and UN officials.Globalisation I mention to Pierre-Henri Guignard, secretary general of COP21 and the French diplomat entrusted with the task of organising the conference, that I covered the 1982 G7 summit at the Palace of Versailles. The country has changed a lot since then. Globalisation may have raised standards of living elsewhere, but for France it has meant a serious downgrade. Guignard was assigned to organise COP21 on returning from Washington in mid-2013. The Le Bourget site had already been chosen; the UN said it was the only place big enough for the conference.""I'd spent much of my career abroad, and Le Bourget was a France I didn't know,"" Guignard says. ""But this is the reality. What do you expect us to do? Versailles again? This is where we need to do things. It's good to show France as she is. Remember, when we won the World Cup in 1998, everyone talked about 'La France black blanc beur' [black, white and Arab]. We're in that frame of mind. There's a large foreign population here. There's no reason to hide it.""Best possible image A phalanx of mostly African and Arab youths greet you off the RER train with a cheery ""hello"" in several languages. Gendarmes with assault rifles stand behind them. The youths are among the 600 underprivileged teenagers recruited by Guignard to help with COP21. Their training included English lessons from the British Council, and they will receive job placement after the conference.""At COP20 in Lima, everyone smiled all the time,"" Guignard says. ""It had me worried, because I thought, 'We're going to do this in Paris, France, where people have a reputation for being unpleasant?' In training, we insisted that they convey the best possible image.""A forest of white columns with the name and flag of all 195 UN members stands outside the entry to COP21There was something touching about the pride of Palestinians taking pictures of each other.

That, in itself, is a real measure of the substantial progress made by delegates at Le Bourget.Released by the French presidency of COP21, the current version shows that agreement has yet to be reached on whether to aim to limit the increase in global temperatures below 2 degrees, ""well below"" 2 degrees or below 1.5 degrees - bearing in mind that it's already up by 1 degree above pre- industrial levels.Linked to this - indeed, inseparable from it - is how any of these ""options"" are to be achieved, in terms of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, where there is also a range of options relating to the depth of such cuts and the timetable by which they might be achieved, either by 2050 or the end of the century. The very fact that a 1.5 degree target is still mentioned in the text is quite a coup for countries most vulnerable to climate change. ""I feel very energised,"" said President Anote Tong of the Pacific atoll state of Kiribati. ""There is now a very good chance of coming away [from Paris] with a positive agreement.""Enele Sopoaga, prime minister of threatened Tuvalu, was also ""very encouraged by the inroads we've managed to achieve in Paris"", saying: ""We are all singing one song, to really address climate change, and we need to sing that song louder because there is still a big push in front of us [to conclude an accord].""Loss and damage A mechanism to deal with ""loss and damage"" as a result of climate change also survives in the latest text, although the US delegation has made it clear that it will only go along with this if the most vulnerable countries are prepared to undertake not to sue the rich developed countries for compensation.US secretary of state John Kerry referred to the ""tough conversations"" that are going on behind closed doors at Le Bourget. But given that it was all ""about the future of the home we share"", he said the task was clear: to ""get the job done."" Kerry's announcement that the US would double its aid to developing countries to $800 million (EUR 730 million), to enable them to adapt to the impacts of climate change, has been greeted as a very positive move. However, even this is a small contribution towards ramping up climate finance to $100 billion (EUR 92 billion) annually in 2020. Climate Action Network Europe director Wendell Trio agreed that COP21 was now ""at a crossroads"" in terms of whether it would produce an ambitious deal or one that was ""extremely minimalistic"". For example, the latest text contains no mention of emissions from international aviation and shipping. Decarbonisation But at least the word ""decarbonisation"" survives, even though it remains in square brackets. This is anathema to oil-producing countries such as Saudi Arabia and to others such as Australia with large reserves of coal; they would be the last to accept that such fossil fuel resources should be ""left in the ground"". The NGOs are all calling on the EU to ""go out of its comfort zone"" (as Trio put it) by embracing more ambition to cut emissions, show real solidarity with the more vulnerable countries and step up its own efforts over time. After all, Europe has already exceeded its own 2020 target to cut emissions by 20 per cent.Given that the climate pledges made by 180 countries (including the poorest of the poor) are not adequate to achieve a 2 degree target, never mind an even more ambitious 1.5 degrees, one of the key issues yet to be decided is how these commitments can be revised over time - starting even before 2020.The World Wildlife Fund has warned that if there isn't such an early revision of the pledges the world would be ""locked into a trajectory of 3 degrees Celsius for at least 10 years"". And this would undermine all the hopes invested in COP21. \l"

Indeed, this could cut global carbon emissions by an estimated five billion tonnes every year, helping to avert dangerous climate change.According to Richard Houghton, senior researcher at the Woods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts, this finding adds to a growing body of scientific work indicating that a greater focus on tropical forests could be one of the world's best chances of staying below the threshold of a 2 degrees Celsius global temperature rise. Lead author of a study published in the latest issue of Nature Climate Change, he said ""feasible improvements in tropical forest management could bridge the gulf between today's rampant fossil fuel emissions and a sustainable future"", noting ""indigenous forest peoples have a crucial role to play"".Tropical forests can absorb and store huge quantities of carbon to offset a large proportion of global greenhouse emissions if they are protected, Houghton said. ""The research also identifies a key way to make it happen - supporting indigenous forest peoples in their guardianship of their ancestral forests.""Suffocating smog For decades, tropical forests have been under attack around their edges by timber logging, palm oil producers, pulp paper manufacturers and agribusiness interests seeking to clear land for cattle. Fires in degraded forests of Indonesia regularly cause suffocating smog and threaten the habitat of orangutans. ""Tropical deforestation releases more greenhouse gases each year than the entire EU and destroys the world's most efficient system for carbon capture and storage,"" according to Nancy Birdsall, president of the Washington-based Center for Global Development and Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, former prime minister of Peru.""We need to re-imagine tropical forests as a public utility like electricity, producing a service people and governments, including in the rich world, want to buy,"" they said in a report called Look to the Forests. ""The problem for the world is that forest destruction, often illegal, generates huge profits in the short term.""But the ambition of halting deforestation is realistic, according to another scientific paper published in this month's DEC journal. It notes that Brazil - the guardian of Amazonia - managed to cut its annual forest emissions by more than one billion tons of carbon between 2004 and 2009. ""Brazil shows it can be done, and done quickly,"" said Alessandro Baccini, one of the study's co-authors. ""It requires strong political will, however, and that's an ingredient that too often is missing, not only in tropical countries but also in developed countries, which need to help finance the effort.""Norway has contributed $1 billion to Brazil's Amazon Fund in recognition of its achievement in reducing deforestation in the Amazon region by 70 per cent over the past decade - without sacrificing agricultural output or economic growth - and pledged at COP21 to extend this aid programme until 2020.But Doug Boucher, of the Washington-based Union of Concerned Scientists, said an 18 per cent decrease in Amazon deforestation in 2014 had been ""wiped out"" by a 16 per cent increase this year.

That language was evident in the cardinal's comments at COP21. ""We receive this Earth as a garden. We do not want to pass it on to those who come after us as a wilderness."" Cue, applause all 'round.? Away from the main COP21 venue is 'Climate Generations', a space for civil society where the atmosphere is distinctly more colourful.There's a solar powered sound system, which allowed a troupe of Greenland women sing songs about eating a whale (sustainably, of course); an opportunity to meet the ""world's wisdom keepers"" and activities for those of a spiritual bent, including 'yoga for the inner climate' and 'chant and meditate for the planet'.Nice piece from the archives of 'The New York Times' about a scientist who n re-examined a theory from the early 1900s about why the planet was warming.""According to a theory, which was held half a century ago, variation in the atmosphere's carbon dioxide can account for climatic change... the theory was generally dismissed as inadquate,"" Waldemar Kaempffert wrote in the paper in October 1956. But according to Dr Gilbert Plass, ""the carbon dioxide theory stands up, though it may take another century of observation and measurement of temperature to confirm it."" Seems that time has come.? With all the talk about the enormous sums of money needed to combat climate change ($100bn a year), it's hard to get your head around all the figures.But 'Stop Climate Crime!' has come up with a bumper one. Some $650bn a year of public money, it claims, is used to support the development of fossil fuel energy.Our taxes are financing ""the run towards climate chaos"". And to add to the deep sense of depression, it seems we're paying to make good the damage too. ""We are struggling to find the $100bn each year to finance climate change mitigation efforts... when fossil fuels are believed to be responsible for $6,000bn of environmental and health-related impacts"".\l"
"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland61","Inconvenient truth about climate change","October 27, 2015 Tuesday","The Irish Times","Sir, - Thank you for breaking the silence and stating the inconvenient truth that our Government has little or no interest in addressing the climate change challenge we face. (""Kenny lukewarm on climate change"", October 19th). The Government fails to see that protecting our environment will be good for our economy and for our society. It is positioning our country as a source of the problem rather than being a leader in providing solutions. It is shaming us by the path it has decided to take.Last month the Government and Opposition parties voted through a Climate Bill in the D\'e1il. At the same time the Government was lobbying in Brussels to get us exempted from EU 2030 emissions reduction targets, Bord na M\'f3na announced they will keep burning peat for the next 15 years, major public transport projects were postponed for decades to come and Eirgrid abandoned plans to develop our electricity grid for a long-term low-carbon energy future. What did those deputies think as they clapped themselves on the back for putting a climate bill through? When it comes to climate action, the parties in the D\'e1il are just not for real.The UN climate meeting in Paris next month (COP21) is unlikely to reach the sort of climate deal we need but it will be an important milestone where all the major countries start out on a common path to rid their economies of the use of fossil fuels.COP21 will be the start of an uncertain pilgrim journey where the path we have to follow is created by taking the first step. The sad thing is that the Irish Government will arrive in Paris and effectively say that we are going to drive the camino for the first week. That will not be good for us. It will not be good for our country or for our standing in the world. Thank you for your editorial which cut through all the hot air and recognised that we are now the best little country for everything, except for looking after this world. - Yours, etc,EAMON RYANLeader of the Green PartySuffolk Street, Dublin 2. \l"
"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland62","Devil is in the detail as contentious issues dominate draft document for summit; Reaching a deal in Paris will be tough as countries clash on their obligations","December 3, 2015 Thursday","The Irish Times","The mammoth task facing delegates from 195 countries at the COP21 UN climate change conference in Paris can be measured by wading through a 54-page negotiating text that contains no fewer than 1,617 instances of square-bracketed words, phrases, terms and even whole paragraphs. Each square bracket denotes an area of contention or even a flashpoint. More often than not, these tend to be between the developed world and those countries that are still developing, with much of the disputation over their ""common but differentiated responsibilities"" in tackling the problem of climate change.All of these glitches, some of which are monumental, must be ironed out in the hardball negotiations that COP21 president French foreign minister Laurent Fabius is determined to conclude on Friday, December 11th, with a comprehensive and credible agreement.The draft text, produced in advance of the summit, acknowledges that climate change ""represents an urgent and potentially irreversible threat to human societies and the planet and thus requires the widest possible co-operation by all countries"" in finding solutions.In particular, it calls for their participation in ""an effective and appropriate international response, with a view to accelerating the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions"", recognising that ""deep cuts...will be required to achieve the ultimate objective"".However, there is no consensus on the extent of these cuts or on a timetable for implementing them.Nor is there any agreement on capping the rise in average global surface temperatures at a particular level, as shown in the text by the following convoluted paragraph: ""Hold the increase in the global average temperature [below 2 \'b0C] [below 1.5 \'b0C] [well below 2 \'b0C] [below 2 \'b0C or 1.5 \'b0C] [below 1.5 \'b0C or 2 \'b0C] [as far below 2 \'b0C as possible] above pre-industrial levels by ensuring deep cuts in global greenhouse gas [net] emissions.""There is also a wide gulf between delegates over how to achieve any of these temperature goals in accordance with the ""best available science"", by aiming for a low-carbon trajectory in the long term and the peaking of emissions by 2030, or even ""as soon as possible"". Decarbonisation Reference to ""decarbonisation"" of the global economy is also in square brackets even though the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has made it clear that carbon emissions must be reduced to zero by 2100 if we are to have any chance of limiting the extent of global warming. Instead, bracketed text refers to a number of options, including reductions ranging from 40 per cent to 70 per cent by 2050 or setting a ""global carbon budget based on climate justice"", which is the option currently favoured by the most vulnerable countries at the front l"
"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland63","Good COP, bad COP: the alternative climate summit; The People's Climate Summit is a direct challenge to the main event","December 7, 2015 Monday","The Irish Times","Montreuil is a large suburb in eastern Paris where few tourists venture. It is predominantly working class. It is not very pretty, but has an edge, with many artists living here. Its politics are radical too, with green and communist mayors in recent years.You can take it that few of the VIPs and senior politicians attending COP21 have bothered to take a trip across the city to Montreuil from Le Bourget. For it is here that an impressive alternative event to the global climate change summit took place. With the support of the municipality, the People's Climate Summit has taken over the main public space of Montreuil as well as all of the side streets and halls. Hundreds of stalls meandered out from the centre; there are dozens of events, thousands of volunteers and many thousands of participants. It involved all the big environmental organisations as well as every imaginable fringe climate group imaginable. I wandered through the fair yesterday and the atmosphere was upbeat. There was a huge mix of people, although the young predominated, with a strong alternative vibe. It's not complementary to COP21. It's a direct challenge to it, saying it is not doing enough. For these climate change campaigners the Montreuil event has allowed them make their case about the urgency and importance of the decisions to be made. To a certain extent it allows them vent their frustration at the (inevitable) disappointment that will accompany the final agreement at the other Paris event. London-born Alexis Rowell of Coalition Climate 21 said environmental organisations had been working towards this event for a year. It is broken into three parts: a climate forum; a peasant's market; and a village that attempts to collect all alternative solutions to the global crises in climate change, the environment, economics and politics.""COP21""The problem with Le Bourget is it is governments sitting around coming up with pledges. There is no binding treaty or no verification or no way of penalising anyone who won't do what say they will do.""At the corner of one street was a massive Statue of Liberty with acrid-looking smoke spewing from the raised torch. A comic troupe flung plastic out of a huge supermarket trolley. In a nearby hall, prominent writers and environmentalists Naomi Klein and Bill McKinney were the prosecutors in a mock trial against oil company ExxonMobil, which allegedly suppressed information over many years about the true environmental impact of fossil fuels. Sneak preview The trial is essentially a performance, but there are impressive witnesses, including a young woman from the Marshall Islands who reminds people the islands are only a metre above sea level. Klein tells the crowd to huge applause: ""What we are doing here is stepping in where courts have failed. We firmly believe that this is a preview, that the prosecution of Exxon will happen in real courts very soon. Do not consider this a mock trial but a sneak preview of Exxon's future."" Kate McNeely, a young artist and activist from New York, stands in front of the climate ribbon, a statue of a tree strewn with a rainbow-burst of ribbons. The idea behind it, she says, is that people write on to a ribbon the thing they love most that might be lost because of climate change. ""The magnitude of what we are dealing with I don't believe can be solved by governments and by organisations inside Le Bourget.""We need a complete system change to deal with not just climate change but with racism, sexism and class differentiation. I believe civil society will make that change. I believe gatherings like this village in Montreuil are the way forward.""\l"
"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland64","Hollande campaign promise leads to historic agreement on climate change; 'A lot of us didn't even know what a COP was'. Now the whole world knows","December 14, 2015 Monday","The Irish Times","Laurent Fabius, France's foreign minister and president of the COP21 UN climate conference, announced that an accord had been reached at 4.30am Saturday. Then things fell apart. The Americans objected to the words ""climate justice"". Nicaragua objected to just about everything else. Hollande offered to telephone the leftist president, Daniel Ortega, in Managua.As the text was whittled down, the French noted with pleasure that the number of ""shoulds"" diminished, while the number of ""shalls"" increased, making the agreement more binding. Dangerous moment ""The developing countries wanted 'shall,' but the Americans wanted 'should',"" says a member of Fabius's staff. ""It was a dangerous moment because other countries wanted to start renegotiating things. ""The Turks had been very difficult. [President Recep Tayyip] Erdogan kept calling Hollande, who told him Turkey could not have special status.""Fabius defined his method as ""listening, transparency, ambition for the agreement, and a spirit of compromise."" Over three nights, he and his top negotiator, Laurence Tubiana, received small groups from problem countries. Fabius asked John Kerry, the US secretary of state, to ask Barack Obama to telephone Indian prime minister Narendra Modi. The Indians needed US reassurance on patents, royalties and technology transfers.It was like herding cats, but Fabius is the most experienced member of the French administration.Now 69, ""Fabiulous,"" as some called him in the wake of the agreement, was France's youngest prime minister at the age of 38. He served seven years as speaker of the national assembly. Finally, at 7.30pm on Saturday, Fabius rose with his green, leaf-shaped gavel. ""I look over the room, I see the reaction is positive, I hear no objections. The Paris accord for the climate is adopted!"" he said, striking his gavel.Responsibility It had been a long road since Hollande promised to hold the conference, as a gesture to his ecologist allies, during the 2012 presidential campaign. No other country wanted the responsibility. The 2011 COP in Durban committed all 195 UN member states to reaching a universal agreement on fighting climate change by the end of 2015. ""The big difference with previous COPs was the sheer number of parties involved,"" says Pierre Radanne, a veteran of 16 COPs and a climate adviser to governments and NGOs for three decades. ""At Kyoto in 1997, only 38 developed countries made commitments.""In September 2012, Hollande announced that France would host COP21. ""He had no idea what he was getting into,"" Radanne says. Fabius was appalled. ""I discussed it with him at the Doha COP in 2012. He said, 'It's going to be very, very difficult. Extremely complicated. I don't know if we can do it.""When Hollande travelled to Washington, Beijing and Berlin, the main question leaders asked him was: ""What are you going to do with the Paris conference?"" ""Hollande realised that his place among the greats of this world depended on the climate question,"" Radanne says.Initially reluctant, Fabius threw himself into preparations even as he grappled with crises in Syria and Ukraine, and with Iran's nuclear programme. The most effective French foreign minister in two decades, Fabius clocked up the equivalent of an around-the-world trip every month.Strong contacts Good casting was essential to his success. In June 2014, Fabius appointed Tubiana, a highly respected political scientist and economist, as his chief negotiator. Tubiana has strong contacts in developing and emerging countries, as well as the UN. ""The last time France held a big UN conference was in 1948, for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,"" said Pierre- Henri Guignard, the career diplomat who Fabius asked to organise COP21. ""A lot of us didn't even know what a COP was.""France's diplomatic network, which ranks second in the world after the US, was a big advantage. Ambassadors were instructed to wine and dine contacts to impress upon them the French seriousness of purpose. Fabius asked for monthly reports on climate policy and foreign opinion. And he avoided a major pitfall. ""There was a huge risk that France, which has a high opinion of herself and of her place in history, would sin by arrogance,"" says Radanne. ""France had to be very present, very active and very humble.""Fabius and Tubiana invited the ministers who concluded the negotiations at Le Bourget to three Paris summits in the months preceding the conference. ""It enabled the French to test ideas and to test people too,"" says Simon Roger, who covered COP21 for Le Monde. ""They saw who they could rely on as 'facilitators' in the negotiations.""There are reports that Fabius will soon leave the foreign ministry. ""Having worked as hard as he has,"" says Roger, ""he probably wants to leave with the stature of the man who, with president Hollande, saved the planet.""\l"

Environmentalists accused the Government of seeking a free pass for agriculture and the Opposition accused him of hypocrisy, saying one thing to a world audience and something different to a domestic audience.Others wondered why he had brought it up at all given that Irish agriculture emissions do not even enter the equation at . Ireland is a part of the EU bloc and is rowing in behind its key pledge of a 40 per cent cut in emissions by 2030.Contribute It will be spring before individual states begin to negotiate how much they will contribute to that 40 per cent. In general, Ireland's position tallies with that of the larger union on all the big issues - ambition, transparency, finance - and as such would be regarded as comparatively progressive. Ireland has been represented at the talks by a small number of officials from the Department of the Environment with expertise on climate. They are led by assistant secretary David Walsh and three senior officials who form part of the EU negotiation team: John O'Neill, Petra Woods and George Hussey.There is also a senior official from the Department of Agriculture and an experienced environmental lawyer from the Attorney-General's office at the summit.High-level talksHe was initially involved with counterpart ministers from Austria and Romania in working on actions that needed to be taken before 2020.He was later involved in talks on emissions' trading between the EU and Brazil, which was due to be put to plenary. Besides the Government, there are representatives of many Irish environmental and aid agencies, including Concern, Tr\'f3caire, Christian Aid, Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace. All have been critical of a lack of ambition and have said the EU should have done more. A number of other politicians have attended or are attending COP21.

"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland66","Expectations grow that agreement will be reached on temperature targets","December 9, 2015 Wednesday","The Irish Times","There has been significant progress over the past 24 hours in the search for a global climate deal with growing support for the lower target of a 1.5-degree temperature increase.A new alliance between the EU and 79 vulnerable countries has added to a sense of optimism as the COP21 negotiations enter their final stages.The French presidency under foreign minister Laurent Fabius has won widespread praise for its handling of the negotiations. It will present a new, ""clean"" draft text at 1pm today which is expected to offer clear options to the almost 200 negotiating governments on key issues. Very positive ""It is going very well,"" said Mohamed Adow, a senior figure with Climate Action Network. ""At this stage compared to Copenhagen and other climate summits, it is all very positive. The politics of process has given way to the politics of substance."" There is growing support among the bigger players to strengthen the text of the proposed agreement to include a reference to limiting the average global temperatures to 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial levels. It is still expected, however, that any legally binding target in the final agreement would be closer to 2 degrees.The EU, which has signalled support for the more ambitious target, last night announced that it had reached an agreement with 79 African, Caribbean and Pacific states on a number of key issues, which have been among the most divisive. Legally binding They include a commitment that the Paris accord be legally binding, that clear long-term goals are set out and that a five-year review mechanism is introduced. They have also agreed that the accord should include transparency and accountability systems to make sure that parties honour the pledges on carbon emission reductions.As part of the pact, the EU will pay EUR 475 million to support climate action in the 79 countries up to 2020.There are still some major issues to be resolved. The plenary session of COP21 heard last night that there is no clear agreement on the contentious issue of loss and damage, which covers the demand for compensation and liability by countries already severely affected by climate change.

"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland67","Slow progress on climate deal as ministers arrive for talks","December 5, 2015 Saturday","The Irish Times","Two new draft documents on a possible climate change accord were published in Paris yesterday as negotiators reported tangible but slow progress in the search for a historic response to global warming.It came as ministers from almost 200 countries were set to arrive for high-level talks in the second week of COP21, the UN climate change conference. Minister for the Environment Alan Kelly and Minister for Communications and Energy Alex White will arrive at Le Bourget this weekend. Ahead of the visit, there were mixed views on how the talks had been progressing. Some environmental groups and representatives of poorer countries expressed frustration at the absence of a breakthrough on key issues. However, UN climate change head Christiana Figueres said talks remained on track. She told a media conference that no single issue had been finalised or cleared during the technical discussions involving officials. It was important to understand that no single issue could be advanced without others and that the document was ""very much a balancing act"", she said. A new, pared-down draft of the possible agreement was published yesterday morning.The document has been shortened to 38 pages, from a 50-page draft. A second document, known as a ""bridging text"" was also published. This contained suggestions by facilitators aimed at narrowing options and to help clean up the texts ahead of next week's high-level discussions.The disputed issues include setting a legally binding limit for the maximum increase in temperature; financing by richer countries of infrastructure needed by poorer countries; loss and damage issues; transparency of what measures are actually being taken; food security and climate justice; as well as discussions around more ambitious targets for the future.""We are just about halfway done in time and about 25 per cent done with our work,"" said Lou Leonard of the World Wildlife Fund. ""There is a need to speed up progress."" 'Fairly brutal' COP21 was getting ""fairly brutal"" as differences were exposed. ""Realities are setting in and it is getting very political. At the adaptation session there was a bust-up. Rich countries are putting forward no text options and adopting a maximalist position,"" said Kelly Dent of Oxfam.Sven Harmeling of Care said Arab countries led by Saudi Arabia had blocked any substantive recommendations coming from a review group which was to give the best scientific recommendations to ministers.The conclusion, he said, was that limiting the average increase in global temperature to 2 degrees above preindustrial levels was not sufficient.""That is an outer defence l"

But Jane Goodall, the British primatologist who is the world's leading expert on chimpanzees, says the agreement is crucial to their survival.""There used to be more than a million chimpanzees in the world; there are only 300,000 left,"" Goodall says. ""The main threat to chimpanzees is deforestation, which destroys their habitat. The second is the live meat trade, and sadly there's a growing trade in live animals, where the mothers are shot and the babies are taken for sale.""Sustainable management Deforestation is a major cause of climate change, as the carbon dioxide in trees is released into the atmosphere when they are cut down and burned. Article 3 of the draft accord encourages parties to the UN convention on climate change to ""conserve and enhance"" forests as ""sinks and reservoirs"" of greenhouse gases. The draft accord mentions the need to reduce deforestation and forest degradation, and to achieve ""sustainable management of forests"" in three separate sections. ""Climate change affects us, of course, but it's affecting all the other animals too,"" Goodall says. ""We are so arrogant to think that this one form of life, that is so horribly destructive, is more important than everything else.""Goodall worked as a waitress to pay her fare to Kenya when she was 23 years old. Her mentor, Kenyan anthropologist Louis Leakey, sent her to Cambridge to earn a doctorate in ethology (animal behaviour). Today, she holds honorary doctorates from more than 45 universities.Goodall's reverence for animals contrasts with the attitude of some leaders at COP21. US secretary of state John Kerry said in a speech last month the threat from global warming was not just the ""harm that is caused to the habitat for butterflies or polar bears as some people try to mock it . . . Climate change is not just about Bambi.""Goodall reminds us that the butterflies, polar bears and Bambi are important. In its most recent , the World Wildlife Fund reported that between 1970-2010, populations of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish around the world dropped 52 per cent.""People don't realise the ripple effect,"" Goodall says. ""A small insect that disappears may be the main food of a certain fish, which may be the main food for a certain bird. There are examples where it has led to ecosystem collapse just because one link is taken out of the food chain.""In the rainforest, you learn about the interdependence of all life. I think we made a mistake calling it biodiversity . . . If you talk about the web of life, people understand.""Azzedine Downes, head of the International Fund for Animal Welfare and an elephant expert, shared a stage with Goodall at a seminar.""There hasn't been a lot of discussion about the impact of climate change on animals at COP21,"" he said.Drought There were only 350,000 elephants left in the wild and 33,000 were being killed every year, Downes said. Climate change forces animals to migrate, as humans do. Drought in East Africa has forced elephants to become more nocturnal, to hide from the sun.""Many elephants leave dry areas and move towards wetter areas. That's a trap, because those are the countries where poaching is out of control.""Stanford academic Ken Caldeira, who is cited by Elizabeth Kolbert in The Sixth Extinction, says animals would have to migrate poleward by 30ft a day to keep pace with present temperature changes.Goodall spent decades on the Gombe reserve in Tanzania observing how much our closest cousins resemble humans. She discovered that chimpanzees make and use tools, for example to ""fish"" edible termites from a mound.Louis Leakey wrote that, thanks to Goodall's research: ""We must now redefine man, redefine tool, or accept chimpanzees as human.""Goodall also discovered that chimpanzees, like humans, can be aggressive and violent.""When rainforests start shrinking, they will become more territorial and brutal,"" she says. ""If a community is forced to move, they cannot just blend in with another community. There will be pitched battles.""Goodall describes the rescue of a female chimpanzee in 2013 as ""the most amazing interaction I've ever had . . . when we released this adult female from her travelling cage on to the island. She turned and embraced me."" The clip can be found on YouTube. ""She was a chimp we rescued from the bush meat trade. Her name was Wounda, which means 'close to death'.""Goodall, a vegetarian, says carnivores ""are going to have to change. Because in order to feed the billions of animals that are being raised for us to eat around the world, huge areas of rainforest are cleared to grow grain to feed them."" Social media Farm animals produce methane, a more virulent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Methane was not discussed at COP21, nor did negotiators suggest people should eat less meat. Goodall spends 300 days a year on the road, campaigning for better conditions for farm and wild animals. The Jane Goodall Institute has 19 offices around the world, and its youth programme, Roots & Shoots, has 100,000 groups in 140 countries.Goodall admires Pope Francis and advocates the power of social media to denounce enemies of the environment.""Young people energise me,"" she says. ""As long as I have health, strength and the ability to communicate, I'll keep fighting.""\l"

Across Europe, you have monopolies in control of the grids,"" he said.""Politicians and their advisers here haven't thought it out. Yes, a small country like Ireland can only do so much, but this country can influence European policy when it wants to.""Mr O'Connor insisted that renewables are ""the cheapest form of electricity on the planet"" and dismissed recent criticisms by some leading economists in Ireland that there is a bubble in the sector, and it is over-subsidised.He said an ambitious agreement at COP21 could also have a big impact on climate change.""Firstly, the costs of solar and wind energy have come down hugely. ""Secondly, China is now taking a huge leadership role in tackling emissions. Both of those are game changers.""Meanwhile, Mr O'Connor said MRP would probably float on the stock exchange in 2018. It would most likely be in New York and also possibly in the UK.Contract in Chile ""We are examining where to float, but if our investment comes from the US and UK, it would be logical to float near our investors,"" he said. He said the company, which in a joint venture with Actis, recently won a $600 million State windfarms contract in Chile. It will also also announce several funding initiatives in the coming months.\l"

"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland74","'Twenty-three years ago, there was a debate about whether it was true'; No one still contests climate change, says S\'e9gol\'e8ne Royal, who sees good progress","September 10, 2015 Thursday","The Irish Times","Twenty-three years after she represented France at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, S\'e9gol\'e8ne Royal is once again France's environment minister. Rio established the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, under which 20 Conferences of the Parties, or Cops, have since been held. Royal will play an important role at Cop 21, in Paris from November 30th-December 11th.Although Royal has been frustrated by the agonisingly slow negotiations, she also measures the distance travelled since Rio.""Twenty-three years ago, there was a debate about whether it was true,"" she said in an interview. ""No one any longer contests climate change because everyone feels the effects. Today we have solutions to act efficiently and collectively for the planet.""On August 17th, France enacted the ""Law on Energy Transition for Green Growth"", which Royal shepherded through 150 hours of debate and some 5,000 proposed amendments. The law, she says, ""makes France the nation of environmental excellence"" because ""France is the first country to have translated into law its commitments in Cop 21"". Defined goals The French believe, often naively, that legislation makes dreams come true. The energy law is based on goals defined by the EU for Cop 21, but also sets specifically French targets, such as reducing reliance on nuclear energy from 75 per cent to 50 per cent. The law foresees an ambitious rise in the carbon tax on fossil fuel consumption, from EUR 14.50 per tonne at present to EUR 56 in 2020.The goal of concluding an agreement to limit the rise in the Earth's temperature to 2 degrees has been entrusted to mid-level diplomats meeting regularly in Bonn. Each session brings together 2,000 delegates and observers. Royal severely criticised the process last June when she told Le Monde that ""UN negotiations are totally inadequate in addressing the urgency of climate change."" Royal wanted heads of state and government to seize responsibility for negotiations. ""Since then, a lot of people have come to the same conclusion, including the secretary general of the UN,"" she notes. Ban Ki-moon told Paris Match that he shares Royal's concern. ""Even I think the negotiators talk too much, that the discussions take too much time . . . I tell the world's political leaders: Give clear orders to your negotiators . . . Stop haggling over technical details.""Since Royal's broadside on the Bonn process, French president Fran\'e7ois Hollande has made it clear he will put maximum pressure on world leaders at the UN General Assembly to secure a ""pre-accord"" before the Paris conference. Royal believes the new ""political impetus""coming from Ban and the leaders of China and the US, the world's big two polluters, will lead to agreement. Hollande said on September 7th that Cop 21 could fail over financing for the Green Climate Fund, which is supposed to provide EUR 100 billion annually to endow the developing world with the technology it needs to make the energy transition. ""Anyone who thought the path to Cop 21 would be paved with a signed agreement, an immediate reversal of climate change and laurel wreaths for us is going to be disappointed,"" Hollande warned. The declarations regarding commitments to cut greenhouse emissions are sometimes spectacular, the president said, ""but they're not always accompanied by cash. It all hangs by the financing. That's the key . . . If there's not a firm commitment to financing, there will be no accord, because the countries of the south will reject it.""In a new twist, the governments of those countries suffering from climate change are demanding ""loss and damage"" compensation for the prejudice already sustained. Rivalry between Royal and foreign minister Laurent Fabius has complicated the organisation of Cop 21. The bad blood goes back to 2006, when both were candidates in the socialist presidential primary. Royal was still with Hollande. ""But who will look after the children?"" Fabius allegedly quipped when Royal announced her candidacy. She lost the 2007 presidential race and separated from Hollande the same year.Asked about the division of labour between herself and Fabius, Royal said: ""Laurent Fabius will preside over the Cop and manage the negotiations. I will show how France has undertaken the march towards a de-carbonised economy. I will continue to mobilise civil society, business and local government, as well as my European partners. ""I will head the French delegation at Cop 21.""Africa advocate Royal has become the de facto envoy to and advocate for Africa in climate change negotiations. While the rest of the government was on summer holiday, she spent two weeks in August visiting Namibia, Zambia, Botswana and Ghana. ""Africa is the most important continent for the climate change conference in Paris,"" Royal told African leaders in Libreville, Gabon, on August 28th. ""With less than 5 per cent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, Africa is not responsible for global warming."" Royal promised that France will ensure that half the credits in the Green Climate Fund go to Africa. She cites the example of Namibia, whose wind and solar resources would make it self-sufficient if only it received the necessary technology.Royal saw evidence of climate change on her African journey. ""A large proportion of beaches have disappeared in Senegal over the past five years,"" she says. ""In Zambia, where 80 per cent of electricity comes from hydro-electric dams, the water level has gone down so far that there are power cuts.""Royal is more optimistic than other French officials about the chances of Cop 21. She believes the long-term effect will be to reduce poverty and rehabilitate the notion of progress. Inequality will diminish, she says. ""Since the hot countries have the greatest potential in solar energy, if they benefit from technology transfer, they'll catch up with the industrialised countries who had to use fossil fuels.""\l"
"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland75","Ireland's 'cynical approach' on climate change criticised","December 2, 2015 Wednesday","Irish Examiner","John Gibbons, a member of An Taisce s climate change committee, said Taoiseach Enda Kenny s admission that Ireland will miss its targets for cutting gas emissions from agriculture and blaming it on the economic crisis is not acceptable.The country would face huge fines as a result, and the agriculture industry should have to pay a levy to offset this, he said.The EU has warned that instead of cutting emissions by 20% from 2005-20, Ireland is likely to reduce greenhouse gases by just 3%, mainly due to agriculture and transport emissions.As one of 135 national leaders to speak at the opening session of COP21, the biggest-ever climate change conference, Mr Kenny pleaded for special recognition of Ireland s plight.Mr Gibbons said: Ireland is acting irresponsibly we are planning to get a free ride on the basis that our neighbours have acted responsibly and will meet their targets. We want to exploit what we see as wriggle room. He said Ireland is attempting to be a freeloader at a time when we are being asked to show solidarity, especially with the poorest nations who are threatened with the worst effects of climate change, some facing complete devastation. We need to act with solidarity and instead we are showing we could not care less about the poor, Mr Gibbons said, adding that Ireland contributes just 2m to the UN s Green Development Fund. This amounts to about 50c per person, while the EU average is 10- 12 a person. We are set to become international pariahs, with further damage to our international reputation, said Mr Gibbons.The Government appears to believe there are no votes in dealing properly with climate change and instead has decided to side with the farm lobby, he said.Mr Kenny said Ireland could not afford the measures needed to reach the emissions reduction targets, 45% of which come from agriculture because of the methane-emitting national herd of cattle and sheep.Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said cutting gas emissions and increasing GDP were compatible given that between 1990 and 2012, the EU s CO2 emissions fell 19% while GDP rose 45%.Mr Moscovici said: This clearly proves that climate protection and economic growth can go hand in hand. It is possible to implement public policies that support both GDP growth and ambitious action against climate change. The Government is making the case that since Ireland is producing food it should be given more time to reach the goals which are set for individual EU countries by the EU.A raft of initiatives were announced at COP21 to help poorer countries that are facing a drop in food production at a time when populations are growing. About 70% more food will be needed by 2050, according to the UN.Harold Kingston, the IFA s environment chairman, said new initiatives are making Irish agriculture sustainable at what is produced but it must deliver an increased economic return to the farmer. \l"
"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland76","ANALYSIS; The future of Irish farming won't be dictated by the Paris conference, writes Paul Melia","December 15, 2015 Tuesday","Irish Independent","THE outcome of the 21st Conference of the Party (COP21) talks in Paris will not dictate the future direction of Irish farming. That battle will be won, or lost, at the European Commission next year, when member states will agree the 40pc emission cuts required by each sector of the economy by 2030 - agriculture, industry, transport, buildings and, possibly, aviation and shipping too.The UN climate summit is solely concerned with high-level goals. COP21 is not concerned with how parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change make cuts in emissions. It only wants to see the necessary steps taken towards decarbonisation.The State will seek a special case for agriculture during the EU talks, arguing that Ireland's agri-food emissions should be treated differently than those in other members states.A number of reasons will be proffered. Our grassland-based system means food is produced more sustainably than other countries.If we are forced to reduce output, it will result in food being produced elsewhere at a higher environmental cost.It will also make the case the recession severely impacted economic growth and that growing agriculture will allow us to invest in research and development, and transfer this knowledge to other countries, a measure known as technology transfer.As outputs from Irish farms are monitored, we have already made enormous strides towards accountability, and the system allows us more readily identify issues which need to be addressed.But that might not be enough to convince our EU counterparts. The global agriculture sector is an enormous problem in relation to climate change, and has to be addressed.Despite our 'green' image, we have a lot of work to do.Although our emissions have fallen in recent years, largely due to the recession, they are still among the highest in the EU per head of population.Agriculture makes up the largest part of the total produced - 32pc. It is followed by energy (22pc), industrial and commercial (15pc), transport (19pc) and residential (11pc).If we are to argue for a special case exemption, we will have to dramatically ramp-up efforts in other sectors, something we have failed to do to date.IFA Environment Committee chairman Harold Kingston makes the point that we are a world leader in sustainable food production.Agriculture targets ""No other country in the world monitors, measures and manages carbon from farm to fork. ""This commitment to environmental improvement by so many farmers is verified by Bord Bia's Origin Green initiative,"" he says.The IFA is seeking support and incentives to innovate, and for money to be advanced to farmers in developing countries to make the transition.But the big political question is whether EU leaders will agree for Ireland's agriculture sector to be given less onerous targets.The difficulty is that if Ireland is given special status for agriculture, other countries will row in with demands specific to their own economy, and that could scupper the entire process.\l"

They shied away from making a direct link with climate change but it was clear the ""normal"" rainfall statistics and the incidence of major storms was changing, they said. Topical focus Their project included data from no more than two weeks ago, and demonstrated the topicality and currency of many of the projects at the exhibition. There were a number of projects looking at the ongoing refugee crisis and its impact on countries across the EU.Niamh Liston (16) and Hannah Barrett (15), fifth years at Desmond College in Limerick, assessed the factors influencing refugee admittance to the EU. ""We wanted to get the opinions of EU citizens and what influenced willingness to accept refugee admission,"" said Hannah. They looked at three factors, the level of democracy in the country, economic status and population density, she said.Niamh described how they set up an email-based survey method and attracted 203 responses from 16 countries.The majority of EU citizens polled felt the refugee crisis was being handled badly. Almost 11 per cent said their country was doing a good job on the issue but 16 per cent strongly disagreed with this view.The Paris attacks in November had an impact on their findings.

That's according to a study in which families were asked to recognise the UK's most common trees (Ash, Birch, Oak, Horse Chestnut and Beech) with only 1% of parents and 1% of children able to recognise all five. The study of 1,000 families was undertaken by Unilever as part of its brightFuture campaign (#ForTheLoveofTrees), to raise awareness of the importance of trees and forests in the run up to the United Nation's Climate Change Summit, COP21, later this year. It also reveals a huge knowledge gap in Brits' understanding of climate change and the role of deforestation as a key contributing factor to rising temperatures. The study reveals that: :: Only 1% of parents in the UK could identify all of the UK's most common trees :: 9 in 10 could not identify an Ash or a Beech tree :: One in five mums and three in ten children could not identify even one tree out of the UK's common five trees :: Children really struggle to identify Ash, Beech or Horse Chestnut trees :: Older children over the age of 10 have no better tree knowledge than younger children :: There is a direct correlation between the parent's lack of tree knowledge and that of our children's, which shows that tree knowledge is dying out This year, Unilever is working with WWF to raise awareness of deforestation and protect one million trees in the Indonesian and Brazilian rainforests as a gesture towards a future where trees are recognised as one of the most valuable defences we have against climate change. The study also throws into question the nation's knowledge of the wider issue of global deforestation and its impact on climate change. 80% of mums know nothing or little about climate change, only 38% realise that deforestation is responsible for more carbon emissions than all transport on the planet (every plane, every car, every boat, and every train), and only 18% have heard of COP21. However, there is no denying that the effects of climate change today are more widespread and harder to ignore than ever before.

The deal commits developed nations to providing $100bn a year from 2020 to developing countries most at risk, with a mechanism to ramp-up investment.In a powerful speech, COP21 president and French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said the proposed accord was ambitious, fair, balanced and legally-binding, and urged nations to accept.""Our responsibility to history is immense. If we were to fail, how could we rebuild this hope?"" he asked.""Success is built collectively. You will be deciding on a historic agreement. The world is holding its breath.

Emissions will peak ""as soon as possible"" and reach neutral levels in the second half of the century. This means emissions must be balanced by developing forests and other carbon sinks, which absorb greenhouse gases. Countries will have to increase commitments, which will be reviewed every five years. There is also a commitment to food security, indigenous people and gender, which were not in earlier drafts. Human rights are also referenced in the preamble. Countries must provide ""transparent"" information on emission cuts delivered. This will be overseen in a ""non-intrusive"" manner. Forestry is given also special mention, as is protecting all ecosystems including oceans.There is no reference to emissions from shipping and aviation, which account for some 8pc of global greenhouse gas emissions.There has also been criticism about clauses surrounding 'loss and damage', which involves mechanisms to protect the most vulnerable countries, including small island states.It also rules out compensating countries affected by climate change.However, it does commit to helping countries mitigate against damage, such as providing early warning systems and assisting in emergency preparedness.Friends of the Earth International said it was a ""bad deal"" and a ""sham"" and showed that developed countries had ""totally erased their responsibilities"" towards developing countries.

"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland88","Doing nothing on climate change not an option","November 30, 2015 Monday","The Irish Times","I keep hearing about a big climate change thing going on in Paris. What is going on? There is a big international conference that starts today, where 190 countries will try to reach agreement on stopping climate change. It has two short names so if you want to sound knowledgeable call it COP21 or CMP11, but its alternative name, the 2015 Paris Climate Conference, is easier to understand. The United Nations is behind it, and nearly every country in the world has said they will go.Ambitions are high given the goal is to achieve a legally binding and universal agreement on climate change signed by all the nations of the world. That is not a small ask, and none of these big meetings ever tried to accomplish something as big as a universal agreement. Not climate change again. Why are we still talking about this? I thought we already had agreements on this? Climate change has been the subject of international discussions and negotiations for more than 20 years. There have been similar big meetings in Rio and Copenhagen and lots of smaller meetings, but the participants never manage to reach final agreements. Why not? Because having to do something about slowing or stopping climate change is going to cost really big money, and neither rich nor poor countries will want to spend money if they think it will harm their economies. It is easier - and cheaper - to do nothing . Given the meeting is taking place, I assume climate change is still happening? It certainly is. The World Meteorological Organisation only last week released data showing that 2015 is certain to go down as the warmest year on record. Ocean temperatures are at their highest, sea level rise continues apace as ice melts in Greenland, and glaciers disappear.This year we are likely to reach a milestone: average global temperatures will reach one degree above what they were in the pre-industrial era before humans began to release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide in huge amounts. That doesn't seem like so much. What difference does one degree make? Scientific research indicates that we will cross a little understood threshold if average temperatures pass the two degree point. There are indications that it represents a tipping point where runaway climate change starts to happen. This will melt even more land ice at both poles and drive sea levels higher and higher. Countries such as the Maldives will be among the first to disappear beneath the waves and low-lying countries and coastal communities around the world will be in trouble. This includes Ireland, by the way. No one will escape. Why haven't we done anything about this if it is so bad? That is what these big international meetings are attempting to accomplish. Some have been better than others for getting things agreed. For example, the Kyoto Protocol adopted in 1997 was a plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions but US president George W Bush decided the US would not accept it. The COP7 meeting in Marrakesh in 2001 brought in rules for bringing the protocol into force.But some things do get accepted over time and limits are set. That two degrees above pre-industrial temperature has been accepted internationally as a limit above which we cannot go. The question is will countries do what is necessary to stay below this limit? Holding to two degrees by 2100 means greenhouse gas emissions will have to be cut from today's levels by 40-70 per cent. So what are they going to try to agree at COP21?This will have an impact in Ireland. Either we will have to produce more renewable energy - which some communities are resisting because of windmills - or we will have to look at large emissions sources such as agriculture and transport, which are contentious issues here. Who else is promising to do something?If everyone agrees and if everyone sticks to the reduction plan then scientists believe this will hold temperature increases to 2.7 to 3 degrees by 2100. This is above the magic 2 degrees set by s scientists but if countries do nothing then we could see temperature rises of 5 degrees. That 5 degree increase is about the same temperature difference between the temperatures we have now and the temperatures on the planet during the last ice age more than 12,000 years ago. How are poor countries going to do anything about this? There will be lots of money needed to change things. Developing countries lobbied to bring about change. They argued that they weren't the authors of this mess and that the rich countries who were should help pay to clean things up.The meeting in Copenhagen, COP15 in 2009, accepted the idea and contribution levels were set. The promise was that by 2020 rich countries would be contributing at least EUR 90 billion a year to help poorer countries. By 2014 the level of funding reached EUR 56 billion so there is still a way to go. So should we expect big things from COP21? The challenge ahead - to stop climate change by 2100 - would be no small thing and no one attending the meeting will be under any illusions about how difficult it will be to achieve consensus.Yet doing nothing is not an option. Failure to act pushes us into unknown territory with runaway climate change a real possibility. If this were to happen then no country can feel secure in the face of major alterations to climate. It is an outcome too horrible to contemplate. \l"

The World Meteorological Organisation confirmed that the global concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere passed 400 parts per million - possibly the highest it has been in several million years. The second indication came from the UK Met Office who indicated that global average temperatures are going to surpass one degree Celsius this year. This passes the half way mark towards two degrees which has been set as the upper limit to avoid. All this as we come to the end of 2015 which is likely to be confirmed as the warmest year on record globally.Here are the questions (answers below): 1. According to NASA data, how many of the top ten hottest years occurred in the past ten years? 2. How many kilograms of carbon dioxide are released from the burning of 3.8 litres (one US gallon) of petrol? 3. What does COP21 refer to? 4. When and where is the next international Climate Summit? 5. How many nations are meeting at the next Climate Summit? 6. At the next Climate Summit, efforts are being made to create a legally-binding treaty. What commitments have already been made? 7. On current emission trajectories, our planet will warm how many degrees in the next century? 8. Who recently said in New York at the U.N. General Assembly that the upcoming 2015 Climate Summit is the ""last chance to save the planet""? 9. From 1800 to 2012, atmospheric CO2 increased by how much? 10. April 2014 was the first month that carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere went above what level? ANSWERS 1. Nine 2. Just over 9kg. This seems counter-intuitive because the quantity of petrol only weighs 2.7kg, but when it is burned it combines with oxygen molecules in the surrounding air, resulting in a greater weight of carbon being produced.3. Conference of Parties meeting for the 21st time 4. Paris, December 2015 5. About 190 6. Known as INDCs (Intended Nationally Determined Contributions) every country coming to the Paris 2015 Climate Summit (COP21) is supposed to have one on the table. The U.S. will cut its emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent compared to 2005 levels by 2025; China will lower carbon emissions per unit of GDP by 60 - 65 percent from 2005 levels; the E.U. will cut is emissions by 40 percent compared to 1990 levels by 2030; and Australia will implement an economy-wide target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.7. 7. 5 degrees. That may not sound like a big difference and day to day it isn't, but we are talking about annual averages. For perspective, the temperature difference between today's world and the last ice age was about 5 degrees (colder obviously)!8. French President, Francois Hollande 9. 40 percent. Half of this increase in CO2 has been since 1970. The amount of methane, a much stronger greenhouse gas, has increased 150 percent!10. 400 ppb. This is the highest concentration of CO2 the atmosphere has held in 800,000 years-and possibly in 20 million years. Scientists say we must keep levels below 350 ppb if we are to keep the planet from warming less than 2 degrees, the generally accepted level to maintain a healthy planet.\l"
"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland90","Paris agreement a cause for hope and a call to action; There are plenty of positives in the COP21 deal but a lot of hard work and 'climate' pain still lie ahead","December 14, 2015 Monday","The Irish Times","'It always seems impossible until it is done."" Thus spoke French foreign minister Laurent Fabius, quoting another author of the impossible, Nelson Mandela, when announcing that a climate deal had been done.There are reasons for cautious optimism. The Paris agreement binds all countries to reduce their emissions for the first time. It sets highly ambitious objectives of keeping global temperature to ""well below"" 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels and of ""pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C"".There is an unimpeachable moral case for 1.5-degree target. Even at this level of warming, many small island states and countries such as Bangladesh will be inundated. Yet the tragic reality is that limiting warming to 2 degrees would require a herculean global effort and drastically reduced emissions by 2030. Going beyond this and trying to limit warming to ""well below"" 2 degrees or 1.5 degrees may require developed countries to reduce their emissions to zero by 2020. For this reason, most experts consider the lower-range targets almost unreachable.However, there was also an excellent political and strategic case for the EU and the US to call for this lower target. It allowed the developed world to make common cause with many of the world's most vulnerable. Very poor countries and small island states had been the primary advocates of the 1.5-degree target for years. The so-called ""coalition of ambition"" negotiating group that emerged was a primary driver of the strong agreement. The rising economies of China, India, Brazil and South Africa were noted holdouts against the 1.5 degrees, as were oil producers such as Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. Importantly Brazil defected from the group in the final day of the talks. Greater efforts National pledges to take climate action are at the heart of the Paris agreement. But there is a contradiction here. As the text itself acknowledges, ""much greater emission reduction efforts will be required"" than is contained within current pledges. Where will this extra effort come from? The litmus test of this agreement was always the extent to which it could bind countries into a process of increasing pledge ambition over time. A robust ""ratchet mechanism"" was what the EU really wanted. The early drafts of the agreement had done little to reassure in this respect, but the final text delivers.A ""facilitative dialogue"" will take place in 2018 to review collective efforts in light of the new long-term goal. This is as early as could have been expected. Every country must communicate a new pledge by 2020 and every five years thereafter. Crucially each pledge must be ""a progression"" and ""as ambitious as possible"". Pledges tend to use inconsistent and messy language, which makes understanding and comparing them challenging. This problem would not appear to have been fully resolved. But will pledges be implemented or will climate fall off the agenda as soon as leaders return home? History tells us that grandiose plan after grandiose plan for decarbonisation are shelved, generally for fear of alienating one or other special interest group.While parties are required to pursue domestic mitigation in l"
"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland91","Irish fossil fuel subsidies almost 200 times amount pledged to UN green fund; Campaigners say subsidies to fossil fuel industry dwarf amounts promised","December 9, 2015 Wednesday","The Irish Times","Ireland spends almost 200 times more on fossil fuel subsidies than it plans to contribute to the UN's Green Climate Fund, a ratio tha is much worse than other developed countries, according to data from clean energy campaigners.New analysis released at the COP21 climate change conference shows that G7 countries along with Australia spend on average 40 times more on subsidies for fossil fuel production than they plan to contribute to the UN's Green Climate Fund.The Government has to date pledged EUR 2 million to the fund, which is aimed at ameliorating the worst effects of climate change in developing countries. Minister for the Environment Alan Kelly said this week he planned to seek Cabinet approval for an increase in this allocation.France has the lowest ratio of subsidies to pledged funding at 6:1 while Australia has the highest at 113:1. Ireland was not included in the study but Friends of the Earth estimates that the fossil fuel industry here benefits from about EUR 386 million annually in subsidies.This figure is made up of the share of the public service obligation (PSO) levy allocated to subsidising peat and securing gas supply, totalling EUR 169.2 million this year, combined with fuel allowance payments to low-income households of about EUR 217 million annually.The PSO levy is a charge paid by all domestic electricity customers to support domestic energy supply. Residential customers pay EUR 5.01 a month excluding VAT, a sum that is itemised on electricity bills.Kate Ruddock, policy and campaigns manager at Friends of the Earth, said fuel allowance payments were regarded in other European states as a fossil fuel subsidy, although she acknowledged that different methodologies could be used in different studies. European average A 2013 IMF study showed subsidies to the oil, gas and coal industries in Ireland as a proportion of government revenue were close to the European average but well below that of Australia and the US. Concern over the role of the fuel allowance as a fossil fuel subsidy is shared by the Society of St Vincent de Paul, whose head of social justice, John-Mark McCafferty, said there was a need to move towards ""sustainable and affordable energy"".While the organisation wished to ensure that people on low incomes were warm in their homes, ""fuel subsidies can't stay as they are in the post-COP21 world"". Money would be better spent on insulation and retrofitting, he said.The study of G7 nations, compiled by Oil Change International (OCI) and Climate Action Network (Can) Europe, shows that Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US together hand out about $80 billion (EUR 74 billion) a year in public support for fossil fuels, while their total pledges to the climate fund only amount to $2 billion per year. 'Crying poor' OCI senior campaigner Alex Doukas accused rich countries of ""crying poor"" on climate finance while paying billions to fossil fuel industries. In better news for Ireland yesterday, the country ranked in 12th place in a survey of the climate change performance of almost 60 countries worldwide, released by Germanwatch and Can Europe.Given that the first three places are vacant, because none of the countries surveyed are said to be doing enough to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, Ireland's position is effectively ninth place on the list.Although European countries still rank high, profiting from their early start in development of climate policies, the EU now ""risks falling behind"" as other countries ""invest in renewable energy on a massive scale"", the authors say.\l"

""This mobilisation is unprecedented in world history,"" Hulot told the Anglo-American Press Association. An environmental activist for more than 30 years, he says ""The real question is will it be half a success, a full success or an absolute success.""Hulot's yardsticks for measuring the success of the conference are: the strength of the commitment to limit global warming to 2 degrees this century; finance to help the developing world adapt to climate change, and a move towards universal carbon pricing.The World Meteorological Organisation in Geneva reported this week that the symbolic threshold of a 1 degree rise in temperatures since pre-industrial times will be crossed this year. If temperatures rise more than 2 degrees, Hulot says, it will be irreversible.The commitments made in Paris will be insufficient to secure the 2-degree goal. ""The important things is that we put in place procedures that put us on a trajectory to 2 degrees,"" Hulot says. That is why France insists on a review process demanding periodic and ever-greater commitments to reduce greenhouse emissions.Actions not words Hulot's second criterion for success is ""a real moment of solidarity, not just words, with countries who are victims of climate change"". The necessity of helping the developing world adapt is much more present than in past conferences, he says. A promised $100 billion (EUR 94 billion) annual fund for this purpose has now reached about $85 billion, but Hulot believes $100 billion should be the minimum. It should begin before the Paris accord enters into force in 2020, and continue afterwards. Hulot pleads for ""unorthodox"" or ""innovative"" finance to fund adaptation, such as special drawing rights at the International Monetary Fund, a tax on financial transactions or redistribution of a global carbon tax.COP21 does not make a commitment to a ""carbon corridor"" within which governments choose their carbon taxes, ""the chances of tipping towards a low-carbon economy will be compromised"".The draft accord that was drawn up by negotiators in Bonn still contains 1,200 sets of brackets comprised of multiple options, all of which will have to be resolved during the two-week conference. The 2-degree limit, periodic reviews, adaptation and carbon pricing are all in brackets. The other most important issues, according to Hulot's Foundation for Man and Nature, are damages and loss for those countries most affected by climate change, and whether the agreement will be legally binding. Hollande says it must be; US president Barack Obama, who faces opposition from climate sceptics in Congress, says it cannot be.Hulot regrets that there will be no provision to punish countries who fail to keep their commitments.

He is counting on peer pressure to hold them to their word, because ""if anyone cheats, the entire world will pay for it"".There has been some criticism of the fact that big polluters such as airl"

It can be summed up simply: given that climate change poses such a threat to our planet and species, why is it largely ignored by the media?Ignored, I can hear you snort? But you can't open a newspaper, browse social media or listen to the radio without hearing about melting glaciers or the upcoming Conference of Parties (COP21) climate change conference in Paris.Research shows coverage of climate change peaks around international conferences and the release of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, this article being a case in point. Yet at other times it all but disappears, especially in Ireland. One survey shows it accounted for just 0.84 per cent of news coverage in The Irish Times between 1997 and 2010.My own research into Irish media coverage of climate change shows that, by comparison with Europe, coverage by the Irish national newspapers of climate change is low.In 2007, European coverage of climate change was almost three times that of coverage in Ireland, at 138.2 stories versus 47.5 per title per month. In the late-2009, early- 2010 period, European coverage had dipped to twice that of Ireland. Since then, the gap has widened again. Irish coverage The latest figures in my research show that by the end of last year, Irish coverage stood at 10.6 stories per title a month, compared to 58.4 in the rest of Europe.Why is the coverage of climate change so low? The answer is as complex as the question is simple. Some studies suggest the ideological orientation of news organisations themsleves inform their climate change coverage, so newspapers with a business- as-usual worldview are less likely to cover climate change in the first place, and when they do, they are less likely to advocate sweeping changes to markets and energy systems.Another theory is that environmental problems have a natural attention cycle among readers.

These variants have been around from the very beginning. It may be cold comfort but the facts point to the earth cooling rather than warming in the longer term, as interglacial periods have always been much shorter than the ice ages.Des Quinn Ballinamore, Co.

"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland105","Agriculture is Ireland's Achilles' heel in emissions; The Taoiseach will speak during the first day of the summit in Paris","November 27, 2015 Friday","The Irish Times","COP21 opens in Paris on Monday with much higher expectations and hopes than the previous global effort in Copenhagen six years ago. COP stands for Conference of Parties and refers to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Get used to the alphabet soup of acronyms: there will be a lot between now and December 11th. The ambition is extraordinary and almost unachievable. It is to get all 196 countries in the United Nations to agree to put measures in place in their own countries with the aim of confining increases in global temperatures to 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels. So far, 160 countries have signed pledges setting out what they intend to do. Some are conservative, others ambitious but achievable. On Monday many world leaders will gather in Paris for a leaders' day. With memories of the recent barbarity in the French capital, it is expected that that awful Friday will be marked in a formal way. Late on Monday Taoiseach Enda Kenny will set out Ireland's position on climate change to the conference. Reduce emissions Ireland will not go to the conference with a unique position. The European Union has submitted its plan and Ireland is a party to this. It commits the EU to reduce emissions by at least 40 per cent by 2030. The issue of climate justice is never far away from COP conferences. There are low-lying islands in the Indian Ocean particularly vulnerable to being wiped out by flooding if global temperatures rise. There are other developing countries which do not have the resources to build the infrastructure to mitigate against climate change, or to adapt to its impact. To achieve equality, there has to be some transfer of either funding, technology or infrastructure from richer (mostly western) countries to these poorer countries. Burden Ireland is fully supportive of the EU position. Its share of that 40 per cent reduction will be determined during negotiations in Brussels in 2016. Obviously, the Government will be arguing that Ireland's proportion of that burden should be fair and equitable (ie, lower than 40 per cent). Ireland's Achilles' heel in this regard is agriculture, which comprises 45 per cent of the country's emissions (outside the manufacturing and power industries, which are included in the emissions trading scheme). When the Taoiseach gets up to speak on Monday, he will also be able to say that Ireland is one of the relatively small group of countries that has passed climate change legislation - the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill has just finished its passage through the D\'e1il. It attracted some controversy for not including specific long-term target but recent amendments have strengthened the law. In particular, a late amendment included a specific and explicit commitment to climate justice - an important concession. Negotiations Over the fortnight of talks, senior officials from the Department of the Environment will form part of the wider EU team in the negotiations. Minister for the Environment Alan Kelly will arrive for the second week of negotiations and give political leadership to the team. Officials say that success would be ""an ambitious legally binding agreement in Paris that ensure that all parties will participate in the global effort to combat climate change"".A rise of more than 2 per cent in average global temperatures or more is not just an abstract concept. An Environmental Research Centre Report in 2006 summarised potential vulnerability for Ireland. This included a sea level rise; an increase in river flooding; loss of coastal habitats; increased incidences of coastal flooding; increased frequency of forest fires and pest infection; changes in distribution of plants and animals as well as more intense cyclonic and extreme precipitation events. That is why a successful outcome of COP21 is seen as urgent and necessary. \l"

They've set themselves the goal of limiting the rise in the Earth's temperature to 2 degrees in this century. To do this, they would have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by between 40 and 70 per cent over the next 35 years.The other chief goal of COP 21 is to secure financing for the Green Climate Fund, which was supposed to provide $100 billion (EUR 89.4 billion) annually to help developing countries adapt to climate change.If carbon emissions continue unchecked, average temperatures could increase by 4.8 degrees in this century, says the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

The organisation yesterday released its 2014 report on concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and other greenhouse gases. It emphasised the major contribution to global warming made by water vapour in the air.Moisture in the air ""amplifies warming"", it says. A warmer atmosphere heated up by greenhouse gases means the air can hold more water vapour, causing further warming.Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, the most important greenhouse gas - and the one that spends longest in the atmosphere - has now reached it highest level yet, with a global average of 397.7 parts per million (ppm). Peak Levels in the northern hemisphere peaked above 400ppm during spring 2014, a ""symbolically significant"" threshold, the organisation said. With the global average so close to this point already, it expects the average to exceed 400ppm as early as next year.With carbon dioxide levels so high, ""we are moving into uncharted territory at a frightening speed"", said the organisation's secretary general Michel Jarraud.His warning comes only weeks ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference, COP 21, in Paris from November 30th to December 11th. Questions remain as to whether the meeting will manage to deliver a unified international response to controlling greenhouse gas emissions, given the lack of progress made at previous conferences. Emissions While COP 21Most of the warming effect comes from carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide and, once released, all three remain in the atmosphere for a long time. Water vapour in the air is short-lived but its abundance helps to trap large amounts of heat while it is there. Further increases in carbon dioxide concentrations will lead to disproportionately high increases in warming from water vapour, the organisation said. Every year the report highlights rising levels for greenhouse gas concentrations and ""every year we say that time is running out"", said Mr Jarraud. \l"

An Taisce, for example, runs many wide-ranging positive initiatives, such as the world-leading Green Schools programme, the Blue Flag, the National Spring Clean and regular nature walks which encourage citizens, particularly children, educators and communities to engage positively with nature.Rather, the message of environmental groups has too often been persistently portrayed as negative within the mainstream media as it inconveniently challenges the ""business as usual"" economic orthodoxy of growth without limits on a finite planet. Our recent successful court case in quashing the continued operation of Bord na M\'f3na's Edenderry power plant is a useful case in point, where a story about the destruction of our natural bogs, the disastrous policy of burning peat and transitioning to a post-fossil fuel future became widely reported as a story about short-term job losses.Lest we be in any doubt, two decades of sugar-coating environmental issues through the mantra of ""sustainable development"" has not slowed the unrelenting accelerating pace of anthropogenic climate change and global species extinction. Evoking a greater citizen engagement with the wonders of nature will prove a fruitless task unless we can also simultaneously politically reorient ourselves toward a positive future, a truer form of progress, which takes full account of the uneconomic costs of growth. - Yours, etc, JOHN HARNETT,Chairman,An Taisce, The Tailors' Hall, Back Lane,Dublin 8.\l"

It's draped on the base of the magnificent statue of Marianne, symbolising the French republic, on the Place de la R\'e9publique, in the midst of countless floral tributes, candles, hand-written messages and posters signifying people's defiance of terrorism.But m\'eame pas peurjoie de vivre. That's hardly surprising, given the enormity of what happened and the death toll wreaked by French-born jihadists.Restaurants, in particular, have been badly hit. During the COP21 climate summit, two of us visited Les Trois Crabes, a small, family-run Vietnamese place in the 12th arrondissement, after reading enthusiastic TripAdvisor reviews. Only one of the eight tables was occupied when we arrived, although a group of five came in later and took a table at the rear, next to the kitchen.The proprietor from Hanoi asked us where we were from and whether we we weren't afraid of being in Paris in the wake of the attacks. , we said. It was almost an issue of showing solidarit\'e9. Had business been affected since? we asked. Yes, she said, it was down by about 70 per cent. Which is pretty devastating for any restaurant in a side-street location.She travels to work from Ivry-sur-Seine, on the southeastern outskirts of the city, and says she would open up the restaurant ""even if there was only one customer"". Quite heroic, really. Significantly, nearly three-quarters of the regular customers were from the neighbourhood; they were just not going out as much any more, after the carnage along Boulevard Voltaire. I've been to Paris at least 40 times since my first visit, when I was only 18. One thing I noticed this time was the appearance of French flags hanging from some windows or fluttering in flower-boxes. It's not widespread, but nevertheless remarkable because, previously, you'd only ever see the beautiful blue, white and red tricolour flying from public buildings or draped under the Arc de Triomphe.We had been to Paris the weekend before the attacks for a symposium on climate change, organised by the Skellig Foundation at the old Irish College, now the Centre Culturel Irlandais. Maeve Jennings, a good friend who used to work for Temple Bar Properties and is now a property consultant in Paris, said then that ""people are waiting for something to happen"" - some form of attack. We were dining out in Au Passage, a trendy restaurant on Passage Saint-S\'e9bastien, right behind the Bataclan Caf\'e9 and music venue, where 90 people were gunned down less than a week later. In rail stations, you could see heavily armed French soldiers with submachine guns, while CRS national police patrolled streets in the run-up to COP21. In the Bois de Boulogne, a public notice read: ""As part of the Vigipirate £ttack-alert' high-security plan now in force in the Paris region, the Jardin d'Acclimatation has put in place more stringent protective measures to guarantee your safety. Thus, before entering the Jardin, you will be subjected to a security inspection . . .

It is a bit ironic, therefore, to see politicians scrambling to show their concern for the latest victims of floods when much of the devastation could have been avoided by prompt political actions in the past. COP21 in Paris show the political attitude to long-term problems such as this remains the same: keep your head buried in the sand until you have no alternative. Flooding is a natural phenomenon and cannot be entirely avoided. However, what must surely add to the trauma of many of the victims is the thought that it might have been totally avoided if proper planning and development policies had been in place or implemented in some of the places recently flooded. Our planning and development system was formally put in place in 1963 with the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act. Flooding was included in it as a non-compensatable reason for refusing a planning application. This meant if a local authority refused planning permission and cited the threat of flooding as a reason, the applicant had no grounds for claiming compensation for that refusal.The inclusion of this section shows there was an awareness of flooding as an issue for consideration in deciding planning applications.Engineering solutions Following this there is little evidence that flood risk was a major consideration in planning decisions until the late 1990s. In the interim the attitude to flooding seems to have been largely based on the belief that it could be managed by ""engineering solutions"". It is clear this ad hoc approach has led to flooding elsewhere in river catchments. Since the late 1990s there has been a growing recognition at ""official"" levels of national and local government of the problem and risk of flooding even if that is not always reflected at political levels. At least eight policy documents have been produced since 1997. Prior to 2004 the lack of definitive information on flood plains and areas at risk presented an added difficulty for planners who wanted to refuse zoning or planning in those areas. In many instances it was one person's word against another. As a result of the potential financial losses to landowners, local authorities and local representatives erred on the side of the landowner.National Flood Policy This changed in 2004 with the report of the Flood Policy Review Group led by the Office of Public Works. This gave definitive reliable information on areas at risk and led to the National Flood Policy.In 2009, section 28 of the 2000 Planning Act was used to issue guidel"

""And actually, if you say you are at war, human rights tend to be given much less attention."" She noted that President Hollande's language had since ""shifted slightly"" to refer to the Paris attacks as ""crimes"".""It is very hard on young Muslims now in France, for example, because of the stigma of insecurity, whereas if we identify that there are radicalised young people, we understand some of the reasons for the radicalisation - but it doesn't excuse that activity.""""Spirit of Paris"" The attacks last January and in November had affected the ""spirit of Paris"", she noted, and there would be a lot of empathy with the French ""because France for its own reasons first of all offered to host the COP21 summit"".

The ensuing discussion allowed both politicians to debate their policies and views regarding Ireland's sustainable development priorities with attending delegates.In his opening remarks Ryan made it clear that our energy focus must change. Energy must switch to that of renewables. ""For 40,000 years we were nomads, during which time mythology was the key driver behind mankind's rationale for living,"" he said.""Once agriculture rose to prominence, more settled communities became the norm with theology becoming the driver for cultural development. At around the same time communication went from script to print then went to ideology. This then led to the evolution of psychology in the 20th century.""Ryan postulated that the current internet revolution, in tandem with the growing use of renewables will bring about a new global culture: one based on ecology. ""Green thinking will be crucially important in this new world,"" he said.""The general public are angry with those politicians who try to serve up age old policies, which are not fit for purpose when it comes to meeting the sustainability challenges of the 21st century. The old conservativism is not working. Increasing numbers of people are becoming angry at the total lack of vision which the current government has when it comes to developing a sustainable future for Ireland.\~""Green thinking is revolutionary. And the great hope, in this regard, is that a combination of digital and renewable energy technologies can be brought to bear in an interconnected way, thereby plotting a sustainable future for this country."" Barry Cowen confirmed that everyone depends on the environment. ""We need to use it, but it must not be lost to us,"" he said. ""Politics is cyclical. We are currently at a crossroads, with regard to the advancement of energy policy in Ireland. And I recognise the great harm that can be done to the environment, if we get it wrong. The challenge of sustainability is not lost on Fianna F\'e1il. It is an issue that has already been reflected across a wide spectrum of our policies for the future.""The challenge of the environment straddles many government departments. But above all else, we need a clear and concise energy policy. One that's adds up financially while, at the same time, is wholly respectful of the need to maintain a sustainable environment. And I do not underestimate the scale of this challenge moving forward. Cowen refuted the suggestion that political parties do not see the issue of climate change as being of key importance and that Irish citizens have not been provided with clear policy options, where this matter is concerned.""The lack of binding targets with regard to climate change must be addressed,"" he said. ""Fianna Fail is seeking to highlight this matter in very precise and effective terms. We need to get clear and binding targets built into government policy where greenhouse gases are concerned. And to do this we must look beyond the current legislation.The Green Party leader defended the actions taken by his party while in partnership government with Fianna F\'e1il. He pointed out that it is extremely difficult for a junior party in a coalition to effect major change across the entire spectrum of government activity. ""Emissions reduced by 14 per cent during our years in government,"" said Ryan. ""Admittedly, half of this was accounted for by the downturn in the economy. But the remainder was accounted for by government legislation.""\~Looking to the future Ryan said that policy makers must have the public fully on board when it comes to making decisions on Ireland's sustainable future. ""And this must percolate right down to town, village and parish level. We need full public agreement on these matters that are of vital national interest. And everything is possible, public opinion is changing. The communications' revolution that is now taking place has the power to educate people more fully on their sustainability options for the future. And this is already happening. ""Increasingly, the public recognise the benefits of green policies. But more than this, they also view sustainability as the only show in town. There is no Plan B. Taking the earth's resource without any recourse to maintaining their value for future generations has only one end point. And it's one that provides us with no future at all.""\~Commenting on the current fracking controversy, Barry Cowen said that the implementation of the technology is not compatible with the best interests of the Irish countryside. ""And most members of the Fianna F\'e1il party feel this way. Our upcoming election manifesto will reflect this.\~Cowen also pointed out that the world's dependence on oil must diminish. ""The upcoming United NationsClimate Change Conference, taking place in Paris, will allow for a full and frank debate on this issue,"" he said. ""Its clear objective will be to achieve a binding and universal agreement on climate, from all the nations of the world. And in this regard we must have India and the European Union fully on board.Eamon Ryan expressed the view that the world must become a zero carbon planet by 2050. ""Oil is the most incredibly energy dense substance that is available to us. This is why it has become so entrenched at the very core of our economy and way of life. Renewable energy sources, however, are much more distributive in nature. This is why we must combine their development with a greater use of digital communication technologies.""All of this hinges on educating our young people properly. I was taken aback recently when finding out that questions on the anatomical structure of the earthworm still feature in Leaving Cert examination papers. I thought that we had left the 20th century behind us: but, seemingly, this is not the case. Both Cowen and Ryan agreed that D\'e1il members need to be more on top of what is happening at EU level.""So much of our national legislation is now based on agreements thrashed out in Brussels,"" stressed the Green party leader. ""So it is crucially important for all our local politicians to get involved in the EU debate on sustainability at all levels.""Ryan characterised Pope Francis' recent encyclical on the environment as a potential game changer where policies relating to global sustainability are concerned. ""The upcoming Paris summit will be a turning point for the world,"" he said. ""And the Pope's recent thoughts will form a fitting backdrop for the discussions that will take place amongst world leaders in a few weeks' time. ""But, fundamentally, we need to make an evolutionary leap forward, where sustainability is concerned. This will involve putting a love of the environment at centre stage, with regard to everything that we do and we must be proactive. Doing nothing is not an option.""\~\l"

Clearly these can be quite complex, given the topography, the geography and the hydrological surveys that are necessary to be carried out,"" he explained helpfully.So once we sort out the ""topography"", ""geography"" and ""hydrological surveys"", we'll be grand.The people of Bandon are not greatly reassured. They have been waiting since 2010 for help, and with one month's rain to cope with in a two-day period, and more on the way, patience has been washed away. Simon Harris has pledged to have ""shovels on the ground"" by the middle of next year.Just as storms like 'Desmond' are given a name, pledges like that issued by the minister are also described in colourful terms, but they are not printable.As one business owner put it: ""water has no mercy"". There are many reasons why those hit by floods question Government commitments to deliver.Even when State relief is offered, businesses find that it is too difficult to draw down, and the process takes way too long.Only last week, Mr Kenny told the COP21 conference in Paris, that ""big and small"" had to take action to address climate change. He promised Ireland would play its part. But there was a caveat - as long as it didn't hamper growth in the agriculture sector. Mr Kenny's concern appears to be postdated until after 2020. Only then will the State be in a position to meet ""aggressive targets"" to reduce agri-emissions.But climate change is here and now. There may be nothing as unpredictable as the weather.Atmospheric disturbances will always be different, but there is nothing as predictable as State excuses.

They now find themselves stricken once again, and this time there is no insurance.Taoiseach Enda Kenny's advice last week for people to move to higher ground was maladroit.His ambivalence towards the UN COP21 summit on climate change in Paris, and his special pleading on his return, suggest a flippant regard for the scale of the challenges.Local interests can no longer take priority over national ones. Good governance is defined by getting things done.A central agency must be set in place to monitor water levels and flood management. The confusion created by too many competing agencies has led to dysfunction and inertia. Management of the Shannon has to be a priority. But all of the issues have to be addressed on a countrywide basis. Planning, irresponsible building on flood plains, poor drainage, failure to dredge rivers, have all been cited as contributory factors.The State must also put a fund in place to help those in areas where insurance is not available.The Coalition has not handled this crisis with either the resolve or sensitivity required.

The passage of time from as far back as Hurricane Charlie in the 1980s has merely served to strengthen the rural-urban divide. After the chaos left in the wake of ""Charlie"", in Dublin at least, immediate action was taken to strengthen the Dodder and Dargle river banks. Similarly, Fermoy and Clonmel - once flood blackspots - have been protected since defences were put in place.The devastation farming families and businesses are feeling around the country follows years of neglect by various governments that avoided introducing comprehensive winter action plans.Questions such as why the Shannon is not regularly dredged, or why so many different players are involved, need to be addressed.

It will invoke former US president John F Kennedy's speech to the Houses of the Oireachtas in 1963 in which he said Ireland could become a country leading the way in the world. Entitled The Power to Power Ourselves, the campaign will highlight that 85 per cent of Irish energy is imported and that wind energy is a renewable source of energy that can reduce that figure. Billboards One billboard will be 85 per cent blank, while the rest of it will have the following message: ""Just 15 per cent of this poster was printed as it was made using only energy produced entirely in Ireland. 85 per cent of our energy requirements are met through imports. Yet Ireland is surrounded by a clean and renewable resource that would vastly reduce imports to meet our energy needs, now and into the future."" Fossil fuels Irish Wind Energy Association chief executive Kenneth Matthews said the campaign followed agreement at the Paris summit which mandated an end to fossil fuels by the end of the century. ""We need to make sure there is a factual discussion around the energy situation that Ireland has at present and there are hard choices to be made,"" he said. He said a recent poll showed that most Irish people were not aware where the country's energy came from. He said that during high winds wind energy generated half the electricity in the country. ""Recently we've seen a concerning escalation in false and misleading information about wind energy from some quarters,"" he said.

It has taken an innovative social media campaign by an intern at An Taisce to draw even a little attention to what the Labour Party rightly describes in its manifesto as ""the biggest single challenge facing humanity""; climate change. Yet the Taoiseach made a rousing speech to the UN's COP21 meeting on climate change in Paris last December. He called on leaders ""to provide lasting foundations for the preservation and sustainability of generations of the future"". He made a very different speech afterwards, pleading for Irish exceptionalism. He rejected any revision of the Government's programmes for expanding the beef and dairy sectors, which will significantly increase our greenhouse gas emissions. Minister for the Environment Alan Kelly of the Labour Party backed him up energetically. This hardly equates to seriousness about the issue.Yet Fianna F\'e1il and Sinn F\'e9in have made no major challenge to this clash between rhetoric and policy. Neither have the Climate Bill nor the White Paper on Energy, for which the Government deserves some credit, featured in the campaign. Other critical environmental issues like flooding, uplands management, resources for conservation, damage to our peatlands and biodiversity loss have also been largely ignored.Some attribute this silence to the exclusion of the Green Party from TV debates. But we should not be dependent on a single party on such crucial questions. It is said that these topics are too technical, or too controversial, or both, for politicians to raise them at election time; that the electorate is averse to long-term issues. But the impact of environmental damage is no distant issue. We urgently need politicians to take into account the environmental costs - and benefits - of all economic and social policies. The treatment of the environment by most parties in the campaign represents a disturbingly symptomatic failure of political vision and leadership. \l"

"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland125","Make climate change a doorstep issue in election","December 19, 2015 Saturday","The Irish Times","Daniel Gilbert, a Harvard professor of psychology, once said to writer George Marshall that if climate change was caused by eating puppies, millions of Americans would be massing in the streets.Marshall's book in which Gilbert is quoted is called Don't Even Think About it - Why our Brains are Wired to Ignore Climate Change. Marshall talked to all sorts of people, including Gilbert, to figure out why most people feel vaguely guilty about climate change but do nothing about it.The research Gilbert and others have carried out suggests we are predisposed to respond to four triggers, for which he uses the acronym PAIN.These triggers stand for ""personal"", ""abrupt"", ""immoral"" and ""now"". ""Personal"" means we are highly attuned to identifying friends, enemies and detecting who is at fault in situations. However, the develop world's fossil- fuel addiction is hard to blame on any one identifiable and simple target.Climate change is also not abrupt: it is relatively slow. Speaking of slow change, contrary to myth, no sane frog will stay in a pot of water while the temperature slowly rises. Rather than sitting still while it boil, it will hop out as soon as it perceives the threat if there is any means of doing so. Unfortunately, human beings appear to be much more tolerant of slowly developing threats - we are quite happy to sit here as the temperature rises. Moral repugnance Nor does climate change trigger the sense of outrage or moral repugnance that eating puppies does. We are also notoriously bad at looking into the future and will discount all risks that are unlikely to affect us directly here and now. Even though developing countries feel the impact right now, we discount it because it is not happening to us.Despite his book's title, Marshall does not believe humans are incapable of grasping the threat and taking action. However, ladling out gloom and doom is counterproductive.Climate-change activists are working hard to create compelling narratives that inspire change, but they lack support from the media and most politicians.For example, a coalition of civil society groups including unions, business, church bodies and the environmental sector has been hosting what it calls Climate Conversations, with the aim of motivating people to take appropriate action.Another Climate Conversation was held last Wednesday in Trinity College in the wake of the COP21 talks in Paris. Some of the organisers were mildly disappointed that only about 250 people turned up. However, most political parties would be delighted with the turnout and age profile, particularly so close to Christmas.There were plenty of older people, but a significant number were young.There was lots of polite disagreement - a minority thought COP21 would be better described as Copout 21, while another minority thought it was a great step forward. The majority seemed to think that it was extremely flawed, but still significant. There was also a sense of developing momentum. Media bears responsibility As one participant put it, if even Saudi Arabia accepts the impact of fossil fuel consumption, we are getting somewhere. In my view, the media have to bear a huge amount of responsibility for the lack of a compelling narrative that motivates change. Look how journalists and presenters rallied behind the move to change the definition of marriage, to the extent that on the day of the result in Dublin Castle it was hard to tell the media from activists.The same is true of politicians. Imagine if a fraction of the passion that is expended on getting re-elected were spent on creating narratives that point to the brighter future that can result from caring for the environment.Vision matters. At times of challenge a sense of common purpose and of interconnectedness is essential. We need to see our planet as our beloved home in order to defend it with the passion that is needed.Even in dire situations, there are positive aspects that can be emphasised. For example, thousands of jobs could be created by incentives to retrofit houses so that they are more energy-efficient.There are local initiatives that are both good for the environment and our bills, such as district heating schemes for estates, which can reduce fossil fuel use by 90 per cent.Irish small farmers are understandably embittered and embattled at the moment, but imagine if there were concentrated efforts to help them diversify, instead of the assumption that family farms that are not massive agri-businesses are on the way out.Everyone can get behind the ""Keep it in the ground"" movement, which puts moral pressure on investors to divest from fossil fuel companies.Individual action is important, but community action is even more important, and political action perhaps most important of all. One thing every voter can do is to make this an issue when candidates come canvassing. Politicians believe there are few votes in this, that people fundamentally don't care that much. The forthcoming election is a prime opportunity to shake that complacency.\l"

The agreement makes a commitment to keep global temperature rises under 2 degrees celsius.The Environment Minister Mark H Durkan has welcomed the deal, calling it ""a result for everyone, our planet and our future generations"".But there is concern that Northern Ireland is falling behind on its carbon emission targets.Mr Durkan, who was in Paris as part of the UK delegation known as COP21, said: ""During my time in Paris I was encouraged by the willingness of everyone to engage in serious discussion on tackling climate change. ""This milestone agreement shows that this was not just talk - real actions have been agreed that will make a real difference.""He also praised commitments to offer billions of pounds in support for developing countries to meet their environmental goals.Sandra Overend, environment spokesperson for the Ulster Unionist Party, also welcomed the agreement, but blasted the Stormont Executive for falling behind on carbon emission targets. ""While the Executive still claims to be committed to the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, its actions suggest otherwise,"" she said.""In order to live up to its global responsibilities, Northern Ireland needs to do much more.

Newspaper editors may be tempted to prepare alternate front pages announcing ""World Saved"" or ""World Doomed,"" as in the 1961 science fiction film The Day the Earth Caught Fire.The UN Conference of Parties started in 1992, and this will be the 21st session, hence the conference's name, COP 21. Alarming predictions by experts and world leaders drive home how high the stakes are. ""The ocean is dying, and it produces 80 per cent of the oxygen on our planet,"" Paul Watson, the president of the NGO Sea Shepherd told the Summit of Conscience for the Climate""If action is not taken immediately,"" the former UN secretary general Kofi Annan said, his grandchildren will endure ""suffocating heat waves, severe droughts, catastrophic forest fires, rising sea levels and drowning cities; New York, Venice and small island states will be submerged.""Pope's encyclical Twenty-seven years have passed since a scientist named James Hansen testified in the US Senate that man's addiction to fossil fuels was driving the planet to perdition. An overwhelming body of evidence subsequently proved him right. Awareness of the peril has grown this year, aided by Pope Francis's encyclical Laudato Si.It is hoped that India, which is also a leading polluter, will be spurred by China's example.Only 47 of the 195 states in COP 21 have made commitments. France, which will host the conference, is focused on securing more NDCs. Many countries are waiting to see others' proposals first. The goal of COP 21If nothing is done, French president Fran\'e7ois Hollande said on July 21st, temperatures will rise four degrees. ""Based on negotiations and the commitments made so far, the agreement that appears reachable today would probably put us at three degrees.""""Mitigation"" and ""adaptation"" are the key words in the run-up to the December conference. The former means substantial reductions in carbon emissions. The latter refers to the transition from a fossil fuel-based energy system to renewable energy sources: solar, wind, marine and geothermal.The governments of developed countries spend huge amounts of money to encourage citizens to buy electric cars, and install insulation and solar panels. The challenge is greater in the developing world.For that reason, earlier conferences foresaw a $100 billion annual ""green climate fund"" to help the developing world make the energy transition. The fund is supposed to be operational by 2020, but who will pay, and how much, remains a major issue.It is perhaps the most absurd aspect of climate change that the governments who are too stingy to fund the ""green climate fund"" spend $5,000 billion to subsidise the fossil fuel industry annually, according to the International Monetary Fund. The absence of a transparent, reliable means of assessing carbon emissions and holding countries to their commitments is also an obstacle to an agreement.With just four months to go, negotiators are showing signs of fatigue. The UN secretary general Ban Ki Moon has complained that negotiations are moving at ""a snail's pace"". ""Taking account of the inertia of the negotiations, we must pull the levers of conscience, meaning and spirituality,"" said Nicolas Hulot, Mr Hollande's special envoy for the protection of the planet.At a preparatory meeting on July 20th, Christiana Figueres, the executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, took several minutes to regain her composure at the microphone, a diplomat who attended the meeting recounted. ""Figueres couldn't speak because she was crying,"" the diplomat said. ""Things are moving very slowly. The pressure is getting to them all. She seemed exasperated by the lack of urgency and momentum. She said that expressions of solidarity aren't enough; we need to see action in moving away from fossil fuels.""Fossil fuels Mr Hollande says a climate agreement ""means giving up 80 per cent of the fossil energy resources that are still at our disposal"".It is as if there were two distinct processes: the plodding negotiations, for which Ms Figueres has overall responsibility, and a gathering wave of global opinion, encouraged by religious leaders, NGOs and social media.More than 40,000 delegates will attend COP 21, and the 12-day conference will doubtless resemble Woodstock more than the Congress of Vienna. Already, many of the events have an all-embracing, warm and fuzzy feel to them. President Hollande's Summit of Conscience included a speech by a representative of the International Confucian Ecological Alliance, an exercise in meditation by a Buddhist nun and a classical concert by Israeli and Palestinian youths.""We're convinced that the challenges presented by climate change cannot be effectively met by states alone, but mainly through individual and collective mobilisation, today and for years to come,"" the representatives of the six main religions in France wrote to Mr Hollande on July 1st.But will it be enough to stop the seemingly inexorable warming of our planet? Mr Hollande says global warming constitutes a ""crisis of civilisation"" and a ""crisis of meaning"". France, he adds, ""is a country . . . which sometimes opens new paths. I think that in December 2015, as in 1789 when the French Revolution produced immense hope in the world, the history of the world can be written in Paris.""\l"

At the publication of its pre-election submission designed to focus politicians' attention on the estimated 250,000 farming votes, the association leadership said communities urgently needed to feel the issue was being addressed. The document focuses on other key issues in the agricultural sector including reversal of cuts to disadvantaged areas, stronger Common Agricultural Policy budgets and bolstering ""fair and viable"" commodity prices. ""It's almost unacceptable now to arrive after dark into a strange house, and to arrive at houses that are locked,"" he said. ""That's such a change in rural Ireland's society in the last 10 years. There is a requirement for government to give a reassurance to people that this is being addressed.""Mr O'Leary said there was a perception in rural Ireland, ""particularly among older people, that they are not secure anymore"".Recent statistics show the increase in burglary rates since 2007 have applied in the main to urban areas. Nevertheless, IFA national chairman Jer Bergin said it was ""clearly a huge, huge issue, particularly over the last couple of years"".""Clearly, [there is] demand on the legislation side for stiffer sentences, more direct action by the criminal justice system to deal with repeat offenders,"" he said. ""Whether that's tagging, whether that's more consecutive sentences, all those sort of areas [should be considered] to keep people who are repeat offenders away from rural Ireland.""In other areas, the IFA is pushing for annual expenditure of EUR 580 million, from national and EU funding sources, on farm schemes; the reversal of cuts to disadvantaged areas; and EUR 250 million for the low-carbon, agri-environment or Glas scheme. Robust defence In the aftermath of the recent COP21 environmental conference in Paris, the association said the next D\'e1il must pitch a ""robust defence"" of Ireland's interests in trade policy and climate change negotiations.

"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland130","Given our history, we must play our part to tackle migrant crisis","December 19, 2015 Saturday","Irish Independent","NOUR is six and she has a cleft palette. Her three younger siblings and their parents were living in Aleppo up until recently. They travelled to Turkey so Nour could be operated on. The operation was not a success so the family decided to head to Germany for treatment. When I spoke to them near the train station in Izmir they had just arrived in town and were beginning to have discussions with the many smugglers that can be found in the back streets of Turkey's third-biggest city.As we chatted, the children suddenly looked up at the sound of a jet passing overhead. In Aleppo, planes spell danger.Sick Are they refugees? Not really.Surprisingly, they intend to return to Aleppo once the treatment is complete. Perhaps you could say they are medical migrants. Looking at it from their point of view, they would not seek asylum in Germany if there was a temporary protection they could avail of to obtain medical care for a sick child.We spoke to Ahmed, whose family had fled from an area near Tartous in Syria and had made a number of attempts to cross to Greece. One attempt had resulted in them capsizing on exposed rock and spending the night there before being returned to Izmir by the Turkish coast guard.Again they were heading for Germany and it is their intention to go back to Syria as soon as possible.Abu Mohammed, also from Aleppo, has settled his family in Germany and is in Izmir working with refugees for the Turkish Red Crescent. He was arrested and tortured by the Assad regime, having been part of the early peaceful protests. Abu Mohammed has no intention of moving back to Aleppo now. He and his family have obtained refugee status in Germany, though he has a job and safety in Turkey. His wife arrived in Germany with false papers through a smuggling route.Finally, I went to a place an hour's drive outside Izmir used by smugglers to launch their dinghies.The road ran out so we parked up and made our way across some scrubland towards, where we thought the beach might be. In the distance, people started to emerge from the bushes. Maybe 500 people were coming from the beach to be fed by a local Turkish voluntary group. These were all Iranians and Afghanis. Too poor to stay in hostels in town, they were sleeping out in the open, waiting for their turn to embark on the short journey to Greece which could be seen just 7 km away. Some had been there for weeks. We continued on to the beach.People ask me if the things I see working for GOAL are sometimes harrowing. Sometimes it's the things you don't see that stay with you.The beach was empty but was strewn with the personal effects of the families that had begun their journey to Europe from here. Kids' shoes and clothes, backpacks and torn life-jackets were thrown everywhere. The smugglers order the passengers to ditch all unnecessary items to lighten the load.It was here that six Afghan children had drowned the previous weekend.Afghanis have a much better chance of obtaining refugee status than Iranians. Yet they all mixed together here - all leaving behind grinding poverty and risking everything for a brighter future.Not being refugees, these Iranians must, according to standard definitions, be migrants. There is no internationally accepted definition of a migrant but the term is quaintly understood to cover cases where the decision to leave is taken for reasons of ""personal convenience"" and ""without intervention of an external compelling factor"".The grinding poverty they had left behind apparently doesn't count.It is these grey areas between refugee status and migration that the international system is not geared towards. There are two key agencies in this area. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) deals with those fleeing conflict while the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) deals with migrants. It is clear that the majority of populations on the move do not fit neatly into these two categories.The UN system needs to be more flexible to account for this complexity.A gobal summit is required to address these institutional issues and the issues of categorisation. A summit is required to contextualise the issue of solidarity. Only a global, multilateral approach based on the principle of solidarity has any hope of succeeding.Safe zone GOAL has argued for two years for a protected humanitarian safe zone in Syria. The failure to provide such relief has been a major contributor to the current crisis. This is an example of the kind of approach a global summit could address.However, lumping migrants and refugees together is not recommended - instead, we need to recognise that each journey has many and complex motivations.There are climate migrants, medical migrants, conflict migrants and many others on the move. There are the residents of Za£tari camp in Lebanon, who are not likely to go anywhere for a very long time. They and so many others like them are neither one thing nor the other.Ireland, of course, can play a role. Our history must inform a robust ethical approach as far as large movements of population are concerned, without having to ignore considerations of security, the integrity of sovereign borders and integration. Ireland's multi-lateralism has been under intense scrutiny lately both at the COP21 climate change conference and in the context of our corporate tax regime. The Government sought a permission slip at COP21 to resile from the principle of global solidarity in favour of narrow self-interest.A strong position on migration might conceivably serve as a counter-balance.Barry Andrews, GOAL'S chief executive, has just returned from Izmir.

I listened to a 'man-made climate change' alarmist on Newstalk radio today, when being interviewed about the COP21 Climate Change Political 'junket' taking place in Paris as I write.World leaders are making speeches to exhort a reduction in CO2 emissions (I refuse to call the phenomenon 'carbon emissions'.) She spoke the usual rhetoric of these people warning us plebs about the many possible effects of socalled 'climate change' if we don't change our wasteful-energy ways - sooner rather than later.She said that in the past ten years 'extreme climate events' were taking place every two years, when they used to take place every 20 years.I could hardly believe the woman when she said: 'Unless we do something, the sea levels will rise by two to three metres before the end of this century.' I was brought up in the small fishing village of Passage East, Co. Waterford in the south-east of Ireland. Passage was founded by the Vikings more than 1000 years ago and built on a sandbank of the River Suir, situated about seven miles from the Atlantic Ocean (aka. Celtic Sea).Back in the 1950s and 60s, I remember the village being flooded several times, up to a metre of water above the quays, during high spring tides (the flooding usually coincided with the spring or autumn Equinox and a strong south-easterly gale.) At one time the sea level reached the doorstep of the house where I lived, in Dobbyn Street, which is one of the highest streets of the lowlying village.On two occasions in the early 1960s our then-secondary school (Waterpark College in Waterford City) was inundated by those floods, when the river level exceeded the height of the sea wall that was protecting the school on Park Road, so much that classes had to be cancelled for that day at least.Nothing has been done since then to protect the school, and as far as I know, the river and sea level never reached those heights since. Fifty Years of my life have passed in the meantime. Surely, if the low-lying islands of the Pacific are to be flooded under water, Passage East will have become a home for the fishes long before then? So much for predicting sea levels rising three metres in the next 85 years.TOM BALDWIN, Midleton, Co. Cork.\l"

As the country rapidly develops, the use of air-conditioning has become increasingly prevalent, leading to the running joke that Malaysia has two seasons: indoors and outdoors. A more accurate description would include the annual monsoons, which provide the country with the rainfall necessary for agriculture, particularly the water-loving rice that grows in the fields around my house.The National Hydraulic Research Institute of Malaysia reports a marked increase in rainfall intensity in the past 40 years, with a rise in temperatures of 0.6-1.2 degrees during the same period. Flooding is the new norm in many parts of the country, further exacerbated by rampant deforestation, due to vast tracts of virgin rainforest being converted into palm oil and rubber plantations. The worst floods on record occurred last year in Kelantan state, with tens of thousands of people forced to evacuate their homes. Almost a year later, many of these flood victims are still living in temporary accommodation. Other parts of the country face annual water rationing. It is not uncommon for the air force to carry out cloud-seeding in the hope of provoking rainfall to fill reservoirs.For the past two decades, Malaysia has had a new season: the ""haze"". Smoke from fires, set to clear land for palm oil plantations in Indonesia, is carried by prevailing winds across the Straits of Malacca. Langkawi, where I live, is usually spared the worst, but this year was exceptionally bad: visibility last month dropped to a few hundred metres and the smell of smoke filled the air.Respiratory problems are rife. Schools and even airports closed temporarily. Tourism was affected, with thousands of tourists stranded on Langkawi and thousands more forced to cancel their bookings. That Malaysia is one of only two countries in the ASEAN that has yet to submit INDC pledges for the COP21 speaks volumes about the importance it accords to climate change. But this is unsurprising, with an economy largely based on oil, gas, timber, palm oil and rubber, all of which have powerful lobbying influences on governmental policies.\l"

The North Atlantic anomaly started more than a year ago, but what is causing it is not known, said Gerald Fleming head of forecasting at Met \'c9ireann.

So the deal at Ankara commits the UN's members, albeit on a voluntary basis, to restore or rehabilitate at least that area every year, just to keep things from getting worse.This target had already been endorsed in the Sustainability Development Goals agreed by the UN General Assembly last September. The UNCCD decision, however, marks a significant advance in that it sets in motion a framework whereby this target might be achieved.It also marks an expansion in the role of the UNCCD. The agency had previously focused on attempting to counter the rapid degradation of productive drylands (""desertification""), especially in Africa. It will now also actively promote and assist land degradation neutrality in non-arid areas across the world.""That is the fundamental change that has taken place,"" UNCCD executive secretary Monique Barbut told The Irish Times after the meeting.Not everyone agreed with this interpretation. Francisco Barreto Campello, the leader of the Brazilian delegation, who had opposed any extension of the UNCCD's role, insisted on Friday evening that the convention would remain limited to drylands, in l"

He will say the Government is preparing a National Mitigation Plan to achieve that. The Government's controversial stance on agriculture, for which it has made a special case, has drawn criticism from environmental organisations. For its part, the Government has said Irish agriculture is among the most sustainable in the world.Another aspect on which the Government approach has been criticised has been climate finance. Until last year Ireland was one of only four developed countries that had made no contribution to the Green Climate Fund, along with Australia, Belgium and Austria.In the budget a sum of EUR 2 million was allotted for 2016 but no firm commitments were made for subsequent years. There were expectations that Mr Kenny would include a concrete pledge of further specific funding to this fund for 2017 and 2018 and beyond. Such a commitment would have required a memo to Cabinet. However, sources say Labour and Fine Gael Ministers could not agree on the matter, and the issue never made it to Cabinet.Mr Kenny will reference the EUR 2 million contribution in 2016 and say it is part of a process with a view to building up Ireland's support over the coming years. It is not known if he will specify any figures.He is also expected to say the Government is examining how private finance can be used to help contribute to the goals.\l"
"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland137","Swedish report urges EU to halve its meat consumption to meet eco goals","February 29, 2016 Monday","Irish Examiner","Swedish scholars David Bryngelsson and Stefan Wirsenius have published a report which suggests EU citizens should be pushed to eat poultry and pork, whose husbandry produces significantly less greenhouse gas emissions.The report s authors suggest people will not have to cut out meat altogether, but will have to be more selective in their diet.They state that producing 1kg of protein from dairy results in emissions four times greater than for an equivalent amount of poultry.The report, How Can The EU Climate Targets Be Met? A Combined Analysis of Technological and Demand-Side Changes In Food and Agriculture , was published in the February issue of Food Policy journal. Cuts, by 50% or more, in ruminant meat (beef and mutton) consumption are, most likely, unavoidable if the EU targets are to be met, the report states. Emissions from manure storage can all but be eliminated if the facilities are covered and waste gases are flared (burned off). But reducing the amount of food thrown away only cuts emissions from food and agriculture by 5%-10%. The Swedish study takes into account commitments made by the EU at the COP21 sustainable innovation forum in Paris in December.The EU is seeking a 20% cut in greenhouse gas emissions (versus 1990 levels); to generate 20% of all EU energy from renewables; and to achieve 20% more energy efficiency.The researchers at Chalmers University of Technology and Sweden s Technical Research Institute focused their report on GHG emissions from agriculture.They stated that farming contributes to 10% of the total EU s greenhouse gas emissions.This is largely down to two greenhouse gases: Methane from livestock digestion and stored animal manure; and nitrous oxide from organic and mineral nitrogen fertilisers.The report says emissions from the production of fertilisers can be halved if factories used the latest technologies. As a first step, they advise farmers to cover over all manure containers.The production of livestock and fodder globally generates more than three billion tonnes each of carbon dioxide equivalent.In 2014, according to Eurostat data, Germany, Spain, France and the United Kingdom had the highest number of livestock.The largest number of pigs was recorded in Germany and Spain (28.3 and 26.6 million animals respectively); cows in France (19.3 million head) and sheep (23.0 million head) in the UK.The Irish Cattle and Sheep Association has suggested that enhanced supports for forestry and energy crops such as miscanthus would encourage farmers to move some of their focus out of livestock.The ICSA suggests these improved grants could lead to a 5% reduction in the share of land use devoted to livestock in Ireland.\l"

Next year, it will seek lessonerous targets for the sector, pleading we are a special case.His comments may have played well among some, but they showed that the Taoiseach is no statesman, but a local politician pandering to his constituents.As was noted on twitter, it seems all global eco-politics are local.Reaction was tinged with a sense of disbelief that the Taoiseach was in effect telling the world's poorest that Ireland - a first-world developed nation - was too cashstrapped to help address a problem which would profoundly impact upon those least able to cope.""We're probably going to be dragged (into this) kicking and screaming,"" Trocaire's executive director Eamonn Meehan said, criticising the lack of leadership.Satirical website Waterford Whispers News didn't hold back in a sketch about the Fine Gael leader needing surgery to remove his head from a certain part of his anatomy.The article helpfully noted that the condition of ""Headious Up Arsesus"" left the afflicted ""unable to perform basic tasks like putting the health of the nation and its environment ahead of a few farmers who might not vote for him if he pushes for a reduction in agri-sector pollution.""It's abundantly clear as to why farmers were being addressed by Mr Kenny in his conference speech, and not the global community.With Fine Gael hovering at around 30pc in the opinion polls, and Labour lagging between 7pc and 9pc, the coalition is facing into a difficult General Election and needs every vote it can muster.The powerful farming lobby will play a huge role in the formation of the next government, hence the 'not at any cost' l"

""Some countries believe 2C is too much as it will affect their climate too much.""The agreement also involves the European Commission providing (EURO)475m in funding to support climate action between now and 2020 in the ACP countries which includes eight from Africa, 16 from the Caribbean and 15 from the Pacific.EU Climate Action and Energy Commissioner Miguel Arias Ca\'f1ete urged other countries to join the bloc to help reach an agreement.""These negotiations are not about them and us,"" he said.

"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland140","Call for EU scrappage schemes to reduce emissions","December 2, 2015 Wednesday","The Irish Times","Europe's car makers are saying that they have done more to reduce emissions than any other single sector. They are also calling for another round of ""scrappage"" schemes to encourage motorists to trade-in for newer, cleaner vehicles. In a statement issued at the COP21 climate change talks in Paris, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA), the umbrella group which represents the European car industry, points out that new cars make up only around three per cent of the EU's car park, and that the average vehicle age in the EU is now 10-years-old and rising. The ACEA suggests that a further 30 per cent reduction in fleet emissions could be achieved simply by getting drivers into newer cars.The powerful lobby group said that ""last year, average new car CO2 emissions were 33.7 per cent lower than two decades ago; by 2021, CO2 emissions from new cars will be almost 42 per cent lower than in 2005.""""Europe's automobile manufacturers have been driving down greenhouse gas emissions by developing ever-more fuel-efficient vehicles. Even when faced with flat or declining sales during recent crisis years, the EU automobile sector has delivered huge environmental improvements, and will continue to do so"" said the ACEA. ""The European automobile and parts industry is the continent's number one investor in R&D, spending EUR 41.5 billion on innovation each year. As a result, the average new car coming on to the road in 2021 will produce 42 per cent less CO2 per km than a new car bought in 2005. No other industry has done as much as Europe's automotive sector to drive down CO2 emissions in recent years.""The ACEA goes on to say that it is, according to its figures, doing far more to achieve emissions reductions than other transport sectors, such as aviation and shipping. The lobby group is calling on EU and world governments to establish a common international framework for the future of vehicle CO2 emissions regulation, saying that a failure to do so will cost both jobs and investment. \l"
"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland141","Scientist backs tax on Ireland's food processors","December 12, 2015 Saturday","Irish Independent","ONE of the country's leading climate scientists has said a carbon tax on food processors will have to be considered if Ireland wants to expand its agriculture sector.Professor John Sweeney of Maynooth University said motorists and householders already paid carbon taxes on fuels, and that unless the agrifood sector was taken into a similar system it would be difficult to reduce emissions.His comments came as talks on striking a global deal to tackle climate change went right down to the wire, with a final draft agreement expected early this morning.It hoped almost 200 nations at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) will agree to the text, and reduce emissions while limiting average global temperature rises to no more than 2C.Prof Sweeney, who was part of the UN team awarded the Nobel Prize for its research on climate change, said while the proposed deal had many positive aspects, it would require countries to be more ambitious. He also said if the Government wanted to expand the beef and dairy sectors, a carbon tax on food would have to be considered.While the Government hoped to get special treatment from the EU for the agriculture sector at negotiations next year, with our growing economy it would be hard to argue we could not afford to make cuts.""Our GDP is growing, so I don't expect to see any special favours,"" he said. ""It will be incumbent for every country to carry their share of the burden. I can't see how agriculture will escape. I think the food companies have to come into the net. I don't see Ireland getting special treatment for agriculture, in the same way that Germany won't get it for cars and Poland for coal.""Motorists pay a carbon tax for their cars, and householders pay it for fuel bills, but there's no carbon tax for agriculture. I would see the food companies, and not the farmers, being brought into the net there. If you're buying 100 litres of milk, and carbon has a price per tonne, they would pay on that.""You need something to reduce emissions. It may have been feasible to increase dairy if you got rid of the suckler cow herd under Food Harvest 2020, but under Foodwise 2025 that proposal is gone and we will have 300,000 extra dairy cows.""All parties must agree the text before it can be ratified, meaning if agreement cannot be struck, the Paris Climate Summit will be deemed a failure.\l"

Organisers hope that, by bringing ordinary citizens to a table previously dominated by bureaucrats and lobbyists, they can help break the long-running deadlock in UN talks to find a successor to the Kyoto Protocol.WWViews says its day-long event - held from dawn in Fiji to dusk in Arizona - is neither a campaign nor is it about telling people what they should think on climate change.""It is about asking them what they think and about making an effort to involve policy-makers and stakeholders in a dialogue about citizens' views,"" said Bj\'f6rn Bedsted of the Danish Board of Technology Foundation, global co-ordinator of the event and based in Copenhagen, scene of a UN climate conference debacle in 2009.Participants have been chosen to reflect the demographic diversity in their country or region and have received information packs detailing all sides of the debate on climate change and energy policy. They will watch identical introductory videos, debate the issues, and vote on identical questions.The conclusions will be collated and communicated to the June session of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) now under way in Bonn and to November's UN climate conference (COP21) in Paris.Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the UNFCCC, welcomed the WWViews debate as a ""unique engagement . . . on one of the greatest challenges of this generation"".""It is an important contribution to galvanising public understanding of what can often seem a highly complex topic, but one that goes to the heart of everyone's lives,"" she said.The event enjoys the direct support of French president Fran\'e7ois Hollande.Anticipating challenges from all camps, WWViews organisers say the information given to citizens has been vetted by a scientific advisory board for accuracy and balance.

The Irish people didn t vote for shame and that s what they ve got at the COP21 conference in Paris.What a national humiliation it was on Tuesday to hear our Taoiseach telling the assembled nations of Earth that the climate challenge requires action from countries big and small , before moving swiftly on to the voodoo which will lead to carbon neutrality in the land sector that does not compromise our capacity for food production .Then to hear his comments to Irish journalists off-piste that the 20% reductions in emissions by 2020 from 2005 levels an EU requirement to which the previous government committed were unrealistic and unreachable : We do not want to see a situation where we are limited in what we can produce with the abolition of quotas, to find that food is produced in countries with inferior standards and higher emission levels. Pardon the pun, but that s bull. Yes, we can reduce emissions per kilo of meat and dairy. But we also have to change our land use, our export patterns, and our eating habits or we will become the laughing stock of Europe to use a well-worn phrase. But we won t be laughing ourselves because we will be paying out billions in environmental fines.Airtricity founder Eddie O Connor hit the nail on the head yesterday when warning the Government against taking a sleeveen approach to the climate negotiations. He said we should not be seeking derogations which is exactly the negotiating position our Taoiseach talked up yesterday when he said that hard bargaining would take place over the coming weeks to make sure our goals were fair and reasonable .The insider word on what the Taoiseach means by fair is an emissions reduction of between 23% and 25% by 2030 as against Britain, France, and Germany, who will offer 40%. I don t know how you can possibly call that fair . It s precisely the me, me, me attitude which COP21 has seemed to overcome thus far in favour of the first stirrings of genuine global co-operation in world history.Generosity on a global scale will be needed if we are to survive with any comfort on this planet. We may be a small brick in the wall against climate change but if we fall we destabilise the structure, opening the door to more special pleading.It is grotesque to listen to Ireland, out with its begging bowl while over a billion people still live in extreme poverty, often greatly exacerbated by the climate effects of the carbon which the rich world emits. Even as the Government trumpets exchequer returns running 3bn ahead of target. Despite recent difficult economic circumstances , whined the Taoiseach, Ireland has committed 34m to help poor countries adapt to climate change in 2014, and is committed to scaling up this support to 175m to 2020. But this is not new money. It is money already committed to Irish Aid. Do the maths. Multiply the 34m to 2020 and you will see how much extra there is.The Taoiseach also announced that we would begin contributing to the global Green Climate Fund in 2016 with a princely donation of 2m for 2016 and no firm commitment to any other year when we need to contribute 45m to 2020 if we are to get to the European average.Some of this 2m is money which was put aside at the height of the recession by the last Government to purchase carbon credits which we did not need because our emissions went down. Our emissions went down for two reasons, according to the Environmental Protection Agency: Because of the recession and because of our increased use of renewable energy.Possibly the most outrageous thing the Taoiseach said in Paris and the competition is fierce was that our emissions had failed to decrease because of the recession. We have lost a decade of investment in our country because of what happened, he said. That cannot be recovered, and until we have an economic engine to allow us change structures and continue to invest in research and innovation for more sustainable ways of doing agriculture, that presents us with a challenge. Holy God, even I thought we d heard the last of It s not my fault, blame them .I certainly never imagined the recession would be blamed for increasing emissions when it was one of two reasons for decreased emissions. This is made clear by the fact that emissions are going up again under the Taoiseach s watch, with next to nothing being done to replace dirty energy with clean energy.The Government has locked us into 15 more years of burning peat in Edenderry, Loughrea, and Shannonbridge. By the time we have finished burning peat, there will be hardly any left, meaning it can t regenerate itself and can t act as a carbon sink . Meanwhile the burning of filthy coal continues unabated at Moneypoint.And it is only the tireless efforts of activists such as the Good Energy Alliance, Love Leitrim, and Friends of the Earth which are holding fracking at arm s length.Alex White, the natural resources minister, and the Environmental Protection Agency were questioned yesterday by the joint Oireachtas committee on transport and communications amid reports the Government s study on fracking has been compromised by links with the gas and oil industries.The desk research allowing fracking to begin is apparently almost complete. All that is missing is local research in Fermanagh, Leitrim, and Clare but thanks to local activism no tenders have yet been issued. Friends of the Earth s Kate Ruddock said yesterday that the study does not even concern itself with the impact of fracked fuel on the climate and our ability to meet our internationally agreed targets.We are on track to miss our 2020 emissions of a 20% reduction from 2005 levels, presenting instead a 5% reduction. The Government has no serious plan to reverse that trend.The people are marching and the nations are communing. Industry is dramatically shifting capital away from fossil fuels and towards clean, renewable energy , according to 350.org, which announced yesterday in Paris that more than 500 institutions representing $3.4 trillion in assets, including the cities of Oslo and Melbourne and Europe s largest insurance company, Allianz, have committed to massive divestment of fossil fuel interests.Meanwhile, we are shaping up to be the laggards of Europe, present-ing the elderly, conservative face of a sleeveen to the planet. And I don t believe that even we deserve that.\l"

What I want to see brought forward is something to show that Ireland is going to be ambitious and play its part, but it will be up to (future) governments to decide their allocations.""The minister said that today and tomorrow will be ""critical"" in determining whether the 21st Conference of the Parties () will be judged a success.Issues yet to be addressed included whether a deal would be legally-binding, which Mr Kelly said was ""completely and utterly necessary"".A ""level playing field"" was necessary, he added, with larger developing countries expected to play their part.But he said demands from NGOs that average global temperature rises be no more than 1.5C - and not 2C - are unlikely to be met. However, 1.5C could be a goal in the final text.Under current commitments, the emission cuts pledged by countries will only limit rises to 2.7C - well above the 2C considered a 'safe' limit.""The 1.5C is extremely ambitious but I think at a political level I'd be saying walk before we can run,"" Mr Kelly said. ""Let's try and achieve 2C, let's be ambitious with the 1.5C, but let's also ensure we have something everyone can sign up to and be realistic. I will be pushing for a reduction of below 2C.

"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland147","Inaction and lack of vision exposed; Climate change","March 10, 2016 Thursday","The Irish Times","The update this week by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on greenhouse gas emissions makes grim reading: Ireland is falling behind the 2020 targets for reductions agreed with the EU by as much as 50 per cent. The EPA is an independent body and its brief includes raising public awareness and advising on policy. It has never been noted for stridency. Indeed, some have accused it of being a watchdog that hardly ever barks. This makes its analysis of the position on climate change all the more disturbing. ""Current and planned policies and measures are not sufficient to meet the 2020 targets,"" the agency states baldly. It goes on to warn that this situation casts doubt ""over efforts to transition to a low-carbon economy in the long term"". The language is subdued but, on any reading, this report makes a mockery of the Taoiseach's call at the UN's COP21 meeting in Paris last December ""to provide lasting foundations for the preservation and sustainability"" of future generations. The outgoing Government's agenda in this area has been in practice the reverse of this admirable long-term vision. It devoted its energies to pursuing a short-term bonanza for the dairy industry after milk quotas were lifted; this despite the overwhelming evidence that the FoodWise 2025 policy of rapidly expanding dairy (and beef) production will put us further behind our emissions targets with every passing year.Likewise, there was no sign that the Government was willing to invest in transport initiatives to reduce dependence on private cars and fossil fuels. The current model of economic growth is again producing short-term jobs, but it needs to be radically reshaped and redirected if it is to lead towards - and not away from - the low-to-zero carbon future to which we supposedly aspire.The detail of the EPA report makes it clear that Ireland needs to be cutting emissions in the agriculture and transport sectors especially. Reductions in other sectors, like residential and commercial heating and the creation of increased carbon sinks through judicious forestry plantation, are welcome. But they do not come close to compensating for the drastically negative trend on our farms and on our roads.Given the linkage between climate change and recent storms and flooding, and the prospect of more to come, it is extraordinary that none of the four big political parties showed any awareness of the seriousness of this issue during the election campaign. If a vision including future generations is too much to expect from whatever government now emerges, perhaps the prospect of EU fines of EUR 60 million a year (and rising) from 2020 onwards for failing to meet emissions targets might concentrate its mind. This is a sad comment on the state of national politics on the centenary of the high-minded 1916 proclamation.\l"

"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland149","Pricing a key tool to encourage research into and use of carbon-neutral energy","December 1, 2015 Tuesday","The Irish Times","The UN conference on climate change that has just opened in Paris holds out the promise of a major step forward in tackling the huge problem of climate change. In the past, the problem was that only a limited number of countries, covering a minority of the world's population, was prepared to commit to action. This time, a majority of countries, covering the bulk of the world's population (and of its greenhouse gas emissions), acknowledge the importance of tackling the problem. The individual national commitments will not, on their own, halt global warming, but they represent a major step towards developing a successful worldwide response.The key to tackling global warming, which is caused by man-made emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily from energy, is to find energy sources that are ""clean"". While there are already opportunities to generate a significant part of our energy needs from clean sources, these are, as yet, very expensive. The implementation of a wide programme of renewable energy in Germany has added 6.5 cents per unit to the cost of electricity for households. While Germany is able to afford this cost, and the resulting negative impact on households' living standards and national competitiveness, it is not a solution that will be easily replicated elsewhere.This means that, even for rich countries, a switch to clean energy today could prove very expensive. For developing countries, at today's prices, such a switch could only occur at the expense of a serious reduction in already low living standards and future development.Cheap option However, the cost of clean energy has already fallen a long way from its exceptional level in the early 1990s, when the urgency of tackling climate change first appeared on the world's agenda. The key to finding a solution to the problem of climate change is to make clean energy the cheap option. If that goal can be achieved, emissions of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels will fall dramatically. A two-pronged strategy is required: first, invest public funds in research and development to bring down the cost of clean energy; second, raise the cost of pollution, reflecting the damage done to the environment, to encourage the necessary private sector investment.While technological development through research and innovation can potentially provide a solution, there is no guarantee that a particular investment programme will succeed. The EU, over a number of decades, has spent about EUR 10 billion of public money in the hunt for clean energy from nuclear fusion. However, to date this has proved to be something of a wild goose chase. This highlights the problems we face. It is likely that a very large budget will be needed to invest in the necessary research and development, representing a significant burden for taxpayers across the developed world. However, governments are not good at picking winning technologies. Probably the best approach is to move on many fronts simultaneously, experimenting with different technologies. In the case of Ireland, some of our public research budget is going on wave energy, in spite of the fact that it does not look likely to be economic in Ireland. However, because one cannot be certain about its economics, it is valid to allocate some of the limited research budget to this field.John Hicks was one of the leading economists of the 20th century, winning the Nobel Prize for economics in 1972. As early as 1932, he explained how raising the price of a good, such as energy, will induce successful research that will eventually reduce the need for that expensive factor. In the 1970s oil prices rocketed, causing major economic disruption to OECD economies. The result was a huge amount of research across the world by companies, large and small, into ways to save energy. A decade later this research paid off for many companies and consumers, resulting in a major increase in energy efficiency. The fuel efficiency of cars was dramatically increased in the 1980s, as was the efficiency of electricity generation. Innovation This shows that when prices rise, companies smell future profit from successful innovation. The bigger the market for that innovation the bigger the potential pay-off and the bigger the potential research effort by companies. Because the price of oil rose for the whole world, the potential pay-off from successful research was huge in the late 1970s. This example also shows that, instead of relying purely on taxpayer-funded research, the successful development of clean energy is likely to rely heavily on investment by the private sector.A decade ago the EU embarked on an ambitious programme to tackle climate change. Among other policies, it was intended that the cost of emitting greenhouse gases would rise substantially. Instead, the policy failed to raise the price of pollution as expected, disappointing investors in clean technologies. Clean energy Paris may well see a welcome worldwide substantial increase in government-funded investment in research into clean energy technologies. However, to be fully successful, the EU, and hopefully some other major trading blocs, will need to take effective measures to raise the cost of emitting greenhouse gases. Higher prices will discourage us from using polluting energy and, in addition, as Hicks suggested, it will signal to private sector investors that there is a lot of money to be made from saving the planet. The medium-term cost of this strategy will obviously be higher costs for households. In the long term, however, if cheap, clean technologies are developed, future generations, whether in Ireland or the developing world, will benefit from cheaper clean energy. It could also save the planet from global warming.\l"

The debate has become intense as the government has pursued plans to deprive convicted terrorists of French nationality.Paris attracted the biggest march as 5,500 protesters, according to a police estimate, went from the Republic square through central Paris. The organisers said 20,000 joined the Paris protest. Smaller marches took place in Toulouse and Marseille as part of protests planned in 70 towns. I think it s more than dangerous, the extension of the state of emergency, said Alexandra Scappaticci, one of the protesters in Paris. It has already been used during the COP 21 (climate talks) to lock down demonstrators who had nothing to do with terrorism, so I think that if it is extended, I don t know what more they could use it for, but in any case, it will not prevent terrorism. The Socialist government has the backing of most French people for the emergency measures and the wider use of nationality-stripping, opinion polls show.But it has angered some left-wing political allies, and justice minister Christiane Taubira, who had deep reservations about the reforms, resigned last week.\l"

"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland154","Irish energy policy and climate change","December 7, 2015 Monday","The Irish Times","Sir, - I have observed and participated closely in the Irish energy and climate change debate over recent years and am heartened to see the rise in associated discussion in The Irish Times, particularly as a result of the COP21 climate change summit in Paris. As a scientist, citizen and father, I see the protection of our planet for future generations as our shared number one priority. However, our national energy policy is a shambles and shows no signs of improving through the soon to be published White Paper on energy. Major vested interests continue to have the most influential voices.The Department of Energy and successive governments remain convinced that using wind energy almost exclusively as our renewable energy source is the best path forward. However, the Environmental Protection Agency clearly reported in 2013 that even if we achieve our nominal target of 40 per cent electricity through renewable sources by 2020, that we will achieve less than half of our corresponding greenhouse gas emissions reduction target.As New ScientistWhat the powerful wind energy lobby endeavours to keep quiet is that the variability and intermittency of wind energy, in addition to lack of viable energy storage solutions, result in the need for our fossil fuel-based energy plants to run in cycling mode in the background for when there is either too much or too little wind. This inefficiency results in only a marginal reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, when using wind energy as the primary renewable energy source.The obvious starting point for us nationally and globally is energy usage reduction and not expansion of energy generation. This approach saves money, reduces greenhouse gas emissions and actually creates jobs, such as retrofitting buildings to reduce energy needs.Every citizen in this country needs to get the unspun facts and contribute to the energy and climate change discussion. It's critical to our future. - Yours, etc,DARYL KENNEDY, PhDCo Westmeath.Sir, - Your editorial of December 5th on the climate change conference in Paris rightly highlights the fact that the rhetoric of the conference ""must give way to action"" to curb global warming. An Taisce finds fault with the fact that Ireland is seeking an exemption for agriculture. It advocates that Ireland shut down its beef production in large areas of the country and convert the land to forestry.Your editorial says that instead of asking for major cuts in agriculture, the alternative could be to ""make meaningful commitments . . . on eliminating peat and coal-burning power plants and on fossil fuel extraction, including fracking"".As any action is going to have a big impact on the livelihoods of many Irish people, this debate is going to get much more attention in the years ahead.Decisions on what actions are necessary are not going to be easy. - Yours, etc,A LEAVY,Sutton, Dublin 13.\l"
"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland155","Motorists could cut CO2 emissions by up to 70%; More than 300 low-emission models available, says climate change scientist","March 10, 2016 Thursday","The Irish Times","Irish motorists could help cut transport carbon emissions in Ireland by 70 per cent over 10 years by choosing one of more than 300 models of car, according to a leading climate scientist. Prof Kevin Anderson, of the University of Manchester, also said retrofitting the State's housing stock over 15 years would eliminate fuel poverty, which affects between 200,000 and 300,000 homes. And introducing stringent efficiency standards on electrical equipment would also contribute to a significant reduction in energy demand.The professor of energy and climate change was speaking at the Institute of International and European Affairs in Dublin on the achievements and failures following the Conference of Parties (COP21) climate change summit in Paris in December.Prof Anderson had earlier given a private briefing on climate change to President Michael D Higgins, along with Prof Barry McMullin of DCU, who is chairman of An Taisce's climate committee.The two men briefed the President at \'c1ras an Uachtar\'e1in after Mr Higgins had expressed interest in an update on climate issues.'Complete and abject failure' Speaking at the institute, Prof Anderson said everything needed to be known about climate change and how to mitigate its effects was known 25 years ago but, in the interim, carbon emissions had risen by more than 60 per cent and that was ""a quarter century of complete and abject failure"". He said there was no chance of keeping temperature rises to 1.5 degrees and only ""an outside chance"" of meeting the 2 degree target. It would require a 10 per cent reduction in emissions year on year from this year. He also said Ireland should have a moratorium on hydrocarbon developments, including fracking. ""If we're serious about climate change - no shale gas, no offshore oil or gas for Ireland."" Road transport Speaking about transport emissions, he said in the EU and US private road transport was responsible for 12-15 per cent of emissions. However, there were now more than 300 models of petrol and diesel cars with less than 100g of CO2/km, and ""they have no price premium. They look like normal cars,"" he said. ""They fit every normal category except for the sports SUV vehicles."" He estimated the average car in Ireland used 170g of C02/km and the average car being sold produced 130-140g of C02/km, because of the EU requirement for cars to average 130g, which was still ""way above the average of cars available"". This figure did not include hybrid or electric cars.He said a move towards models with less than 100g of CO2/km would result in a 70 per cent reduction in transport-sector emissions. ""That's all you require - but we're not even bothered to do that.""Prof Anderson also said retrofitting homes would greatly cut energy demands. Retrofitting every home in Ireland would cost an average of EUR 40,000, amounting to EUR 48 billion over 15 years, or EUR 3 billion a year, equivalent to 1.3 per cent of GDP.\l"

Government ministers begin high-level talks in Paris today on the 48-page draft accord completed on Saturday evening at the summit. Among those in Paris to participate in what are seen as difficult negotiations are US secretary of state John Kerry and Ireland's Minister for the Environment Alan Kelly.Minister for Communications and Energy Alex White will also attend the venue at Le Bourget today for 'Energy Day'.Delivering his homily in the Vatican yesterday, the pope said: ""What kind of world do we want to pass on to those who come after us, to the children who are growing up?"" He said every effort should be made in Paris to mitigate the impact of climate change, as well as tackling ""poverty and [letting] human dignity flourish."" Urgent plea The UN secretary general Mr Ban said yesterday that he was confident an ambitious agreement could be reached. ""I am urging member states to look beyond their national boundaries. Climate change does not respect national boundaries. It impacts all throughout the world and, therefore, we have to have a global vision, global solidarity. ""The sea level is rising. Global temperatures are warming. This year, 2015, is the warmest year in human history. Therefore, there is no time to lose. We need to take action now.""The week-long technical talks culminated with the publication of the draft on Saturday night. There was general agreement of much greater progress than at a similar stage of the Copenhagen talks six years ago. However, many central issues have not been resolved. There are still a few hundred brackets (representing contested text) in the document.""The crunch issues are still to be decided. Ministers will be arriving on Monday and those crunch issues will come down to the wire,"" said Dr Diarmuid Torney, an expert on climate change policy from DCU who is attending the summit.He said these included the debate over what should be the maximum average increase in global temperatures: 1.5 degrees or 2 degrees Celsius.""There is differentiation, which is how developed and richer countries should act compared to less developed countries. There is the question of transparency. That's how countries report on their issues and whether or not other countries can trust the statistics.""Dr Torney said future ambition and finance were other huge areas of contention. In particular there remains a massive shortfall in the annual EUR 100 billion sought from richer countries towards funding mitigation in poorer counties.Before his arrival Mr Kelly addressed criticisms of Ireland's approach to climate change.

Enviro....","December 12, 2015 Saturday","Irish Independent","One storm doesn't mean our climate has irrecoverably changed, but the events of the past week certainly paint an apocalyptic picture of a future ravaged by extreme weather events.Storm Desmond has caused utter devastation across large parts of the country, with householders, businesses and ultimately the Government facing a massive clean-up bill. And the science tells us we should get used to more of the same - extreme winter-weather events, coupled with summer droughts - which will become more frequent as climate change takes hold.It highlights the great dilemma facing every nation across the globe - Governments get elected by promising to grow the economy, but that growth comes at an environmental cost.The Coalition is committed to reducing emissions over time and the weather events of the past week are yet another example of why we need to.However, half the population remain unconvinced that climate change is a serious issue requiring urgent attention. Could Storm Desmond be the catalyst to change the minds of that 50pc and make them begin to sit up and take notice? We are not alone in displaying an unwillingness to address climate change, believing it's a problem for future generations.The latest Eurobarometer survey shows a slight drop in the number of people across the EU who believe it is the single most serious problem facing humanity. Just one in four believes they have personal responsibility for tackling it. That's borne out in the comments made by almost 150 heads of state gathered in Paris for the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21).But behind the rhetoric lay cold, hard electoral politics, exemplified by Taoiseach Enda Kenny, who told the UN climate summit that while all countries had to play their part, Ireland would not jeopardise its economic recovery and tackle agriculture emissions in the near future.He was clearly courting the votes of 140,000 farming families in the run-up to next year's General Election, but he wasn't alone in speaking out of both sides of his mouth. The world's biggest emitter, China - which this week raised warnings about air pollution to their highest level - is seen as likely to support a weak deal, despite making all the right noises during the plenary.India has genuine concerns about its economic growth being curtailed, and while the US is committed to an ambitious deal, it's worth noting that Barack Obama is on his way out of office.Back in 2009, at COP15 in Copenhagen, when he was less than a year in the White House, Obama's administration was widely seen as scuppering an ambitious agreement due in part to domestic opposition. There's still the very real prospect of Congress refusing to ratify any deal. But the inaction to date flies in the face of science. Climate change is already happening, despite what sceptics would have us believe. Even oil-rich country Saudi Arabia accepts this.Average temperatures in Ireland and across the globe are up almost 1\'b0 C this century. Last winter was the stormiest on record. Some of the highest global temperatures on record have been seen in the last decade, with 2015 looking like being the hottest ever.We are experiencing more frequent flooding, and it's going to get worse. Research from the University of Oxford also suggests that greenhouse gas emissions released to date have increased the likelihood of winter storms by as much as 25pc. It's no longer a question of 'if' but 'when' the worst effects become a feature of our weather. And therein lies the problem. How do you mitigate against further change, while allowing economies to grow? The costs of tackling warming are put at less than 1pc of global GDP, an enormous amount but not that much in the grander scheme of things.The costs of inaction will be far higher, as nations spend billions installing flood defences and replacing damaged infrastructure, dealing with food poverty and coping with climate refugees forced to flee their homes.Fewer cars on the road mean less fossil fuels are burnt, improving air quality and public health. Less traffic means less wear and tear and lower road-maintenance costs, and money for other public services.We need to focus on what we're good at, and look at where we could improve. We're good at producing food sustainably, but we don't debate the fact that 30,000 farms have an output of less than (EURO)4,000 a year - could these farmers, many part-time, be encouraged to move away from beef and dairy to forestry or biomass, for example? Our focus on renewables is helping reduce emissions, but many communities are opposed. What policies can be enacted to encourage take up? A stake in projects? Limiting a wind farm's lifespan to 20 years? Or should we continue to send money to oil and gas-rich nations, many with dubious records on human rights? We have made positive strides towards energy efficiency, and our domestic retro-fitting programme has cut heating bills and created jobs.But we could be doing more, particularly on public buildings, which would give the Government more money for public services.We must also ask if we really need to change the car, or upgrade the television, when the old one works perfectly well? We throw away as much as 30pc of the food we buy - not only a waste of money but a waste of the water, fertilisers and feed required to produce that food.Growing the economy and reducing emissions appear to be mutually exclusive goals, in the short to medium-term at least.But the trick is to achieve growth with the least environmental HYPERLINK http://www.impact.Nowww.impact.No one is suggesting that growth be curbed or farmers forced off the land.What is being suggested is a bit of wit and ambition to help reduce risk, otherwise Ireland faces being left behind as the world moves to a low-carbon future.An interesting study was published during COP21, which asked the UK public how much they were willing to pay to fight climate change.The study, published in the Journal of Environmental Economics and Policy, revealed not very much, about \£327 a year, which researchers said amounted to no more than the cost of a year's stamps. Among the reasons? ""A belief that climate change is caused by nature allows some people to absolve themselves of responsibility toward those who will be negatively impacted by climate change,"" they wrote.It is nature that is the cause of problems for so many families this weekend. That in itself should give pause for thought and reflection on what is happening to our planet and our seeming unwillingness to do anything about it.How do you mitigate against further change, while still allowing economies to grow?\l"

We need to break away from a destructive relationship with the diversity that is life on our planet towards a new paradigm of existence, one that will be built on the respect we must have for the wonderment and renewal of nature, the President said.President Higgins was in Paris to attend the Summit of Consciences for the Climate.The day-long conference was designed to raise awareness of the threat from climate change ahead of the COP21 conference on climate change in Paris in December.Other attendees invited included ex-UN secretary-general Kofi Annan, former president Mary Robinson, religious leaders and ex-California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.In a direct appeal, President Higgins said there had to be inclusive, humane and non-judgmental engagement with the voices of those most affected by climate change. We must begin with an acceptance of the evidence of science. It is now clear that failure to respond to the scientific reality of climate change may ultimately lead to the destruction of life on our planet, said President Higgins. We must therefore unequivocally reject the position of those who would obscure the scientific reality of climate change in their protection of any narrow and short-term self-interest. The first ethical test is in accepting that there can be no compromise with truth. Despite warning about the threat posed to the planet, Mr Higgins also said there is cause for optimism. I perceive among the populations of the world, and especially among the young, a search for beauty and a yet retained sense of awe at the harmony of nature. Among the elders of the planet, there is also a respect for the potential of the inherited wisdom of the world to inform institutions and policies in new circumstances. President Higgins also asked if succeeding in tackling climate change would not be the greatest of all human achievements. When history records the actions we take or fail to take at this our moment of truth, we will not have the excuse that we did not understand, that we did not know, he said. We have been gifted, in a global communications order, with the knowledge and the opportunity to act. President Higgins also suggested world s leaders should look to the example set after the Second World War, while he also attacked the rampant consumerism in many countries.

Simon Kuper had suggested in the Financial Times that lessons could be learned from ""the improbably successful gay marriage campaign"": keep the message positive, immediate and, crucially, not too liberal. The exhibition, which will tour in Ireland in 2016, takes its title from a Lemn Sissay poem: ""what if our wanting more was making less? / And what if all of this wasn't progress?"" This sets the tone for a show that deliberately avoids polemic, in which the work of 19 artists flirts with questions of nature versus culture, climate change, the meaning of progress and our undoing of the natural world.

From Dublin to Darwin, the effects of climate change are being felt in a very real way and will only get worse if we do nothing to halt or reverse it.There are low-lying islands in the Indian Ocean that face being wiped out by flooding if global temperatures continue to rise.As an island nation, Ireland is also vulnerable.Almost 10 years ago, a report by the Environmental Research Centre warned climate change would lead to a rise in sea levels and consequent coastal flooding as well as an increase in river flooding and more extreme cyclonic and precipitation events.All of the above have already happened, yet in the past decade we have done little or nothing to address the cause.That is why COP21, the UN summit on global climate change being held in Paris, is relevant to us all and not just the political elite gathered there.The last such summit was held in Copenhagen in 2009 and failed to deliver any meaningful or lasting changes.No firm targets, timetables or enforcement mechanisms for cutting carbon emissions were put in place.Copenhagen failed because no real pressure was put on the world s leaders to come to an agreement, particularly when it meant facing down the fossil fuel industry.Paris might be different if only because, for the first time, tackling climate change has become a mass issue, with ordinary people taking to the streets to compel their governments to act.Tens of thousands yesterday joined one of the biggest global days of climate change activism to put pressure on world leaders to unite in fighting global warming at the Paris summit.Ireland was among 70 countries worldwide where marches took place to call for action on climate change, with rallies taking place in Dublin, Belfast, Cork, and Galway.What is happening in the streets may prove more important than what happens in the conference halls.The Paris summit will need to deliver far more than the Copenhagen summit did. It is little exaggeration to say that a robust treaty is all that stands between us and mass extinction.The real danger associated with global warming is how rapidly it is happening, faster than any climate change event in millions of years.Rapid climate change in the past resulted in 90% of all species being wiped out.There is no Planet B. The Earth is our only home and we ignore the dangers of climate change at our peril.\l"

The latest Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report says not even full implementation of existing energy efficiency and renewable fuel policies will help the country meet its binding targets for four years' time.Despite overachieving in annual obligations since 2013, Ireland is set to breach its targets in 2016 or 2017, with agriculture and transport comprising 47 per cent and 29 per cent of non-ETS emissions respectively. Agriculture emissions are expected to increase by 6-7 per cent for the period 2014-2020, with an increase of 10-16 per cent expected in the transport sector. The latest EPA figures concern one of two broad categories for EU greenhouse gas targets, the other being the large energy and power industry which is also coming in behind target. Minister for the Environment Alan Kelly last year admitted that Ireland would not satisfy the 2020 targets. Speaking at the COP21 meetings in Paris in December Taoiseach Enda Kenny described the targets as ""unrealistic"" for Ireland considering the ""lost decade"" of recession the country had gone through.The national herd is expected to increase substantially by 2020, which many groups say will impact negatively on Ireland's climate obligations.Concomitant effect Allied to this, the EPA's report for 2014 showed that the country's economic recovery is having a concomitant effect on increasing emissions figures from the industrial, commercial and buildings sectors. ""Ireland must follow a pathway to decarbonising energy, transport and heating. We must break our dependence on fossil energy infrastructures,"" EPA director general Laura Burke said. Responding to the figures, the Green Party blamed Government policies and said a ""radical shift"" is needed to attain the next milestone 40 per cent reduction which is pencilled for 2030.""The 2020 targets are now beyond reach. We need a radical shift in policy if the situation is to be in any way salvaged, and get back on track for 2030. The transition to a decarbonised economy is an economic opportunity, not an economic cost - and we have everything to gain by embracing it,"" the spokesman added.The Department of the Environment said its National Mitigation Plan aims to ""close the gap as much as possible"" by 2020, and is working with other departments through the plan's steering group to find the best way forward.A spokesman decl"

Parties, including environmental campaigners, have welcomed the addition of the longer-term goals, including a move to ""emissions neutrality""; better transparency; guaranteed climate financing of $100 billion a year to 2020 for poorer countries; and five-year reviews to ensure each country keeps up their ambition levels.The potential of the accord was described by the conference president, French foreign minister Laurent Fabius, as ""a big step forward for humanity as a whole"". Mr Fabius was due to present the final draft today with the 50 final bracketed areas of text, denoting disagreement, removed.Well-placed sources told The Irish Times they expected the agreement to be sealed later today after difficult negotiations yesterday. ""I will present a text that is as balanced and as ambitious as possible,"" Mr Fabius said last night. The agreement will have no immediate implications for Ireland, which negotiated as part of the EU bloc. Agrifood sector However, the higher emissions targets could mean a new regime of carbon taxes or levies on agriculture and the agrifood sector, which accounts for a third of Ireland's greenhouse gases. UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon said he was optimistic. ""This negotiation is the most complicated, most difficult but most important for humanity"", he said.On the implications for Ireland, climate expert Prof John Sweeney, of NUI Maynooth, said all Irish transport, including trains, would need to be electrified by 2050 and Irish agriculture would have to pay a carbon tax. ""With economic growth, Ireland will be one of the richest countries again in two-three years' time,"" he said. ""I just do not expect to see any special favours for Irish agriculture.""Polluter pays With an increase of 300,000 planned in the national herd, and no appreciable reduction in emissions, Prof Sweeney said a price would have to be put on agricultural emissions under a ""polluter pays"" principle. ""We will have to adjust our agriculture taxation system to reflect that."" He said the most likely outcome was a carbon tax on agrifood companies. Minister for the Environment Alan Kelly welcomed the reference to 1.5 degrees and said Ireland, like Europe, had sought an ambitious agreement that included transparency and long-term goals. He defended Irish agriculture policy, which he said was among the most sustainable in the world. ""We have analysis that shows that though the dairy herd is going to increase in coming years, we can do so with the amount of emission we have at the moment,"" he said.\l"

"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland167","Growth potential; Solid yields and low risk factors make forestry an increasingly attractive investment option ; \'a6 forestry","January 26, 2016 Tuesday","Irish Independent","THERE is a growing interest worldwide in forestry as an investment due to a combination of its low volatility, relatively risk free status and level of returns achievable.Investors have been making inroads into the sector long before the recent turbulent ride on the stock market as many consider forestry as an investment that moves away from traditional asset classes.Forestry has many natural properties such as age, class, species, market and end use which allows flexibility in management to achieve best financial returns. Traditionally it is seen as providing a solid yield, due to its growth rates, with relatively low ongoing capital investment.Forestry is one of the oldest forms of investment with the diversity of timber products produced now part and parcel of everyday life including timber to build homes, fuel and food packaging.The recent COP21 climate change conference in Paris is likely to lead to increased integration of forestry into combating climate change. The agriculture sector accounted for 32.6pc of Ireland's total national emissions in 2013.Forestry removes CO2 from the atmosphere and also provides raw material for construction and fuel for renewable energy generation. The key to mitigating Ireland's agricultural emissions lie both in increased on farm efficiency and forestry expansion to sequester emissions from the air.Forestry is considered a real tangible asset, rather than stocks that have many investors quaking in recent days. It also provides a real return to investors from sales of timber, and annual forest premiums in the case of Irish forestry.The annual forest premiums available to all landowners are detailed in table 1. Separately, farmers can continue to receive their Basic Payment Scheme on land they plant to forestry. This provides an additional incentive to farmers to engage in forestry, particularly on marginal land.It is important to note that forestry resources are finite. The production of timber takes time which ensures the ability to increase forestry supply can only happen over long timeframes. The current scarcity of timber in Ireland is resulting in the importation of around 500,000 tonnes of roundwood annually into Ireland.The strategic goal of Ireland's forest policy 'Forests, products and people' is ""To develop an internationally competitive and sustainable forest sector that provides a full range of economic, environmental and social benefits to society and which accords with the Forest Europe definition of sustainable forest management"".In order to achieve this, increasing the forest area by 15,000 hectares per annum from 2016 to 2046 in order to support a long term sustainable roundwood supply of 7 to 8 million cubic meters of timber per annum is a recommended policy.However, we are currently falling behind with 6,252ha planted in 2014.This policy is supported in Ireland by afforestation grants, which cover the full cost of establishing and maintaining a plantation for the first four years, and annual forest premiums payable to forest owners. Support schemes in the form of forest roads and woodland improvement grants are available to facilitate proper forest management.However, the caveat is that forestry is a long term investment meaning the imperative to match a forestry investment with the objectives of each investor.Paddy Bruton is managing director of Forestry Services Ltd.

The camera focuses on a beautiful, brown-eyed Syrian child. She is about six years old. ""Thank you, Europe, thank you Mrs Merkel,"" her father shouts excitedly at the camera. He squeezes his child so hard in his excitement that I think that she might cry, but she smiles instead. There are tears of joy in his eyes, his daughter is now smiling straight into the camera, and my heart melts.Then my eyes are drawn to a group of three young men standing just behind them, taking their lifejackets off, smiling broadly, not Syrian, maybe Afghans, but I can't be sure. And then I find myself involuntarily scanning the group to see who else is there on that beach.How many other young men are travelling on their own? Where are they from? Are they just economic migrants and, if so, why is that so important to me? What would I do in their situation? Where will they settle? Will we be safe? Will they? The last image in the news report is a shot of discarded, tangled lifejackets, the detritus of this mass movement of people, the lifejackets lapped by the sea.What have I learned in 2015? I have learned we are a small world, a lot smaller than we ever thought and the old certainties that governed our old, much larger, world have changed forever.

They are confusing to me and my thoughts.The UN climate change conference in Paris this month, COP21, showed that sometimes global consensus about global problems can emerge and we will discover soon enough if practical solutions derive from this shared political will.And I was fortunate in being given the opportunity to present my research on individual psychological responses to climate change at the UN scientific conference in Paris in July.There was clearly a scientific consensus then and it was more than heartening to see a political consensus emerge five months later.But this emerging consensus on climate change, it must be remembered, took many decades.

We have committed, with our EU partners, to a collective target to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by at least 40 per cent by 2030.

We are developing a National Mitigation Plan to achieve that vision.""One really significant area for Ireland is our valuable and already efficient agriculture sector.

"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland172","Climate change could be our final undoing","November 7, 2015 Saturday","Irish Independent","ADVOCATES and campaigners for climate justice struggle to make the threat of global warming relevant to the general public. People are busy and understandably preoccupied by the day-to-day struggles of raising families and responding to the demands of work. Some people even find it hard to keep up with the routine domestic political agenda and rely on the media to keep abreast of current affairs.So, expecting people to reflect on the seemingly remote implications of climate change is challenging.Occasionally, a report from NASA or the UN and other agencies heralding the melting of the ice at the north or south poles, causing rising sea levels, forces the reader to stop and ponder.But short-term concerns aroused are quickly eclipsed by the next, more immediate news item.It is fortunate, therefore, given the fickle nature of politics and media, that public opinion is not the principle driver of initiatives on the State's policy on climate change.This is a topic which requires global leadership and sophisticated policy-making by way of international agreements, targets and binding commitments.India, the US and China have recently stepped up cooperation on climate change and carbon dioxide emissions.The next UNconference on climate change in Paris, later this month, will be a test for the EU in respect of moving to a lower carbon trajectory and restating the EU's traditional leadership in this area. There are real fears that the EU will miss the 2020 emissions targets.The Volkswagen emissions scandal will have cast a shadow, not only on the credibility of the motor industry and compliance with regulations, but on the reputation of the EU.The United States and the Obama administration is now focusing on climate change policy domestically, and also by diplomatic engagement, which will go some way to make up for the failures of earlier administrations to address, or even acknowledge, the reality of climate change.Much of the research in this area is assisted and informed by work in space by organisations such as Nasa. It is expensive work but vital in monitoring by satellite the many changes occurring on the planet.Few people are aware that the international space station is circumnavigating the earth every 92 minutes, doing research, taking photographs and observing the planet in all its diversity.Out of sight and out of mind, all this important work by Nasa goes on literally as if in a parallel universe.Every now and then, when there is a launch or a landing of a space mission, we earthlings take notice and briefly marvel at the wonders of space and earth science.We notice, of course, the big events; landings on planets, meteors, eclipses of the moon or sun.But in the main, most of us are blissfully unaware of all this space exploration and research going on, with a host of devices monitoring planetary changes, carbon emissions levels, melting land and sea ice, and global warming.Satellite images of icebergs breaking off are tracked and fed into the research supplementing the work of scientists here on earth.Canadian Astronaut Chris Hadfield made all this real for millions of us by intensively photographing the earth from his tour on the International Space Station.During 2,579 orbits of the planet, he took about 45,000 photos. He even had a Twitter feed from space, relating his experiences and went so far as to record David Bowie's iconic song 'Space Oddity' from inside the station. The astonishing sight and sounds of him floating around with his guitar is an indelible image for me of space travel.His book of photographs 'You are here' is a revelation of astonishing views and commentary from space of the earth divided into continents.The images over Africa are stunning in their colour, diversity and clarity, ranging from human settlements in Mali to deserts and deltas in North Africa and the coral reefs of Australia and the Red Sea.These photographs have now inspired a new collection of paintings by Irish artist Catherine Daly, titled 'The Curious Eye', currently showing in the Source Arts Centre in Thurles.Looking at Hadfield's images of our earth from space transported into paintings, I recalled all the places, particularly in Africa, that I visited as minister for overseas aid. I saw for myself the human calamity of famine in countries where food insecurity and drought, harsh terrain, environmental degradation and deforestation contributed to humanitarian disasters, mass displacement and chronic underdevelopment.Climate change is now firmly on the human rights development agenda.Reflecting on planet earth is a rewarding activity. These days one thinks of the war and instability in Syria and the unprecedented march of humanity fleeing across the blue waters of the seas to Europe.One thinks of the tragedy of tsunamis which devastated several countries in the recent past, of melting ice caps and of earthquakes and hurricanes which claim so many lives.Looking at our world from space reminds us that we are mere custodians of the planet for the brief period of our mortal lives.We hold it in trust for future innocent generations. The significant money spent on space discovery and science, which informs policy here on earth, is money well spent.The US federal government spends $1bn each year on Antarctic and Arctic research. Its impact is not immediate.It is the slow burn of knowledge feeding into our collective intelligence about sustainable life on earth.A recent report from Nasa said that the pace of melting of the ice in some parts of Antarctica was a cause for serious concern, suggesting a point of ""irreversible retreat"" had been reached, which could mean a rise in sea levels of three metres.Similar research is going on in Greenland's ice sheet, the full melting of which could increase sea levels by six metres. Such significant rise in sea levels would have dire consequences for low-lying populations as diverse as Bangladesh and New York. We ignore this intelligence at our peril.Failure to stop dangerous climate change will undermine all the development gains that have been made in poor countries which suffer the most impact.Predicting how rapidly sea levels will rise in the 21st century is not just the stuff of policy wonks. It is a matter of life and death.The Volkswagen emissions scandal will have cast a shadow, not only on the credibility of the motor industry and compliance with regulations, but on the reputation of the EU\l"

The others might do it instead argument imagines trade deals with places like Brazil, where, very expressly, Brazil is left out of all current trade deals being negotiated.TTIP, TPP and CETA (Pacific, US-EU and EU Canada deals respectively) exclude all the BRIC countries, Brazil, Russia India and China.This current raft of trade agreements, and indeed the Russia trade war, could be seen as a way to inhibit growth in the BRIC countries.We are also presuming growth in meat and dairy consumption will continue forever, despite their high GHG emissions compared to other foods.This is like presuming coal will still be burned, despite the existence, and needs for, renewables.Yes there are growth predictions for both coal and meat/dairy, but if these growth trajectories do happen, we are facing runaway climate change. All of us.In this context, is it more ethical, and sensible, to say let s try something different, and let s try to convince others to eat that food ?Or will we continue presuming people will ignore the evidence as the planet fries?So just like leaving fossil fuels in the ground seems impossible but yet also the only sensible thing to do, based on the science, changing land use away from land grabbing and methane producing conventional livestock production, and over towards other types of production makes eminent sense.These other systems would integrate livestock more into mixed farms with proper rotations and clover for N fertility.They would also be much more about producing vegetables from mixed cropping systems.And the range of soil regenerative practices currently possible and carried out on model organic farms would have to be mainstreamed.Agroforestry holds the most potential for farmers, especially sheep farmers, to keep farming and store more carbon.As we saw in this supplement last week, while the livestock stocking rate stays more or less the same, there can be 400 to 1,000 trees per hectare with agroforestry.The tree itself is a store of carbon, while soil carbon levels soil structure are improved with standard agroforestry techniques.With organic fertility and pest management techniques, along with agroforestry, soil microbiology would be strengthened, restoring and regenerating the soil.Research has shown that soil carbon can increase by 2.2% per year in organic farms, but remain at best stable on conventional farms.Also organic matter levels are 7% higher in certified organic soils.We are the Carbon Leakage. But we don t have to be.\l"

Attending the COP21 global summit on climate change in Paris, the Taoiseach singled out Irish agriculture as an exception, and said the State would need ""time and space"" to deal with meeting stringent EU targets of a 40 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030.Mr Kenny was one of more than 150 world leaders at the summit yesterday, and in his formal address he said Ireland was ""determined to play its part"" in reaching an historic agreement before the conference closes on Friday week.The most anticipated speech of the day was that delivered by US president Barack Obama, who described the conference as a potential ""turning point"" to curb global warming.Saying the next generation was watching, he declared: ""I came here personally to say the United States not only recognises the problem but is committed to do something about it.""The UN summit involving 195 parties will seek pledges that, it is hoped, will collectively result in global temperature not rising more than 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels. Warning However, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, who launched an ambitious alliance that will work towards an increase in solar power, warned that the developed world would have to recognise that, for countries such as India, climate change was not of its making. Another key player, Chinese president Xi Jinping, confirmed his country's commitment that its emissions would peak in 2030 and then start to fall.In a well-received speech, the host leader, French president Francois Hollande, referred back to the recent terrorist atrocity in Paris that had resulted in the loss of more than 130 lives.""I can't separate the fight with terrorism from the fight against global warming,"" he told delegates.In his address to the conference, Mr Kenny said Ireland supported the aim of creating a legally binding agreement on climate change. ""Ireland's national long-term vision is presented in climate legislation, which sets out our intention to substantially cut CO2 emissions by 2050, while developing an approach towards carbon neutrality in the land sector that does not compromise our capacity for food production,"" he said.Speaking to reporters earlier, the Taoiseach blamed Ireland's difficulties in meeting targets in agriculture on a ""lost decade"" which he said was created by recession caused by the previous government. That had resulted in few resources being available to invest in climate change research and infrastructure. 'Unreachable' He also said the targets set by the EU Commission for 2020, which called for a 20 per cent reduction of emissions compared with 2005 levels, were ""unrealistic"" and ""unreachable"". Mr Kenny denied the State was seeking ""wiggle room"" on the vital sector of agriculture. Rather, he said that when the EU Commission set the 2020 target it had overestimated what agriculture could achieve in terms of curbing emissions.""We do not want to see a situation where we are limited in what we can produce with the abolition of quotas, to find that food produced in countries with inferior standards and higher emission levels.""Mr Kenny said he had spoken to several other European leaders at the summit about the agriculture challenge, including the prime minster of Denmark, Lars L\'f8kke Rasmussen. UN Special Envoy on Climate Change, former president Mary Robinson refused to be drawn yesterday on Ireland's policy stance, saying she did not like to talk specifically on a political matter.""I always want every country including Ireland to be more ambitious,"" she said. ""There is room for improvement and I do hope this conference will help.""\l"

The 2,000-strong audience included the families of victims, people wounded in the attacks and those who survived them.It is extremely rare for Les Invalides, which belongs to the French armed forces, to be used to honour civilians. President Fran\'c3\£7ois Hollande gave the only speech, and referred at least three times to ""the fallen"", as if the victims were soldiers on a field of battle. The Republican Guard band played La Marseillaise at the beginning and end of the hour-long service.Mr Hollande had asked the French to hang the blue, white and red tricolour from their balconies to mark the tribute. French flagmakers have reported a rise in sales since the attacks. 'Mad cause' In his speech, Mr Hollande played the role of war president and commander-in-chief to whom the French have rallied. His approval rating has shot up to 41 per cent since the attacks. ""France has been struck in a cowardly way, through an act of war that was organised far away and coldly executed,"" he began. ""A horde of assassins killed 130 of our own . . . in the name of a mad cause and a god they betrayed.""Mr Hollande promised that ""France will use every means to destroy the army of fanatics who committed these crimes. I promise you too that France will remain herself, as the disappeared had loved her, as they would have wanted her to remain.""Yesterday France informed the Council of Europe that its state of emergency would contravene provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights. Twenty-four militant environmentalists have been placed under house arrest in the run-up to the COP21 climate conference, accused of belonging to ""radical protest movements"". Muslim groups have complained of arbitrary treatment.At Les Invalides, several of the country's best known pop and classical musicians performed music by Jacques Brel, Barbara (Monique Serf) and Bach while photographs of the victims were shown on a large screen. The names and ages of all 130 who died were read out.""These men and women embodied the joy of living,"" Mr Hollande said. They came from 50 French towns, cities and villages and from 17 countries.""These men and women were the youth of France, the youth of a free people, which cherishes culture,"" he added.Refuse to attend The average age of those killed was 35 and they've been referred to as ""the Bataclan generation"", after the concert hall where the greatest number perished. Today's youth will remember the attacks ""as a terrible initiation to the hardness of the world"", Mr Hollande said. Two families stated publicly that they would not attend the ceremony because they felt that government incompetence was partly to blame for the deaths.""How can a country that has been on maximum alert since [the Charlie Hebdo massacre of] January 7 have failed to have noticed preparations for the November 13 tragedy?"" wrote Delphyne de Peretti, the sister of Aur\'c3\£9lie de Peretti, who was killed at the Bataclan.Also yesterday, Msgr Philippe Barbarin, the Cardinal Archbishop of Lyon, relieved Fr Herv\'c3\£9 Benoit of his duties. The priest had published an opinion piece objecting to Eagles of Death Metal, the US band performing at the Bataclan and their song Kiss the Devil. The priest described pre-attack images of concert-goers as ""in an ecstatic trance. They are the living dead. Their murderers, these hash-smoking zombies, are their Siamese twins. The same unrootedness, amnesia, childishness, absence of culture.""\l"

""The sun god is the soul of all beings,"" Mr Modi told a crowded press room, in the presence of the French president and ministers for foreign affairs and the environment, and the secretary general of the United Nations.""Many in India begin their day with a prayer to the sun,"" Mr Modi said. ""The world must turn to the sun to power the future.""The Solar Alliance seeks to unite 110 countries, situated between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, which enjoy more than 300 days of sunshine a year, for the purpose of obtaining solar technology cheaply from the US, Germany and Japan, the leaders in photovoltaic panels. India's institute for solar energy will contribute $30 million (EUR 28.4 million) to establishing a secretariat for the alliance. It will be in Gurgaon, a city near Delhi that focuses on information technology.""Carbon space is what it's all about,"" said Raj Chengappa, a former member of the government's climate change council and editorial director of the India Today group. ""You've done all the damage, and now you tell us we can't use fossil fuels,"" he said. ""So give us the finance and technology.""Paradox Antagonism is giving way to understanding. President Fran\'e7ois Hollande repeatedly used the term climate justice yesterday. ""We can no longer accept the paradox that countries with the most sun have the least energy. Climate justice also means reducing costs to right this,"" he told the launch of the Solar Alliance. India, the world's fourth largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and the second most populous country, was long viewed as an obstruction to an agreement. Indian leaders note that, on a per capita basis, their emissions are far below the world average.Although India has promised to produce 40 per cent of its energy from renewable sources by 2030, it is nonetheless determined to double coal production over the next five years. Mr Modi said that one quarter of India's 1.2 billion citizens have no electricity at all, while another quarter have electricity only one hour a day. Access to electricity Close to 1.3 billion people throughout the world have no access to electricity. ""If you put clean energy within the reach of all, it will create unlimited economic opportunities,"" Mr Modi said. ""This day is the sunrise of new hope for villages and homes still in darkness."" The French organisers of the conference are pleased that Mr Modi has assumed a constructive role with the Solar Alliance. Laurent Fabius, foreign minister and president of the conference, visited Mr Modi in Delhi last Friday.China has long voiced the demands of developing and emerging countries, but is seen to have defected, said Mr Chengappa. ""India is now the champion of all the countries who say, 'You've got to pay'.""At present, a megawatt of solar power in India costs three times more than a megawatt of coal-generated electricity.""We are looking for breakthrough technology, in particular better batteries to store solar energy and smart grid management,"" Mr Chengappa said.At present, renewable energy is used to top up polluting thermal energy during peak hours. India wants the technology to establish a ""green corridor"" which would ensure that grids switch immediately to renewable energy each time it becomes available.\l"

French authorities have insisted the summit, known as COP21, will go ahead despite the terrorist attacks that killed 130 and left hundreds injured in Paris earlier this month. Prime minister Manuel Valls said the event, due to begin next Monday, would be held because ""it's an essential meeting for humanity"" and would be an opportunity for world leaders to show their solidarity with France. In order to protect the water system from attack during the conference, sensors have been installed in the network to monitor pressure, chlorine levels, temperature and conductivity - parameters that could signal whether there is any contamination of the water supply. ""A terrorist could very well take advantage of this gathering to strike,"" Jean-Louis Fiamenghi, head of security for French water and waste company Veolia, told Reuters. He added that there had been no threat of nuclear, biological or chemical threat at any Veolia sites across France, however. Greenhouse gas Conference participants will be in a closed, protected area at the venue at Le Bourget, north of Paris, as they work towards a deal to limit rising greenhouse gas emissions. Security within that inner zone will be the responsibility chiefly of the United Nations, but French authorities will guard the buildings and control access to the complex. Some public demonstrations planned to coincide with the talks have been cancelled under a state-of-emergency decree that remains in force until February. The French government said 140 heads of state and government were due to attend the opening day of the summit on Monday. They include US president Barack Obama, who said he would go ahead with the visit despite the attacks and urged other leaders to do the same as a way of showing defiance in the face of terrorism. ""I think it's absolutely vital for every country, every leader, to send a signal that the viciousness of a handful of killers does not stop the world from doing vital business,"" Mr Obama said.Among the events cancelled by the government are large demonstrations that were due to take place in Paris and other French cities on Sunday, the eve of the summit. A number of events scheduled for December 12th, the day after the conference closes, have also been called off. Authorities initially looked at relocating the Sunday march, which was to take place between Rue de la R\'e9publique and Place de la Nation, but that was ruled out. The foreign ministry said only indoor events could go ahead under the tight security restrictions. ""The security of everything within the rooms of the conference we will guarantee 100 per cent, because it will be under our control, but we can't completely ensure the safety of the external part,"" French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said.Climate justice Climate 21, a coalition of NGOs and trade unions, said it regretted the decision but was ""more determined than ever"" to make its voice heard on climate justice. It would find ""creative"" ways to have its say, the group added. Access to Le Bourget will be strictly controlled. People entering the conference area will pass through security scanners, and vehicles will be screened for bombs. Some 30,000 police will be on duty around Le Bourget and at French border checkpoints. \l"

However, women still tend to occupy more subaltern positions, with eight of 11 new junior ministers women.The reshuffle indicates no clear policy changes, other than the attempt to bring the estranged Greens back into the fold in the run-up to the 2017 presidential election. Hollande's stalwarts - environment minister S\'e9gol\'e8ne Royal, defence minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, finance minister Michel Sapin - remain unchanged. The popular young economy minister Emmanuel Macron was neither promoted nor demoted.Ayrault's appointment as the highest-ranking minister after prime minister Manuel Valls is the most salient feature of the reshuffle. For the third time in a row, a former prime minister has been given the foreign ministry, after Alain Jupp\'e9 and Laurent Fabius.This is also the first time that a sitting prime minister, Valls, will be followed in rank in the cabinet by his predecessor, Ayrault.Valls replaced Ayrault when he was sacked after the socialists lost the March 2014 municipal elections. Ideological grounds Ayrault believed that Valls had plotted against him, along with Arnaud Montebourg and Beno\'eet Hamon. They later broke with Valls on ideological grounds and left his government. Ayrault knows Hollande well. He was leader of the Socialist group in the national assembly for 15 years, including the 11 years (1997-2008) when Hollande was secretary general of the Socialist Party. In a documentary made by Ayrault's daughter last year, Hollande said with a sigh: ""I miss Jean-Marc.""As foreign minister, Fabius, who has become president of the constitutional council, focused mostly on the war in Syria, the Iranian nuclear agreement and the COP21 climate conference.Ayrault is expected to re-focus on Europe. A former German teacher, he converses with Chancellor Angela Merkel without an interpreter and is highly regarded in Berlin. The migrant crisis and the possibility of a UK exit from the EU are important issues he will have to address.A former mayor of Nantes, Ayrault has been the most fervent advocate of building a new airport at Notre-Dame-des- Landes. He and Valls agree on that issue, but the airport is opposed by the Green, who had made its cancellation a condition for returning to government. They now appear to have dropped that demand.The Greens refused to participate in the Valls government that was formed in April 2014 but apparently could not resist the temptation to regain a foothold in power.As Florian Philippot, vice-president of the extreme right-wing National Front, put it, the Greens ""had been scratching at the door for months"". Hollande needs their support if he is to have any chance of re-election. Ousting Emmanuelle Cosse, national secretary of Europe \'c9cologie Les Verts (EELV), becomes minister for housing. Jean-Vincent Plac\'e9, who left EELV last year, is junior minister in charge of state reforms and simplification. Another EELV militant, Barbara Pompili, is junior minister for the environment in charge of biodiversity. The most remarked upon slight was the ousting of culture minister Fleur Pellerin, and her replacement by Hollande's cultural adviser, Audrey Azoulay.Azoulay is close to Hollande's partner, Julie Gayet. A former adviser to the king of Morocco, she reportedly makes Hollande laugh and organises Sunday night film screenings in the \'c9lys\'e9e Palace.\l"

This was not supposed to happen, at least not so soon after 2009. Then residents and businesses consoled themselves, believing such a flood would probably never reoccur in living memory. Then Met \'c9ireann calculated the rainfall which fell in the month of November 2009 was a once in a 500-year event. ""We were assured the last time it was a once-off,"" says Frances Cryan, owner of Cryan's Hotel. Using sandbags Six years ago, Cryan's was closed by the floods, but it has managed to keep the water at bay this time using sandbags and a pump. An elevated walkway over the floodwater has kept visitors dry. With Christmas coming the timing could not have been worse, but shop owners are fighting back. A commuter bus ferries shoppers in from local GAA stadium P\'e1irc Se\'e1n Mac Diarmada. A video declares Carrick is open for business. The flooding is not quite as bad as 2009, but it is bad in comparison with any other year. The main N4 into the town is flooded. So, too, is the car park at the back of the Bush Hotel and the Park Lane.Carrick Indoor Karting, popular with stag and hen parties, has been shut since November 29th, depriving it of a last-minute flurry of parties before the end of the year. ""I put everything into this, not the banks,"" owner Nicky Davey says forlornly. This time, the Carrick Cineplex, the only cinema in a 30km radius, has stayed dry, but it is still closed for business, because customers cannot make their way to it.Swans have been gliding past the cinema car park in recent days. Until the swans leave and the cars come back again, the cinema cannot reopen, says owner, Liam Flood. Flooding levels ""The 2009 flood and, to a certain extent, what is happening now bucked all the trends,"" he adds.The people of Carrick-on- Shannon, Athlone, Limerick and all the other places affected by flooding might have to deal with a new reality which will mean frequent floods and heavier rain. The floods this year bring home the reality of global warming more than all the talking done at the COP21 summit in Paris, says Carrick area councillor Enda Stenson. ""I believe there is a solution, but it is going to take mega-money and maybe we don't have the expertise to do it. We might need to call in the Dutch,"" he says. A start would be to manage the tributaries of the Shannon and clean up parts congested with vegetation which stymie the water flow. ""The Shannon has got to be managed properly,"" he says. He recommends the setting up of one agency to manage the river from the source to the sea. It is a view universally held among those who live close to its banks. \l"

Mr Durkan will join his counterparts from the devolved regions in a delegation headed by British Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Amber Rudd.Northern Ireland is the only part of Ireland and Britain with no legislation for tackling the causes of global warming - a situation Mr Durkan describes as ""an embarrassment"".The minister has conceded that a bill to curb emissions will not come before the assembly in the current mandate but he believes some future legislation is necessary.""The scientific evidence for climate change is irrefutable, as is man's role in creating it,"" he said.""Therefore it's imperative that man does all we can to slow down climate change and reduce the impact we have on our environment. While its a global issue there are local actions we can take.""Proposals for a Stormont climate change bill have faced strong opposition from the farming lobby.Agriculture is the north's largest source of climate change-causing emissions, accounting for 29 per cent of the region's greenhouse gases, far outstripping the amount caused by transport and energy production.Most of the agricultural air pollution comes from livestock, which emit methane through belching and in manure.Earlier this week, Taoiseach Enda Kenny said the significance of the Republic's agriculture industry meant it would need ""time and space"" to deal with stringent EU targets of a 40 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030.In 2013, a report commissioned by the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development said cutting greenhouse gases would have ""significant negative impacts"" on the agrifood sector's growth plans. The 'Going for Growth' strategy is one of the Stormont executive's main job creation plans and aims to increase exports through the expansion and intensification of farm production, a move expected to lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions.But Mr Durkan rejected the notion that expanding the agrifood sector was incompatible with reducing emissions.""We have a similar dependence on the agriculture industry as they do in the Republic and it's important we take cognisance of that,"" he said.""However, I don't think that climate change legislation specific to Northern Ireland has to impact adversely upon productivity.""He said there were other ways to address emissions without reducing livestock numbers and that he was determined to strike a balance which did not compromise environmental standards but acknowledged the economic contribution of agriculture.A statement from the Agrifood Strategy Board (AFSB), which is responsible for implementing 'Growing for Growth', said it agreed minister's assertion that agricultural expansion and a reduction in climate change gases were not mutually exclusive.""We believe that clear, demonstrable sustainability credentials will be key to marketing our food and drink across the world and are working to develop a robust scientific evidence base for the measurement of greenhouse gas emissions,"" the statement said.However, it added that AFSB was not in favour of specific targets as these would ""simply result in off-shoring agricultural production to less environmentally efficient food production systems"". The statement said the board was committed to reducing the ""carbon intensity"" of produce.Mr Durkan said other ways of reducing greenhouses gases elsewhere were through increased use of electric vehicles and more renewable energy, though he expressed his disappointment at the recent decision to scrap the renewables subsidy.\l"

""We were thrilled to receive this award. It's a recognition of the vast array of services we offer, and helps grow our status within the industry in Ireland,"" said Paddy Bruton, the managing director of the Kilkenny-based firm. Established in 1985, the company provides services in forest establishment and management, road construction, forest thinning including harvesting and timber sales, national and international forestry investment, woodland valuation, taxation advice and a wide range of associated services. ""The government has an afforestation target of 14,000 hectares per annum in Ireland, but the annual rate is currently just over 6,500 per annum. The list of incentives for landowners who consider planting forestry are numerous, and we anticipate that more will opt for forest plantation in the coming years,"" said Bruton. Indeed, the COP21""It will be necessary to have more land planted to offset the CO2 increase, which is inevitable with an expansion in dairy and beef herds. This has many additional national benefits, including rural employment and increased timber supply into the future particularly to the emerging biomass market,"" said Bruton. He pointed out that forestry plantations were fixed assets and, by their nature, increased in value each year with growth - giving a solid yield. There are no establishment costs, as these are paid for by the government by means of afforestation grants and landowners can earn between (EURO)440 and (EURO)615 per hectare per year in income tax-free forestry premiums which can also be combined with the basic payment scheme in the case of farmers. Additionally, their value does not fluctuate in comparison to property price change, and with the cost of timber increasing, both nationally and internationally, the wisdom of the investment is indisputable - especially on marginal land. ""Another incentive is that, at the last budget, Minister for Finance Michael Noonan abolished the high earners income tax restriction which previously limited the exemption to (EURO)80,000 per annum. From January 1, this change comes into law,"" said Bruton. Forestry Services Ltd provides free consultations for those landowners thinking of forestry planting. A core part of the business includes forestry management and plantations set prior to the Celtic Tiger era are now in need of major thinning. Bruton said: ""In the late 1980s and early 1990s, between 12,000 and 20,000 hectares were planted each year. Now thinning of those forests is required. The yield from the material removed is significant and sold to the sawmilling and biomass industry, amongst others, leading to profits for the landowner. We take care of everything from the thinning process to the actual marketing stage. We ensure the entire process is seamless for the forest owner."" With the increased range of incentives available to landowners in terms of planting forestry, the sector is set to see a significant upturn in 2016 and beyond. From small acorns, large successful and, in the case of Forestry Services Ltd, award-winning companies grow.

That cannot be recovered, and until we have an economic engine to allow us change structures, and continue to invest in research and innovation for more sustainable ways of doing agriculture, that presents us with a challenge,"" the Taoiseach said.""We don't want to see a situation where we are limited in what we can produce to find that food is being produced in other countries with inferior standards and higher emissions levels.""Agriculture is the biggest contributor to Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions, currently accounting for more than 30pc of the total. Ireland also has the highest proportion of emissions of any EU member state from this sector.Emissions are expected to increase by 2pc by 2020 as Government plans to ramp up food production are realised.However, the EU requires a 20pc cut by 2020 over 2005 levels - on the current pathway, they will have reduced by just 5pc, well below the target.""The European Commission in setting out targets for 2020 overestimated what agriculture could actually deliver,"" Mr Kenny added.

"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland185","Ireland is the only country guaranteed an annual date at the White House","March 17, 2016 Thursday","Irish Independent","SEVEN years ago, First Lady of the United States Michelle Obama requested that the water in the White House fountain be dyed green - similar to a Chicago tradition, wherein the city greens its river for the St Patrick's Day festivities.This gesture complemented and continued an annual tradition that affirms one of the greatest bilateral relationships in the world. Ireland is the only country in the world guaranteed an annual invitation to the White House. The meeting between the President of the United States and An Taoiseach gives us an opportunity to talk about some of the very important bilateral issues that we face, and also to address global issues in response to which our two countries are taking leadership.President Barack Obama has repeatedly identified entrepreneurship as one of the brightest hopes for expanding economic opportunity and creating jobs. Since the president first launched the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in Washington DC five years ago, hundreds of thousands of entrepreneurs have been empowered to launch thousands of new businesses and creative initiatives.The US-Ireland economic relationship is now valued at over $510bn ((EURO)454bn), and this fantastic achievement is made possible thanks to our respective entrepreneurial spirit - a spirit that I have seen first-hand in my visits to American and Irish companies across Ireland.The US and Ireland also apply our creativity, talent, and energy to tackling some of the world's most pressing issues such as global hunger, migration and refugees, and climate change.Speaking to the world following the historic COP21 agreement on climate change in Paris last year, President Obama said: ""Together, we've shown what's possible when the world stands as one.""The president connected our country's future with a future he could now envision as a grandparent. Having been blessed with a grandchild myself, I feel a profound kinship in this shared sense of responsibility - a solidarity that resonates in Ireland.Former President of Ireland and UN Special Envoy on Climate Change Mary Robinson has spoken of how her devotion to her grandchildren has stoked her passion on climate change. As a global ambassador, she exemplifies how an Irish voice can electrify, and amplify, a message on an issue with worldwide impact.The bond and the friendship felt between the United States and Ireland is something most everyone accepts as a given, but we can't take it for granted. We need to ensure that the next generation understands why the White House fountain will flow with green waters this St Patrick's Day and why we cherish this special relationship.That's why in 2015 we launched the Creative Minds Series, which invites prominent US innovators to creatively engage with Irish audiences. The goal of Creative Minds is to spark new collaborations and innovative connections between the US and Ireland.Since January 2015, we have pursued this goal by inviting an exciting list of creative Americans to lead discussions, master classes, and performances in Ireland.Creative Minds envoys have included singersongwriter Ben Folds, Emmy Award-winning 'Sopranos' creator David Chase, legendary songwriter John Prine, Academy Awardwinning animation expert Pete Docter, hospitality guru Danny Meyer, and Grammy award-winning banjo players Bela Fleck and Abigail Washburn. We recognise the talent of these creative minds and also that the economies of the 21st Century depend increasingly not only on creativity, but also creative connections.As President Obama has said: ""America's possibilities are limitless, for we possess all the qualities that this world without boundaries demands: youth and drive; diversity and openness; an endless capacity for risk and a gift for reinvention.""I believe the same may be said of Ireland and, to the list of qualities that both our countries enjoy this St Patrick's Day, let us include the value that we place on friendship.L\'e1 Fh\'e9ile P\'e1draig Sona Daoibh.\l"
"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland186","Back to the future with high-speed couriers; Innovative bicycle couriers cut carbon emissions by 99 per cent","November 27, 2015 Friday","The Irish Times","The bicycle courier has become an indispensable part of the working day for many businesses, ferrying important documents or packages through traffic-choked city streets - without producing carbon emissions.What would happen, Leeds man Nick Blake wondered a few years ago, if you took Europe's high-speed train network and book-ended it with cycle couriers? With that, ImagineCargo was born. Then in February 2014, Blake, a veteran of the logistics industry, discovered the real selling point: using bicycles instead of trucks at each end cuts carbon emissions by 99 per cent.""That was the a-ha moment,"" he says, calculating that the transport of a 5kg package across Europe using traditional carriers generates up to 12kg of CO2 emissions. ""With 4.5 million packages sent in Europe each day, our model offers a megatonne-sized CO2-saving potential that puts it into a category with major changes to building regulations or power generation.""From its base in Z\'fcrich, ImagineCargo has negotiated deals with the rail companies in Switzerland, Austria and Germany and acts as link to courier companies in all major cities served by the high-speed rail network.The company's packaging displays specific CO2-saving information, making each package a small advertisement for its reduced environmental impact, one seen by everyone who handles the package along the way.Embrace sustainability Sustainability never played a major role in the traditional logistics industry, says Blake, but he is confident companies are ready to embrace the concept - once the price is competitive and the service reliable. ImagineCargo intends to be both, and is confident it is well-placed to benefit from heavy investment by European governments in their high-speed networks. From 2017 on, for instance, the 600km Berlin-Munich train journey time will drop from almost six hours to less than four on one of Germany's most crucial arteries.Even now, for journeys of up to 1,000km, Mr Blake says it isn't much quicker to messenger packages via out-of-city airports than city centre train stations - but far dirtier. Overlooked Part of the challenge so far has been convincing German, Austrian and Swiss rail providers of the value of their existing rail transport services for packages, in many cases overlooked since truck deregulation made the rail courier services unprofitable in the 1970s. ""It's a 'back to the future' situation: the Austrian system is more than 150 years old and began with steam train and horse and cart,"" he says. ""With our new technology to manage orders and tracking information, we can offer a better experience.""ImagineCargo joins the logistical dots but is not a service to ship anything. Instead it pitches itself as the green alternative for companies who need something somewhere fast - legal documents, medical supplies, architect models for competition - and where price is a secondary concern.Prices vary but Blake says it will always be cheaper than the current alternative for companies up against a deadl"

The report uses data from CDP, voted no 1 climate change research provider in 2015 by institutional investors, and shows Volkswagen is not the only car maker facing significant potential penalties as regulation on fleet emissions tightens around the world. Seven other car makers face up to 4.8bn in potential penalties from the EU and US combined for non-compliance on their fleet emissions. The two US car giants General Motors and Ford are the companies at most notable risk - their penalties could potentially equate to a combined US 1.8 billion (114% of EBIT) and US 1.2 billion (27% of EBIT) respectively. The annual CDP Automotive Report ranks each carmakers in four ways: 1. Fleet emissions - emissions from manufacturers' fleets of cars on the road account for 75% of total emissions from the automotive industry 2. Manufacturing emissions - about 20% of the industry's emissions come from the manufacturing stage 3. Advanced vehicles - how well manufacturers are doing at developing and selling alternative fuel vehicles such as electric vehicles, fuel cell and hybrid 4. Carbon regulation supportiveness - the length to which each manufacturer is supporting (or opposing) climate legislation Last year's CDP Automotive Report highlighted Volkswagen as one of the manufacturers most at risk of emissions penalties five months before the scandal broke. This year GM and Ford are most at risk of facing fines, whilst Nissan, Renault and Volkswagen are leading on advanced vehicles. Kia is the only manufacturer to not disclose its carbon emissions. As a result of the ensuing debate around testing for emissions, the report anticipates that emissions regulations are likely to further tighten around the world. The report also identifies several automakers who have taken a lead on `advanced vehicles', putting them at a competitive advantage, especially in light of the accord reached at flagship climate conference, COP21 and increasing pressure to deal with urban air pollution, such as measures to disfavour diesel vehicles. Nissan, Renault and Volkswagen are the only car makers to receive an `A' grade from CDP in this area. VW launched five new models of advanced vehicles last year, contributing to a three-fold increase in advanced vehicles sales volume globally. There is explosive opportunity in China from advanced vehicles where a booming market combines with some of the most stringent passenger vehicle fleet emissions targets.

I mean it has a huge impact on what is happening.""I mean the difficulty is sometimes to get this point across - that if we just leave it and say, well there are obviously lots of, there are endless problems arising all over the place therefore we deal with them in a short term way, we never deal with the underlying root cause which regrettably is what we're doing to our natural environment.""The interview came ahead of Charles travelling to Paris next week to deliver a keynote speech at the November 30 opening ceremony for , the United Nations conference on climate change which will attempt to reach a new international agreement to help limit global warming to no more than two degrees.Charles has been a strong advocate of taking action to protect the environment for many years.In 2007 he set up the Prince's Rainforest Group to find a solution to save the world's threatened forests. He addressed a UN international climate summit in Copenhagen in 2009 and the following year he gave a keynote speech to the Oslo Climate and Forest Conference.Last month he gave a speech at Lancaster House in London he told Environment Secretary Amber Rudd, her French counterpart Segolene Royal, and other guests that tackling deforestation will be central to combating global warming.Speaking to Sky as part of a day of special programmes, Charles was asked whether we can afford to deal with climate change in a time of austerity.He said: ""The trouble is if we don't, this is the awful thing, if we don't it's going to get so much worse, then life will become very, very complicated indeed, and what we're experiencing now will be as nothing to the problems.""I mean the difficulties in 2008 with the financial crash - that was a banking crisis. But we're now facing a real possibility of nature's bank going bust. If you see it like that, we've been putting so much pressure on the natural systems and all those aspects of nature that we take for granted.""He added: ""Obviously I try to be as optimistic as possible, but sometimes you think that - do we really have to face catastrophes and chaos before we understand that real action needs to be taken? The difficulty with all that, is that by the time you try to take the action, it's already too late.""Climate Crisis: Prince Charles Speaks Out, is on Sky News at 8pm.\l"

A bus carrying 32 people, ranging in age from 20 to 72 years, was stopped at the Port of Cherbourg at 5.30pm local time because they were carrying a banner.As a result, French police said they were being refused entry because protests have been banned and they were told they must return to Ireland on a ferry. However, shortly after 8pm they were released.The group included Grace O'Sullivan, who was on board Greenpeace's Rainbow Warrior in July 1985 when it was bombed by the French secret service amid protests about nuclear testing under way in French Polynesia.It later emerged that two mines had been planted by two members of the French intelligence services. A crew member died in the attack.Ms O'Sullivan was a Green Party candidate in last year's European elections.The Irish group was allowed to leave the port following interventions from the Irish ambassador to France, and a request for help from the French Embassy in Dublin.The spokeswoman for Stop Climate Chaos, Ciara Kirrane, said the party were told they were being refused entry to the country because demonstrations were not allowed. ""We said we were there for sanctioned events, and they (police) said there was no negotiation and we were being put back on the next ferry,"" she said.""They told us they were flexible and let us through. We've been let go and we're on the road.""The Irish party was made up of members of groups including Friends of the Earth, An Taisce, Christian Aid, Eco-Unesco and People's Climate.Meanwhile, UN climate talks remained unresolved, with the French presidency of the socalled 21st Conference of the Parties () not expected to release a draft agreement late last night.It is understood that some changes have been agreed, with negotiators expected to begin further talks after midnight.Emissions The summit was expected to conclude this evening, but is expected to go into tomorrow, and possibly Sunday.Key issues remain unaddressed, including financing for developing nations to help them adapt to climate change, a system to verify that countries are reducing emissions and a system to ratchet up ambition over time.There is no mention of emissions from aviation or shipping, but it is understood that forestry is being included as being a method to reduce emissions by capturing carbon.This would prove beneficial to Ireland, which intends ramping up investment in the forestry sector to help reduce agriculture's carbon footprint.PARIS DIARY Paul Melia \£6 THIS column has already referenced Mohamed Adow from Christian Aid for his comments about politicians needing to stop flirting with each other and ""seal the deal"" in Paris.

Just over 1,300 companies control 80 per cent of global operating revenues, with 40 per cent of this controlled by only 147 organisations. The annual revenue of a company such as Royal Dutch Shell or Walmart is more than double the GDP of many countries, including Ireland.Such wealth gives business enormous potential to contribute to sustainable economic and social development. In recent years ""sustainability"" has become a business buzzword. However, despite more than 20 years of business engagement with social and environmental issues, global indicators suggest we are farther away from achieving just, stable and resilient societies that function within increasingly vulnerable ecological limits.The aim of the COP21 negotiations that began this week is to produce an international framework to limit human-driven global warming to below two degrees. Nation states will be ascribed legally binding targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. These targets cannot be achieved without significant engagement and investment from the private sector, particularly from multinational corporations who are both sponsors and ""civil society"" representatives in Paris.The financial crisis showed key elements of our economic system, of which businesses are the engine, are deeply flawed. The short-term focus of financial markets and the primacy of shareholder value mean business decisions are made within a narrow frame: maximise profit, quickly. Long-term goals The concept of sustainable development is based on long- term ecological and societal goals. To make business compatible with sustainability a paradigm shift is required, away from financial short- termism and towards holistic, long-term thinking. Currently, business discourse on sustainability is dominated by the ""business case"". Investment in sustainability-related issues is said to benefit the organisation, for example, energy efficiency leads to cost savings. This win- win premise is an excellent idea when it holds. However, it does not always do so. For example, if British American Tobacco was to switch to manufacturing only e-cigarettes, society would benefit, the company likely not. The fundamental issue with the business case is that it is limited by the need to fit within the existing paradigm of financial short-termism. Much business talk of sustainability simply puts a ""green"" gloss on business as usual. For a paradigm shift to occur, business must look beyond the business case. This is not just a pipe dream but an alternative being implemented by some of the largest global companies.Sustainability vision In 2011, Unilever ceased to publish quarterly financial statements, a controversial decision initiated by chief executive Paul Polman as part of his ""longer-term"" sustainability vision. The day Polman announced the new policy, the company's share price dropped 8 per cent. In the short term there was no business case for scrapping quarterly reporting, but Unilever's stock rebounded within six months and has since doubled. This challenge to short-term shareholder pressures illustrates that it is possible to go beyond the business case and maintain financial stability. Unilever is among several large companies making innovative operational changes for sustainability. Organisations such as Marks & Spencer, Puma and O2-Telef\'f3nica have implemented initiatives which go beyond efficiency gains (the benefits of which are often negated by increased productivity) to ""eco-effectiveness"", reducing total ecological impact. Marks & Spencer, for example, is exploring the possibility of ""dematerialisation"", reducing supply chain waste by allowing customers to rent clothing. Puma has created a biodegradable running shoe that customers can return to its store to be composted at the end of its useful life. Here in Ireland, the Musgrave Group operates in accordance with core values that include ""long-term, stable relationships"" and ""not being greedy"".Sustainability is a challenge to accepted norms. It requires business leaders to think beyond conventional notions of the purpose of a business, to recognise that our current economic system is unsustainable in a societal and an ecological sense, and to take an honest look at the role of business in perpetuating that system. We must stop thinking of sustainability as an element of company strategy, an optional extra to be added on if a business case can be made. To make a real contribution to a just, equitable, and ecologically sustainable future, business must begin to look beyond the business case.

President Fran\'e7ois Hollande had earlier vowed that ""France will be merciless against the barbarians"" of IS.At the same time, French and Belgian authorities launched an international manhunt for a 26-year-old Frenchman who is believed to have been the ""eighth terrorist"" in the attacks.The wanted man is Salah Abdeslam. He and his brother Brahim are believed to have opened fire on the Petit Cambodge, La Carillon and \'c0 La Bonne Bi\'e8re cafes and restaurants in Paris's 10th and 11th districts on Friday night, killing more than 40 people. Brahim blew himself up with an explosives belt at the Comptoir Voltaire bar. Salah is believed to have jumped back into their Belgian-registered black Seat car and driven away. Car found The car was found in the eastern Paris suburb of Montreuil yesterday morning. It contained three Kalashnikovs. Incredibly, Abdeslam had been stopped for a routine identity check at Cambrai, on the Belgian border, on Saturday and allowed to continue. Another brother, Mohamed, was taken into custody, but the terror suspect cannot be found. Abdeslam may have fled to Belgium, where several of those involved in the attacks lived in the Molenbeek section of Brussels, known for its strong jihadist presence. The identity of three of the killers, all French citizens, was established by forensic specialists who were able to take prints from fragments of fingers. Six of the seven died when they detonated explosives vests. One was shot dead by French commandos. Police earlier identified Ismael Omar Mostefai (29), as one of three assailants who killed 89 people at a rock concert by the California group Eagles of Death Metal at the Bataclan music hall. Though Mostefai's name appeared on a terrorist watchlist, he was never imprisoned.Paris prosecutor Fran\'e7ois Molins explained how three synchronised groups carried out seven attacks in the space of 33 minutes - the deadliest terrorist assault in Europe since 192 people were killed in the 2004 Madrid train bombings. Three people were arrested in Molenbeek, the neighbourhood of Brussels that is 80 per cent north African Arab, on Saturday morning on suspicion of collusion in the attacks. French prime minister Manuel Valls said 103 of the dead have been identified, while up to 30 more bodies remained to be identified. Young people were heavily represented among the victims, who came from at least 15 countries including Algeria, Belgium, Brazil, Britain, Chile, France, Mexico, Morocco, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Tunisia and the US.An Irish man is in a serious but stable condition in hospital in Paris after undergoing surgery for gunshot wounds he suffered during the concert at the Bataclan. The Department of Foreign Affairs said it was contacted by a large number of concerned Irish people over the weekend, and asked that Irish citizens in France let their families know they are safe.France will come to a standstill at noon today for a minute's silence in memory of those killed. At 4pm, Mr Hollande will deliver a speech to the National Assembly and Senate, in congress in Versailles, ""to unite the nation"". Claude Bartolone, the speaker of the Assembly, said Mr Hollande will ""explain the various decisions that must be taken to ensure the security of the French people"". Pay homage Thousands of people gathered at the Place de la R\'e9publique and the sites of the Paris attacks to pay homage to the victims with flowers and votive candles. The crowds scattered at least twice last night when loud noises were heard. The exploding bulb of a street lamp emptied the Place de la R\'e9publique in minutes, but it filled again later. French authorities said the three suicide bombers who died outside the Stade de France, killing one passerby, had intended to enter the stadium, which would have claimed many more victims.The French government also said the COP21 UN Climate Conference to take place at Le Bourget on November 30th, will go ahead.

The system has pulled together information from multiple sources to give the most comprehensive overview available to officials here. It is commonly used for natural disasters or humanitarian crises.Jim Casey, the OPW's head of Hydrology and Coastal Section, said: ""We have requested them to monitor the floods as they are evolving now and over the coming days.""Athlone is still at severe risk of flooding with the chairman of the National Co-Ordination Group John Barry saying concern is growing that the defences used in recent days to keep areas dry may not cope with the rising water levels.Asked whether any families had been advised to move out of their homes ahead of the expected surge of floodwaters tomorrow and Monday, he said: ""It might well come to that.""In Limerick, the senior council engineer, Vincent Murray, admitted it was now a case of wait and see.""We will have to wait and see what happens over the next 48 hours but at the moment it's good that the ESB has held the discharge rate [at Parteen Weir in Co Clare] at 375 cubic metres per second - we can cope with that,"" he said.Critical The critical factor in Limerick, as in Cork, will be the rainfall tomorrow and on Monday when high tides are scheduled.""We are not overly concerned by the tides; we have had much higher tides and have coped well before, but it's the rainfall and the water coming from upstream that we have to monitor,"" Mr Murray added.If water levels on Lough Derg, upstream on the Shannon, continue to rise, traders and householders in vulnerable parts of Limerick and Clare could face a flood threat as severe as 2009 when, between Cork and the mid-west, over (EURO)200m worth of damage was caused.In Cork, officials are hopeful that, despite the risk, Cork city, Bandon and Skibbereen will escape a repeat of the disastrous floods of 2009, 2012 and 2014.Since Storm Desmond hit last weekend, just under 500 Defence Force officers have been deployed to help communities.Personnel were last night active in six locations: Castleconnell, Clonlara, Portumna, Ballinasloe, Athlone and Claregalway.Defence Minister Simon Coveney vowed that Army units equipped with high-axle trucks would remain deployed in support of emergency services.""All State agencies will do everything they can to protect people and property over the coming days,"" he said.Environment Minister Alan Kelly arrived back in Dublin last night, having spent the week discussing climate change at the COP21 conference in Paris. He will meet the emergency co-ordination group today.Temperatures are also set to drop today, prompting garda\'ed to warn motorists to take extra caution on the roads.Meteorologist Evelyn Cusack said there was ""a degree of uncertainty"" attached to the weather system coming in but it was likely to ""track across Ireland"".""There could be an hour or two of snow,"" Ms Cusack said.The week ahead is likely to bring ""waves of rain"" that will be ""quite heavy at times"".Mr Barry said that public safety is now the major priority.He said people should stay away from rough seas and use detours rather than risk using flooded roads.\l"

""It's not just electricity, but heat and transport.""He added that wind farms will require financial support for ""some period"" of time, but will eventually have to operate without a subsidy.Separately, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon urged almost 200 nations to strike a legally-binding deal to combat climate change, saying there was ""rising support for a strong, universal agreement"".""We are on the verge of one of the most important peace agreements of our times, making peace with our planet,"" he said.\£6 Never fear, chocolate is here Fairtrade (of course) bars are being handed to delegates with the name 'Change Chocolate' promising to give ""all the energy you need to fight for our future during the climate negotiations"".But lest anyone think it's just a sweet gesture, each bar has a serious message: ""During all your negotiations, please think about us children and what is best for our future.

There is massive potential for communities across Ireland to produce a portion of their own energy needs and reduce their carbon footprint.'To reach our national climate and renewable energy targets communities need to be empowered to install energy efficiency measures and insulation retrofits to buildings, and harness local renewable sources. The transition to a clean energy future will not happen without the power of the people.' In contrast to many of our European neighbours, community-owned renewable energy in Ireland is practically non-existent. A fundamental shift in policy is required that views citizens and communities as indispensable agents in securing our energy future, not obstacles to be negotiated. The Community Energy Proclamation recognises communities as active participants in the clean energy transition, and as one of the best way to unlock the renewable energy potential in Ireland.Davie Philip, the Cloughjordan based mentor of the Get Involved contest said: 'Every time we pay our energy bills, millions of euros pour out of our communities that could have stayed there creating jobs and energy security.

"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland196","Prospect of a deal has never been better","November 30, 2015 Monday","Irish Independent","What is happening in Paris? A total of 147 governments will attend the 21st so-called Conference of the Parties (COP) in an attempt to hammer out a deal to address climate change.This is needed because the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), having reviewed scientific literature from across the globe, has concluded that climate change is real, is caused by human activity, and must be addressed to prevent catastrophic changes to our climate system.How many people will attend? Organisers believe around 30,000 will attend the summit, which will be opened this morning by French President Fran\'e7ois Hollande, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and French Foreign Affairs Minister and President of COP 21, Laurent Fabius.Will civil society be represented? Yes. Side events are organised, but there will be no large-scale climate marches following the Paris terrorist attacks.Have we not been here before? Yes. The first COP took place more than 20 years ago, and in 1997 a deal was struck - called the Kyoto Protocol. But, crucially, the USA pulled out. It is hoped to strike a new deal in Paris.What's the scientific evidence? This year is the hottest on record, and last year was the stormiest winter on record in Ireland. Average global temperatures have risen 1C in the last century, and scientists believe if they go above 2C it will cause ""dangerous"" climate change.Have countries set out their emission reductions in advance? Most have. But experts warn the current limits will keep warming to 2.7C - not enough to prevent catastrophic change.Can these targets change? Yes. There is nothing to stop countries from pledging more ambitious targets.What is Ireland's position? We are bound by the European Commission, which has ambitious targets to reduce emissions by 20pc by 2020, and 30pc by 2030. Next year, international EU negotiations will begin where Ireland hopes to secure lower targets for agriculture.What are the stumbling blocks? There are many. A crucial question surrounds finance, and who will pay the bill, and in particular assist developing countries to adapt.Is there hope? Yes. The prospects of a deal have never been better. The US and China, among the biggest emitters, have agreed to reduce emissions and there is a mood among civil society, governments and business for change. It will all fall to the level of ambition expressed by countries. It is hoped to secure a deal by Friday week, when the conference formally closes, but organisers have indicated it may run into Saturday if required. Paul Melia\l"
"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland197","Weather man sacked over book storm; 'Mr Weather', who pooh-poohed global warming, now finds the going rough","November 3, 2015 Tuesday","The Irish Times","If you were the head of French state television and your leading weatherman started preaching climate scepticism in the run-up to the UN climate conference in Paris, you would probably sack him too.Philippe Verdier, ""Monsieur M\'e9t\'e9o"" (Mr Weather) at France 2, published a book titled Climat Investigation last month, in which he pooh-poohed global warming and questioned the probity of the 830 scientists who comprise the UN's intergovernmental panel on climate change.The panel says if nothing is done to reduce carbon emissions, the world's temperature could rise by up to 4.8 degrees by the end of this century. It is 95 per cent certain that most of the global warming since 1950 has been caused by man-made greenhouse emissions.Verdier used his position as Monsieur M\'e9t\'e9o to promote his book. ""Every night I address five million French people to talk to you about the wind, the clouds and the sun,"" he said in a promotional video. ""Yet there is something important, very important, that I haven't been able to tell you We are hostage to a planetary scandal over climate change. A war machine intended to keep us in fear.""At the root of this conspiracy, Verdier claimed, ""are scientists who are manipulated, politicised, conflicts of interest, corruption, sex scandals, politicians who think only of their image and their thirst for power, blind media who get carried away and censor under the pressure of shareholders and advertisers, contradictory financial interests, mercantile NGOs and religions in search of new beliefs"". In his book, Verdier vaunted the ""merits"" of climate change - the attraction to tourists, lower heating costs in winter, better wine and champagne. No one denounced him as a nut case. He told Les Inrockuptibles magazine he decided to write his book when foreign minister Laurent Fabius, who will preside over the COP21 climate change conference in December, urged weathermen to report on ""climate chaos"". Fabius appeared on a magazine cover as a weatherman with the title ""500 days to save the planet"". ""If a minister decides he is Mr Weatherman, then Mr Weatherman can also express himself on the subject in a lucid manner,"" Verdier said.Asked about Verdier, Fabius said, ""If one is a serious scientist, there is no debate Of course, in history there have been famous precedents of minorities who were right. But one mustn't invert reason and say that just because they are a tiny minority, they are scientifically right.""On November 1st, Verdier posted a video in which he read his dismissal notice in silence. Delphine Ernotte, chief executive of France T\'e9l\'e9visions, told Paris Match that her employees ""must distinguish between personal opinions and what may be attributed to the company. He confused these, and that's a problem for me.""Daniel Schneidermann, an editorial writer for Lib\'e9ration newspaper, warned of the ""Streisand effect"" whereby attempted censorship merely amplifies the internet audience. ""Firing [Verdier] will make the presenter an instant martyr of climate skepticism,"" he predicted.In other ""climate chaos"", socialist politicians have clashed, yet again, over air pollution in Paris. In the face of predicted peak levels of pollution yesterday and today, Anne Hidalgo, the socialist mayor of Paris, and Jean-Paul Huchon, the socialist president of the \'cele-de-France (Paris) region, demanded that environment minister S\'e9gol\'e8ne Royal activate a plan to limit traffic to cars with odd or even plate numbers on alternate days.Royal, in Beijing with President Fran\'e7ois Hollande, said the plan would not be activated before tomorrow, and only if peak levels were reached. (They were not.) As accusations of incompetence and bureaucracy flew, it became clear no one is certain who holds ultimate responsibility for activating the anti-pollution plan.In an earlier clash over anti-pollution measures last spring, Hidalgo said ""the health of Parisians is non-negotiable"", while Royal said it was not reasonable to impose the hardship of odd/even car days on residents of the suburbs.\l"

The priority of French authorities was to prevent panic, perhaps because France produces 75 per cent of its electricity in nuclear power plants, the highest share in the world.On April 28th, 1986, the evening news presenter on public television reported in all seriousness that a high-pressure zone from the Azores would block radiation at the French border.""From a public health point of view, there is no risk,"" the deputy head of the health ministry's radiation protection service said. ""Cloud stopped at the border,"" was Lib\'e9ration newspaper's mocking, front- page summation of the government's position.Decades of investigations, accusations and lawsuits over alleged misinformation followed. The true effects of Chernobyl in France were never fully elucidated.The French comforted themselves with the knowledge that their plants, unlike Chernobyl, are encased in concrete. Likewise, when the nuclear accident occurred at Fukushima in 2011, the French said their country was not threatened by powerful earthquakes or tsunamis.""This reasoning is wrong,"" Pierre-Franck Chevet, the president of the Nuclear Safety Authority (ASN), said in an unusually forthright interview with Le Monde today.""We could have earthquakes or floods greater than expected in France, acts of malevolence against a plant,"" Chevet said.""To think it only happens to others means you're not accepting the consequences . . . Japan was caught by surprise . . . We could be too."" Dismantling costs The electricity company EDF needs EUR 55 billion to renovate 58 nuclear reactors on 19 sites, to extend their lifespan from 40 to 50 years. But it has neither the means to prolong their service nor the EUR 74 billion the EU Commission says it will cost to dismantle them in coming decades.One lesson of Chernobyl was that a nuclear accident does not spare one's neighbours. Switzerland recently filed a lawsuit over the Bugey plant in eastern France, for ""deliberately endangering the lives of others"".On Sunday, hundreds of people, most of them German, demonstrated against Fessenheim, France's oldest, 39-year-old nuclear reactor, in Alsace. The German government has long demanded it be shut down. To satisfy intermittent allies in the Green Party, President Fran\'e7ois Hollande promised in 2012 that he would close Fessenheim in 2016. At his annual environmental conference yesterday, Hollande promised to sign the closure order this year. But Fessenheim will remain in service at least until 2018. It cannot be shut down until the new European pressurised reactor (EPR) at Flamanville, on the English Channel, comes onl"

He said Ireland operates one of the most eco-friendly beef industries in the world. It would be foolhardy in the extreme to curb the production of beef in a country where we produce in an extensive grass-based system that is far more efficient and sustainable than elsewhere in the world, said Mr Healy.He said Irish beef has the fifth lowest carbon footprint in Europe and is far more sustainable than beef production in South America.\~He said Ireland s meat sector is also committed to the Bord Bia-led Origin Green initiative, an independently verified, national scale sustainability programme which involves a sustainability audit of all farms and the use of the Carbon Navigator tool enabling farmers to focus on improving both their economic and environmental efficiency.Mr Healy cited a World Bank statement which noted: If every cow was as good as the top 10% produced in Ireland we would have one-third less methane emissions on the planet. He also praised Taoiseach Enda Kenny for the views he expressed at the COP 21 meetings in Paris last week.\~He said Mr Kenny set out the progressive steps being taken by Ireland to meet the challenge of climate change and to further improve the efficiency and sustainability of agriculture and food production in Ireland.He singled out the exceptional performance of Irish agriculture in particular.However, the Taoiseach was criticised by environmental group Friends of The Earth for taking a soft position on climate changeFriends of the Earth director, Ois\'edn Coghlan, said: The reason we are not on track to meet our 2020 targets is because this Government has made no concerted effort to do so. It will go through its entire five year term without producing an Action Plan to reduce emissions. Compare that to the Action Plan for Jobs and you see what policy looks like when the Government is serious about setting and meeting targets. In fact, Friends of the Earth has reluctantly concluded that the Government is deliberately not trying to meet the 2020 targets, because they want to say to the European Commission look, we told you that they were too hard, make our 2030 targets easier. MII s Cormac Healy said Ireland remains very sustainable compared to food production in many other parts of the world.\~The meat sector alone supports over 100,000 jobs across farming and processing in rural Ireland and accounts for some 3.5 billion in export earnings annually, he added.\l"

They must now also consider the danger of strikes, transport chaos and even civil unrest.France has seen almost daily demonstrations by the left of the left, who demand withdrawal of a new labour law, for 2\'bd months. But participation was waning and the communist CGT, France's largest trade union, has turned to more drastic measures, including blockading petroleum refineries and storage facilities and open-ended transport strikes.Yesterday, railway workers announced daily strikes from May 31st. Civil aviation employees will strike on June 3rd, 4th and 5th. This is in addition to already scheduled train strikes today and tomorrow, marches against the labour law and blockades in French ports tomorrow, an open-ended strike in the Paris metro from June 2nd and further marches on June 14th.For the first time in the current crisis, the government yesterday used force to ""liberate"" the Esso petroleum refinery and storage depot at Fos- sur-Mer in the southeastern Bouches-du-Rh\'f4ne department, which the CGT had occupied overnight.'Burning pallets' When police from the mobile guard stormed the site at 4.30am, they encountered ""significant resistance"" including burning wood pallets and tyres, and projectiles. It took an 90 minutes to dislodge the trade unionists with water cannon and tear gas. Only one of France's eight refineries was functioning normally last night. The CGT's siege of petroleum facilities has led to panic buying in much of the country. Prime Minister Manuel Valls vowed all fuel facilities will be ""liberated"". Transport Minister Alain Vidalies said 2,400 of France's 12,000 petrol stations are dry or running out of fuel.Queues The government has ample petrol reserves, and Mr Valls has promised there will be no shortage.

""It was extraordinary. It was a wonderful performance and a wonderful evening,"" he says. ""And then the text arrived."" The message was from his step-brother, who was looking out of the window of his apartment close to the Bataclan, and was just four words long: ""It's war in Paris."" By accident, the French ambassador to Ireland had become one of the first people to learn of the horrors that were beginning to unfold across the French capital. ""I didn't understand it,"" Th\'e9bault says. ""I called him straight away, and he said there were bodies all over the avenue, and shooting everywhere. He lives on the third floor of an apartment block, and could see everything that was unfolding on the ground. So we understood quite quickly that something really terrible was happening."" Through the course of a long and sleepless night, the full extent of the Paris attacks emerged. By the next morning, with the death toll having risen to well over 100, Th\'e9bault and his compatriots were under no illusions about the threat they were facing. ""This was a coordinated, indiscriminate mass attack by people who did not care whether they themselves survived. It was a completely new form of terrorism,"" he said. ""In some ways, the word terrorism doesn't fully reflect what we are now facing. It is an ideology first, and a terror ideology second. It thrives on and enjoys the feelings of fear it creates. It has taken us into a long-term fight that will not be solved by dialogue or discussions and where no accommodation is possible, because this is a totalitarian regime that will never accept how we live."" We are meeting a few weeks after the Paris attacks. Th\'e9bault is just back from a five-day visit to the city, his first since the outrage. An air of sadness remains, he says, but so too does a determination to carry on life as normal. There is also, he says, huge gratitude for the outpouring of support the city and country has received. ""I've had so many people come up to me since the attacks and say 'we went to France this year on our holidays, and we will go again next year'. It is their act of solidarity with our people, and it is something that we are deeply grateful for,"" he says. ""We have had letters of support from all over the country, we have had drawings from children that they have made in school - all of that will go into the embassy's archive. I will never stop saying how thankful we are to the Irish people for everything they have done for us during this challenging year. For us, it has been incredibly moving."" As ambassadorial residences go, 53 Ailesbury Road is nothing short of spectacular. When it was placed on the market by the French government in 2008 it had a price tag of (EURO)60 million, - with 40 rooms and over 11,000 square feet of living space, it reportedly attracted interest from the likes of Denis O'Brien and Derek Quinlan. But by the time the year was out, the property market had collapsed and the bids received on the house had been withdrawn. So it was that when Jean-Pierre Th\'e9bault arrived in Ireland with his wife and two children in 2014, he found himself living in what had been described at the time of its aborted sale as ""by far the largest and grandest detached house in the city"". He had never been here before, but had met many Irish people over the years in his home city of Lourdes. ""The first time I saw an Irish flag, it was flying over one of the hotels in Lourdes. It caught my eye as a child because it was a tricolour, just like ours - it made me want to find out more about it,"" he says. The year-round population of Lourdes is a modest 18,000, but every year it attracts eight million visitors. ""It's a really unique place to grow up, because it's very local and very international at the same time,"" Th\'e9bault says. ""I have no doubt that my diplomatic career was inspired by the fact that, even as a very young boy, I was meeting people who had come to Lourdes from all over the world."" He studied history at university before furthering his studies at the Paris Political Sciences Institute and the National School of Administration, then joined the ministry of foreign affairs in 1988. By 1992 he was a special adviser on European affairs in the office of the prime minister. The following year brought both his 30th birthday and his most challenging assignment to date, as head of a European monitoring and negotiating mission in the former Yugoslavia. He led a team of some 60 military personnel attempting to monitor the situation in war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina and, where possible, negotiate ceasefires, prisoner exchanges and the return of the bodies of casualties to their families. ""It was very challenging. We were unarmed, with only flak jackets and helmets for protection, and we were very easy targets. But it was the type of mission where as a diplomat you felt that you were having a real, tangible effect on the situation on the ground,"" he says. ""One of the proudest days of my life was when I was able to reach agreement to get the first food convoy into eastern Mostar [the city was under siege]. We knew that if we didn't get that convoy through, it could be a week before we could try again, and the civilian population was suffering terribly, as they always do in these situations."" He spent two years in the former Yugoslavia; it made him ""a very convinced European"", he says. ""It's easy to criticise Europe, but what is the alternative? The former Yugoslavia could have been a brilliant example of Europe working together to ease a transition to democracy. But instead we didn't pay enough attention, and a truly terrible war broke out,"" he says. ""We must not forget the lessons of that war. We must always remember that peace is not a given - it is something that we must actively defend. ""Nothing that we have built as Europeans could have been possible without us all contributing to it, and nothing will be kept if we do not realise that it is up to us to express a strong political commitment to it. ""We need a Europe that is completely embraced not only by its governments, but by its people."" More than (EURO)8 billion worth of goods and services were traded between Ireland and France last year; the country is our sixth-largest trading partner. Over 200 Irish firms, among them Glen Dimplex, Accenture, CRH and Smurfit-Kappa, operate in France - between them, that group of 200 employs over 16,000 staff. Here, around 130 French companies employ 13,000 people. It is by any measure a prosperous relationship, but Th\'e9bault believes there is plenty of scope to grow it. The agreement on climate change, which was negotiated in Paris before Christmas, will not only benefit the environment, he believes, but the business landscape too. ""COP21""France and Ireland are already cooperating strongly in areas like sustainable energy, sustainable transport and energy efficiency, and this gives us the opportunity to do even more."" A special France/Ireland forum on sustainable energy will take place next spring, according to Th\'e9bault, and will gather together national and local government representatives as well as businesses and researchers. In another initiative designed to boost relations, a number of young Irish and French students interested in careers in the hospitality and tourism sectors will travel to study and train in each other's countries. Those links, Th\'e9bault says, make him feel ""very close to at home"" in Ireland. He and his wife Aurore have taken their two young children on a family holiday to Mayo (""I promised Aurore good weather and lobsters; we got the lobsters at least""), and he himself has visited areas including west Cork, Galway and Carlingford. The couple are keen gastronomes, and travel regularly to discover Irish ingredients and cooking - oysters from Dungarvan and butter from west Cork are particular favourites, and here again, he believes there is scope to boost trade between both countries. ""There is great potential for Irish artisan food producers to grow their business in France,"" he says. ""I would love to see more Irish products with 'protected designation of origin' status - in France we have about 400 of them, but there are only five here. My grandfather was a farmer, so I've always had an interest in what is produced on the land, and what that says about a country and its people. It's a very strong physical expression of a culture."" That interest in Irish food extended to Christmas dinner at 53 Ailesbury Road, with the family enjoying oysters from Dungarvan, Carlingford and Galway followed by lobster thermidor, a leg of Mayo lamb with c\'eapes and girolles, and cardons \'e0 la mo\'eblle, a traditional Lyonnaise dish of chard in a marrowbone sauce. As for the wines, they too had an Irish connection, coming from two of the most famous wine geese ch\'e2teaux - Lynch-Bages and Kirwan. \l"

"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland206","Saudi Arabia a fly in ointment as countries strive to reach accord; The wealthy and influential oil nation is attempting to frustrate progress","December 9, 2015 Wednesday","The Irish Times","The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been cast as the villain of the COP21 UN climate conference.""Saudi Arabia is braking on every important subject,"" says Denis Voisin of the Nicolas Hulot Foundation. ""They're playing for time, contesting long-term objectives about reducing emissions and decarbonisation.""Liz Gallagher of the environmental think tank E3G calls Saudi Arabia ""the first and primary disrupter in the talks"". Riyadh has so far blocked attempts to enshrine the goal of a 1.5-degree ceiling on the rise in temperature. It would preserve island nations such as the Philippines, where most of the Saudis' servants come from.Saudi Arabia opposes statements about climate-friendly investment and refuses to help developing countries fighting climate change. They've even asked for assistance which, as Gallagher says, ""is a bit rich, coming from the world's 13th wealthiest country"".Pakistan as puppet The country exerts influence over the six-member Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC). When the ""Like-Minded Developing Countries Group"" decided this week to endorse the 1.5-degree goal, the GCC objected, at the Saudis' behest. Saudi Arabia uses other Sunni Muslim countries such as Pakistan ""to say things the Saudis don't want to say themselves"", says a highly placed source. The Saudis are masters at obstruction. They've banned the words ""renewable energy"" from the draft accord. They object to ""decarbonisation"" and prefer ""climate neutral"" to ""carbon neutral."" Ultimately, the linguistic arguments mask deeper issues over the objective of the accord and who assumes responsibility for fighting global warming.On the opening day of the conference, Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi called for ""emissions-reduction policies that do not discriminate against any of the energy sources"". Climate Action International, a network of more than 950 NGOs, gave al-Naimi its ""Fossil"" award for saying there should be no distinction ""between clean and dirty fuels, a statement that fundamentally undermines what everyone is trying to achieve at the climate summit"".Negotiating tactics In an interview with Elizabeth Kolbert of the New YorkerThe Saudis are defending their livelihood or as the French say, their bifteck (steak). With temperatures often above 50 degrees, they too are threatened by global warming. ""Parts of the kingdom won't be inhabitable, no matter how much technology you bring,"" says Gallagher. ""Their outdoor air-conditioning brings temperatures down from 55 degrees to 35 degrees. They do have a vested interest in a good outcome. They want to have a diversification strategy. But they want to do it on their own terms and they don't want international pressure.""With the world's largest oil reserves and lowest production costs, Saudi policy has been to drive down the price of petroleum. ""They basically want to bankrupt everybody and put them out of business so that theirs is the only oil that will be sold,"" says Gallagher. ""When they talk about the end of fossil fuels, I think they mean everybody else's but not theirs.""Anti-Americanism Alba, a group of left-leaning South American countries led by Venezuela, is also causing problems. They are motivated by anti-Americanism. ""They believe that climate change is an imperialist imposition, which is true,"" says a veteran negotiator. ""And therefore they don't want to participate in any solution that is also imperialist, where the US dictates how much money will flow, etc."" The South Americans ""can make a lot of noise and they can be very dramatic and it will get a hell of a lot more dramatic before we close on the weekend"", says the same negotiator. ""You'll have people screaming and crying and standing up on their chairs and making flamboyant multihour statements."" But ultimately, neither Saudi Arabia nor Alba have the economic weight to block an agreement. ""The Saudis know the Chinese and the US need an agreement,"" says Gallagher. ""So they're not going to bring down the show. What they will do is systematically undermine the quality of the deal coming out of here.""Ten nations yet to pledge on emissions Of the 195 countries represented at the UN climate change discussions, 185 have submitted pledges. The 10 which have yet to do so, in order of contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions, are: VenezuelaEmits 0.83 % of global greenhouse gases Uzbekistan 0.5 % Libya 0.27% North Korea0.18% Syria 0.15% Nicaragua 0.09 % Nepal 0.08% Panama0.05% East Timor 0.002% Saint Kitts and Nevis less than 0.0001%\l"

A decade ago, S\'c3\£9gol\'c3\£8ne Royal watched helplessly as Val\'c3\£9rie Trierweiler, a journalist at Paris Match magazine who is 11 years her junior, stole the heart of Fran\'c3\£7ois Hollande, moved in with the socialist party leader and eventually became first lady.Some argue the ensuing drama should be confined to the private lives of the protagonists. But Hollande and Royal are political animals, and their story of love, rivalry, rupture and reconciliation is at the core of contemporary French politics.After seven years in purgatory, Royal, who had been spurned and humiliated, has made a stunning comeback. She has resumed her role as chief supporter and adviser to Hollande, with whom she lived for 27 years. In April 2014, Hollande appointed the mother of his four children as the third-ranking member of prime minister Manuel Valls's government.Royal is no ordinary cabinet minister. Detractors say she's a temperamental and bossy diva whose restoration symbolises a decadent monarchy. Nonsense, Royal told L'Obs magazine. ""We're in France, country of the rights of man and woman, in 2015, not at Versailles under Louis XIV.""Royal's admirers say the 17 million votes she won as the only Frenchwoman to have made it to the run-off in a French presidential election confer a special status that justifies her position.Royal may be playing for higher stakes. After losing municipal, European and departmental elections since last year, the socialist party's prospects are poor in next December's regional elections. Hollande wants to be re-elected in 2017 and could sack Valls in the hope of making a fresh start. If that happens, Royal is the leading candidate to replace Valls at the prime minister's office.Royal has already become a central figure in Hollande's presidency. In January, he sent her to Jerusalem to represent France at the funerals of four Jews who were murdered during a jihadist attack on a kosher supermarket. Her presence annoyed foreign minister Laurent Fabius, who believed that as second in the government, he should have gone.In February, Royal accompanied Hollande to the Philippines to raise awareness of global warming. Their complicity was obvious at a joint press conference. When the Germanwings flight crashed in March, Royal rushed to the scene of the catastrophe with interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve. In April, she and Hollande together launched the Hermione, a replica of the frigate the Marquis de La Fayette sailed to join the American revolution. In May, she again accompanied Hollande on an official journey, this time to the Caribbean.According to L'Obs, Royal has a direct telephone l"
"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland209","Amidst devastation here, at least climate change summit offers hope for the future","December 12, 2015 Saturday","Irish Independent","THERE are five good reasons for Ireland to be cheerful about COP21, whatever the outcome of the Paris climate change summit.The result of the summit is currently unknown, but the direction of travel is clear.Countries across the globe have put together plans to tackle their emissions, many of which include renewableenergy generation targets. Strong policy signals about the transition to a lowcarbon economy are already reverberating across the globe.The prospect of success at the Paris summit has been boosted because the two biggest emitting countries in the world, the US and China, have started taking decisive action on climate change.Ireland is playing its part, but the chances of success are beginning to feel real as the big players come on board.China has said its emissions will peak by 2030 as it looks to combat the smog blighting some of its cities and show leadership on climate change.The US has released a Clean Power Plan to radically overhaul and decarbonise its power sector. It is estimated that the rule will cut powersector emissions 32pc below the 2005 levels by 2030.The G7 nations agreed to phase out fossil fuels altogether by the end of the century and for emissions to be cut by between 40pc and 70pc by 2050, compared with 2010 levels.So that's the good news and the indications are that Ireland and other nations will benefit from a legally binding agreement before delegates leave Paris. Here are five reasons why we can all be positive about the prospects for a sustainable future: 1. CARBON PRICING Regional carbon-trading schemes are being created as governments look to put a price on emissions. China is set to create what is expected to be the biggest scheme in the world in 2017.The EU's emissions-trading system is on the mend after politicians stepped in to tackle an oversupply of allowances.In North America, schemes in California and on the east coast are gaining traction, and it is thought that the Clean Power Plan could pave the way for other states to initiate carbon trading.2. COMPANIES Not only are governments beginning to take decisive action against climate change, but businesses are now also leading the way.Many have now recognised that climate change is a material issue for them.Companies such as Apple and IKEA are sourcing their own power from renewables.Apple's investment in a new Data Centre in Athenry and the Docklands21 initiative to build a Sustainable Energy Community (SEC) in the IFSC and Silicon Docks are hugely positive steps.The global environmental disclosure organisation, the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), recently said the number of companies with emissions targets has doubled since 2010. In Ireland, 28 of Ireland's leading corporates report under the CDP Climate Change programme, including Kingspan, which recently achieved an A grade.3. INVESTORS Investors are increasingly realising that environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors are material. Some 1,380 firms representing a combined $59 trillion of assets have signed the UN Principles for Responsible Investment, which sees them commit to incorporate ESG factors into their investment decisions.Sonen Capital, a USbased impact investment management firm, is the latest ESG focused fund to domicile here. In Ireland, some $36bn is already deployed into Irishled sustainability projects and enterprises, funds managed or domiciled.4. STRANDED ASSETS Some investors are increasingly taking seriously the risk that fossil fuel investments could be devalued or rendered 'stranded' as policies are brought in to discourage the burning of fossil fuels.5. GREEN BONDS The green bond market has emerged as an increasingly popular tool in recent years for investors to channel resources into investments with an environmental theme. Since 2007, the market has grown rapidly and is thought to have seen $40bn of issues so far this year.Green bonds have the potential to help fund the transition to a low-carbon economy and countries such as India and China are actively encouraging the issuance of green bonds. A Europe-wide 'Green bond' seminar will be hosted by the ISI Centre in Dublin in January.IRELAND'S OPPORTUNITY Ireland is emerging as a hub for environmental finance by attracting a greater share of green assets, either under management or domiciled. BlackRock Renewable Power, Greencoat Capital, Brookfield Renewable and Kleinwort Benson Investors are amongst an emerging investment cluster.The country's businesses are looking overseas where their expertise is helping to finance, develop and construct sustainability related projects across the globe.The sector, a cluster of over 600 firms, is creating innovative, world-beating solutions with firms like Glen Dimplex, Cylon, OpenHydro, FenestraPro, SELC, OxyMem and Climote to the fore. Such firms are creating jobs and winning global investment.Opportunities for Ireland - founded on our financial expertise, innovative and entrepreneurial abilities - are emerging, holding the potential of sustainable growth and economic prosperity as the world transitions to a low carbon model.Stephen Nolan is CEO of the International Sustainability and Investment Centre, Ireland's partner to CLIMATEKIC, Europe's largest public-private innovation partnership focused on climate change. \l"
"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland210","Environmentally friendly questions for our politicians","February 3, 2016","Kerryman (Ireland)","BETWEEN now and the end of February every politician in the land will be looking for your vote so be prepared for some extra visitors on the doorstep. Environmental issues may not be very high up on the agenda of many of those seeking a seat in D\'e1il \'c9ireann, but if we do not ask the questions, they'll have no idea of our concerns. This week we look at some of the questions that should be put to anyone looking for your vote.CLIMATE CHANGE Question: What is your policy on climate change? Food 2025 is part of government policy to increase the current herd of 7.1 million cattle by 300,000 by 2025. Almost 1/3 of our current greenhouse gas emissions now come from agriculture. Methane, produced by cattle, is 20 times more heat retentive in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide.Increasing the national herd is a contradiction of Ireland's commitment to climate change at COP 21The response will probably be that Ireland is producing food more sustainably and more efficiently than other countries and that if Ireland reduces or does not increase its output, other countries will produce the food in a less sustainable way.Your response: (1) This is the 'race to the bottom' argument. Germany will say it produces cars more efficiently. Poland will claim it produces coal more efficiently. Each country has its own pet project.(2) All this extra milk and meat will not feed the poor.(3) A large portion of the extra milk that will be produced is to be exported as powdered milk to China. This will discourage Chinese mothers who are now breast feeding their children and will result in them changing to powdered milk.(4) The production of meat requires far more energy in the form of land, animal fodder and fertilisers than the production of vegetables. From a health point of view, we should not be encouraging the consumption of more meat. In a world of 8 or 9 billion people, more food will have to come from cereals, rootcrops and vegetables.TRANSPORT If we increase emissions from cattle, we have to reduce emissions from either energy or transport. So, here are some interesting questions that arise from that: Have you any plans to increase public transport in this area? Can we have a smarter travel project in our town? We need more cycling routes for residents and visitors. What can you offer? ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF ENERGY Questions: Why is there not more support for community based alternative energy co-operatives instead of supporting huge corporations supplying power to Ireland Do you think the grants for retro-fitting houses are sufficient in light of our commitment to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions? What support are you giving for the installation of photo-voltaic panels (similar to solar panels but excess energy can be sold back to the national grid)?\l"
"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland211","Special treatment for 'rich' Ireland may be hard to justify; Ireland has vowed to continuously cut emissions from the agricultural sector","December 12, 2015 Saturday","The Irish Times","The Government's approach to the climate talks in Paris could be summed up by the country expression: ""You can't run with the hare and chase with the hounds.""On the one hand Ireland has played its full part as part of the EU negotiating block, seeking ambitious long-term goals, transparency, and momentum towards the target of a 1.5 degrees Celsius limit on global temperature increases.On the other hand, both Taoiseach Enda Kenny and Minister for the Environment Alan Kelly have made the same argument about protecting Irish agriculture. It's a growing sector in Ireland, helped by the removal of quotas. It comprises 12 per cent of GDP, and there are plans to increase the national herd by 300,000. The Government says this can be achieved without increasing emissions.But emissions in this sector are already high (a third of all Irish emissions). Even without Europe moving to more ambitious emissions target in Paris, Ireland will face an uphill struggle to meet 2030 targets. It has essentially argued a special case for Ireland on the basis that Irish agriculture is among the most sustainable in the world. If it doesn't succeed in that argument the State will be on the hook for hundreds of millions of euro in annual carbon charges. The focus will now turn to Brussels in spring when EUstates will debate how to divide the burden of meeting the EU's 2030 targets. Mr Kelly yesterday stressed the inclusion of reference to ""food security"" in the text of the proposed agreement, which he said acknowledged the reality that food will have to be produced for a rising global population.""Ireland is a very environmentally friendly producer of food, will continue to do so. We will continuously reduce our emissions from the agricultural sector."" Richest countries But climate expert Prof John Sweeney said with economic growth Ireland would be one of the richest countries again in two to three years' time. ""I just do not expect to see any special favours for Irish agriculture,"" he said. He said it was incumbent on every country to share the burden, and Ireland had to put a price on agricultural emissions under the ""polluter pays"" principle. ""Agriculture and food companies should be brought into the net. I don't see Ireland getting special treatment for agriculture in the longer term. We will have to adjust our agriculture and our agriculture taxation system to reflect that.""Prof Brian \'d3 Gallach\'f3ir from the department of energy policy in UCC said there had been less discussion on heat and transport, even though they comprised 80 per cent of energy use.""We have higher emission per capita because of dispersed population. We have a poor standard in building stock, though there have been improvements in new buildings. We still have a large legacy stock. ""The challenge is to persuade one million households of the benefits of retrofitting their homes.""Another reality that will emerge from Paris is that all transport will have to be electrified by midcentury. ""In the public transport area, electric vehicles do not exist in the Irish bus fleet,"" said Prof Sweeney. ""They were using hybrid buses in Paris for COP 21. The network in Paris is electrifying in the next three years. ""We cannot make excuses, because we won't be poor.""\l"
"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland212","Ireland can play vital role in resolving refugee crisis; We need to keep seeing the Syrian conflict as primarily a humanitarian issue and not one of border secu....","January 7, 2016 Thursday","The Irish Times","The photograph on the front page of yesterday's Irish Times brought me back to a beach near Izmir in Turkey last month. The beach I went to was littered with shoes, backpacks and packaging for outboard motors and life-jackets.Picking through the debris of Syria's awful war, I could only imagine the anxiety of parents as they loaded their children into boats. I was told that smugglers would take no more than six children on each boat and that children under five went for free.Yesterday's picture also put in mind the restless anger that we all felt at the photo of Alan Kurdi last September. Somehow the mood has changed. Politicians and the media are now focused on how to deal with two ""problems"" - the refugee problem and the Islamic State problem. But if both were comprehensively dealt with tomorrow this would take you back to summer 2014, before Islamic State, also known as Isis, had captured great swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq, and before the tide of refugees arrived in Europe.Back then, the conflict in Syria had already been accepted as the worst humanitarian crisis since the end of the cold war and the worst refugee crisis since the second World War.It must be obvious that the two issues (Islamic State and refugees) are downstream consequences of the original source of these problems: the government of Bashar al-Assad. To paraphrase Winston Churchill, even if the deluge of refugees was to subside and even if Islamic State was to be defeated, what would emerge would be the integrity of that originating quarrel. In spite of this, and informed by the obsession with refugees and Islamic State, insufficient attention has been directed towards resolution of the conflict. Some voices are even calling for Assad to be part of the solution. Disastrous models of succession In support of this viewpoint, frequently cited are the examples of the turmoil in Libya and Iraq following the fall of Col Muammar Gadafy and Saddam Hussein respectively. Clearly these disastrous models of succession are not to be recommended. But to even contemplate a future Syria with the house of Assad still in charge is Pollyannaism in the extreme. It is clearly in Assad's interests that the West focuses on Islamic State, so much so that the recent Russian military intervention that purports to target Islamic State has targeted all anti-Assad targets bar Islamic State.Solutions across the European Union must be found for the absence of EU solidarity on refugee intake. But perspective is important. If I told you that the population of the EU had increased in 2015 by 0.2 per cent you would probably think that that was a bit low and a strong indicator of the difficult demographic problems that lie ahead for our ageing population. More than a million refugees and migrants arrived in Europe in 2015. That is 0.2 per cent of the population of the EU. Notwithstanding this, the EU finds itself unable to cope. Fundamental freedoms, Schengen and all the principles of solidarity that form the basis for the EU are under pressure because of what Peter Sutherland referred to before Christmas as ""ruinously selfish behaviour"". German chancellor Angela Merkel's policies can succeed only if her generosity is matched by other member states.One hundred and fifty thousand migrants came to Ireland in 2007 alone (net migration was more than 100,000). We coped well with that number and significant numbers in the years previously. While times have changed, the economic recovery looks real and sustainable. It is incredible to hear Irish politicians say we should bear in mind there are still people on housing lists, as though we should wait until all social problems have been addressed before demonstrating solidarity with those fleeing crippling violence.If that argument was applied in Turkey and Lebanon, where would Syrians go? There are four million Syrian refugees in countries in the region. Is it good enough to say to Turkey: ""Tough luck, they landed in your country?"" Burden-sharing is the core of multilateralism. Election manifestos As we approach election season in Ireland, manifestos should have clear policies on the issue of Ireland's place in this debate. There will be a sense of trying to avoid politicising the issue. Such an approach would be mistaken. This is the compelling issue of our time. It is important that serious political comment is made on issues such as integration and migration generally. And there are many positive proposals that should be looked at. First, after our special pleading at , we should re-establish our multilateral credentials and drive hard for an international summit on migration and displaced populations, fed by citizens' forums at which issues around integration and diversity could be addressed.Second, while Ireland's peace process in not necessarily transferable, many lessons can be learned from our experience of the institutions and political economy of peace and reconciliation. Along with our status as a non-belligerent EU member state we have credibility and we should use it.Most of all we should continue to look at the Syrian conflict through a humanitarian lens and not through the lens of border security.

Quite probably there were three terrorist groups, who were co-ordinated, who originated these barbaric acts. In Belgium, the raids followed French requests related to a Belgian-plated rental car found near the Bataclan concert hall, Belgium s Federal Prosecutor s office told reporters.Police and intelligence agencies across Europe and beyond are racing to determine who was responsible for Friday s assaults, which French President Fran\'e7ois Hollande called an act of war .[media=bbw]2548605[/media]The slaughter compounds one of the deepest crises facing European leaders since the Second World War as they struggle to accommodate a stream of refugees from war-torn Syria while also facing jihadist retribution for air strikes on Islamic State.According to Molins, one of the three teams operating on Friday consisted of a trio of suicide bombers at the Stade de France, who wore identical explosive vests. A second drove to multiple locations in east-central Paris, firing hundreds of rounds from Kalashnikov rifles.And a third went to the Bataclan, where 89 people were slain before police stormed the theater, killing one gunman. The other two killed themselves with explosive vests, Molins said.Molins said information was still preliminary, and that police are working on the basis of witness statements and surveillance-camera footage. It s unclear whether additional suspects are still being pursued.In a statement posted on Twitter claiming responsibility, Islamic State said the violence was in retaliation for French air strikes on what it calls its caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria. The attacks are the first drop in the rain, and should serve as a warning , it said.For the extremist group, the killings signal a structural shift in its modus operandi, representing a prelude to additional attacks in the West , political consultancy Eurasia Group said.[media=bbw]2548779[/media]Islamic State s leadership is committing to a strategy of pursuing retaliatory attacks against any country conducting airstrikes on its bases in Iraq and Syria , the note said.Ninety-nine people remain in critical condition, among a total of 352 injured, according to Molins. The death toll, which he warned could still rise due to the number of seriously wounded victims, is the largest for a terror attack in Europe since the 2004 train bombings in Madrid.Among the rapid developments in the aftermath of the assault:Marine Le Pen, leader of the hard-right National Front political party, said the attacks were evidence of the need for France to take back definitive control of its borders and strip French terrorists of their nationality;Laurent Fabius, France s foreign minister, said the United Nations COP21 climate talks scheduled for late November and early December in Paris would go ahead as planned, with reinforced security. Over 120 world leaders are expected to attend the conference;The Paris stock exchange operator said it would open trading as normal today .

How many migrants will Ireland take, the Taoiseach was questioned at every turn.At a breakfast - organised by Enterprise Ireland and the Irish Embassy - on the top floor of the Sofitel, with a panoramic view over the Rh\'f4ne river and Lyons, Mr Kenny witnessed the signing of Franco-Irish contracts totalling EUR 5 million.""My presence here is to give witness to opportunities in the Lyons region,"" he said. Fifteen Irish firms will visit Lyons on a trade mission in November.Tricel, from Killarney, Co Kerry, makes sewage-treatment plants for buildings not connected to public systems. Bacteria that live in three- chambered tanks eat the waste and die, managing director Mike Stack explained. Tricel produces the tanks at a factory in Poitiers. ""More than five million homes in France are not connected - that's 50 per cent of the European market,"" Mr Stack said.Wood-pellet boilers Wood Energy Solutions, which makes boilers fuelled by wood pellets, signed deals with French, Swiss and Spanish firms. Enterprise Ireland had invited the small company from Cahir, Co Tipperary, to a trade show in Saint-\'c9tienne in 2013. ""We dipped our toe in the French market at that exhibition and met our French and Swiss partners,"" said technical director Declan Crosse.Derek Bryan, vice-president for sales at Fleetmatics, met the Taoiseach when he inaugurated the company's Tallaght headquarters in 2012. Mr Bryan said Fleetmatics was ""the fastest growing software company in vehicle tracking globally"". Its technology keeps watch on the maintenance, location, speed and fuel levels of fleets of vehicles. Fleetmatics bought the French firm Ornicar in Grenoble last February. It is a growth sector. At 15 per cent, French market penetration is much lower than Britain's 30-40 per cent, because French drivers object to the idea of ""Big Brother"" watching them. Mr Collomb welcomed Mr Kenny in the city's 17th-century town hall. Its magnificence bears witness to the fortune Lyons built on silk and textiles. Today, Mr Collomb said, it is a leader in life sciences, green and digital technology.Though nominally a socialist, Mr Collomb is allied with jis party's economically liberal, reformist wing, and like Mr Kenny he is gung-ho on business. The Taoiseach briefed him on his discussion of the migration crisis and the Cop 21 climate conference with Mr Hollande. They talked about the Irish recovery, their mutual desire to fight youth unemployment, French debt and the need for labour-market reform in France. Mr Collomb said he found the Taoiseach ""very warm and straightforward and very engaged"".Mr Kenny invited Mr Collomb to tag along with Mr Hollande when he visits Dublin next summer.

Each laid a long-stemmed rose outside the Bataclan concert hall, where 89 were killed.Yesterday, an explosives belt believed to have been abandoned by Salah Abdeslam, one of the attackers, was found in a public litter box in Montrouge, south of Paris. Abdeslam's mobile telephone was detected near Montrouge before he fled to Belgium. ""The United Kingdom will do all in our power to support our friend and ally France to defeat this evil death cult,"" Mr Cameron said at the \'c9lys\'e9e.Air base Mr Cameron offered France the use of the British sovereign air base at Akrotiri, Cyprus. The two countries last shared the air base for a joint attack on Nasser's Egypt in 1956. Britain has also offered to refuel French aircraft on long-range sorties.Referring to the stepped-up air raids on Islamic State, also known as Isis, Mr Hollande said: ""We will choose the targets that yield the best possible damage against the terrorist army."" The arrival of the Charles de Gaulle in the eastern Mediterranean triples France's strike force from 12 aircraft, based in Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, to 36.Mr Cameron hopes the atrocities in Paris will help him win parliamentary approval for British intervention in Syria. (Britain already participates in attacks against Islamic State in Iraq.) ""Later this week I will set out in parliament our comprehensive strategy for tackling [Islamic State],"" he said.France believes two steps it has already completed will provide arguments to Mr Cameron and other leaders who want to strike at Islamic State. The UN Security Council passed resolution 2249 on November 20th, exactly one week after the Paris attacks. And EU defence ministers voted unanimously on November 17th to assist France under article 42.7 of the Treaty of Lisbon. Negotiations Gen Beno\'eet Puga, Mr Hollande's chief of staff, has started bilateral negotiations to determine how France's European partners can best help.Resolution 2249 calls on UN member states to ""take all necessary measures"" against Islamic State. France would have preferred to invoke Chapter VII of the UN charter, which authorises military force, but feared getting bogged down in lengthy negotiations.By November 29th, Mr Hollande will have met with the leaders of the other four permanent members of the Security Council. At the same time, he will engage in last-minute negotiations before the UN COP21 climate conference.Mr Hollande will fly to Washington DC today to meet President Barack Obama. He will dine with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, in Paris tomorrow. On Thursday, he will have breakfast with Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi, attend the France-Oceania summit and travel to Moscow to see President Vladimir Putin.Mr Hollande built his career in the French socialist party as l'homme de la synth\'e8se, who always managed to conciliate opposing views. He now hopes to bring the US and Russia together, though Washington insists that Syrian president Bashar al-Assad must step down, while Moscow wants him to remain in power for as long as possible.Versailles speech Mr Hollande's speech in Versailles last week was widely interpreted to mean that France had altered its position on Mr Assad. ""In Syria, we resolutely, tirelessly seek a political solution in which Bashar al-Assad cannot constitute the outcome, but our enemy in Syria is [Islamic State],"" Mr Hollande said.A source close to Mr Hollande now says ""there is no reason to abandon one objective for the other. It was Islamic State that attacked France. That doesn't mean we will make less effort to make Bashar leave.""At Versailles, Mr Hollande said he was working to establish ""a grand and unique coalition"" to fight Islamic State. His entourage now prefer to speak of ""co-ordination"" through a ""cluster of bilateral proposals"" with France at the centre of that ""cluster.""""It is what you would expect of a country that was hit so hard,"" an official said. ""It was unspeakable what happened to us . . . We're a country that is trying to react with its allies.""Mr Putin met with Iran's president, Hassan Rohani, and supreme guide, Ali Khamenei, in Tehran yesterday. France believes Mr Putin is now less attached to Mr Assad, and hopes to drive a wedge between the dictator's most stalwart allies.On Sunday, Mr Hollande will meet with UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, lunch with Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and dine with Chinese president Xi Jinping.\l"

Environment minister Mark H Durkan ....","March 11, 2016 Friday","The Irish News","Mark H Durkan says he didn't really value the environment before he was handed the portfolio in July 2013. His attitude has since changed but the 38-year-old Foyle MLA remains to be convinced that his ministerial colleagues share his positive assessment of the natural world. To illustrate this he points to an executive proposal to name the new department that will have responsibility for farming and environmental matters.""They wanted to call it simply the Department of Agriculture and I took exception to this as it clearly relegated the importance of the environment and suggested environmental policy and protection was going to be subsumed into the new department rather than merged with it,"" he says.""Sadly it reflected where the environment sits on other ministers and other parties' list of priorities.""Despite the general lack of concern at executive level, he believes the north's environment has ""dramatically improved"" in recent decades.""It's no coincidence that we've been a member of the EU during this time,"" he says.""They keep us on our toes.""He therefore believes a Brexit would be a setback for Northern Ireland.""I think leaving the EU would be catastrophic for the north as a whole and it certainly wouldn't do our environment any good,"" the minister says, adding that ""fear of infraction has concentrated minds around the executive table"".As he prepares to clear his desk before the Department of Environment is confined to history and its responsibilities absorbed into the new Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera), Mr Durkan reflects on his three years as a minister.The positives he takes from his time in charge are a tightening of road safety measures, the creation of a strategic planning policy and safeguarding the region's built heritage.On the downside, he's failed to convince his executive colleagues of the need for a climate change bill. Like his predecessor and party colleague Alex Attwood, who early in the mandate was thwarted in his efforts to create national parks, Mr Durkan points to objections from the powerful farming lobby.""I circulated discussion paper on climate change and while responses were overwhelmingly in favour of the legislation you have what you might describe as the usual suspects, who believe there's no need for such legislation,"" he says.The minister believes in working with farmers and the agrifood sector and points to last year's Cop21Mr Durkan is so convinced by the need to curb climate change gases that in the event of the new Daera minister not showing any enthusiasm for legislation, he will introduce a private members bill.""If I'm lucky enough to be returned to Stormont, I'll be looking to bring forward a private members bill but I believe that it's such a huge issue it should be led by the department and by the minister,"" he says, pointing to two recent assembly votes that have endorsed his aim.The ""usual suspects"" are again cited for their resistance to the creation of an independent environmental watchdog, a body the minister believes is all the more important now that his department is being dissolved.""I think it should be independent and not be restricted by conflicting policy objectives in government departments or even within one government department,"" he says.""There's continued concern that within the new department alongside agriculture that environmental protection might be relegated in terms of its importance.""Mr Durkan admits that being the sole SDLP minister in the executive can be ""lonely"" and frustrating.""I've seen how it works from the inside but I've also seen why it doesn't work,"" he says.""What you tend to see around the executive table is the tip of the iceberg - a lot of the dealing and deals between the two big parties happens behind closed doors and they usually come to executive meetings with agreed positions on things.""As an illustration of how things sometimes work, the minister points to proposals he first tabled in November 2014 to extend emergency financial assistance for flood victims to businesses, churches and community organisations.""The other parties sat on it for 15 months then lo-and behold in January this year they stole it as when it was Dard and DFP announced they were bringing forward this scheme,"" he says.How did he react?""I just laugh - it was kind of pathetic.""So after his experience in the executive does he advocate the SDLP returning to government after May's election?""Whether we go into the executive depends what's on the table and us having a imprimatur on the new programme for government,"" he says.""While it's depressing at times at the executive table at least we're seeing more of what's going on - as you wonder how much they'd try to get away with if they weren't being watched so closely."" \l"
"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland218","Hollande approaches Washington and Moscow in bid to form 'grand coalition'; President's initiative has been greeted with sarcasm by Putin","November 18, 2015 Wednesday","The Irish Times","Even as Paris steps up its military intervention in Syria, French president Fran\'e7ois Hollande has launched a diplomatic offensive aimed at uniting international efforts in the war against Islamic State (IS).Since the IS attacks that killed 129 people in Paris, Hollande has been dreaming of uniting two international coalitions that are working at cross purposes in Syria. The Moscow-Tehran-Damascus axis seeks to keep Syrian president Bashar al-Assad in power. Moscow and Tehran are the only foreign parties to the conflict who have shown a willingness to commit ground troops.The other coalition, led by the US and including France, says Assad's departure should be a prerequisite for military cooperation with Moscow and Tehran. Washington fears the Russians and Iranians might otherwise misuse intelligence on US-backed opposition groups.There are also fissures within the US-led coalition. Turkey gives priority to preventing the emergence of a Kurdish state, while Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Arabs - the main financiers of the rebellion - rabidly oppose Assad but are ambiguous on IS. Conflicting interests Hollande has stepped into this tangle of conflicting interests. He began efforts to build a ""grand coalition"" at a meeting with US secretary of state John Kerry yesterday. Kerry expressed their shared determination to ""fight and defeat together the psychopathic monsters"" of IS. But Kerry told journalists travelling with him there could be no military co-operation until there was a ceasefire and political transition. It would be impossible to defeat IS unless Assad left. ""He's complicit in the rise of Daesh [the Arabic acronym for IS], and therefore, as long as Assad is there, you cannot fully get rid of this [IS] phenomenon.""Hollande also talked to Iranian president Hassan Rohani by telephone to ""show the importance"" of negotiations among great powers regarding the war on IS.France nearly bridged the gap with Russia on Monday, when Hollande said IS, not Assad, was France's enemy in Syria. Russian intelligence has just confirmed that the crash of a Russian aircraft which killed 224 people on October 31st was the work of IS. Until now, 80 per cent of Russian air strikes were directed at opposition other than IS, but Vladimir Putin has said he will intensify attacks on IS because of the Sinai assault. ""The murder of our own in the Sinai is the bloodiest of crimes,"" he said. ""We must act without delay and learn the names of those responsible. We will seek them out wherever they hide. We will find them and punish them.""Putin welcomed Hollande's initiative with a sarcastic remark. ""We heard our French friends saying all the time that President Assad's departure was a precondition for political changes . . . But did that protect Paris against a terrorist attack? No."" Putin also claimed paternity for the idea of a grand coalition. ""I talked about it at the UN session marking its 70th anniversary . . . The tragic events that followed [in Paris] showed we were right,"" he said.Russian forces in Syria are based on the coast. The French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle has been redirected from the Persian Gulf to the eastern Mediterranean, where the French will co-ordinate with the Russian navy.Hollande will travel to Washington on November 24th, and Moscow on November 26th, to discuss the ""grand coalition"" with Obama and Putin respectively. But French diplomacy ""has little margin for manoeuvre"", warned Bernard Badie, an expert on international relations at the Sciences Po educational institute. ""Things get played out between the Russians and Americans, and we try to get involved.""Hollande enjoyed more immediate success after invoking article 42.7 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty, on the ""aid and assistance"" owed to member states who are ""the victim of armed aggression"".Vote of support French defence minister Jean-Yves Le Drian called a unanimous vote of support by EU defence ministers yesterday ""a political act of great importance"" which would ""enable us, in the coming hours, to hold the necessary bilateral meetings"". Le Drian's entourage said other EU states might contribute weapons or aircraft to France's war effort.France also received financial relief from Brussels. ""The pact of security is more important than the [EU's] stability pact,"" Hollande said in his speech at a special congress of both houses of parliament on Monday, referring to France's commitment to bring deficit spending under 3 per cent by 2017. Paris has received repeated postponements from the European Commission. The budget limits ""will have to be exceeded"", French prime minister Manuel Valls said yesterday. As a result of the IS attacks, Hollande has promised to recruit 8,500 personnel for the ministries of the interior and justice. Pierre Moscovici, commissioner for economic affairs, said the commission ""understands the priority for security"".The COP21But he added: ""Everything outside the COP, a whole series of concerts and festive events, will probably be cancelled."" However, uncertainty surrounds the grand march between Place de la R\'e9publique and Place de la Nation, scheduled for November 29th, the eve of the conference.

"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland219","Invest, innovate and educate to solve challenge posed by climate change","April 23, 2016 Saturday","Irish Independent","THE signing of the Paris Agreement by Ireland and 170 other governments brings into sharp focus the fact that there is no time like the present to get serious about addressing climate change. History tells us a lot can happen in a short time, but the next decade is critical for effective actions on global warming.Our understanding of the Earth's climate, and the role we have in changing it, is a major scientific achievement. It was not a breakthrough made by one scientist, but a culmination of efforts that are central to our fundamental human curiosity about our world and how it works.In Ireland, monuments like Newgrange reflect this curiosity.It was built to chart the changing cycles of light and dark, and the seasons. This understanding allowed forecasting of the coming summer and planning for a new year.The award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2007 is really an award to the hundreds of scientists who put the scientific jigsaw puzzle of our climate system together.We can now look back to when Newgrange was built, and beyond that, and chart how and why the Earth's climate changed over centuries and millennia.Importantly, we can also project what may happen to our climate system in this century and beyond.The key information is that we are irreversibly changing our climate system. That was the message from science to last December's meeting in Paris. The detail carefully presented by the IPCC to governments is compelling and stark; warming is unequivocal, the human influence is clear, and the need to take action is urgent if large-scale global impacts are to be avoided.The response by world leaders was also compelling. They agreed to collectively work to hold average global temperature increases to well below 2\'b0C relative to pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\'b0C. They also agreed to enhance adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience to the impacts of climate change that are now inevitable. Importantly, they agreed to make finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate resilience development.Among the details is agreement to peak global greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible and reach a balance between emissions and removals, by sinks such as forests, in the second half of the century.The Paris Agreement effectively takes on board the necessity to decarbonise global energy systems and enhance land management to increase uptake of carbon dioxide.Scientifically, reaching net zero carbon dioxide emissions is an imperative if we are to stabilise the global climate system.Ireland's National Policy Statement on climate change and the White Paper on Energy outl"

Willie won through eventually. Junior Minister Simon Harris deserves mention for his persistence in his ascent of the greasy pole.Tall tale of the year award: Enda Kenny, take a bow.

"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland221","PUTTING PEOPLE IN GREEN HOUSES; We're making progress, but Ireland still needs to change how it thinks about sustainable homes","December 12, 2015 Saturday","The Irish Times","As we digest the warnings and promises from the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris, there is one industry that is poised for major change in Ireland and abroad: construction. ""Every newly built house in Ireland now has to have an A3 BER"" - or building energy rating - ""under the 2011 building regulations,"" says Pat Barry of the Irish Green Building Council (igbc.ie). And, although this heralds a new era in green building, the work involved in improving the energy ratings of the 1.7 million existing homes is the other side of the coin.Some progress has been made through two grant schemes run by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (seai.ie), Better Energy Communities and Better Energy Warmer Homes, which help to cover the cost of retrofitting insulation, upgrading boilers, installing smart meters and switching to renewable energy, among other fuel-saving measures. There has also been some success because of energy providers' EU obligations to save energy by working with communities to reduce fuel poverty and improve efficiency. But there is still a strong sense that Ireland lags behind many other countries in becoming a nation of energy-efficient homes. Last year the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources published Better Buildings, Ireland's first National Renovation Strategy, for instance, which aims to reduce emissions from the country's buildings. But it lacks goals, and Ireland is off course to meet the overall EU target of saving 20 per cent of projected energy use by 2020 and 27 per cent by 2030.Buildings account for about 12 per cent of the Irish greenhouse-gas emissions, and improving buildings' energy efficiency is one of the cheapest ways to cut that figure. But to do this, organisations such as the Irish Green Building Council believe, the Government and local authorities must understand the benefits of sustainable housing. ""The Department of Health needs to see that decent housing is part of a public-health strategy, that fuel poverty and people attending A&E departments with respiratory problems are linked to poor-quality housing,"" Pat Barry says. And building contractors will need to get to grips with sustainable building methods. ""There aren't enough renovation skills in Ireland. Poor-quality insulation is worse than none at all. For example, it's critically important that good ventilation is understood by everyone in the building trade,"" says Barry. A hundred builders took part in the council's three-day Qualibuild scheme this year; from next year the EU-funded scheme is open to all builders. And the council has just published an e-book for homeowners, explaining what is required for a house to be properly insulated. For example, the concept of deep retrofitting - where floors, attics and walls are insulated, boilers upgraded and air-tight doors and windows created - isn't widely understood in Ireland. ""What happens with a shallow retrofit - attic insulation and a new boiler, for example - is that people absorb the extra comfort into their homes with no energy savings,"" Barry says. Another key issue in green building is that of cost. D\'fan Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council recently decided that all new buildings in its area should meet passive-house standards. This usually means thick insulation, triple-glazed windows, solar-powered hot water, and a heat pump or other form of renewable energy, and it would enable both commercial and residential buildings to dispense with conventional heating systems. But the Construction Industry Federation has warned that the standard will increase prices, and Nama has urged the council to reconsider the requirement. Supporters of the passive-house standard argue that building costs are not necessarily higher and that money is also saved over a lifetime of tiny heating bills. Barry says that the passive-house standards are higher than current building regulations but that costs depend on several factors. ""Green building shouldn't cost more if the architect, construction contractor and construction workers are all trained well. It's down to good design, quality building and quality supervision of work.""Greener future Paris zero-carbon pledge France's minister for ecology, S\'e9gol\'e8ne Royal, led the first day dedicated to buildings at the COP21 UN Climate Change Conference in Paris. The message was that ""green buildings are possible, healthy and profitable"" - and the outcome of the day was that 25 Green Building Councils committed to register, renovate or certify more than 1.25 billion square metres of green building space and train more than 125,000 green-building professionals by 2020. All 74 national green building councils at the event supported the World Green Building Council's commitment to achieve net-zero-carbon new building and energy-efficient refurbishment of existing buildings by 2050. A net-zero-carbon building - or net-zero-energy building, known as an NZEB in the trade - is one whose annual energy consumption roughly equals the amount of renewable energy created on the site. Buildings account for about a third of global emissions, and green buildings are one of the most cost-effective solutions to climate change, partly because it's cheaper to save energy through more efficient design than it is to produce it differently. The development of materials for green buildings brings jobs to economies, and green buildings have better indoor air quality, leading to more pleasant and healthier living and working environments. Several large construction-material firms, including Ecocem, Kingspan and Saint-Gobain, pledged to reduce emissions, increase low-carbon investments and use more clean energy to tackle climate change. Such is the growth in the green building sector that green building will account for more than a third of the entire US construction sector by 2018.\l"

However, the constant association of ""the environment"" with ""catastrophe"" is profoundly unhelpful, disabling, and simply wrong. Engaging with nature should be a source of pleasure, not a trigger for crippling anxiety. We cannot and must not evade the daunting challenges of climate change, land degradation, and biodiversity loss. The road to December's Paris COP21 conference, and beyond, will be among the stories you read here. But our sense of helplessness in the face of such devastating changes too often slides into despair; then it can collapse into weary, fatalistic indifference. To counter this, we need to focus more on expanding the ways citizens, educators, scientists and communities are already finding to engage positively with nature, and reviving old ones. Here at home, and across the world, there has been a surge in innovative conservation and restoration projects, in urban agriculture, in sustainable farming programmes and in artisan food production, to give just a few examples. New research has confirmed the widespread conviction that the physical and mental wellbeing of children and adults depends to a remarkable degree on their ability to access, and engage with, natural landscapes. Hospitals are recognising that even very small increases in contact with nature significantly benefit patients.When children are given an opportunity to encounter wildlife and wild places, even in urban settings, their sense of wonder and delight is almost always spontaneous and immediate. We need to find ways to nurture and sustain this pleasurable engagement with nature through all phases of education, and in adult workplaces and leisure activities. If more people enjoyed a closer relationship with the natural world, and had a more direct grasp of nature's extraordinary variety and resilience, our society would be in a better place to tackle the consequences of centuries of environmental abuse by our species. The focus of the ""green"" constituency to date has too often been too negative and too narrow.No-one has done more to evoke the wonders of nature for Irish Times readers, over several generations now, than Michael Viney, in his Another Life column and in his delightful, informative and insightful books. It is a privilege to join him as a regular contributor, along with Sylvia Thomson and other colleagues, to this very welcome development of expanded weekly environmental coverage in The Irish Times. Viney's column will continue to be the flagship of this coverage. Wide-ranging themes General themes will be wide-ranging, and may include: opportunities for individual engagement with the natural environment, from mushroom foraging to whale-watching; environmental policy at home and abroad; lifestyle in relation to environment; energy issues; community-based environmental projects; agriculture, landscapes and biodiversity; conservation and restoration; the natural environment in urban contexts; innovative approaches to tackling our various environmental challenges; eco-holidays at home and abroad; artisan food production and traditional crafts that heighten environmental awareness.The design of the homes and towns we live in, and of built infrastructure generally, can have significant environmental costs and benefits, and we will explore these from time to time.In my own articles, I will highlight new environmental projects, especially those involving ordinary citizens, and also educational programmes that engage children in an active relationship with the natural world. Interest in these issues extends throughout our communities, urban and rural, right across the country. From time to time, I will report from abroad, linking the stories to themes and contexts familiar at home. I will also focus on environmental policy and science issues. While never minimising the grave environmental challenges we face, I hope to highlight areas where advances are being made, and the pleasure that many people derive from working together to reverse degradation and restore biodiversity. We are particularly keen to find ways of drawing readers' attention to opportunities to delight in nature close to home throughout the year. For example, many of us are unaware how easy it is to find orchids in most parts of Ireland, even on an urban street, if you know where and when to look for them. Or that it is possible to witness the wonder of the massive seasonal migrations of birds, close up and personal, even within our biggest cities. We hope a closer relationship with our readers will develop; there is certainly a great web of knowledge and experience beyond our inevitably limited circles as writers that we would like to share with the reading public. We hope you will enjoy, and perhaps contribute to, this ongoing expansion of the paper's long history of environmental coverage.

Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim, a remarkable young African woman who campaigns for land rights for her pastoralist Mbororo people, would agree.She believes grazing and cultivating communities can benefit each other, in a traditional seasonal synergy. ""It starts with cowshit,"" she explains disarmingly. The dung dropped by the Mbororo's cattle, roaming vast areas across Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon and the Central African Republic, is an essential source of fertility for crops after they have moved on. But problems arise when the Mbororo retrace their steps, and find land they have grazed for centuries fenced off for exclusive cultivation, often without even a corridor for their cattle to pass through, and with no prior negotiation. Ibrahim argues that customary communal use of land should be recognised as a legal right worldwide.Ibrahim represents the Congo Basin region on the Indigenous Peoples of Africa Co-ordinating Committee. She has won remarkable concessions from the government of her native Chad, such as flexible school schedules and curriculums for pastoralist children, whose patterns of life do not conform to a five-day working week. She spoke to The Irish Times after participating this week in a round-table on land rights at the biannual conference (COP12) of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) in Ankara. Many NGO delegates expressed concern that the convention's proposal to rehabilitate degraded land globally could have negative, if unintended, consequences. UNCCD is usually seen as the poor relation of the UN environmental bodies which emerged from the historic 1992 Rio Conference on Environment and Development, but that may be changing. Hitherto mainly restricted to arid land issues, especially in Africa, the UNCCD has long been dwarfed by the more global reach of the Convention on Biodiversity (CBD) and the Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which starts its critical COP21 negotiations in Paris next month. Ambitious target Those who hope for some real movement on climate change at those talks can find grounds for optimism in the outcomes so far in Ankara. After byzantine discussions over 10 days, the conference finally accepted, in principle, the ambitious new target of ""land degradation neutrality"". That is, the restoration of degraded land to productivity, in each country each year, should be the equivalent of the land lost. Since 12 million hectares of productive land are degraded annually across the globe, this is a very challenging aspiration. The agreement is a significant expansion of UNCCD's role, because wetlands and forests as well as arid lands are degraded by unsustainable use. The convention decision, if implemented fully, could affect Ireland and Bangladesh as much as Mali and the Sudan. ""Land degradation neutrality"" is an awkward mouthful at first, for sure. And it risks joining ""sustainable land management"" and a dozen other familiar ""green"" labels that governments and corporations love to display, but all too rarely put effectively into practice. If it were achieved, however, it would not only help supply rapidly increasing demand for food production, it would also mitigate carbon emissions. This is because restored land generally stores carbon, while degraded land often emits CO2. So it could have an impact on how emission reductions are negotiated in Paris and beyond.However, as some land rights activists see it, there is a serious snag in the proposal. They argue that it needs to be hedged by much clearer definitions of ""degradation"", and accompanied by legal recognition for the world's many millions of untenured small farmers, pastoralists and indigenous peoples. Otherwise, it could accelerate the current trend towards ""land-grabbing"" by states, corporations and private individuals.Michael Taylor, director of the International Land Coalition, told the conference a new study demonstrated that as much as 65 per cent of the earth's land surface is claimed by indigenous peoples and local communities, through customary usage and management. But only 18 per cent of this land is acknowledged as communally owned by governments. Squatters on ancestral lands ""This is a concern,"" he said, ""because it is land on which up to 1.5 billion people live and use, but over which they have no legal control. In other words, they are legally squatters on land that in most cases has been theirs for generations."" As competition for this land increases, and this competition becomes increasingly unequal, so does their risk of dispossession.""The question of definitions is almost as tricky as the issue of legal rights. Where one person sees good pasture, another may see degraded land. ""Hindou's people know the land they graze as very productive on a seasonal basis,"" said Taylor after listening to our interview, ""but a government or a corporation might say it can only become fully productive if it is irrigated."" Forcing unsuitable land into industrialised agricultural production, however, often exhausts the soil. It can destroy its productivity long term through salinisation. So we are left with the paradox that, unless there are clear guidel"
"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland226","Divide between developed and developing countries at heart of difficulties facing talks; Developing nations insist responsibilities of developed world must be r....","December 1, 2015 Tuesday","The Irish Times","What distinguishes the Paris climate summit from other such gatherings over the past 20 years is that it's the first time virtually all of the world's nations have committed to being part of the solution, with 180 pledging to take action aimed at tackling global warming. These 180 countries account for about 90 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. By contrast, the 1997 Kyoto protocol on climate change applied to just 37 developed countries, which accounted for substantially less than half of the world's emissions at that time. The problem is that the current pledges - known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, or INDCs in United Nations' jargon - are not legally binding, nor can they be, because of the difficulties of ratifying anything that could be called a ""treaty"", especially in the United States. The US delegation has circulated a ""non-paper"" to a number of other countries suggesting that further pledges under the Paris accord should also be determined independently by each country, rather than being mandatory or subject to sanction if they fail to deliver. Green Climate Fund President Barack Obama's climate envoy, Todd Stern, has also made it clear that the traditional distinction between developed and developing countries should no longer apply, and that wealthier developing countries should contribute to the UN's Green Climate Fund.""What is expected from countries should be differentiated to capture their varying circumstances and capabilities today and in the future, not based on outdated categories created in 1992"" under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Stern said. This is anathema to China, India and other much poorer developing countries. They insist that the historical responsibility of countries that achieved economic growth and prosperity over the past 200 years by burning fossil fuels must continue to be recognised.In its ""non-paper"", the US also wants the long-term goal of the Paris agreement to be defined as ""collectively aiming to achieve climate neutrality over the course of this century"", which would allow countries to continue burning fossil fuels by buying carbon credits elsewhere. As world leaders gathered in Paris for the high-level opening session yesterday, negotiators were grappling with a 54-page draft text peppered with square brackets indicating that agreement had yet to be reached on key points, such as the level of ambition needed. But China's chief negotiator, Su Wei, said the ""mere presence"" in Paris of 150 heads of state or government - an unprecedented number for any event in the UN's history - ""will give important political momentum in moulding the negotiation process"" over the next 10 days. Ken Kimmell, president of the Washington-based Union of Concerned Scientists, said the emissions cuts countries had proposed, ""while an important step forward, will not collectively achieve the goal of holding global temperature increases to two degrees Celsius"".Pledge revision ""So, to be a success, the agreement must require countries to revisit their pledges in the years to come, raising the level of ambition to take into account advances in technology and economies of scale that make cutting emissions easier or less expensive,"" he said. According to Kimmell, an environmental lawyer, a ""good outcome"" in Paris would be a commitment to revise pledges at least every five years after the accord takes effect in 2020.""Given the so-called ambition gap, we can't afford to wait until 2030 to revisit this.""He said another important element to watch for in the negotiations is a long-term goal to spur future actions in raising the level of ambition. It needed to send an ""unmistakable signal that the age of fossil fuels is coming to a close"", pointing the world towards renewable energy.Naming and shaming Although the accord will not be legally binding, Kimmell said it needed to have a mechanism for ""naming and shaming"" countries that don't fulfil their pledges. Therefore, it must include ""a reliable and common protocol for each country to monitor, report and verify progress"". Also critical for Paris is how the negotiations ""handle the issue of fairness for poorer countries that have contributed little to climate change, are particularly vulnerable to its effects and have the fewest resources to cut their own emissions and prepare for what is coming"". At the abortive Copenhagen climate summit in 2009, developed countries promised to mobilise $100 billion (EUR 95 billion) a year in public and private financing by 2020 to assist developing countries. So far, however, only $6 billion (EUR 5.7 billion) has been pledged to the Green Climate Fund. Conditional pledges That's why a number of developing countries, notably including India, have made ""conditional pledges""- commitments to cut emissions that are conditional on the availability of funds and technology from richer countries to help them grow in a low-carbon, sustainable way. Ravi Prasad, head of India's delegation in Paris, said he hoped to ""get a just, equitable, durable an ambitious climate deal"" by the time COP21 closes on December 11th. But he stressed that it must be grounded on the principles of the UN framework convention adopted in 1992. Gurdial S Nijar, spokesman for the Like-Minded Developing Countries group - which includes China and India - said it was clear and ""very disturbing"" that attempts were being made by others to ""dismantle a fundamental precept"" of the climate change convention. This precept relates to the ""common but differentiated responsibilities"" of parties to the convention, meaning those that got rich during the fossil fuel era ""owe a debt"" to developing countries which had yet to eradicate poverty and provide food security for all of their people.Sticking points What can go wrong nDemands by developing countries that their richer counterparts' historical responsibility for causing climate change must continue to be recognised. nFailure by governments to honour promises made at the Copenhagen summit in 2009 to mobilise $100 billion (EUR 95 billion) a year in climate finance for poorer countries by 2020.nDisagreements over how to ensure countries implement pledges made to cut emissions.\l"
"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland227","Are Irish people becoming 'less black'?","December 8, 2015 Tuesday","The Irish Times","Jimmy Rabbitte's proclamation in that the ""Irish are the blacks of Europe"" had a ring of truth in the late 1980s when the Roddy Doyle novel was published. Can the same be said today in a changed socioeconomic landscape?Irish folk in England are now better known as developers than bricklayers, while in Europe we're top of the class, having helped to gang up on those supposedly irresponsible, sun-kissed Mediterraneans.If you feel a little less black today, or a little more white, then, you may have good reason. As Linda Mart\'edn Alcoff, the New York-based philosopher and author of The Future of Whiteness, points out, ""white"" and ""black"" are fluid concepts and not necessarily tied to skin colour.""Whiteness emerged in the colonial period,"" she notes. ""Before that there were Normans and Saxons and Irish, and various assorted people, but there weren't whites as such."" Colonialism in the traditional sense might have ended, but a white, European ""vanguard"" mindset continues to infiltrate economic, scientific and even environmental thinking, says Alcoff, who was speaking to Unthinkable on a visit to Dublin.In order to tackle big problems such as borderless conflict and climate change, she argues, ""We need to come to understand what role whiteness plays in our own identities"". In what way does whiteness influence our thinking? ""Everywhere European colonialism happened - and it happened in Ireland too - there were certain ideas, concepts and categories that got sent out to the world. There was a ranking of peoples, and part of the idea of colonialism was that European peoples were the vanguard of the human race: scientifically, technologically, aesthetically, morally, philosophically, politically.""The assumption was: 'We have the best thinkers.We have the best religion in Christianity'. That idea of [the supremacy of] white societies is still embedded.""The other way in which it still manifests itself is being uncovered by a lot of empirical studies by social psychologists who are looking at how white people think and talk and interact with others in unconscious ways. Implicit bias can make people pay more attention to others, or judge them to be more credible.""The way in which we interact with others, even if we are anti-racist, can be affected by these histories, so we need to be more conscious of that."" How is whiteness approached in the US?""In the US there is a kind of hysteria about it now because of the demographic changes; whites are going to become a minority by 2042. You have white nationalists running around - like Donald Trump - talking about white, European identity in very old-fashioned ways.""So the right wing loves to talk about whiteness, liberals are afraid to talk about it, and radicals have adopted this view for the abolition of whiteness - they want to eliminate it - and I argue against that because I don't think it's a realistic approach.""We need to come to understand what role it plays in our own identities. It's not everything, but it's not nothing either. We need to spend some time understanding the history of places like the US where a lot of state policy favoured whites.""In 1793 one of the first laws that was passed after the US was formed said you could immigrate to the US if you were free and white. So they institutionalised a certain privilege for white immigrants from the very beginning.""Whiteness is a historical formation. You can talk about the Irish experience in very particular terms because they were coming in to the labour market at the lowest of the low. They weren't included in the club of whiteness in the beginning, but have had a particular experience in colonial migration and the labour market because they were at least seen as European, and so were able to make the shift that I think is harder for African-Americans today or people from Latin America or Asia."" Do colonised people think differently? ""Every part of the world that was colonised has had to think at some point about their identity, and has not been able to buy into the universals of European thought so easily because they were excluded from those universals.""So in Latin America, philosophy is not seen as just bodiless minds engaged in debates, but something that comes out of a particular place in time, because Latin American philosophers had to defend their ability to do philosophy, and the right to ask fundamental questions."" What is the future of whiteness? ""I am a philosopher, not a social scientist, so I certainly don't feel capable of making predictions. But I do think that if we get a better grasp of what whiteness is as a historical formation, we can have a more realistic approach to our possible futures.""The climate change crisis is connected here because there is an incredible hubris about the technological possibilities of overcoming nature's restrictions on us that is very much connected to that European 'vanguard of the human race' model, rather than seeing that we need to work with others, and learn from others, to survive on the planet together. ""So in some ways I think the question of whiteness is really critical to the future."" But one of the chief proponents of that technological approach is the US's first black president, Barack Obama. Are you saying his thinking here could be 'white'? ""Sure, I think there is a certain perspective that all of us who were trained in European school systems and curricula adopt, and live in the West. In that sense, whiteness is not exclusive to white skin.""

Mr Higgins also said the issue should not be addressed under the sway of economic neoliberalism, which he said weakened the state and fostered inequality and injustice. ""New thinking,"" a ""new normative framework"" and ""reconstructed"" economic models were desperately needed, Mr Higgins said. ""It will require moral courage.""The President yesterday addressed the ""Summit of Consciences for the Climate"" in Paris, at the invitation of French president Fran\'e7ois Hollande. The fact that both he and the former president Mary Robinson, now United Nations special envoy for climate change, were prominent speakers created an impression of Irish presidents, past and present, as a moral compass for Ireland and beyond.Ethical questions Mr Higgins saluted the complex political and technical decisions to be thrashed out in the international COP 21 climate conference in Paris in December. But he concentrated on the ethical and intellectual questions raised by climate change. Global warming provided ""opportunities to construct a new order for humanity and for our planet,"" he argued.Climate change was ""grounded in forms of development and industrialisation that were based on the exploitation of fossil fuels, with an assumption of infinite growth,"" he said. ""Individualism manifesting itself as insatiable consumption and accompanied by unconscionable levels of inequality characterises much of what is regarded as the developed part of our planet,"" he said. ""For some it is an economic model that cannot be contested, like received truth in the days of Galileo.""In a subsequent interview, Mr Higgins explained how the post-second World War model based on solidarity and human rights was in the 1980s transformed by the influence of the Chicago school of economics, which advocated rolling back the state. At the same time, investment that could be identified and traced gave way to uncontrolled, ""massive, free-flowing capital"" that created ""great fissures of inequality"" and was ""capable of dislodging the international fiscal system"". The global challenges of climate change and inequality could not be met if governments were not in control of their economies. Mr Higgins linked the climate conference to UN conferences that are defining the follow-up to the Millennium Development Goals - international targets for addressing issues such as poverty, hunger, and disease. Mr Higgins added: ""People are sleepwalking into the acceptance of the inevitability of a single model in economic theory. People think I am attacking neoliberalism . . . Yes, I think the neoliberal model has failed, because of its push to extremism.""But isn't neoliberalism the Irish model? ""I wish we had time to look at how it came to be,"" the President said. ""Of course, as President I don't ever comment on government policy of the day, but I offer this analysis. The interesting part is I have gathered a lot of allies in the last couple of years.""In their speeches, Mr Higgins, Mr Hollande and Mrs Robinson linked climate change to broader development issues. Sustainable model A planned $100 billion annual ""green climate fund"" constituted ""collective global recognition that while today's rich countries built their prosperity from fossil fuels and unsustainable land use, leaders from the developing world are trying to find a way to a more sustainable model of developing without emissions,"" Mrs Robinson said.In the minds of the speakers, climate change seemed to have replaced nuclear war as the threat looming over the world's future.Former UN secretary general Kofi Annan quoted the late Soviet leader Nikita Krushchev, who said, regarding nuclear war, that ""the living would envy the dead"". On a lighter note, Mr Higgins commented on a recent Irish Times report citing French documents that indicate remains buried in Drumcliffe churchyard were unlikely to be those of WB Yeats. Did it matter? ""Not at all,"" Mr Higgins said.\l"

An industry with an annual output of (EURO)24bn employing over 150,000 people in Ireland, agriculture has played a pivotal role in leading the country's economic recovery and delivering a much-needed dose of national confidence.After more than 30 years, the lifting of dairy quotas this year opened the door to increased export revenue and the potential for considerable job creation. Opportunities also continue to open up for Irish beef exports, with markets such as China and the United States lifting their bans on exports of Irish beef this year. The opportunities for the sector will continue to emerge as Ireland's association with quality, traceability and sustainability strengthens.2015 has also been an important year in the global debate on the pace and effects of climate change. With the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris approaching in December, many critical issues will be debated in the months to come. COP21 will be an important conference, with a focus on achieving a new international agreement on the climate, with the aim of keeping global warming below 2\'b0C. At a national level, agriculture is a significant contributor to Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions. It accounts for approximately 32pc of our total emissions, a figure that underscores the role Irish agriculture plays in our economy. The Irish government has set out ambitious targets for further growth and development, so as to take full advantage of the opportunities for our industry. The challenge is to drive Irish export growth and feed a growing global population while respecting our environmental limits, not to mention legal obligations to reduce greenhouse gasses.Irish agriculture has come under the spotlight of late as stakeholders examine ways to square this circle. There is the belief in some quarters that the objectives of initiatives like Food Harvest 2020 (which includes a target to increase beef production by 20pc) are incompatible with Ireland's legal greenhouse gas reduction obligations.There is criticism of what some view as government rhetoric around emissions reductions and a lack of concrete proposals to achieve these. There is also a fear that attempts to protect ""privileged sectors"", such as agriculture, will result in unfair concessions for food producers and a disproportionate effect on other sectors of the economy. The blunt solution suggested by detractors is that Ireland should, as a responsible global citizen, reduce food production in order to meet the mandated emissions targets.The truth is that Ireland's high rainfall combined with our grass-based feeding system makes for a sustainable beef production environment compared with other regions of the world. Within the European Union the average CO2 output per kilogram of beef is 22.1kg, whereas in Ireland it is 14pc lower at 19kg. Put simply, swapping an Irish cow for one somewhere else in Europe will actually increase the overall global carbon footprint, even if it helps Ireland hit emissions targets.responsible production to It is worth considering the broader sector context. While Irish agriculture contributes 32pc of total Irish emissions, agriculture targets worldwide contributes only 12pc, with energy production contributing 75pc. This gives an idea of the scale of the challenge facing us all.Ireland also has a natural advantage in terms of carbon sequestration - the removal of carbon from the atmosphere and its longterm storage. The carbon released in the production of beef for example, is offset by that carbon being stored by the grassland, soils and forestry on Irish farms. Our climate is naturally ideal for grass production, and carbon sequestration should be taken into account when looking at national emissions - currently it is not.Reducing emissions is important, and at Dawn we have made huge efforts to address the environmental sustainability of our business. We introduced a group sustainability plan in 2009 which made core commitments to reduce our environmental footprint including: a 50pc reduction in CO2 emissions by 2020; a 40pc reduction in water and energy use by 2020; and a 50pc increase in recycling of waste by the end of this year.To date, we have achieved annual water savings of 56m litres and reduced thermal energy consumption by 50pc across all sites. Among the most ambitious projects to date has been our development of a seven-acre wetland and eco-park in Carrolls Cross, Co Waterford, a low-carbon effluent treatment method, improving biodiversity and also sequestering carbon. Carrolls Cross was also the site of our first fossil fuel-free plant in 2014 reducing our dependency on non-renewable energy and the associated carbon emissions.Dawn Meats and many of our industry peers have supported and driven initiatives such as Bord Bia's Origin Green programme which is helping Irish food producers demonstrate to international customers the verifiable achievements being made to ensure supply chain sustainability. The industry has recognised and advocated the importance of a proactive, innovative approach from an early stage.Origin Green is a global first, with Ireland taking a leadership role in making a commercial virtue of climate-smart agriculture. Irish food producers After more than 30 years, the lifting of dairy quotas this year opened the door to increased export revenue. Below: CEO of Dawn Meats Niall Browne continue to take huge steps in this area, and given the collective goal of reducing global emissions it would be an exercise in futility to reduce Irish beef production to meet emissions targets, and shift production to less-sustainable production systems overseas.There is a tendency to view sustainability purely in terms of carbon emissions. Whilst measurements like these are important, sustainable production should be viewed in a more holistic way, recognising the benefits that it can bring to the Irish economy, at a national level, and in towns and villages all around the country.Finally we need to consider the global food security threat that we face, with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) forecasting a 50pc increase in food demand by 2030.Few would dispute the urgency of the emissions reduction challenge facing Ireland and countries all over the world.It is important, however, that sustainability should take into account the significant contribution to addressing this challenge that Ireland's rich and varied agri-business sector is making in an environmentally responsible way.We also need to remind ourselves that any drop in food production in this country will quickly be filled by other, lesssustainable locations.Niall Browne is Chief Executive of Dawn Meats\l"

So began Mick Wallace s first moments of freedom after his imprisonment on Wednesday for failing to pay a fine.The fine arose from a guilty verdict against him and his confederate Clare Daly for breaching security at Shannon Airport in July 2014. Later on that evening, Daly was subjected to an equally gruelling spell in stir, but she did her time with stoic defiance, and also emerged two hours after the key had been turned on her freedom.The release of the Shannon Two was just one of a number of instances during the week that gave us a glimpse of modern Ireland as we head towards the centenary of the Rising to commemorate who we are. Or something like that.There was much derision and anger heaped on the Shannon Two over the use of Garda resources to have them brought to Limerick to do their time.Perhaps resources could have been put to better use, but on the same day a Garda Inspectorate report was published which suggested that garda resources are mismanaged to a chronic extent, what s the big deal about four officers driving around the country for a day when hundreds are apparently sitting behind desks twiddling their thumbs?Others grumbled that Wallace and Daly were lawmakers who were breaking the law.Maybe so, but at least they did so on a matter of principle. Look at the huge cohort of councillors and a clutch of TDs who improperly filled out their declarations of interest, as exposed on the RT\'c9 Investigates programme. They didn t have much regard for the law either.Among those who considered the whole incident with distaste was Health Minister Leo Varadkar.He was doing press on Wednesday for new legislation which will bring in unit pricing for alcohol and restrictions on advertising.This proposed legislation follows recommendations from an expert group that reported in 2012. Now, with the D\'e1il on the cusp of dissolving, the Government announces the changes.There isn t a hope that the legislation will be passed in time, but at least Leo got some PR and the drinks industry managed to get the whole thing delayed.Anyway, when Leo was asked about the Shannon Two, at the launch, he had this to say: I imagine they [Wallace and Daly] will argue they did this as a form of protest and that is a decision for them. ""It does occur to me the instability that might arise from having a government that is dependent on independents for support.""Because you might come to an agreement with some independents in order to form a government but then you might find those independents are in jail because of a protest and the government falls. Did you get that?Leo Varadkar, the apparently straight- talking minister, is saying that you shouldn t vote independent because your TD might end up in prison, triggering the collapse of government.Not just that.He is hinting that a vote for an independent might clog up the already overcrowded prison system. Cabinet meetings may have to be relocated to Mountjoy or moved to Cork Prison, and take place within visiting hours.Perhaps Leo is searching for a slogan that echoes with that which informed the infancy of democracy in this State, when senior figures languished in English jails. Put him in to get him out, it said on the election poster.Maybe Leo is going to drum up something like: Don t put them in or we ll have to get them out. In any event the mask has now slipped on the extent to which Fine Gael will milk the stability or chaos tactic in the general election. The chaos option is being painted as more chaotic by the day.While Varadkar was musing on jailbirds, his boss was in Leinster House having a pot at the man who would be president. In a pose that would elicit blushes from the editorial writer of the Skibbereen Eagle, Enda Kenny said he would unreservedly condemn the latest outpouring from the ridiculous Donald Trump.He was reminded by Richard Boyd Barrett that last year The Donald had been met at Shannon Airport by Michael Noonan with a red carpet, harps and people in traditional Irish dress in what was frankly, even at the time, quite a ludicrous show of deference to this multi-billionaire .Word from Trump Towers in New York is that The Donald s campaign is now on the rocks following this stab in the back from world leader Kenny.(Before he attended the COP21 in Paris last week, where he managed to talk out of both sides of his mouth, Mr Kenny said he was off to confer with other world leaders .)The smart money says The Donald will now go quietly and retreat to his Doonbeg golf course, where he will instead focus on scaling the rickety ladder of Irish politics, crowned with a new rug.While there was enough sill"

Some say if the agreement is made it would be praised in the future as humanity's greatest achievement. However, that did not stop our very own Enda Kenny from taking to the stage and making excuses. Commentators criticised his lacklustre speech, which said that while ""Ireland is determined to play its part,"" in cutting CO2 emissions by 2050, he wants ""an approach towards carbon neutrality in the land sector that does not compromise our capacity for food production,"" referring to beef and dairy farming.Later, speaking to reporters at the COP21 global summit, he singled out Irish agriculture, which he said was being asked to meet unreachable targets and blamed the ""lost decade"" of the recession for impeding our efforts.This kind of localised thinking at a global summit is a bit embarrassing, isn't it? For the Irish are not the only ones who rely on agriculture, nor are we the only ones who experienced the ""lost decade"" of the (ahem) global recession. And while the beef and dairy agriculture industry may suffer, (even though the diversification to crop production, ironically aided by rising temperatures due to climate change in our latitude, should be embraced), that is nothing to the suffering of countries affected more directly around the world by the effects of climate change and pollution.One need not look very far last week for examples.The New York Times also profiled the disappearing Marshall Islands, 1,000 low-lying islands in the South Pacific that are slowly being drowned by rising sea water.""I feel like we're living underwater,"" said islander Linber Anej, ""I can't leave my parents but I don't want my kids to drown here.""Not only is climate change impacting on our natural environment but our political and social environment too.Scientist Bill Nye spoke on CNN last week linking climate change to the recent Paris attacks. He said, ""It's very reasonable that the recent trouble in Paris is a result of climate change,"" explaining that water shortages in Syria are displacing young farmers to the city where high levels of unemployment lead to disaffection and ultimately radicalism.Despite Kenny's hesitation, compromise is exactly what will have to happen if we are to make any dent in the overwhelming reality of global warming.Meanwhile, while climate change may have played a role in the rise of Isil, Western intervention most definitely has and this sticky topic reared its ugly head again last week as the British parliament faced a tense 10-hour debate over whether or not to support a vote for airstrikes in Syria.Thousand of protesters took to the streets to cry ""Don't bomb Syria"" and politicians on the left decried a lack of proof that airstrikes would lead to any tangible change.Whether or not it will is debatable. The UK is merely joining a Western air fleet to fight Isil but many worry that innocent civilians will be caught up in the bombings. Without any clear military targets or strategy, they fear, it will merely create more devastation and inevitably, play into the cycle of Western killing of innocents leading the victims to seek retribution against the West and becoming radicalised. Then there's the issue of who on the ground the West should support to fight Isil. Syria is divided amongst warring factions, some just as dangerous as Isil should they gain power. While British PM David Cameron claimed there are 70,000 opposition fighters in Syria, critics say the number is far fewer and they are not a united force.Still, action calls. Last week it was reported that yet another mass grave of Iraq's Yazidi community has been discovered in the town of Sinjar, one of more than 30 believed to exist in the region. The UN has accused Isil militants of committing possible genocide.Can we stand by and do nothing when faced with such a destructive, borderless, fascist force? As Cameron said, ""If not now, when?"" In the end Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn stood by his lifelong policy of pacifism, calling for a diplomatic peace settlement. However, Corbyn did not use his party whip - indeed, shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn spoke eloquently in favour of airstrikes in the House of Commons debate. In the end, many Labour MPs voted in favour and the motion was passed, leading to airstrikes on the Isil-controlled Omar oil fields, in eastern Syria, just a few hours later.Meanwhile, a potentially Isil-motivated terror attack in California shocked no one, as it was seen merely as another in a series of deranged civilian-on-civilian attacks. Gun violence in the US is relentless and unchanging and there's an element of sympathy fatigue amongst those watching from the sidel"

This requires action by everybody - big and small.Ireland is determined to play its part. We have committed, with our EU partners, to a collective target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% by 2030.Ireland's national long-term vision is presented in climate legislation, which sets out our intention to substantially cut CO2 emissions by 2050, while developing an approach towards carbon neutrality in the land sector that does not compromise our capacity for food production.We are developing a National Mitigation Plan to achieve that vision.One really significant area for Ireland is our valuable and already efficient agriculture sector. Through a series of programmes, like carbon foot-printing 43,500 beef farms and 18,000 dairy farms, we are driving economic and environmental efficiency in agriculture and achieving results that we believe are both transferable and scalable.Our research will contribute to global progress and help all countries realise the potential of their land sectors in addressing climate change.This is not just about opportunities - but about the cooperation that will allow us to address our common challenges. Real transparency and accountability will benefit us all but we need to trust each other and the systems that we operate in.Building on our strong track record of supporting developing countries including in areas like climate justice, human rights, gender and education, Ireland recognises that vulnerable communities need very considerable assistance in adapting to climate change.Despite recent difficult economic circumstances, Ireland provided public climate finance of 34 million in 2014, including support for the Least Developed Countries Fund. These funds support adaptation in agriculture, food and energy systems, and help to strengthen the resilience of vulnerable households, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa.Ireland is committed to scaling up climate finance;2. We will increase our contribution to the Least Developed Countries Fund and3. We are also examining ways to mobilise private finance from Ireland, to further contribute to the 2020 goal.The negotiations this week will be very difficult but if we are serious then we should leave Paris with an ambitious and binding agreement that will ultimately limit global temperature increase to less than 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels. In this regard, I wish to salute the leadership the French Republic has brought to hosting the negotiations.I encourage our negotiators to bring this process to a successful conclusion next week. Let's send the signal the world is waiting for and let us not deprive our successors and their children of a real future before they are born.\l"

His hour-long overview of the sorry state of the world was long on observation and very short on remedies.The country that fostered the Enlightenment has, it seems, little more to offer than its skill at organising international conferences. The UN COP 21 climate change conference in December ""will be a major event"", Mr Hollande said. ""We must succeed because the stakes are global, because France is the host.""Paris will host a conference on Christians of the Middle East next week, and Mr Hollande also offered to stage a meeting of parties who are fighting Boko Haram extremists in Nigeria.Confronting terrorism Islamic State is the greatest danger, Mr Hollande continued. Alluding to the beheading of Khaled al-Asaad, the former director of the ruins of Palmyra, and IS's destruction of the temple of Baal Shamin, he said the intention was ""to erase all traces of humanity, terrorise through images . . . show that there is no limit to barbarity. We must act.""But no, Mr Hollande was not about to send in the legionnaires. In connection with the Unesco convention on cultural diversity, he has asked the president of the Louvre to undertake a study mission on the protection of cultural treasures in armed conflicts.Nor did Mr Hollande offer succour to the victims of Boko Haram, ""10,000 since the beginning of the year . . . 14,000 last year, most often women and children"". He expressed France's ""faultless solidarity"" with Nigeria and surrounding countries.In Mali, he said, France, with the help of the African Union, the EU and the UN had ""made terrorism step back"".Terrorism must be fought with force, Mr Hollande continued, but ""military commitment will never be sufficient alone, for terrorism feeds political chaos"". It was up to French diplomats ""to find exits from the crises we are living through"".In the lurch Mr Hollande remains bitter over the way President Barack Obama left him in the lurch two years ago when Washington backed out of military retaliation against Syrian president Bashar al-Assad for using chemical weapons. IS now holds one-third of Iraq and half of Syria, but Mr Hollande insisted that Iraq, like Syria, must preserve its ""state structure"". A state was not consolidated in Libya after the fall of Gadafy ""and we are paying a high price"" for it, he said. The ""disorder"" of the Middle East has created ""the greatest migratory crisis since the second World War"", Mr Hollande said. Walls rising He estimated that 350,000 migrants had arrived in the EU in recent months. ""One sees walls rising up again within Europe, armour being mobilised, barbed wire being set down, refugee centres attacked. This is the situation today, and it is likely to continue . . .""An opinion piece in Le Monde newspaper, written by Jean-Marie Fardeau, the director of Human Rights Watch France, accused Mr Hollande of ""burying the diplomacy of human rights"". Mr Fardeau particularly criticised France's cosy relationship with President Abdel-Fattah al-Sissi of Egypt. Mr Hollande devoted three sentences of his speech to Egypt. Nor did the French president explain why France has abandoned a UN Security Council Resolution that would have recognised the state of Palestine within two years. Mr Hollande told the Presidential Press Association on July 27th it was because the Obama administration had threatened to veto the resolution.Mr Hollande challenged those ""who foretold the end of the credibility of France as an exporter of military materiel to look at the figures.

But there are no guarantees that the people who lose their jobs will be the same people who get the new work. As people realise that job losses in fossil-fuel industries will be a consequence of the move to a low-carbon economy, environmental campaigners and trade unionists have been forming an alliance, to highlight the need to combine cleaner energy with an enlightened employment policy. Trade unions stress the need for a ""just transition"" to a carbon-free world and point out, as their slogan has it, that there are no jobs on a dead planet. The International Trade Union Confederation, which says it represents 168 million workers in 155 countries, attended COP21, the UN climate-change conference in Paris at the end of last year. Here the Irish Congress of Trade Unions was one of the organisers of Climate Conservations, a series of public debates on climate change in 2015. This month Liam Berney of Ictu was a speaker at a Friends of the Earth gathering in Dublin of groups from 25 countries that discussed, among other things, how to support communities in the move towards low-carbon economies. ""Decarbonisation is an economic, moral and political imperative for a stable world and climate,"" he says. ""We don't have a choice, but it's important that the environmental movement doesn't dismiss working people and their jobs.""Berney cites the 150,000 people employed in the coal industry in Poland and the 2,000 jobs that would be lost if the two Bord na M\'f3na peat-fired stations closed. Speaking in Dublin earlier this month, the Canadian climate-change activist Naomi Klein said that 100,000 people had already lost their jobs since the price of oil collapsed. ""When oil prices are down it's a good time to introduce a carbon tax - to pay for the green transition. When people are losing their jobs in the extractive industries it's also a good time for the environmental movement to build alliances with unions and labour movements,"" she told a packed audience at the RDS. Berney says there is too little debate about how we will move to a low-carbon economy. ""Markets dictate policy to government, and workers have a right to know the Government's plan to move to a different order. Workers and vulnerable people can't be left behind."" Diarmuid Torney, who teaches international relations at Dublin City University, says: ""Much of the discussion on decarbonisation focuses on the business interests that either push for or, more often, hold back low-carbon transition. ""If Ireland and the EU are serious about decarbonising the economy, the Government needs to come up with a proactive set of interventions that will retrain and reskill workers from high-carbon sectors, so that they can move into emerging low-carbon sectors."" Ois\'edn Coghlan of Friends of the Earth is more vocal about the Government's delay in closing down peat-fired electricity plants. ""The Irish government was first told to stop burning peat for electricity in 1998, to meet their 2010 Kyoto targets.

But how do renewables stack up against bricks and mortar as an investment option? Sometimes it feels like there is only one option for excess cash in this country - invest in property. Our recent past, however, has made us wary of putting all our eggs in the property basket. Renewable energy is a real alternative in investment terms, and represents a viable way to diversify. It offers a steady return over a medium term, typically 8.5% for a direct investment in solar for example, and of course it has the moral kudos.It's relatively new to us, however, and lack of knowledge makes us cagey. To help close that knowledge gap, here's a cheat sheet on renewables. I'm deliberately ignoring the moral or environmental argument so as to compare them simple as asset classes.Renewable energy has fixed, predictable income streams. Rates are usually underwritten by government feed-in-tariffs, which provide price certainty. The government guarantees a price of energy for the producer. In Italy, for example, where Solar 21 has its solar farms, we are guaranteed a price for each unit of energy we produce for the next 20 years.Government support for renewables will increase. Global agreements like the one achieved at COP21 in Paris in December will mean more, not less, support in the future. Not everyone was thrilled with our own government's white paper on energy, which was finally published in December, but it is indicative of the commitment global governments are making to reduce dependency on fossil fuels.There are minimal operational costs once a renewable energy project is up and running. If you think about it, wind and solar farms have a free supply of raw materials.Like property, you can see your investment. You are buying a piece of a wind or solar farm. You can physically visit it.There is an increasing demand for electricity. You're investing in the generation of electricity. You know it will always be in demand.Accessible. Through companies like Solar 21, Greenroom and Greenman, individuals can invest in solar or biomass farms easily with the help of their financial adviser either through a self-directed investment structure or directly.There are downsides though. For a start, like any technology there is the potential for obsoletion. This is important given the long-term nature of the investment. Having said that, the pace of technology innovation has been slowing in recent years translating into lower costing assets. According to a recent KPMG report, the costs of solar fell by 80% from 2008 to 2013.Renewable energy assets need on-going investment.Regulation is evolving, which may lead to some uncertainty.Now for property. Having lived through the property crash, we may all need some reminding of what property as an asset class actually has going for it.It's familiar. The oldest asset class, everyone is familiar with property, particularly in this country where it is a barstool and dinner-table staple topic of conversation.There are many ways to do it. REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts - a tax-efficient way of investing in property), self-administered pensions, direct investment; there are many ways to dip into property investment depending on how hands-on you want to be.It has the prospect of capital appreciation.

Locals from Swords, Donabate and Rush have always known that the inner estuary, bounded towards the sea by the Dublin-Belfast railway bridge, was a special place. The subtle wetland landscape captures light in ever-shifting ways. Walking there is a more powerful, and much more desirable, antidote to stress than Prozac. Well-informed nature lovers have been enjoying its wealth of wildfowl, wading birds and plants since at least the mid-1970s. It has also long been home to gardening allotments. But it is only in recent years that innovative management by Fingal County Council has opened up the estuary, and the Turvey parklands to its south, to a much wider range of visitors. The council consulted widely with neighbouring communities, and with groups ranging from BirdWatch Ireland to the boy scouts and the National Parks and Wildlife Service. Nature on Display: An Integrated Masterplan for Amenity, Nature, AducationHiking routes and cycling trails now extend through most of the Turvey parklands, and will soon link the site to Newbridge Demesne, nearby. The setting has been greatly enhanced by the planting of 30,000 native trees by Conservation Volunteers Ireland and locals, and by the reintroduction of traditional grazing and cultivation in some areas. Now the council's biodiversity officer, Hans Visser, has begun to incorporate elements of ""climate-smart conservation"" into the management of the site, anticipating the future effects of increasingly frequent and dynamic high tides. This is a pioneer project for Ireland.His first step, taken two months ago, has been to level nearly a kilometre of a 1.5metre-high embankment above a stretch of the south bank of the river. This will allow exceptionally high tides to flood on to several acres of level grassland. ""The removal of the embankment here means that this area will probably flood with brackish - ie, partly salt - water about twice a year, instead of once every 10 years,"" says Visser. ""We are restoring the natural hydrology of the area, beginning to climateproof the estuary,"" he continues. ""There are no houses behind this bank, no critical infrastructure, so we are able to allow floods to occur as they should naturally."" This absorption of floodwaters is a valuable ecosystem service provided by wetlands, protecting housing upstream from extreme weather. On the open area where we are standing, the flooding will create a gradual shift in vegetation from wet grassland towards salt marsh. ""We don't have sufficiently detailed records to claim that we are restoring the salt marsh that may have existed in this precise place before,"" he says, although he thinks it is likely. In any case, the drainage of so much salt marsh along Dublin's coastl"

For example, a giant asteroid collided with Earth with the force of 100 million megatonnes of TNT 66 million years ago, plunging the planet into cold and darkness, wiping out three-quarters of all species (including the dinosaurs) and ending the Cretaceous period. That cataclysm was not explained until 1980, by Walter Alvarez, a geologist, and his father, Luis, a physicist.We are now rushing headlong into a sixth mass extinction, but this time the culprit is man, Elizabeth Kolbert writes in her best-selling book, The Sixth Extinction; An Unnatural History, which won a Pulitzer Prize last April. Kolbert travelled the world, from the Americas to the Great Barrier Reef to Europe, to document vanishing frogs, bats, rhinoceroses, coral. In our Anthropocene age, named for the impact of human activity, increasing numbers of species exist only in ""frozen zoos"", their cells preserved in pools of liquid nitrogen at -195 degrees. Towards oblivion Amphibians, which have been around for 250 million years, are now the most endangered species. ""But extinction rates among many other groups are approaching amphibian levels,"" Kolbert writes. ""It is estimated that one-third of all reef-building corals, a third of all fresh water mollusks, a third of sharks and rays, a quarter of all mammals, a fifth of all reptiles and a sixth of all birds are headed towards oblivion.""The early 19th-century French naturalist Georges Cuvier discovered that earlier species had become extinct, paving the way for Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.The sixth extinction is characterised by its rapidity, Kolbert explained in a telephone interview from her home in Massachusetts. ""Most of the great mass extinctions of the past unfolded over thousands of years. The rates at present are phenomenally high,"" Kolbert said. ""If we keep this up for another 500 years - long for humans but very short for the planet - the general consensus is that we are in a very serious extinction event.""Kolbert's book explains the ""dark synergy"" between climate change, the acidification of the oceans and ""fragmentation"" - the fact that ""Tundra is crisscrossed by pipel"
"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland243","GOLDEN EAGLES AND AN UPLANDS CRISIS; Eagles reintroduced to Donegal are struggling, and the reasons may lie in a centuries-old ecological problem","January 9, 2016 Saturday","The Irish Times","We often talk about our troubled relationship with the natural environment as if it were a modern problem. But there is abundant and increasing evidence that human effects on our landscapes have had problematic consequences for a very long time. Lorc\'e1n O Toole of the Golden Eagle Trust, which is having serious troubles of its own, embraces this long perspective. He thinks widely and deeply about matters ecological, and suggests that solutions from the past may hold lessons for present crises.So, while discussing why the eagles that the trust has reintroduced to Co Donegal failed to fledge a single chick last year, O Toole throws a legend that may date back to the Bronze Age into the mix. Midhir, the hero of the story The Wooing of \'c9ta\'edn, was challenged to plant a great forest in Breifni (Cavan, Leitrim and parts of Sligo). ""I think this story suggests that even then people were aware that they had gone too far in deforesting the land, and that they needed to start replanting,"" says O Toole. He concludes that the management of our landscapes has always had to accommodate changes and conflicting interests, and that our notion of an ideal landscape condition is often distorted by seeing it through a short time frame. ""Today we seem to think our uplands are at their best, their wildest, when they are denuded of trees,"" he says. ""But if we take a longer view we realise that they used to be a mosaic of open country and pockets of native woodland."" Although some of our vast stretches of upland blanket bog were created by climate change in the past, he holds that many of them were the product of human clearances. ""It's possible that we may have been mismanaging our uplands for centuries. We are simply not sure today what healthy uplands should look like.""What has this to do with his main concern: securing the success of the reintroduction of golden eagles?In November O Toole bluntly posted on the trust's Facebook page that the breeding productivity of the eagles was ""not enough"" to ensure their survival in Ireland.The problem, he wrote, was not direct human activity. Neither persecution nor accidental poisoning has been a key issue since the first of 50 young eagles was released in Glenveagh National Park in 2001. ""In general the people of Donegal have embraced golden eagles,"" says O Toole. Changing climate is probably a key issue: exceptionally wet springs are causing higher than expected fledgling mortality. But O Toole believes that the primary problem is the poor ecological condition of the Donegal uplands. This habitat is simply not producing enough prey for eagles to feed their chicks adequately.This analysis is surprising. Surveys before reintroduction concluded that these uplands could definitely support eagles, to the satisfaction of national and international conservation authorities. ""In hindsight we may have got it wrong,"" says O Toole. But if that's the case ""the same failure applies to everything in this habitat.The Golden Eagle Trust rather naively felt that the amount of designated upland [conservation] sites and the size of the national park could lead only to the long-term enhancement of these habitats and further expand the live-prey availability in these sites. However, we did not sufficiently factor in deteriorating prey populations and worsening habitat.""More victims than villains The Irish Wildlife Trust has blamed ""uncontrolled burning, turf extraction and overgrazing"" by farmers for this deterioration. But O Toole sees sees hill farmers as much more victims than villains in a complex uplands tragedy. He stresses the lack of connection between the international promotion of Ireland's ""green"" environment and the degraded ecological condition of many of our most cherished landscapes. He believes that there is an urgent need for extensive research into upland management that takes into account the needs - and effects - of all legitimate interest groups: hill farmers, wind farmers, foresters and recreational users, as well as conservationists. There is, he points out, far more State and university funding for research into the agricultural and biological productivity of our lowlands.The National Parks and Wildlife Service and the uplands council movement do their best, ""but far more resources are needed"", says O Toole, who mentions the cutting-edge uplands management research and practice in Scotland, Wales and, especially, Norway. There is nothing comparable in Ireland. Pending such research, he says, the amount of prey for golden eagles could be augmented by increased culling of another top predator: the fox. He has observed the Donegal eagles hunting most in areas where farmers keep fox populations low. He argues that, because Irish wolves have been exterminated, fox numbers are much too high for the good of the overall ecosystem. Foxes reduce the populations of vital eagle prey, such as red grouse and hare, to levels that will not sustain eagles.A fox cull will not be popular with everyone, O Toole concedes. But as hardly anyone supports the reintroduction of wolves, he says, we have a responsibility to control foxes just as conservationists, in the absence of big grazers, cut native hazel to foster wild-flower diversity.He also advocates restoring native forest in the uplands, through spontaneous regeneration and through hand-planting. The latter could provide incomes for hard-pressed farmers. Again, this idea may seem surprising, because eagles favour open landscapes. But O Toole says that native woodlands, limited to smallish pockets by harsh conditions, would also foster additional prey for eagles. O Toole says that the Welsh Pontbren farmer's project, which indicates that broad-leaved native-tree woodland absorbs water run-off 60 times more effectively than pasture, reveals another benefit of such reforestation; it could be a very significant tool against flooding.But he is sceptical about current proposals for more upland plantations of alien conifers, accompanied by promises to sequester carbon and help us meet the Paris COP21 targets. O Toole believes that the aggressive cultivation methods involved in such plantations increase net emissions.He is mildly optimistic that growing public concern about climate, carbon and flooding will soon drive research towards much better upland management, benefiting the human and ecological communities that depend on healthy hill and mountain landscapes.""The Taoiseach made very big promises before world leaders in Paris about our landscapes' capacity to sequester carbon,"" he says. ""Now we need to measure precisely how this can best be done.""The task of restoring our uplands, with eagles thriving above them, will require different tools from those that Midhir employed in the legendary past, but it is just as challenging, and more urgent than ever. Lorc\'e1n O Toole develops some of these points further in the upcoming issue of Natural Renewal, published by the Golden Eagle TrustNot just eagles Which species indicate the health of our uplands? n""Indicator species"" are animals and plants that help ecologists to gauge the state of an ecosystem. If there are pearl mussels in a river, for example, that indicates the water quality is very high.nIf predators at the top of the food chain, such as the golden eagle, are flourishing, then the whole system is probably doing well. nBut Lorc\'e1n O Toole of the Golden Eagle Trust uses a suite of indicators to assess upland conditions: red grouse suggest thriving heathlands, and breeding golden plover indicate healthy upland grasslands, while Irish hares tell us that the mosaic mix is good. Bog cotton grows only in areas that are free of overgrazing. \l"
"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland244","Global harmony needed on ethical leadership","December 19, 2015 Saturday","Irish Independent","THE Christmas tree is up on Leinster Lawn but the mood in Leinster House is fractious and far from festive. Decks are being cleared as the Government pushes through reams of legislation before the end of term. After the Christmas break there is no knowing what could happen and deputies across the board are on election footing, with several in the last-chance saloon.Some in Fine Gael may be regretting the Taoiseach's decision not to call the election back in October. The seemingly intractable problem of patients on trollies, the constrained banking inquiry, and the calamitous floods of the last two weeks, all have a capacity to poison the public mood. However unreasonable it may be, when people lose their homes, livestock, farms and possessions, they inevitably cast around to blame the ""authorities"". In fairness to the Government, local authorities and the Civil Defence have mobilised a massive collective effort on this occasion to respond to the crisis, including immediately making money available to help those affected.There was more than a touch of irony that while people here in rain-soaked Ireland battled the elements, world leaders at long last agreed a long-term strategy on climate change in Paris. The Taoiseach's opening speech at the conference was badly received as being minimalist and defensive; he appeared to be putting the interests of Irish agriculture ahead of our country's climate justice obligations and to be at variance with the general political sentiment and clamour for brave global action.Climate change has always been a difficult policy agenda on which to get traction. With so many competing issues for global leaders to tackle ranging from terrorism, poverty, migration and economic and currency challenges, long-term priorities like global warming and rising sea levels have taken a back seat, despite many grandiose plans. But now for the first time, 195 countries rich and poor have agreed to eliminate dependence on fossil fuels in favour of more environmentally sustainable options. Action is no longer postponable, such is the rise in global temperatures due to uncontrolled carbon emissions and disregard by developed countries of the impact of transport pollution, agricultural methods and excessive energy use on the environment. Reaching agreement was arduous and protracted but the Paris Agreement binds all countries to reduce their emissions and sets highly ambitious targets.This week, Ireland's White Paper for decarbonising our energy system was published.President Francois Hollande and foreign minister Laurent Fabius of France did well to pull it off. Perhaps there has never been a greater need in the world for ethical leadership by heads of state and government. Chancellor Angela Merkel, now ten years in office, has been appropriately acknowledged in some quarters for her courage and leadership on the migrant crisis in Europe and her handling of the Greek debt crisis. Germany has welcomed a million refugees this year. She has done so even as the tide of welcome and public solidarity is ebbing away. She faces dissent too within her CDU party, some members of which are dismayed by what they see an ill-judged and disproportionate response. But she is steadfast in her belief that this is the right thing to do, not just for migrants but also for Germany. This week, she described the challenge as the ""historic litmus test for Europe"".Merkel is an example of a world leader, willing to risk unpopularity for herself personally and her party because she is convinced of the moral validity of her stance.Similarly, US president Obama has that capacity to hold firm against the tyranny of populist domestic politics, by articulating a need for gun control reform in the United States against the clout of the National Rifle Association. But he has been constantly thwarted by Congress in his attempts to introduce even moderate reforms.Closer to home, our own John Hume, whose life is documented in a recently published book, risked his own reputation and the electoral fortunes of his party by having a secret dialogue with Gerry Adams over many years since 1985.When news of it emerged in 1993, Hume was vilified but he made no apology for the controversial talks, even though IRA violence continued at the time. It took real courage to trust his instincts about the value of that engagement. He was instrumental in persuading president Clinton to grant a visa for Adams as part of confidence building with republicans. Clinton, in turn, took risks in granting the visa, against the advice of the State Department, and in 1994 the first IRA ceasefire was announced, marking the beginning of the end of the conflict in Northern Ireland.Reflecting on John Hume's selfless contribution to the peace we all now enjoy, one cannot help comparing such a life of endeavour and conviction to the likes of Donald Trump, the republican candidate seeking the US presidential nomination. The wrong-headed intolerance and xenophobic rhetoric emanating from him is enough to reduce one to head-hanging despair. Similarly, the narrow nationalist rhetoric generated by UKIP and some of the eastern European member state leaders is depressing.Denmark's recent referendum result marked yet another popular vote against EU values of solidarity. The Brexit debate can also be seen in this context.So ethical leadership in politics is an absolute priority in these times of war, migration, economic instability and terrorism. We in Ireland, though we are small, can and do play a disproportionate part in international discourse on these major issues through the EU and the UN. Only this week, former president Mary Robinson was honoured in Dublin by Kofi Annan for her work on climate justice. Former attorney general and UN special envoy on migration Peter Sutherland has led the humanitarian debate on behalf of migrants and refugees, making the moral case for generosity and humanity in dealing with the migrant crisis in Europe. The passing of the marriage equality referendum this year is a measure of the best instincts of the Irish people and our polity.We should be proud of our many distinguished and internationally renowned politicians, public servants and presidents and not be overly side-tracked by the misdeeds of the odd venal councillor. Probity in elected officials is important and there are rigorous checks on ensuring high standards now. But the sins of a few should not eclipse the achievements of many good men and women who devote their lives to public service in politics. Those who seek to attribute base motives to all politicians should be careful what they wish for.Denigrating all politicians from traditional parties leaves the pitch open to unproven and potentially chaotic extremes which could unravel our hard-won recovery.Angela Merkel is an example of a world leader who will risk unpopularity when she is convinced of moral validity\l"
"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland245","Inside Ireland's first ecovillage: 'We are a community who are trying to do our best'; Challenges exist but the project's work has been recognised international....","December 11, 2015 Friday","The Irish Times","An idea that began in Dublin's Central Hotel in 1999 - to create Ireland's first ecovillage - has borne fruit on a 67-acre farm adjoining the village of Cloughjordan, Co Tipperary.Back then, the aspiration of low-carbon living, where going about one's life means producing as little climate-changing carbon emissions as possible, was cutting edge. Now it's on the lips of everyone from the pope to corporate and state leaders meeting in Paris at the COP21 climate change summit.As a founder member of the ecovillage, I was heavily involved up until 2009 when I left for a six-year stint in Belgium. Back then, only one house had been built. On returning this summer, things had changed dramatically.There are 55 homes, an enterprise centre, a bakery, allotments and a hostel. The community farm is finally up and running; some 16 acres of broadleaved forestry is maturing nicely; a meandering biodiversity trail, colloquially known as the ""perimeter walk"", is trod daily by ecovillagers and locals alike. There's also a steady trail of students, both from school and university, who come to learn in the community. Policy lessons Internationally, the ecovillage is part of the global ecovillage network and has been identified as one of Europe's most important examples of an initiative that provides policy lessons for a low-energy society. Of 1,500 projects initially chosen by the EU-funded Milesecure researchers, Cloughjordan featured in the final 23. ""It's the multifaceted nature of our project that makes us so successful,"" says Peadar Kirby, academic, author and one of the first ecovillage residents. ""The ecovillage is robust in renewable technology, food and community.""At the national level the community's ecological footprint is the lowest measured in Ireland at 2 global hectares (gHa), just above one-planet living. (One gHa represents the average productivity of all biologically productive areas on Earth.) The average for 79 other settlements included in the study was 4.3gHa.""This is the single biggest piece of evidence that we are really achieving quite a substantial amount,"" says Kirby.That the ecovillage has gained international acclaim is all the more remarkable given that it is still a work in progress, with 47 sites still for sale, and, like many other developments, recovering from the recession.""We were launched in the Celtic tiger and were expected to be sold out but now it's quite a different ball game,"" says Tom Tracey who lives here with his family. ""There are only 55 households where there were meant to be over 130."" Higher charges One effect is that the district heating system has fewer customers than it was designed for, resulting in higher than expected charges for residents. Also, it was designed to run on two renewable sources - woodchip and solar - but the solar panels have, so far, not worked. The contractor overseeing the work subsequently went bust and we are now seeking ways of raising the finance to get them operational.Nevertheless, the ""interconnectedness [of the district heating system] reinforces community which is at the heart of the project"", says Kirby. ""Far too much of the discourse about climate change is about technology but it's not going to make a difference on its own. It's a resilient community that will make the difference."" Drainage system One system that appears to be working well is the sustainable drainage system. In effect it's a controlled floodplain, designed to keep water away from ecovillage houses but on site for as long as possible, thus slowing down its release into the local stream. It's heartening to know we are doing our small bit to reduce flooding, especially as we're in the Shannon catchment. In September 2012, the ecovillage halved its site prices, with sites serviced for electricity, heat, sewage and water now on offer for between EUR 45,000 and EUR 70,000. The project received virtually no national public funding but did receive an EU grant towards the renewable energy heating system.""We are at the cutting edge of the most crucial global challenge - that of achieving a low-carbon society by 2050 - and yet we are existing on a knife-edge and with virtually no funding,"" says Kirby. So what's it's like life in the ecovillage? Living in a bright, warm house (ours is B1 energy-rated) is pure luxury, especially when you know all your heating and hot water is coming from a renewable resource. It's satisfying too to harvest rainwater off our roof for use in all but two cold water taps. When it comes to mobility I was part of a car club in Brussels, so sharing cars with a couple of my ecovillage neighbours comes easy. The strong sense of community within Cloughjordan as a whole, combined with various community email lists, is a bonus to getting to places.""Help is always there,"" says resident Junko Shimada, who is originally from Tokyo. ""When you need a lift, you send an email and five minutes later it's sorted.""Living here, it's possible to radically reduce one's food miles. You can grow your own, buy directly from the experimental vegetable gardens run by ecovillager Bruce Darrell or join the community farm. As members we help ourselves to as many vegetables as we want from the central collection point, where produce is delivered three times a week. Making a living We are also members of the local bread club, paying for our home-delivered bread from the Riot Rye bakery on a monthly basis. Combined with meat from the local butcher, milk delivered by a local supplier, dry goods ordered in bulk with some 50 others and a few supplies from Cloughjordan's shops, non-local shopping trips are few and far between. Making a living in rural Ireland is undoubtedly an issue. While some residents commute to nearby towns and some further, many work from home and from the WeCreate enterprise centre.For Laois man Pat Malone, who farms the community land, the biggest daily challenge in the ecovillage is our diversity.""But it's also our strength. To live in a community you have to follow the agreed processes. I'm useless at it, but I'm learning,"" he says with a chuckle.As for the kids, they have a choice of two primary schools and numerous activities within walking distance. Sophia Whelan (11) who has been in the ecovillage since she was seven, says: ""We are quite free to go where we want as there aren't many cars.""So is the ecovillage a success? ""We don't have much of a sense of achievement but others who visit are always impressed,"" says John Jopling (80), the oldest ecovillager. ""We are a community who are trying to do our best.""Village life By the numbers 90% of ecovillage homes are energy-rated B1 or higher 28% of households have rainwater harvesting systems 2 Wood-chip boilers provide all ecovillage homes with heating and hot water 85 varieties of vegetables including five types of potatoes are grown on the community farm 600 metres, the distance vegetables travel from soil to the collection point 95% of primary-age residents cycle or walk to school 1 public 'ecar' charging point at Django's hostelLoad-Date:\~December 10, 2015\l"

"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland247","POWER TO THE PEOPLE; The Government wants us to become 'energy citizens', but advocates of community energy schemes say Ireland is lagging behind other EU count....","January 30, 2016 Saturday","The Irish Times","Last month, as world leaders met in Paris at COP21, the United Nations climate-change summit, more than 100 Irish community groups, co-operatives, energy agencies and nongovernment organisations signed the Community Energy Proclamation. ""Imagine a community putting its hands up and deciding to build a wind farm,"" its organisers said. ""Imagine all the schools in a town running on clean, free solar electricity."" Encouraging communities to move to clean energy through projects like these is the best way to unlock Ireland's renewable-energy potential, according to the groups that put the proclamation together.""The 100 signatories represent thousands of people. A lot of people see the climate challenge as serious and want to respond to it in their communities,"" says Kate Ruddock of Friends of the Earth ( HYPERLINK http://www.foe.iewww.foe.ie), one of the organisations that signed up. The proclamation envisions Ireland as a nation of ""energy citizens"" who will plan, generate and distribute energy for the benefit of their communities. This is also what the Government says it wants, according to Ireland's Transition to a Low Carbon Energy Future 2015-2030 (bit.ly/1nxDJdd), a White Paper that Minister for Energy and Natural Resources Alex White published the week after the signing of the energy proclamation. ""The need for change to our energy system is absolute. The deregulation of the electricity sector has led to the private ownership of new energy infrastructure. The debate on fossil fuels is now over, and in the transition to clean-energy production we need to engage citizens in the ownership of energy,"" says Paul Kenny, chief executive of Tipperary Energy Agency (tea.ie).Kenny believes that much of the objection to wind farms was really about the transfer of wealth from the community to developers and landowners ""who make substantial amounts of money while the wider community doesn't benefit much at all"". Service to society Kenny has been to Denmark to see some of the first community wind farms. ""It was interesting to see how community wind energy was born out of a voluntary effort and a move against corporate energy production. The Danish model of co-ownership states that a community must own 20 per cent of wind farms."" Everybody in Denmark accepts and is engaged by the need to move from a fossil-fuel society, according to Kenny. ""That hasn't happened in Ireland yet,"" he says.""We have to ask ourselves: is energy a service to society or a commodity to make money from?""Kenny believes the ideal is for energy to be created in the local economy and for any surplus to be sold back into the local area as part of a circular economy. But Ireland has huge issues to overcome before it can accommodate many community-run wind farms or solar-powered schools. Most community energy projects cannot currently access the national electricity grid, for example, sell any surplus electricity they generate or share the electricity they generate with their neighbours.More fundamentally, they often cannot even get advice on planning permission, on the installation of equipment or on the financing and managing of energy co-operatives.Kate Ruddock is critical of Ireland's lack of support for community energy projects. ""We have relied on energy from big power plants. In contrast to many European countries, community-owned renewable energy in Ireland is practically nonexistent,"" she says. ""About 60 per cent of renewable energy is owned by communities in Germany, and Scotland has recently met its target to supply 500 megawatts - about 500,000 homes - with locally owned wind- and hydro-powered projects. ""How is it right that we subsidise peat and gas power plants but there are no payments for solar electricity or for microgeneration of electricity? How is it right that the system supports developers to build wind farms but there is no mechanism for community participation in renewable energy?"" She acknowledges that the White Paper is a step forward. One of its sections, entitled ""From Passive Consumers to Active Citizens"", outl"

During the recession, understandably, it plummeted as a priority issue for voters, with a huge fall-off in media coverage. In 2009, there were almost 3,000 articles in Irish media about climate change; in 2012 there were well below 1,000.Last December, the UN climate change conference, COP 21, produced the Paris agreement, a breakthrough document that commits nearly 200 states to keep global temperature increase ""well below"" 2 degrees, and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees, compared to pre-industrial levels. The achievement was beyond the expectations of many detractors. There were also important commitments to limit greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible and to put $100 billion a year into climate finance. However, there are large variations in terms of detail and commitments, as well as get-out clauses for particular sectors or interest groups. For example, some parties look for exemptions for the likes of agriculture, oil-burning power generators, peat-extraction and wind-power. The spread of wind energy had met resistance in local communities because of the intrusive nature of some wind farms and this local opposition has percolated into manifestos.Dr Cara Augustenborg, a lecturer in climate change and the environment at the UCD School of Biology and Environmental Science, has done a comprehensive analysis of the manifestos to compare their policies. A former member of the Green Party, she declares that interest up-front. She found limitations in all the manifestos, including that of her former party. But as this is its raison d'\'eatre, it is unsurprising that the Green Party emerges as strongest in her analysis. It is rated number one followed (in descending order) by Labour; Social Democrats; Fianna F\'e1il; Fine Gael; Renua; Sinn F\'e9in; and People Before Profit. The latter four have big omissions or are inherently weak or soft on climate change, in her view. Fine Gael It refers to climate change in its manifesto more than any other party and there is a section devoted to it, including some good measures on biomass. Surprisingly, there is no concrete target for electric vehicles, in sharp contrast to the 2011 manifesto which included ambitious targets. There are no firm commitments in terms of reductions and all initiatives mentioned have to be ""balanced"" against other interests, including rural economy and expansion of agricultural produce. Whitegate refinery is to stay open. Judgment on fracking is withheld. There is no reference to solar energy. Wind energy must be balanced against the concerns of local communities.

"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland251","'THEY KNEW THE CITY WOULD BE BUSY ON A FRIDAY NIGHT'; Paris terrorists targeted civilians over heavily-protected buildings, writes Francois de Beaupuy","November 15, 2015","Sunday Independent","THE gunmen who mowed people down in cafes in central Paris and at a packed theatre in the French capital on Friday were acting in a city on high alert since terrorists attacked satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a Jewish supermarket in January.That did nothing to stop them.According to eyewitnesses, the men with machine guns walked down streets crowded with Friday revellers with aplomb to carry out the worst terror attack in over a decade in a Western country. Their action shows the challenge of providing foolproof security in a city of 2.2 million people with a bar or a restaurant dotting practically every corner, said Louis Caprioli, the exhead of DST, France's former anti-terrorism unit, and now an adviser to Paris-based security consultants Groupe GEOS. ""It's precisely because sensitive sites have been protected by security forces since January that the terrorists attacked all of France,"" Caprioli said in a telephone interview. ""These people knew our habits. They knew these streets would be busy on a Friday night. There is no way to provide total protection.""Friday's carnage left at least 128 dead and more than 200 wounded in near-simultaneous assaults on cafes, a soccer match and a concert hall. The attacks were carried out by ""a terrorist army"", French president Francois Hollande said in an address to the nation. It's the deadliest such act since the 2004 bombings at train stations in Madrid that killed 191.""Though shocking, the attacks are not completely surprising,"" risk analysts Stratfor said in a note to clients. ""Multiple individuals from France and other European countries have travelled to Syria to join extremist groups there. As the Charlie Hebdo attacks have also demonstrated, there is a persistent risk of terrorist attacks within Europe.""That said, Hollande's government may draw criticism for what some analysts see as a failure of security.""This kind of attack is an intelligence failure,"" said Rohan Gunaratna, head of the International Centre for Political Violence and Terrorism Research in Singapore. France was ""aware of the threat but did not anticipate an attack of this scale"".After 17 people were murdered at Charlie Hebdo magazine and a kosher supermarket in January, the French government mobilised 7,000 soldiers to protect sites such as government buildings and synagogues. It hired more police and voted in laws giving it greater surveillance powers.Hollande, who yesterday blamed Islamic State for what he said was an ""act of war"", pledged that security will be further tightened, with more soldiers patrolling the streets of Paris.There are 571 French residents with radical Islamic groups in Syria now and 141 have died there, interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve said on Thursday. Another 370 have been arrested upon their return and 11,000 people are being followed, he said.After the Friday attacks, France is deploying 1,000 additional soldiers to patrol streets in the Paris region, reinforcing the 30,000 police and military who have been protecting sensitive sites in recent months. Another 230 soldiers have been put at the disposal of local authorities.While armed soldiers in the metro have become a standard sight for Parisians, they can't be everywhere. France has 35,000 cafes, according to state statistical institute Insee. Paris alone has about 13,000 restaurants, according to the Paris Commercial Court. Visitors spent 22 million hotel nights in Paris in 2014. The Paris metro has an average of five million rides a day.""It's very difficult to secure a city,"" said Raffaello Pantucci, director of International Security Studies at Royal United Services Institute in London. ""It's access to weaponry which would make this less heinous.""COP 21""When one targets civilians, it's almost impossible to prevent,"" Claude Moniquet, co-founder of the Brussels-based European and Strategic Intelligence and Security Centre, said in a post on Facebook. ""Don't forget that every day security forces arrest or question suspects, and that at least 10 plots have been broken up since January.""In addition, illegal guns circulate freely in the tough neighbourhoods that surround many French cities, even if civilians in France aren't allowed to possess military-style weapons unless they are a certified collector, and permits and background checks are required for hunting rifles and handguns. An AK-47 can be bought for (EURO)1,000 on the black market, according to police unions. Police seized 5,300 guns in 2014, of which 175 were ""war weapons"", according to the French interior ministry.""Weapons are circulating very easily,"" former French anti-terror prosecutor Jean-Louis Bruguiere said on BFM TV. Thibault de Montbrial, a French lawyer, said France needs to loosen some of its gun laws. ""Civil servants who are authorised to carry weapons should be allowed to do so off-duty,"" he said.

"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland253","THE MASAI CONUNDRUM; Preserving the Masai way of life in Tanzania is a complicated task, especially where it conflicts with environmental concerns and women's r....","April 9, 2016 Saturday","The Irish Times","At the Paris climate talks before Christmas, the former World Bank chief economist Nicholas Stern heralded the end of what he called the fake horse race between the twin goals of tackling climate change on the one hand and eradicating poverty on the other.In his conceptually neat view the COP21 agreement, in which 195 nations, led by the United States and China, agreed to cut emissions in order to limit global warming, will involve no economic cost.In the savannah and highlands of northern Tanzania, reducing poverty while preserving the environment is a high-wire act. Twelve million Tanzanians live in dire poverty despite economic growth of 7 per cent last year. A large population - 47 million people - a high birth rate, and an economy based largely on subsistence farming mean that pastoralists, smallholders, commercial farmers and game reserves are competing for land.This is all happening amid rising temperatures brought about by global trends, uncertain rains and vanishing tree cover. In 2012 Nasa warned that the ice cap that crowns Africa's highest mountain, Kilimanjaro, could disappear by 2020. The volcanic Mount Meru, 80km to the west, has been mostly ice free since the 1960s. Today the people who live and work on its slopes feel the heat very keenly indeed.""It's much warmer around here now than in the 1970s, even in the early 1990s,"" says Ernest Kaaya. A small farmer in the Luguruki ward of Arumeru district, with two wives and 10 children, the 66-year-old is a genial, paternal figure in the small community. ""The snow on the mountain disappeared decades ago,"" he says. ""Until recently a lot of the trees on the mountains were being cleared by the villagers, but the government stopped it.""While climate change affects the mountains' ice caps, forestry has been blamed for robbing the slopes of moisture. Kaaya started a small tree nursery in 2011, selling jacaranda saplings for about 8 cent each, after being trained by Cedesota, a community organisation funded by Irish Aid, via Care International.""After the seminar I started growing trees so locals could plant on their farms on the mountain, to help the soil,"" he says. ""Now the conflict with the government is over. It's my ambition to spread the training, because it's good for everybody. It's very easy to erode the soil on the mountain without trees, and the trees provide shade.""Kaaya is also part of a co-op that exports avocados, papayas, coffee, beans and timber. In addition to nurseries and cash crops, Cedesota has helped the locals, who come from the Meru and Masai tribes, to mitigate the depredations of drought by keeping poultry and goats.""It opened my mind: chickens are like insurance when there's no rain,"" says Rosemary Mosembise, a 37-year-old who runs a small restaurant from a tiny shack. ""My firstborn is in secondary school because of the money I get from selling chickens."" The tuition costs 1.2million Tanzanian shillings a year, about EUR 500 - a sizeable sum.Northern highlands Compared with the tropical south and the arid interior, Tanzania's northern highlands are blessed with rich soils and a superb, relatively cool climate despite being just shy of the equator. In the area around Luguruki village, where I visit small irrigated plots of coffee, avocados, papayas and bananas, I pass oxen pulling ploughs, fields teeming with corn, and plantations of beans and peas. ""They are poor people here - they live in the mountains - but they know how to use the land,"" says Jackson Muro of Cedesota. ""They take their cows' manure to fertilise the crops, and the cows eat fodder. There is no grazing here, because there is no space to graze. It's mainly agroforestry.""Here, at least, among Meru tribespeople, economic development seems to go hand in hand with looking after the land. Farther north and west, near the vast Serengeti plain, Masai communities practise pastoralism. Although the government officially encourages agriculture as more economically and environmentally sound, no crops or trees are planted on the plains to the west and north of Arusha, the regional centre. Instead Masai pastoralists drive cattle across them in ever-increasing numbers.Although the vast majority of Irish Government aid to Tanzania goes on health services and nutrition, Irish Aid policy is to support the pastoralist way of life.To experience it at first hand I travel to Loliondo, in the heartland of Masai territory, on the border with Kenya. The 360km journey takes about 10 hours - the route includes deeply rutted tracks - but we sweep through the sunlit uplands of Ngorongoro Conservation Area, a Unesco World Heritage site where Masai herdsmen share green pasture with wildebeest, zebras, giraffes and elands. The vast lands north of the conservation area, around Loliondo, are also populated by Masai tribes, although wildlife is not afforded the same protection here.In the boma, or fenced village, of Enguserosambu I meet Masai widows who, in 2014, were part of a group that received 100 cows funded by Irish Aid via Palisep, a local group. Robert Kamakia of Palisep explains how they help the women produce and market their dairy produce. A Masai, Kamakia admits that work among the tribe to combat female genital mutilation, forced marriage and a widespread denial of the existence of sexually transmitted diseases has a long way to go. Customarily forbidden from remarrying or owning land, Masai widows are usually shunned by the community and even by their own families.Nanyikai-Sironet, who is 48, says that her late husband's alcoholism frittered away their resources and that she suffered dire social exclusion for not owning cattle. ""When I received the cow from Ireland I was so happy. It was the end of a very dark time. It was the first time I ever owned livestock. Things are changing, but very slowly,"" she says of the deeply patriarchical Masai society.After another hour's drive we come to the boma of Ngarwa, about 10 huts overlooking a marshy plain. I meet Noosupuia-Kosiom, a 24-year-old who was widowed five years ago, when her husband died in battle. After she sold her remaining livestock to feed her two children she was forced to work part-time as a labourer, collecting firewood and water. ""It was very difficult having nothing. Since receiving my cow from Irish Aid"" - via Oxfam - ""people here treat me completely differently.""Sagging, grey, grassless land Although flies swarm around us and the cattle, the land is lush and green up here in the far north, and some areas show bursts of agriculture. Not so between Karatu and Arusha, where the sagging, grey and often grassless land shows, even at the end of the rainy season, the effects of overgrazing. Local officials say that pure pastoralism is unsustainable in the long term, as nomadic herders require much more land than the agroforesters of the Arumeru region.Given the Masai's staggering birth rate - the population has more than doubled in less than 30 years - there is huge pressure on the land in many areas. Oxfam has called for the Masai lifestyle to be embraced as a response to climate change, because of the Masai's experience of living in arid bushland. Yet the rapid growth in the Masai population, and subsequent overgrazing, is one reason why some previously fertile lands have turned to desert. This article was supported by the Simon Cumbers Media FundMental health: the culture is to repress and suppress The population pressure in northern Tanzania is especially evident in Arusha, whose population estimates put at anything from 500,000 to two million. A city who bustle is partly due to its status as a safari staging post, Arusha consists mostly of slum dwellings, wooden or earthen shacks with neither running water nor electricity. The area around Esso Road is among the fastest-growing slums in east Africa.Evanna Lyons, a Meath woman, sees the problems first hand in her work as a psychotherapist at Arusha Mental Health Trust, the city's sole mental-health clinic. ""The patients we see have no words for depression, anxiety or stress. Emotive words like 'sad', 'hurt' and £ngry' are not used a lot,"" she says. ""The culture is to repress and suppress; a lot of members of the community can by silenced for the greater good.""They find it hard to express feelings and report a lot of psychosomatic symptoms. You might have someone say they have a pain in their head, and then you find out their father died in front of them a few weeks beforehand.""Arusha Mental Health Trust was founded in 2000 by another Irishwoman, Dr Sheila Devane. Last year Minister of State Sean Sherlock awarded EUR 10,000 to fund a psychotherapy education programme on sexual abuse.\l"

Vienna, Vancouver, Melbourne, Zurich and others regularly found at the top of global rankings.In survey after survey, mobility in these cities is dominated by effective public transport systems. At the heart of these systems is a high-capacity rail network, and planning and development which supports sustainable travel and living.As our delicate economic revival continues, the most immediate pressures are being felt once again in our urban centres, with congestion returning, traffic volumes reaching boom-era levels and the unsustainability of car-dominated commuting clearer than ever.This is most acute in the Greater Dublin Area, where conservative forecasts show a 35 per cent increase in morning peak travel demand by 2041 or 650,000 additional trips to and from work per day. Clearly this increase in transport demand needs to be supported by sustainable public transport options, with Dublin recently identified as being the 10th most congested large city in the world with an average route taking 35 per cent longer than it would in free-flowing traffic. As home to 39 per cent of the population and 43 per cent of jobs, the economic wellbeing of the greater Dublin area is central to national economic recovery. It accounts for almost half of national GDP and its effective management and continued success is critical for the performance of the entire economy. Furthermore, the new COP 21 UN Climate Change agreement puts an onus on Ireland as a country to work to reduce transport emissions significantly, which currently account for 30 per cent of Ireland's emissions, second only to agriculture.Investing for our futureIarnr\'f3d \'c9ireann is planning to address the forecast demand and expand the scope and capacity of our rail network to ensure we provide the high-capacity public transport solutions needed for a sustainable future.Through a mix of shorter-term and longer-term projects, we can keep pace with the emerging pressures from a growing population, and help support the type of planning essential to achieve sustainability.In 2016, two projects will be delivered which will allow more commuters to travel by rail:\'b7\~\~\~In April, we will increase the frequency of DART services from every 15 minutes to every 10 minutes in each direction all day on weekdays, as well as providing additional weekend frequency.

"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland257","Supply Chain Optimisation - Promoting Professionalism in Logistics and Transport","January 24, 2016","Sunday Business Post","Supply chain optimisation can yield a significant reduction in supply chain costs as well as giving companies a competitive advantage through delivering more efficient, flexible and responsive supply chains. ""Companies across all sectors now recognise that implementation of best-practice supply chain management can offer strategic differentiation,"" said Pat Treacy, deputy chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Logistics & Transport Ireland (CILT). ""Many companies are now seeking to proactively build supply chain capability and as a result, supply chain graduates are much sought after,"" said Treacy. ""At the recent annual End2End Supply Chain Conference 2015 held in Dublin, there was much debate among delegates about the need to generate more supply chain graduates and build greater capability in this key area."" Treacy said several new developments were supporting supply chain optimisation. ""These include greater focus on marketing and supply chain integration and the implementation of lean manufacturing principles right across the supply chain from external suppliers through to the customer,"" he said. ""These initiatives will drive greater integration across all functions and liberate significant business savings which will enhance margins,"" said Treacy. ""Business has invested heavily in information systems which have had a significant impact on organisational structure and design. This investment has supported improvement in the flow of information and cash which supports more effective decision-making in key areas."" Treacy believes, however, that the business culture in many organisations does not support the full exploitation of these systems. ""This needs to change and supply chain managers need to show leadership in not just using systems for competitive necessity but leveraging their use to deliver competitive advantage,"" he said. ""Diageo Ireland, for instance, identified the adoption of a supply chain philosophy as key to developing competitive advantage within the brewing industry and invested heavily in capability development,"" said Treacy. According to Treacy, COP 21 [the 2015 Paris Climate Conference] will have profound implications and challenges for Ireland, particularly in agriculture and transport. ""If we are to be successful, we must adopt a systemic approach as sustainability initiatives are complex. Supply chain professionals are trained to take on these challenges and can help organisations develop supply chains that adopt a sustainable biosphere approach,"" he said. Whilst there are a significant number of higher certificate, degree and masters degree programmes offered in many of Ireland's third-level colleges, Treacy said the Institute had identified a lack of continuous professional development (CPD) programmes in the market. ""This needs to be urgently addressed if we are to continue to develop supply chain capabilities and stay on top of developments and trends,"" he said. The Chartered Institute of Logistics & Transport Ireland is the international professional body for the industry. ""Our role is to promote professionalism in logistics, transport and supply chain,"" said Treacy. ""We currently deliver a Diploma in Logistics and Supply Chain Management and are actively engaged in collaborating with a third-level college in developing and delivering a new part-time degree which is aimed at working professionals,"" he said. ""We have also sought feedback from our membership recently as to the type of CPD programmes we should deliver and we are currently developing these programmes which we intend launching in quarter two of this year."" ""Taking the Gartner Top 25 supply chains as a reference, we have the top-rated companies like Apple and P&G operating from Ireland,"" said Farrell. ""Conspicuous by their absence from this top 25 are any of the pharma companies operating from Ireland and these companies will be catching up on other industries in terms of supply chain maturity during 2016."" He said there was a trend towards spending less time focusing on the demand forecast. ""This is heresy to many practitioners but agility and responsiveness to actual demand and supply events is the guiding principle underpinning this movement,"" said Farrell. ""This process called Demand Driven MRP (DDMRP) requires the demand forecast to play no role in supply decisions. It can be mind-bending to run a supply chain in this way if your experience to date saw a forecast driving the plan, but we're seeing a lot of interest in this topic from Irish companies that do not have a strong tradition of accurate forecasting."" Farrell said recruiters were finding it difficult to source certified planners. ""There is a real shortage of certified talent and while many people end up working in supply chain, not enough is being done to educate this talent to certified levels,"" he said. ""Government-supported Skillnets are one way of addressing this gap, so an expansion here would certainly improve Ireland's credibility as a global hub for supply chain excellence,"" said Farrell. IPICS, the Supply Chain Management Institute, was established in 1981 to facilitate courses, study and exams in APICS certifications. ""This year, our focus will be on the creation of a Supply Chain Skillnet, raising awareness of new course areas such as DDMRP, Certification in S&OP, Certificate in Transport & Logistics, and promoting existing certifications such as CPIM and CSCP,"" said Farrell. With supply chain management (SCM) now widely recognised as a critical success factor for many organisations, there is a growing need for more formalised training, according to Eoin Plant, assistant head at Dublin Institute of Technology's School of Transport Engineering, Environment and Planning, which manages the National Institute for Transport & Logistics (NITL). ""In contrast to other professions, a career in supply chain management and logistics tends not to develop in an orthodox way,"" said Plant. ""You could say that traditionally many people fell into an SCM career. However, today you find higher education colleges are now offering SCM programmes at undergraduate and postgraduate level, offering a clear career path."" The National Institute for Transport and Logistics (NITL) offers a full-time MSc in Supply Chain Management and a flexible part-time course that allows students to tailor their own MSc to meet their particular career requirements. ""The aim of this programme is to develop the leaders of change and business improvement in all sizes and types of companies,"" said Plant. ""It achieves this through broad-based vocational postgraduate education, providing a thorough understanding of the key elements of logistics, technology, operational management and business."" \l"

What use is it to try to tackle global climate change through a country (or a group of countries) whose entire CO2 output, if somehow reduced to zero, would make not one bit of difference to global emissions?

"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland262","PARIS after the attacks","January 16, 2016 Saturday","Irish Daily Mail","As the Middle East editor of Newsweek, JANINE DI GIOVANNI had come to terms with the idea that she might die in a war zone. What she wasn't prepared for, however, was the terror on the streets of her own city that brought two worlds crashing together - and made her fall in love with Paris all over againOn Friday 13 November, I woke before and lay in bed thinking about weekend plans: lunches with friends, a bike ride by the Seine or Bois de Boulogne with my son. the early light crept through my curtains, I got up and prepared my chocolat chaud and tartine, before hustling him to school around corner from our flat on Rue Notre Dame des Champs in the of Paris.I love those moments walking my little boy, listening to his chatter; passing the house where Gertrude Stein once lived, the apartment where Hemingway lived with his first wife, and where many of the memories in his memoir A Moveable Feast - his love letter to Paris - were made.Then I went home, dressed quickly and rushed across the river to the Place Vend\'f4me.It was the middle of Paris Photo, the annual tribute to photography that draws some of the most gifted artists in the world to my city. It is also a time that sets offthe holiday season in Paris - lights going up all over the city, foie gras, champagne, parties, celebration, happiness.That morning, I was judging a prestigious prize and I was late. I ran up the two flights of a 17th-century building designed by Jules Hardouin-Mansart, so lovely that I stopped and took a photograph of the staircase. Paris is like that. Sometimes, just walking to buy bread or get on the metro, I see something so visually stunning that I have to pause and look. Thank goodness for Instagram.I have lived in Paris for 12 years, since I married a Frenchman (we are no longer together) and gave birth to our little boy. I am French by nationality now, meaning I hold a French passport and pay my taxes here. But I never really felt French until that dark Friday.Less than 24 hours later, I felt bonded to the city in a way I had never thought possible. Tragedy can do that. To believe that an attack so vile could take place in the middle of Paris was unthinkable. When it happened, and in its aftermath, Parisians stood together.The attacks all had a horrible sense of 'it could have been me ' - a slap in the face about the fragility of our own mortality. I had been to Le Petit Cambodge - one of the two restaurants attacked - just the week before, drinking beer and eating dinner with a good friend; the Bataclan was a place where I had passed happy hours listening to cool music.In early September, I had spent nine days in the H\'f4pital des Quinze-Vingts, which is on the route the killers took, so I was back and forth among those streets. I have often wondered about whether I would die in a war zone; I never thought about dying in my own city.For me, it was even more disturbing because, as Middle East editor of Newsweek, my work is centred on reporting in Iraq and Syria, and on the study of Islamic State [IS]. I am also a graduate student in international law and relations and am writing my MA thesis on the Syrian peace process. For the past four years, since I began reporting there, I have lived and breathed the Syrian conflict and the issues that go along with it: radicalisation, the rise of armed factions, terrorism.But war has always been somewhere else for me. As someone who has reported on conflicts for nearly 25 years, my only method for staying sane is to compartmentalise my work life and my home life. Home is nesting, cosy, friends, a fireplace, love, my son, food, drink, sleep, comfort.War is Iraq, Syria, Somalia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, South Sudan, Liberia, Chechnya, Libya, Sierra Leone. It is stories about blood, war, vengeance, hatred, murder, rape, torture, refugees, ethnic cleansing, chemical weapons, starvation as a tool of war - issues that I feel must be brought to light.But the person who wears a flak jacket and crouches when bombs go offis not the same person who makes Sunday lunch and teaches my son to appreciate Chopin. Separating the two is the only thing that has allowed me to escape the hell-onearth traumatic syndromes that some of my colleagues suffer from.But the Paris attacks changed all that. Except for a brief few months after my son was born - and I was recovering from living in Iraq and assuming that every window had the potential to be shattered by a car bomb - I have felt safe here.Paris is a place where I take the metro at midnight; where I walk home alone and never assume the worst. Paris is the Algerian fruit seller outside my door where I can leave my keys for friends to pick up if I am away and trust them entirely. Paris is the Pharmacie Stanislas across the street where I can go any time of day and know I will find the right answers. I have learned, in my dozen years here, to trust Paris.Suddenly, I felt betrayed by my own innocent trust. I have a dear French friend who last year nearly died from malaria that she caught working in South Sudan. Part of the recovery process for her was learning to trust her body again, because she felt it had betrayed her, let her down.But as she grew healthier, she told me she discovered something monumental: 'My body had not betrayed me - it saved me,' she told me. 'It did not let me die. It pulled me out of the coma I was supposed to never wake up from. I survived.' In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, I felt let down, in some sense, by my city. Where were the gaps in the security services that could allow so many people to die? Where was intelligence, when French intelligence is so strong? How had they let this slip through the cracks? But by the next week, as the city slowly came back to life - and even as I write this, weeks later, there are still checkpoints on certain streets where I have to show my ID to pass - I began to see the strength of this society. Many people, my French relatives included, lived through war and occupation, and not only survived, but learned to make the best of it.The reason I fell in love with my ex-husband (one of the many reasons) was that when I met him in Sarajevo during the siege, he taught me about a French idea called 'Syst\'c8me D', a wartime concept which means making the best of a dire situation. In Sarajevo, the French reporters always kept some saucisse and a bottle of wine tucked into their gear to supplement their humanitarian rations. It's a clich\'e9, but they always had style.A week after the attacks, my son and I finally went for that bike ride. I took my rented V\'e9lib and he took his mountain bike and we rode down through Rue de Rennes in the 6th arrondissement to the Seine. We followed the quiet, dreamy water west, seeing all the runners, families, skateboarders and sailors who had come out, almost in defiance: we are not going to let you destroy us, they seemed to say.This morning as I write, the French tricolore is still at half-mast and raw emotion remains, but there is hope for the future. The climate change conference opened today, with world leaders from 140 countries arriving in Paris, not afraid of terror. I still look at the photos of the dead from that awful night and well up with tears because I know they are someone's daughter, someone's son, someone's loved one - who will never come home again. The horror of terrorism is that it always strikes innocents.But Paris is resilient. Paris will survive and go on. We will not forget, but we will continue. It's part of what makes France great. Le Petit Cambodge, the restaurant where so many died, posted a notice on its website that the restaurant would open out of solidarity: 'Because life must go on, out of respect for the customers who were here that night. Not to reopen would be to give in and concede a victory [for IS].' On Facebook, friends wrote of going to parties where they 'dragged their feet because they did not want to leave their houses'. But when they got there, they sang, drank, danced, smoked and made their own little victory over terrorism.Hearing all the stories made me incredibly proud. I have had my French passport for many years, but for the first time, I felt truly bonded to this place.It is interesting to note that Hemingway's A Moveable Feast topped the bestseller lists here in the wake of the attacks. It is a classic memoir of Paris, but one that perhaps had been forgotten until now. It tells the story of Hemingway's love affair with this city, and I think people are buying it because they, too, are falling in love with Paris, all over again.Janine di Giovanni is the Middle East editor of Newsweek.

Sean O'Driscoll, chief executive of Glen Dimplex - which is the world's largest manufacturer of domestic heating appliances - says the energy revolution is here and now it's just a matter of joining all the dots across the various industries.""We are selling Quantum (the electric heating and storage system being rolled out in 1,250 homes) and have been selling Quantum for the last three years as a heating device which has a 27pc lower running cost (than its predecessor).""So we're already selling the unit on that basis and that's a standalone basis and we have sold 80,000 of them between the UK and Ireland over the last three years,"" said Mr O'Driscoll, proving that the results of the RealValue project will be able to stand up on their two feet in economic terms.The RealValue project has a total of 13 partners on board, including energy economists from UCD and businesses from both the public and private sector.The Glen Dimplex CEO explained: ""What this project is now about is saying we now want to take the technology to the next level, we know we have a very good heating system which is operating in isolation from the overall energy ecosystem.""We're now saying with connectivity, with digital connectivity, we can bring all of this together and provide it as a service to the electricity industry.""That's 1,250 homes, that's what those business models are and within that there are about eight or 10 different income streams that can be generated out of that which can be passed on, part of it, to the consumer.""The results of the project can be divided into two parts, between the customer running their home off the electricity grid and then the industry, which is supplying the energy and ensuring its distribution.""The customer is getting a much more controllable and a much more energy-efficient system and the running cost for a Quantum heater relative to its predecessor is a 27pc reduction, so there's a real, real tangible saving.""It's completely controllable and you can also control it over an app. You're bringing a better solution to the home and you're bringing a cheaper solution to the home.""Then the second side of all of this is, if you aggregate a population of homes, which is the 1,250 that we're talking about in this project, you can provide that as an energy store for the electricity system.""There are times during the day, in the winter particularly, where it's very windy, and there's too much electricity coming onto the system.""You can now find a home for that and when it's surplus to requirement it's cheaper, because after putting up the turbine, the costs are minimal. The wind is for free.""So you're providing a balancing system to the grid operator and that is of real value to the grid operator and that will reflect itself in a better tariff and a better pricing structure for the customer,"" he explained.""There is very, very significant industry collaboration here in Ireland. So you look across the 13 members that we have, we have EirGrid, which is the grid operator in Ireland, we have ESB Networks, which is the networks operator, we have SSE Electricity, which is an energy provider.""Now that would be unheard of to be able to get the sector together, to get that together in another country would be virtually impossible. We are able to do that here in Ireland.""It's five years of very, very hard work. At a very early stage, we would say EirGrid, ESB Networks and SSE Electricity got this immediately.""Another key player to come on board was Intel, bringing the project to a whole other level of applicability.""The other thing we love about this is, we got an absolutely cold-call from Intel research, [in] November 2011.""They knew why they were making the call, they heard it in Brussels that we were working on something very significant in this area,"" explains Mr O'Driscoll about how the technology giant became involved.""They were building out a gateway technology platform for electric vehicles and concluded that there wouldn't be a population of electric vehicles to deliver what they wanted any time soon, so they were looking to see how could they deploy this technology into something that would be available quickly and then they heard of our heating technology and they approached us to see if we wanted to work with them.""By the time Intel came on board, it meant that RealValue now had indigenous Irish industries (Glen Diplex) working alongside the country's largest foreign direct investor (Intel), as well as ESB and EirGrid from the public sector and then the UCD Energy Research Centre.And the parties promise to have the results of RealValue as soon as possible, so that it can be implemented and rolled out into the real world.""We're looking here at a three-year project, we are six months into the project and we won't be waiting until the very end to find out the lessons from this.""As we're going along, we're getting information and using information and we're moving along our business model.""So this is not waiting for the big bang at the end of the three years, this is a progressive learning process and as we're doing it.""We will then be using that to put that platform over all of the houses that currently have the heaters installed,"" Mr O'Driscoll said.Furthermore, this project is something the whole world is keeping an eye on, and it is not just a project relevant to a small island on the fringe of Europe.The island just happens to be the perfect research ground for it.""This has international opportunities. We will be working on this concept everywhere from Tasmania through to Nova Scotia. Word gets out. This actually has international appeal and opportunity. Ireland is at the forefront of this.""The wonderful thing about Ireland is, we actually have it in the era of energy that we're heading into, and we're only at a very, very early stage of it.""Ireland being an island with very little connectivity, hugely dependent on fossil fuels historically, it throws up all of the problems that this industry will have worldwide and those problems can be studied, they can be researched and the solutions found, which not only have relevance to Ireland but to the UK, to Germany, to France,"" explained the Glen Dimplex CEO.Key figures from countries like Spain and Portugal are already seeking to speak to the leaders of the RealValue project, because they have the ""same problems.""So will Ireland be home to the world's next Silicon Valley, having spearheaded this international home-energy project? ""I would be very hopeful that the answer to your question, 30 years from now, is that we look back at it and say, 'Ireland was at the forefront of this,'"" answers Mr O'Driscoll. Right now, however, Denmark and not Ireland is at the forefront of renewable energy consumption, something that has benefited the country's economy too.""The country that we think has the best energy policy in the whole world at this time is Denmark. Denmark has a national policy of saying that by 2050, it will be completely independent of fossil fuels, irrespective of the price.""They've already started the process of getting there and if you look at the Danish economy over the last 15 years it's grown by about 40pc, and its energy consumption has been reduced by 18pc. ""So again to the people who say, £ll this does is over-layer the consumer, the customer, the industry with costs,' they're wrong.Denmark has the policy and framework that we can all look at and say, 'that's the way to do it,'"" explained Mr O'Driscoll.Other people who he believes are 'wrong' are those stockbrokers and detractors who say that the green energy industry is a long time off being economically sustainable, aside from government grants.""Well firstly I would say to the stockbrokers, if they were saying that to me, I would say, 'you're wrong, the technology is there.' ""All the parts are there from a technology point of view, it is connecting the parts.""So the technology is there, the connectivity will be there very, very quickly,"" said the CEO.In terms of Ireland, where a whopping 52pc of homes are oil-heated, it seems like it would take a long, long time before the results of the RealValue project could be implemented here. Europe will have to push us on.""Europe has set a 2050 target to electrify heat and transport. If we were sitting here in 2025 or 2030, I think we'd be having a very different conversation.""This is not something that's going to happen overnight, this is the start of a journey and we are at a very early stage in the journey,"" said Mr O'Driscoll.And perhaps he is right, considering that no less than 195 countries at COP21 (conference of parties) in Paris this month agreed to a landmark deal.These countries, Ireland included, aim to cut greenhouse gas emissions to a level that will limit the global average temperature to rise ""well below"" 2C (3.6F) compared to pre-industrial levels - 2C is a level of warming that is deemed to be the point when dangerous climate change could threaten life on Earth.GROWTH OF DANISH ECONOMY AT THE SAME TIME AS ITS ENERGY CONSUMPTION FELL BY 18PC 40pc'With connectivity, with digital connectivity, we can bring all of this together and provide it as a service to the electricity industry'\l"
"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland269","Investors starting t ting to bet big on green; As renewable technologies become more cost-effective, investors are now waking up to opportunities in the previou....","December 6, 2015","Sunday Independent","CLIMATE change and renewable energy are phrases long-associated with tree-hugging non-capitalist types, but in 2015, if you follow the money even in Ireland, you'll find business people are investing billions of euro in the new green sector. They're investing in companies that manufacture things such as solar panels, wind turbines and LED lighting. They're funding firms that build wind farms and companies that are developing software to run more efficient energy grids.In short, climate change is a reality and we appear to be in the middle of an energy revolution - the catalyst perhaps being the Paris climate conference, which ends this Friday. For the first time in history the world is on the cusp of having a legally binding and universal agreement on climate change thanks to the UN summit in Paris, known as the COP21 (Conference of Parties).This potential agreement, which US President Barack Obama is strongly backing, coupled with the fact that the creation of some renewable energy sources is as cheap, if not cheaper, than more traditional supplies such as oil and gas, means the green sector is now attracting major investment.""If you look at the next generation of investors they're very pro-environment. There is a trend to invest in companies that support society,"" said Chantal Brennan, the chief investment officer (CIO) with Davy Asset Management. ""The UN principles for responsible investment are an important part of how we think about things,"" added Ms Brennan, referring to the investment approach taken at Davy.In terms of environmental investments, ""directionally it's the right thing to do"", she added.""People want to do the right thing by the next generation. We're all members of the global community.""One Dublin fund has (EURO)1.5bn of its clients' money invested in green equities For the time being she feels that government subsidies are still needed in some cases to get companies off the ground in the green sector and in time to take these away, hopefully leaving the firms standing on their own two feet.One 'green fund' in Dublin, run by Kleinwort Benson Investors (KBI), has (EURO)1.5bn of client money invested in environmental equities.So where exactly should investors place their money and what are the incumbents that currently stand in the way of this energy revolution? Kleinwort Benson's chief investment officer Noel O'Halloran points to a few areas in which people are currently investing.""Wind, solar, hydro are the three renewable energies, within wind you have turbine manufacturers. So from an investment point of view you have Vestas Wind Systems, they're a Danish company, and then you've wind farm operators, you've one called Gamesa, which is a big Spanish company.""The other big area then is solar. There's a value chain there as much as anywhere else and the leaders would be a company called SunPower, which is probably the highest, most efficient manufacturer of solar panels globally.""There are also very low-cost, very efficient Chinese manufacturers. There's a company called Trina Solar and one called Canadian Solar - even though it's actually a Chinese manufacturer,"" said Mr O'Halloran.""There's an increasing amount of dedicated money. We have in our environmental fund today about (EURO)1.5bn of client money invested in environmental equities from a Dublin point of view,"" Mr O'Halloran told the Sunday Independent.For years, investors and big businesses have been extremely slow to back this sector but now 'grid-parity' means that the green industry is standing on its own two feet.Grid-parity is a technical term meaning 'on par' - in other words, the generation of some renewable energies is as cheap, if not cheaper than the extraction and roll-out of oil or gas extraction.""For instance today, wind energy in Eastern Brazil and solar energy in Northern Chile is cheaper than traditional energy sources.""In India, where almost 400m people have no access to electricity, heavily polluting diesel generators account for the bulk of electricity. Solar is emerging as a cost-effective and cleaner energy source especially in areas where there is no electrical grid,"" reads the KBI white paper on energy solutions.Furthermore, the cost of solar panels has reduced by 75pc since 2008.But it's not just in renewable energy where the investible opportunities are emerging. Technologies such as super batteries and LED lighting are creating an economic stir too.But the KBI white paper states that a breakthrough in battery technology is needed before the mass electric vehicle market will be penetrated.""We expect lithium ion battery costs to decl"
"COP21","Ireland","COP21_Ireland270","BHUTAN: THE PRICE OF PARADISE; The tiny Himalayan country, which long ago decided to limit tourism, has decided it's time to welcome more visitors. Will this pr....","January 16, 2016 Saturday","The Irish Times","I don't know who wrote the signs along the road that goes from Bhutan's international airport, at Paro, to Thimphu, the tiny capital, but like almost everything in this remote Himalayan kingdom they are distinctly memorable.""Don't be a gama in the land of lama,"" the most original one instructs. Translation: Don't drive crazily in the land of Buddha. Other road-safety rhyming couplets include ""Drive slow to avoid grave below,"" ""Faster spells disaster"" and ""On the bend go slow friend.""Paro Airport has one big and thoroughly stirring arrival route - through the Himalayas, with bonus views of Everest - one small airstrip in a breathtakingly gorgeous valley, and one small baggage carousel. The population of Bhutan is about 700,000, and the best road is that between the airport and Thimphu, 50km away. It's one of very few that is surfaced and the only one that appears to have clearly designated lanes. Hence the road signs, which are there to warn locals to slow down on a near-irresistible stretch of fast going in a country where elsewhere it takes hours to travel a few score kilometres. High value, low volume I have a driver and a guide because that's the rule for international tourists. This has been the policy since 1974, when Bhutan first opened to foreign tourists with a ""high value, low volume"" ethos. It was probably the only country actively seeking low numbers of visitors, albeit high-spending ones. Its visas are inexpensive, and Bhutan does not limit the number it issues, but it does impose a daily tariff. This fixes the cost of travel for international tourists and so keeps visitor numbers low. In high season the tariff is $250 (EUR 230) a day and in low season $200 (EUR 185), with supplements for travelling with fewer than two other visitors. The tariff covers your guide, driver, accommodation and meals.In 1974, 287 tourists visited. By 2008 that number had risen to 27,000 international tourists and 12,000 regional ones (which is to say people from India, Bangladesh and the Maldives, who do not have to pay the daily tariff) .On any scale, those figures are minuscule. In 2014 Ireland received 7.3 million tourists, a figure the industry is continuously trying to increase. Attracting more tourists has long been seen as good for an economy, including our own, but Bhutan has always aimed for something radically different.The Bhutan I arrive in in December is not very different from what those first tourists in 1974 would have experienced. True, wifi is almost everywhere, but the distinctive square houses are still built in the traditional way, and there are no advertisements, international franchises or western clothing chains to be seen. Many people still wear national dress, some of it woven by hand, and the landscape remains pristine. There is no McDonald's, Starbucks, KFC or Subway. Bhutan has a royal family, and the monarch, Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, is called the dragon king. The kingdom is known as the Land of the Thunder Dragon or, sometimes, after the Tibetan paradise in James Hilton's novel , as the Last Shangri-La. The royal family is revered and respected, if singular. The fourth king, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, who ruled between 1972 and 2006, has four wives, all sisters, whom he married on the same day. I see the four sisters' beautiful hand-woven wedding kiras in the textile museum in Thimphu. The fifth king says that Jetsun Pema, whom he married in 2011, when he was 31 and his bride was 21, will be his only wife. Their striking wedding photograph, showing them in yellow traditional royal dress, seems to be on the wall of every public space, with blown-up versions near many temples and in many town centres. Last November they announced that their first child, a son, will be born in February - and Bhutan rejoiced for a day and a night.Zebra crossings The only daily publication in Bhutan is Kuensel, an English-language paper of between eight and 12 pages. One day in December it carries a press release from the Royal Bhutan Police about the recently introduced zebra crossings in Thimphu - reputed to be the only capital city without traffic lights. The press release explains how pedestrians and motorists should behave at the zebra crossings: pedestrians have been lingering on their phones at some crossings, and motorists have failed to stop at others. ""We feel saddened to hear about such inconveniences,"" it says, ""but it is apparently happening because this is a new initiative. As time passes by, we expect people to be more aware about how to cross the Zebra Crossing."" I cannot think of another capital city where such instructions would be needed in a national paper.After its four-decade experiment in moderating the number of tourists visiting it, Bhutan is undergoing a change that some fear may result in more tourism and damage the country's so-far-unspoilt culture.In 2006 the fourth king, who had initiated the ""high value, low volume"" tourism policy, abdicated in favour of his eldest son and declared that he wanted Bhutan to make the transition from absolute monarchy to constitutional monarchy with a multiparty democracy. This was a highly unusual step in the absence of public pressure, lobbying or unrest, and one for which he was much admired.Bhutan held its first general election in 2008. Since then the monarchy has had an essentially symbolic role. Also since then there has been much discussion within the government about developing tourism. In 2009 the ""high value, low volume"" policy was changed to ""high value, low impact"". The government now has a target for attracting international tourists - it hopes to see 100,000 a year. By 2014 the number had reached 65,480. It's still a low figure, but it had more than doubled in only six years. The question nobody can answer is: how much will Bhutan change as a result of developing its tourism industry?During my stay the word that comes to my mind every day is ""pristine"". There is no other word to describe a country whose natural landscape has been so carefully conserved and is so consistently beautiful.Bhutan is like most countries in having specific destinations on its so-called tourist trail. Here they include the impossibly photogenic Tiger's Nest or Taktsang Palphug monastery, the country's most sacred site, which is built into the side of a mountain that tourists and monks hike to daily from Paro. But Bhutan is different in that the entire country is a destination in itself. The built and natural environments remain so astonishingly unspoiled by development that pretty much anywhere in the country will reward you equally. Bhutan's heritage is also unspoiled. For example, many people still wear national dress every day. Men wear a gho, which is a kind of woollen belted kimono; women wear a kira, a long wrap-around skirt, with a short jacket; and many children wear miniature versions. Paro and Thimphu have almost as many little fabric shops selling the makings of ghos and kiras as they have shops selling hand weavings and prayer wheels to tourists.Native forest At COP21All those deep, dense forests again bring fairy tales to mind. Trees wash across the mountains and valleys like the waves of a green ocean. Depending on the elevation, there are forests of fir, pine, spruce, cedar, cypress, magnolia, oak and laurel. The trees shelter countless species of wildlife, among them the rare snow leopard, common leopards, tigers, yaks, blue sheep, wolves, Himalayan black bears, red pandas and 770 types of bird. The forests of Bhutan are one of the last remaining great areas of biodiversity, and surely deserving of World Heritage status.The lack of pollution results in crystall"

Preparations for the centenary of the 1916 Rising got under way during the year, with all manner of planned ceremonies, commemorative books and various movie and TV portrayals all set up.[media=bbw]2518476[/media]On September 18, a state funeral took place in Cork for Thomas Kent, the only man to be executed outside of Dublin following the Rising. Kent had been buried in the grounds of Collins barracks, and it was deemed time that he be given a proper burial in his hometown of Castlelyons.On the political front, the split has already occurred, with Fianna F\'e1il and Sinn F\'e9in announcing during the year that they would hold their own commemorations.A taste of things to come was presented on August 1 with an event to mark the 100th anniversary of the funeral of O Donovan Rossa, the event at which P\'e1draig Pearse s oration singled him out as a serious dude. The President, Taoiseach and various dignitaries all attended. A few hours later, Sinn F\'e9in held its own re-enactment of the funeral complete with period costumes and all that jazz. Expect more jockeying for position to claim the mantle of real inheritor of the fallen leaders Ireland in the year to come.[media=bbw]2519070[/media]BROOKLYNThe Irish movie of the year according to the critics and the box office. Saoirse Ronan (above right) plays the lead role in the film adaptation of Colm Toib\'edn s novel about emigration from Wexford in the 1950s.Ronan s performance has attracted much speculation about the possibility of Oscar action, but it remains to be seen whether this weepie from the oul country makes waves among the movie people on the west coast of the USA.Typical of the gushing reaction was that in the British Daily Telegraph, which said the director John Crowley managed to achieve something close to a miracle the kind of old fashioned shivers-down-the-spine serendipity that s hushed and special and can t be taught .CLERY SOn June 12 the 350 staff at the iconic Dublin store were given 30 minutes to pack up and leave the building. The store had been sold and the new owners had new ideas for an enterprise that resonated with old Ireland.Trading had not been going well for at least a decade. Shopping habits had changed. Yet many felt that Cleary s could have a future with a little tweeking.The big issue was the treatment of staff. Some had worked there for more than 40 years. Many of them had come out and worked to save the store during a flood in 2013. Now they were simply being told they were excess to requirements, that a property ploy was in train and would they kindly clear off.For many, the episode was a searing example of modern capitalism.DONALD TRUMPThis guy is the business, all hair and hot air and a capacity to tap into the basest instinct among a particular type of American. The Donald, as he is known, bought Doonbeg golf resort in Co Clare in 2014 and arrived here like the Pope, greeted on the Shannon tarmac by a band of musicians and the minister for finance.In 2015 he concentrated on his race for the US presidency, outpolling a whole field of contenders for the nomination for the Republican party. The scary prospect that he could one day be US president is no longer a joke. At the very least, he is currently on track to get the nomination.Over the year he has managed to outrage by blaming Mexicans for US economic woes and suggesting in the wake of the Paris attacks that all Muslims in the US should be recorded on a database.He also managed to mock a reporter with a disability, just to show what a tough guy he is. On the upside, if he does become president, he is likely to retreat to Doonbeg for a little R&R, which will give our government the opportunity to bow and scrape before him on a regular basis.ENVIRONMENTFlash Gordon never had it this bad in his attempts to save the universe. Climate change kept coming at us throughout 2015, but as the curtain came down on the year the nations of the world gathered to join battle. The COP21 climate change conference in Paris went through some tortured negotiations before finally coming to an agreement to decarbonise as much as possible over the next decade.Among the world leaders in attendance was Enda Kenny, who gave a rousing speech about our responsibility to the planet, and soon after demounting the podium he explained to Irish reporters that this country would require a major derogation due to our reliance on agriculture. This may be the best little country in the world in which to do business, but as far as the environment is concerned, there s no getting away from farting cows.FENNELLY REPORTThe report by Judge Niall Fennelly into the departure from office of former garda commissioner Martin Callinan was published on September 1. This could have been a banana skin for the Taoiseach. Did he, like a tin pot dictator, sack the police chief for political expediency? Not really, said Fennelly in a report notable for its Jesuitical nuances.No record had been kept of a meeting in April 2014 where the commissioner s fate was sealed. It is beyond argument that good administration would require that a proper record be kept of such an important decision. In effect, the report gave the Taoiseach enough cover to claim that he didn t sack Callinan, although he created the conditions to induce Callinan to sniff the wind and take a hike. One way or the other, the public gave the Taoiseach a pass on the matter. A man with his folksy smile and clumsy charm would never cut mustard as a tinpot dictator.GREECEOn January 26, the left-wing coalition known as Syriza was elected to government in Greece, a country that was drowning in austerity. Led by Alexis Tsipras (below right, the party promised to tell the EU and ECB to clear off with their austerity. We don t want your bail-outs no more was the general message.The new departure was greeted with glee by the Left in Irish politics, which had long claimed that the Government should have talked as tough with the European powers that be. Gerry Adams had once said that the troika should be told to leave with their bail-out cash.Tsipras and his finance minister Yanis Varoufakis duly toured Europe, lecturing one and all that they had a moral duty to slash Greece s debt. Morality was on their side, but unfortunately they left the diplomacy at home.The result was another bailout with more onerous conditions, and a split. Tsipras returned to power in September after calling a general election, but Yanis split on his high-power motorbike, en route to the high moral ground.At year s beginning Syriza was all the rage among the left in Ireland. By year s end it was Sip what? Naah, never heard of them. HOUSINGThe year saw the housing problem balloon out of control. By December, around 80 families a month were becoming homeless in Dublin. In Cork, the Penny Dinners organisation had noticed a seven fold increase in those seeking its service over the last few year. Much of this was foretold.

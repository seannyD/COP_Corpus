Study tours, networking, learning, are all a lot of rot. Elected councillors, often one term, are all there to do a very simple part-time job.The $16,000 expense account should be reduced to zero.This is the insignificant Mornington Peninsula Shire, not New York City. It is my hard-earned money being exploited.Brian a. Mitchelson, MorningtonIt IS not ratepayers' money. It is in fact Mr Cowie's money, as it formed part of his salary package, negotiated with councillors.There is a history of such trips bringing information that has directly influenced shire policy and outcomes, more than justifying the trip expenses.The programs at events such as COP 23 (an annual United Nations climate change conference) deliver far more than any internet search would provide.Talking one-on-one with like-minded people from around the world is invaluable. The Nepean Ratepayers Association, which represents ratepayers in the Nepean Ward, commends Mr Cowie travelling to the COP 23 conference in Bonn.With his experience running commercial businesses he will definitely bring back some fresh ideas which will benefit ratepayers all over the shire.colin watson, Nepean Ratepayers AssociationAdi came to us three years ago, after five years as a puppy farm breeder. She was very traumatised by her early life, and it has taken us years to bring her out of her shell, but she still has some issues with people and loud noises.We live in Nunawading, and went down to Rosebud for a few days for a holiday. On November 3 we went to the Woolworths on Nepean Rd, where an aggressive German shepherd was barking in the back seat of a parked car.Adi was getting freaked out and when the aggressive dog went off she jerked out of her collar and ran. She made it safely through the carpark and across Point Nepean Rd (somehow) and disappeared in to the foreshore scrub.We searched for nearly 12 hours but, given her history, suspected she would be in deep hiding. After 19 hours (at 4.15am), Adi turned up at the front door, a bit cold and wet, but otherwise OK. We want to thank all the people who helped us in that time - especially the couple shopping at Woolworths. He helped Mum and Oli get home, while she raced across the road to help look and then they later got in their car to look further afield. Thanks also to the Woolworths employee who took off after Adi and followed her to the foreshore; Shelley, who posted a photo and missing notice on the 'Reuniting Lost and Found Pets - Mornington Peninsula' Facebook group; Emma from Kaya's Mission Traralgon (who rescued Adi three and a half years ago), who posted on the 'Kaya's Mission' Facebook page and paid to promote it for the Mornington Peninsula area. Thanks to the many people we encountered along the foreshore during our search - what a friendly, caring community!And Whitehorse Veterinary Hospital in Blackburn, who have been with us right through Adi's journey, and squeezed her in for a thorough check-up after her ordeal.Nicole Ackland, Nunawading\l"

""The reason is because at its core, it is an attack on renewable energy,"" he HYPERLINK http://reneweconomy.com.au/koutsantonis-slams-neg-says-it-is-an-attack-on-renewables-71267/is reported to have told a conference in Adelaide.""It's not a national energy guarantee at all, it is a guarantee for coal. It is an attempt to subsidise and keep alive coal-fired generation in the largest state in country.""But Mr Frydenberg, speaking in London, called on the state energy ministers to come to the Council of Australian Governments meeting with an ""open mind.""""We'll be taking modelling proposals to the COAG energy ministers meeting at the end of November,"" he said. ""I would ask those ministers to come to that meeting with an open mind and have a healthy debate. We have a long way to go with this policy but certainly early responses from the states [have] been positive..""Obviously [South Australian Premier] Jay Wetherill has different issues and a different agenda but I would hope that he and Tom Koutsantonis??? would see the merit in this proposal and would be happy to consider it in the context of energy pricing,"" he said. Round and round in circles? Earlier, Mr Frydenberg told an Australia-UK Chamber of Commerce breakfast gathering that the national energy guarantee proposal is the ""simple piece of the [climate policy] jigsaw that has been missing for so long"".""The NEG, representing the best advice of the energy experts, and a system which involves no taxes, no subsidies, no trading schemes and which meets the reliability requirements, and also the emissions reductions requirements and drives down prices at the same time, has been described for example by Bloomberg Energy Finance as a world-leading solution to a problem that is being faced by jurisdictions right around the world.""But questions remain whether the government's solution would be sustainable given previous attempts to curb emissions, such as the carbon pollution reduction scheme introduced by former prime minister Julia Gillard, have all fallen victim to politics.""How do you see the politics lining up behind this or are we just going to go round and round in circles once again and find another solution with promise that ultimately fails?"" one attendee asked. Mr Frydenberg singled out for praise his Labor opponent Mark Butler, whom he said he respected and was able to talk to in a ""frank and bipartisan"" way.""And I think they understand that this is the chance, this is the chance to end the so-called climate wars - in fact Mark wrote a book called Climate Wars,"" he said. Mr Frydenberg said his government's guarantee proposal has ""near-unanimous"" support from businesses and the energy sector.""I think the political debate has come a long way, I think people are tired of the argy-bargy that has gone on and I think when you see both supporting the NEG it does offer you an opportunity for a real breakthrough,"" he said.But Mr Butler has strongly criticised the guarantee as an ""incredibly rushed job"" that culminated in an ""eight-page letter"" that would take investment in clean energy backwards, as it does not lock in any commitments to either renewables or carbon reduction beyond 2030.""We are taking a pretty negative view of at least the underpinnings of the NEG so far,"" Mr Butler HYPERLINK http://reneweconomy.com.au/neg-a-rushed-job-that-takes-us-backwards-not-forwards-57932/said in a recent speech""It doesn't mean we are opposed to the principle of bringing a stable investment scheme into the national energy market architecture combining emissions and dispatchability imperatives.""On Tuesday Mr Frydenberg will represent Australia the United Nations in Bonn, Germany which began on Monday.

Big emitters like China and India are at the table. While Australia's share of the carbon footprint is small at 1.3 per cent, we are highly active in these international meetings.Some of the initiatives that Australia is driving include: The Asia-Pacific Rainforest Partnership FORMED in Sydney in 2014, the partnership brings together leaders from government, private sector and civil society to implement policies that prevent deforestation and forest degradation. About one billion tonnes of C02 is released each year in our region as a result of deforestation and land degradation, nearly double the emissions Australia produces annually from every sector of the economy combined. Indonesia has agreed to host the 2018 partnership meeting and our two countries are working closely together.The International Partnership for Blue Carbon ANOTHER Australian initiative, this partnership strengthens co-operation between 20 formal members, including research bodies, intergovernmental organisations and governments themselves, to protect mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses.It's a little-known fact these water-based ecosystems can sequester up to four times as much carbon as a traditional land-based forest ecosystem. If degraded or destroyed, significant amounts of greenhouse gases are released, making their conservation critical. With Australia home to about 10 per cent of the world's blue carbon, our role leading this region-wide effort to build awareness of blue carbon and encourage inventory standards to report and manage it has been well received.Climate finance AUSTRALIA is co-chair with Saudi Arabia of the Green Climate Fund and has spearheaded the Climate Finance Roadmap with the United Kingdom. Both initiatives seek to leverage support from government and private sector for investment in emissions reduction technologies and measures to build climate change adaptation and resilience.

President Donald Trump has vowed to pull the US out of the agreement although any exit cannot take place for several years.The Turnbull government is due to complete its review of climate policies by the end of 2017. Rising emissions from most sectors - including a resurgence in carbon releases from land clearing - are likely to show Australia will have to do much more to meet its Paris promise of reducing 2005 levels of pollution by 26-28 per cent by 2030.The WMO noted current CO2 levels were last reached during the mid-Pliocene era. At that time, Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets had melted, lifting sea levels by as much as 20 metres from current levels.The WMO said CO2 levels are now 145 per cent higher than the rate in 1750. The 3.3 ppm increase last year was about 50 per cent faster than the average rate of 2.21 ppm over the past decade.Methane, a more potent greenhouse gas than CO2, had increased even faster since 1750, rising 257 per cent since then to 1853 parts per billion in the atmosphere.It increased 9 ppb last year, and while less than the increase in 2015, the rise was much higher than the average 6.8 ppb annual increase over the past decade.The added greenhouse gas levels mean the so-called radiative forcing - the warming effect on the climate - has risen 40 per cent since 1990, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Last year alone, the forcing rose 2.5 per cent.""Without rapid cuts in CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions, we will be heading for dangerous temperature increases by the end of this century, well above the target set by the Paris climate change agreement,"" WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas??? said in a statement. ""Future generations will inherit a much more inhospitable planet, "" he said.Global temperature records were broken each year from 2014 to 2016, as the El Nino event combined with background warming.With conditions tilting towards the opposite pattern in the Pacific - a La Nina - 2017 is likely to be marginally cooler than last year but still be second or third warmest on record, NOAA estimated last month.\l"

"COP23","Australia","COP23_Australia39","Australia plays its part","November 17, 2017 Friday","The Advertiser (Australia)","Environment Minister Josh Frydenberg is in Germany for a key international conference on climate change. Here, he explains what Australia is doing to help combat the global problem.REPRESENTATIVES of nearly 200 countries have gathered in Bonn for COP23, the major climate change conference of the year.While the corridors will no doubt be filled with talk of the Trump Administration's decision to withdraw from Paris, support for the agreement remains firm.In record time, around 170 countries have ratified Paris. Collectively they represent more than 70 per cent of the world's emissions and GDP and more than 80 per cent of the world's trade and population.Big emitters like China and India are at the table.Some of the initiatives that Australia is driving include the Asia-Pacific Rainforest Partnership, which brings together leaders from government, the private sector and civil society to implement policies that prevent deforestation and forest degradation.To put it in perspective, about one billion tonnes of CO2 are released each year in our region as a result of deforestation and land degradation.This is nearly double the amount of emissions Australia produces annually from every sector of its economy combined.Indonesia has agreed to host the 2018 partnership meeting. Our two countries are working closely together on capacity building, verification methods and enhancing private sector financing opportunities to support concrete outcomes in this important area.Second, the International Partnership for Blue Carbon. Another Australian initiative, this partnership strengthens cooperation between 20 formal members, including research bodies, intergovernmental organisations and governments themselves, to protect mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses.It's a little known fact that these water-based ecosystems can sequester up to four times as much carbon as a traditional land-based forest ecosystem.If degraded or destroyed, significant amounts of greenhouse gases are released, making their conservation critical to the emissions management effort.With Australia home to about 10 per cent of the world's blue carbon, our role leading this regional-wide effort to build awareness of blue carbon and encourage inventory standards to report and manage it has been well received.Third, climate finance. Australia is co-chair with Saudi Arabia the Green Climate Fund and has spearheaded the Climate Finance Roadmap with the United Kingdom.Both initiatives, the Fund and the Roadmap, seek to leverage support from government and the private sector for investment in emissions reduction technologies and measures to build climate change adaptation and resilience.Australia itself has committed at least $1 billion in climate finance over five years, including $300 million to projects working with our neighbours in the Pacific.Fourth, mission innovation. Australia is a member of a 21-nation grouping that is committed to double its investment in clean energy technology by 2020.Already a leader in the field, Australia has much to gain from sharing experiences and knowhow with other countries.This has particular resonance for South Australia, where the Turnbull Government has invested in a range of innovative new projects such as the virtual power plant in Adelaide which links 1000 premises with solar and storage, a $30 million battery project on the Yorke Peninsula and a pumped hydro feasibility study at Cultana.No one country needs to reinvent the wheel or to confine the application of their technology successes to their own domain.To the contrary, reducing emissions is a global effort and must be done at lowest cost which can only be achieved through technology transfer.The work Australia's Clean Energy Finance Corporation and Renewable Energy Agency are doing around pumped hydro, including Snowy 2.0, battery storage and large scale wind and solar has been acknowledged globally.The COP will also be a good opportunity to outl"

"COP23","Australia","COP23_Australia43","Fiddling while rome burns","November 28, 2017 Tuesday","The Australian","Politicians will not do anything about global warmingSay one thing about Australia's dawdle towards an agreed energy policy: it's matching the pace of the global process.A few days before the COAG Energy Council met last week to put off agreeing to the government's National Energy Guarantee, the latest UNFCCC conference of parties (COP23) wound up in Bonn with a similar outcome.Not that either Hobart or Bonn were failures - far from it!Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg put out a press release on Friday that the Turnbull government welcomed the decision to do ""further design work"" on the National Energy Guarantee.And the Bonn talks were always meant to take steps towards implementing the agreement at COP21 in Paris two years ago, when almost all countries on earth agreed to do their best to reduce global warming to less than 2 degrees, sometime soon.The US announced this year that it was going to pull out of the whole thing but hasn't actually done so yet. US delegates did turn up in Bonn, and used a side event to try to sell the benefits of coal and nuclear energy, which went down like a uranium balloon by all accounts.Anyway, negotiations on the Paris ""Rulebook"" are now meant to take place in 2018 in the lead up to COP24 in Poland at the end of next year and something called the Talanoa Dialogue was set up to discuss the contributions that parties would submit to carbon abatement by 2020. Not make mind, submit.The reason it's all got a bit slow is money. In Paris, $US100 billion was agreed to be paid by developed nations to developing ones to help meet their targets. But with the US out, everyone else will have to pay more, a lot more.China is moving swiftly to fill the global moral leadership vacuum on combating global warming, but there's no sign yet of them making the switch from developing to developed nation and coughing up cash rather than receiving it.Meanwhile in Hobart, COAG met to consider the Turnbull government's proposal for the National Energy Guarantee (NEG), submitted by the Energy Security Board (ESB) to replace the chief scientist's Clean Energy Target (CET).As discussed here previously, the CET had the wrong name to get through the Coalition party rooms - the word ""clean"" was never going to fly. When the ESB replaced ""clean"" with ""national"" and ""target"" with ""guarantee"", the Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Frydenberg fell on it with a glad cry and held it aloft as the shining solution.But alas Labor is still against it. Between the CET - which Labor would go along with - and the NEG - which the Coalition's right-wingers will cop - there is little difference in reality but a vast gulf in politics, which, as we know, is not reality.In Hobart, past grievances and alliances were on the table in plain sight. The Labor governments of SA and ACT voted against, the Liberal governments of NSW and Tasmania voted for, Queensland had no government at all at that point so it didn't vote and Victoria said it was open to finding out more about it.So in the end, Victoria won - they're going to find out more, or do more design work, or something.Most of the modelling done so far shows that the NEG will do absolutely nothing either to bring down emissions, enhance security or reduce energy prices, and the price reductions predicted with a rhetorical flourish by Frydenberg last week were apparently due to the Renewable Energy Target, not the NEG, which was a bit awkward.It seems the ""further design work"" agreed upon by COAG in Hobart will mainly be needed to ensure that the NEG is actually neutral in its impact and doesn't make emissions and security worse rather than better, in which case it will be back to square one, since Turnbull's political opponents on both sides will have every excuse to gleefully knock it back.The way things are going, Australia's first bipartisan energy policy might be ready to go by the time the Paris Rulebook is finalised in 2020. Or maybe not.Overall, it's becoming clear that action on climate change is the last thing any politician wants to take, and the focus of all political work on the matter is to appear to be doing something, without doing anything.The reason for this is not hard to find: earlier this year Nobel-prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz and former World Bank chief economist Nicholas Stern said that the only way to prevent catastrophic global warming would be to tax carbon dioxide at $40-$80 per tonne by 2020, and up to $100 by 2030.That sort of carbon tax would increase the prices of fossil fuel energy so much that the world would very quickly dump oil and coal in favour of wind, solar and batteries.Thankfully, renewables are now cheap enough that there wouldn't be a global recession as a result, but coal and oil-rich countries like Australia would definitely lose big.Meanwhile the UN's World Meteorological Organisation said last week that 2017 is the hottest on record and that the concentration of greenhouse gases is the highest in 800,000 years, thanks partly to a big increase in methane because of fracking in the US and the growth in livestock numbers.And scientists are now increasingly coming out and saying that the impact of global warming will be far worse than thought.So thank goodness the whole thing is a Marxist conspiracy by those scientists and their fellow travellers, otherwise the fact that politicians are on a deliberate go-slow in dealing with it might be a serious problem.Alan Kohler is the publisher ofThe Constant Investor.\l"

He reckons there's a lot more in this story still to be discovered.Netani Rika: It would be uncomfortable for some people in Fiji if it became known what these people were actually doing here, and how they came in in the first place, and how they were able to stay longer than their tourist visas allowed them.Hagar Cohen: So what do you think they actually did in this country?Netani Rika: I think there has to be a link to prostitution, and that is one of the angles that we are pursuing at this time. We don't expect too much help from police in this matter, so it could become quite a drawn-out affair.Hagar Cohen: But you're not giving up?Netani Rika: No, one must never give up.Hagar Cohen newspaper. He refused to buckle to the almighty government censors.Once, instead of running an edition full of heavily censored stories, Rika published a blank newspaper edition. He says he wanted the public to know their right to information was under attack.Netani Rika: Of course the paper came out the next day with a lot of blank spaces. That really set them off. We played a bounded pushing game I suppose from then until November 2010. They put a lot of pressure on people.Hagar Cohen: It was a risky game. Rika says he became a target.Netani Rika: There were a number of incidents: there's the stoning of my home and my car, and the attempt to burn the home, there's three separate incidents. Abusive phone calls from the Prime Minister, being sworn at, and detention.Hagar Cohen: He recounts how in 2009 his team were investigating a number of sensitive stories about Commodore Bainimarama, now the Prime Minister, including the Commodore's purchase of a house. The paper also published critical opinion letters about the military rule. Rika alleges that Bainimarama threatened him to stop publishing these stories, or else:Netani Rika: The words in English would be, 'Do you want to put an end to this or do you want me to end it for you?'Hagar Cohen: And what did you say?Netani Rika: I said that he was entitled to his opinion and that we will run his views if he wanted to, whereupon he swore at me.Hagar Cohen: He swore at you? What did he say?Netani RikaHagar Cohen: The Prime Minister?Netani Rika: Yes.Hagar Cohen: The next day, Netani Rika says his car was smashed. No link has been established between the two incidents.Netani Rika: Of course complaint was made to the police after that incident.Hagar Cohen: You complained to police?Netani Rika: Yes. I made a complaint to the police, and the officers who came and took the statement said, 'You know this is not going to go anywhere.' I said, 'Well, all that aside, let's just follow the process and see where it goes.' Of course seven years later I'm still waiting for any outcome from the police.Hagar Cohen: has contacted the office of the Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama and Fijian police for a response, but we've received no comment.In 2006, when he was head of the military, Commodore Frank Bainimarama overthrew the democratically elected government of Laisenia Qarase.Journalist [archival]: It had been threatening for weeks and this evening it was declared Fiji's fourth coup.Frank Bainimarama [archival]: As of six o'clock this evening the military has taken over the government, has executive authority and the running of this country...Hagar Cohen: At that time it was common for journalists to be detained and beaten. Today, the suppression of the media is slightly more subtle.: I think there's still this latent fear of being dealt with by the military. But for others it's not that so much, but people are afraid of losing their government assignments, their work with government companies, they are just afraid of being blackened or tarred by the government in any way because that's going to affect their incomes, their jobs, they could be blacklisted, they could be investigated.Hagar Cohen: This is Richard Naidu.Richard Naidu: I'm a former journalist, so I've been around the media scene for quite a long time in Fiji. I've advised over the last 20 years various media organisations. I'd probably say that I don't think I've ever seen the media at quite such a low ebb as it is now.Hagar Cohen: Naidu is Fiji's most respected human rights lawyer. His opposition to the coup even got him into trouble with the military, and let's just say he's lucky to be alive.Naidu is a partner with Munro Leys legal firm in Suva, and he's represented the Fiji Times newspaper in its many legal stoushes with the government. Naidu says prosecuting journalists became much easier in 2010 when a draconian media decree was introduced.Richard Naidu: If you look at particularly perfidious provisions in the media decree such as Section 22 which criminalises the reporting of anything which is against the national interest, for example. That's a classic. We've managed to put the whole of what in Australia would be understood as the media code, a voluntary set of rules that people comply with, that's been made law now. So for example, it's the law that you must report in a balanced way. Now, how on earth can that be the law? Because to say that you must report in a balanced way is of course an aspiration, and it's one that all media should try to achieve, but to suddenly say it's the law that you report in a balanced way well, who enforces the law? Of course every news media organisation is effectively chilled by those provisions, their lawyers advise them to take extreme care to ensure that they stay on the right side of those laws, which means that there are a whole lot of areas that are just no-go zones for journalists.Hagar Cohen: So the main interpretation that I've seen is, for instance, if an event has happened that involves a government department and criticism of that government department, unless the journalist receives on-the-record statements from that particular department, without this statement their reporting won't be balanced and therefore they are not allowed by law to publish this article. Is that right?Richard Naidu: Well, that's not my view of it. My view of it is that balance is fine if you deliver a balancing view the following day, for example, or in another story. But it's not so much what people like me think, it's more what media organisations are advised, including by the government, of what the government thinks is balanced. Generally speaking, the media here do not want to get offside with the authorities, notwithstanding that in many cases it's the media's job to be offside with the authorities.Hagar Cohen: Two years after these strict media laws were introduced, the Bainimarama government in Fiji engaged one of the world's most influential media and lobbying companies to manage the press. That American multinational company is Qorvis. Its clients have included Saudi Arabia in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, Bahrain, Kurdistan part of Iraq, and Sri Lanka. In the recent budget paper it was disclosed that Fiji paid Qorvis an annual fee of 1 million Fijian dollars.On the face of it, this is normal practice for many governments around the world. But according to documents obtained by , Qorvis has an unprecedented amount of control and power in its dealings with the Fijian public service and the media.Qorvis promotional video: At Qorvis MSLGroup we've prepared executives, ambassadors and even Nobel laureates for media appearances. In our state-of-the-art studio we help our clients prepare for their television, radio, or print interview.Hagar Cohen: An ad from the Qorvis YouTube channel spruiks the company's worldwide credentials.: Our training focuses on understanding one's role as a newsmaker, how to hone messages to make them more compelling for an audience. We show clients how to deliver those messages...Hagar Cohen: A Qorvis consultant in Fiji is Graham Davis, who was born in Fiji but lived and worked for many years as a TV journalist in Australia. His Qorvis job started in 2012 and his role is hands-on. Last year, Graham Davis complained to the editor the Fiji Sun newspaper, Peter Lomas, about his editorial decision-making in the Coconut Wireless column. In April 2016, Lomas included in the paper sarcastic commentary about human rights lawyer, Richard Naidu.Reading: Vinaka, Richard Naidu, that lawyer of many tweets, good humour and close association with the opposition.Vinaka, Richard Naidu, and yes, we do know where Pyongyang is. Good to see you still reading the Bigger, Brighter, Better paper first thing.Hagar Cohen: The column prompted this harsh email response from Graham Davis, who asked Lomas not to make Richard Naidu a martyr, something the Fijian government was concerned about.Reading: Seriously, why is this allowed in the paper at all? Who benefits from these sneering, petty ad hominem attacks on the government's opponents? Because they elicit sympathy for them and contempt for the attacker. And they are giving Richard Naidu constant fodder to persuade his 1,411 followers on Twitter that he's relevant, when he's not. If the idea is that it's helpful to the government, believe me nothing could be further from the truth. Deeply concerned about the feedback I'm getting generally around town about the Sun. 'Zero credibility', 'rag', 'cocksucker', is the general drift. Sorry to be brutal, but it's the truth. I explained many months ago that the paper is only helpful to the government if it retains its credibility.Hagar Cohen: CC'd in the email is Ewan Perrin, until recently one of the most senior public servants in Bainimarama's administration, and an Australian expat. He left his job in Fiji abruptly last year, so I gave him a call.So look, we're recording, but it's a pre-recording...Ewan Perrin: It's not live. You'll...Hagar Cohen: Exactly.Ewan Perrin: My name is Ewan Perrin. I was the Permanent Secretary for the Fiji Department of Information and Communications, Ministry of Information and Communications, from February to May 2016.Hagar Cohen: So that's a period of about four months, isn't it?Ewan Perrin: Yes. I actually counted it, it was 100 days.: Before he left, his job was to manage all government communications.Ewan Perrin: The Permanent Secretary's role is to provide oversight, guidance, efficient running of all aspects of the department.Hagar Cohen: Perrin is no longer living in Fiji. He's decided to blow the whistle on how Qorvis manages the media and the public service.Ewan Perrin: It was very clear to me that Qorvis calls the shots on all government communications.: Why do you say that?Ewan Perrin: There was an instance where a letter had been drafted by Qorvis, so I was instructed to sign the letter, and hand-deliver it to the editor and publisher of the Fiji Times.Hagar Cohen: Who were you instructed to do that by?Ewan Perrin: The head of Qorvis in Fiji, with the Attorney General's approval.Hagar Cohen: That's Graham Davis.Ewan Perrin: That's right.Hagar Cohen: Did you have any part in drafting that particular letter?Ewan Perrin: No, I did not draft it, and I was not involved in any discussion about the topic, and I was not expected to do anything except sign that letter and deliver it.: The controversy centred on what Graham Davis said were unfounded allegations that Prime Minister Bainimarama plagiarised a recent speech. The Fiji Times wrote a story about the speech, pointing out the similarities to another speech given by an official in the United States. But the newspaper did not allege plagiarism. Nevertheless, Davis accused the Fiji Times of making up false accusations:Reading: The has clearly set out to wilfully mislead its readers and damage the Prime Minister's credibility. I request an immediate retraction of this story and the publication of a prominent apology.Hagar Cohen: Ewan Perrin says even though he didn't write the email, he was expected to deliver it to the editor of the Fiji Times under his own signature. Graham Davis wrote to him in the email that the Attorney General had approved it.Reading: The AG has approved this and has asked that you send it both by email and hand-delivered to Hanks Arts as soon as possible this afternoon. Cheers.Hagar Cohen: But Ewan Perrin didn't do that. He fought back.Ewan Perrin: I didn't agree ethically with the content and the tone of the letter, I made a decision at the time that it was more important that I maintain my standards, high standards of integrity, to act without fear or favour, and to actually escalate the issue to the highest level of government, to see if we could actually resolve it in some other way, rather than just...I was feeling like I would just become a lackey, I would have no value really, and I would compromise my own integrity as well.Hagar Cohen: So you were...there was an attempt by Qorvis to control you as well? Ewan Perrin: Yes, yes, and I don't think it was about personally controlling me, it was controlling the position of the Permanent Secretary. That particular instance was part of a pattern that had been started emerging, which was the Permanent Secretary was not being treated as a respected advisor to the minister. The Permanent Secretary was 'sign the document, make the statement, and don't bother trying to think about anything or contributing to the discussion'.Hagar Cohen: Perrin says the expectation to follow instructions blindly made him particularly uncomfortable. It had happened before, when the office of the Solicitor General asked him to sign a sworn affidavit in court without even reading it.Ewan Perrin: And I wasn't expected to read it, and I wasn't expected to have any input into it, and I was also not expected to have read other documents that I was swearing that I had already read. And again, I pushed back there I said, look, I'm not going to sign this until I've read it, and I'm not going to sign it and say that I've read this other document until I've read that one too, so go and get it. So they went all over town to find these documents, and they also had to keep the High Court open for an extra half an hour so that they could actually get the signed affidavit in on the closing date.Hagar Cohen: That is extraordinary.Ewan Perrin: It is extraordinary.Hagar CohenEwan Perrin: Yes, very much do as you're told.Hagar Cohen: But the alleged plagiarism issue with the was the last straw.Ewan Perrin: Yes. I did take that up with the Attorney General, and interestingly he just refused to speak to me for the next two or three weeks. And then I went back to Graham Davis, who kind of exploded and had a heart attack over the phone, and sort of started shouting and ranting at me.Hagar Cohen: What did he say?Ewan Perrin: He was quite insulting, I mean, he was obviously quite wound up, and he was quite insulting. I can't recall the exact...I can recall some things, but I'm not going to share some of those words on public radio.: Perrin says he was sacked and had to leave. After he left, he says the role of the Permanent Secretary wasn't advertised, and a number of key communications positions were staffed by relatives of the Prime Minister and the Attorney General.Ewan Perrin: What they have done is they've put an Acting Director of Information, which is the Prime Minister's daughter, and the man who runs the newsroom is the Prime Minister's nephew. And the man who runs the national broadcaster is the Attorney General's brother. Some of these people are quite talented, but again, there is no transparency in terms of some of these appointments. You can call it nepotism or cronyism or whatever you want to call it, but it's unhealthy.Hagar Cohen: The Prime Minister's daughter is no longer in that position.Ewan Perrin says he is very concerned about journalists in Fiji, in particular the suppression of freedom of speech. He says there are serious and immediate consequences for people who refuse to toe the l"

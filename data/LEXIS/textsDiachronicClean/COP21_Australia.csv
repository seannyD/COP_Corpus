What this will mean for agriculture is that there are new investments in reforestation projects and forestry offsets. Carbon projects could become tradable internationally and popular. Landowners can benefit from approved method projects like Beef Herd Management, sequestering carbon in soils in grazing, feeding nitrates to cattle, avoiding clearing of native regrowth and savanna fire management projects, just to name a few. Perform these in accordance with the rules and credits or money could be earnt.Reliance on fossils fuels is set to reduce (these can still be offset using sinks, CCS etc) and there will be growth in clean energy and renewables. The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) for example funded over $22m towards the Barcaldine Community Solar Farm. Some projects like this could be located on private land and agreements reached with private companies who wish to construct these renewable projects.Grazing may still be grazing, but what if you just grazed a little differently and were paid to reduce your greenhouse gas emissions or the emissions of some other polluter in another country?"" \l"

But the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris does not end for another two weeks.So what happens now at the world's biggest gathering on global warming?The nations get down to the nitty gritty.Howard Bamsey is an adjunct professor at the Australian National University. Previously he was deputy secretary of Australia's Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, and Australia's lead negotiator at the UN climate conferences.He estimates he has been to at least 18 of the 21 conferences.""The most important event, in terms of the expectations of the people who are looking on, is the negotiations themselves,"" he said.In the lead-up to the Paris conference, a draft version of the international agreement to limit global warming was circulated.This week, negotiators from each nation will break into specialist teams, each taking a section of the draft to consider, Professor Bamsey said.""At this stage they're all in these smaller groups working on a limited set of issues. All separately,"" he said.""So in the Australian delegation, every morning there'll be a meeting where the negotiators from the different groups come together and inform one another what's been happening in their groups so they can make the connections and see how the whole thing is shaping up.""It's really difficult to judge what the whole picture is unless you're able to keep in touch with the different processes that are happening at the same time.""Gruelling, complex negotiations not for the 'impatient'Professor Bamsey says negotiations happen both formally and informally, day and night, in a gruelling process for the delegates.Sometimes talks become stuck when one nation will not budge on a particular issue.""They insist on full discussion. They want their outcome and they won't back down very easily. So at different points, different parts of the text become a blockage to the agreement as a whole,"" he said.But judging which issue to move on from and where to stand firm is all part of complex and often unrelated issues.""What might look like a completely straightforward negotiating process is filled with all this significance that isn't apparent on the surface,"" Professor Bamsey said.""So you can see inordinate amounts of time given to negotiating what might seem to be quite straightforward text.""The ones that are invested in significance ... they can take a long time to resolve.""Unless you're part of the process, you can become very impatient with the time taken to resolve those because they may not look on the surface as if they're significant at all.""By about Saturday, he said various pieces of the text should be settled or decisions made in a draft form.From there, the negotiating baton is passed to the next level up. That is usually the most senior negotiators, or ministers.""That's when the final trade-offs are made,"" he said.Circus of the talks can help negotiationsThe 2015 conference aims to have the text fairly well nailed down by the middle of the next week.In the meantime, outside the often closed-door haggling over draft text, businesses, activist groups, think tanks and academics all gather in what has become the world's biggest trade-fair for climate change ideas and industry.Professor Bamsey said the associated circus could be an indirect contribution to the negotiation process.""In many cases delegates won't have a lot of time to get to side events. Often what's happening there is indirectly conveyed to the negotiating process,"" he said.""Very often you'll hear insights that will inform an issue that's being negotiated or there's the sense of momentum that's imparted by this vast number of side events and stories about climate action.""That sense of momentum can have a positive impact on the negotiating process.""\l"

The specific goal of this meeting is a legally binding agreement of all nations, which will come into force in 2020, with the aim of keeping warming below 2 C.It's critically important for every country to not only ""tick the boxes"", but go beyond obligatory efforts to do the very best they possibly can.This is especially true of wealthy developed nations. While Australia contributes a small proportion of total global emissions, both our per capita emissions and our wealth are among the highest in the world.As usual, Australia punches above its weight in influence; so we have an opportunity to make a positive impact disproportionate to our size by demonstrating a bold commitment to positive action - and polls show the majority of Australians support this.In Port Macquarie, we too have the opportunity to be influential beyond our size!This coming weekend will see climate marches and rallies all over the world, and Port Macquarie will be part of the action.A large turnout for these events will send Australian and world leaders a strong message of support for ambitious action.

The last attempt to cut such a deal, at Copenhagen in 2009, collapsed amid fierce argument about who should do what, between the developed countries, led by the Americans, and the developing nations, led by the Chinese.This time around, some of the auguries are better, not least because last November the Americans and the Chinese announced their own bilateral climate accord, each agreeing to cut their carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to a greater degree than at any point before and to work together to reach agreement. This is vital because these are the two biggest carbon emitters, between them accounting for 45per cent of the global total (China with 29per cent, and the US with 16per cent).If there is a major obstacle remaining, it is the third-biggest emitter, India, currently with 8per cent of the total, and rising. India stresses its prime national objective is economic development to pull its 1.25billion people out of poverty, and, at the moment, that will be powered by burning cheap coal.Whether or not Prime Minister Narendra Modi will agree to have development constrained by a legally binding emissions treaty remains to be seen; it looks very doubtful.However, there is something that may comprehensively alter the mood music of Cop21, and give 2015 another significance for climate change: this may be the year when the pause in the rapid progress of rising temperatures, which began after 1998, may be over.The fact that the soaring world temperatures of the 1980s and 1990s began to flatl"

Visiting Australia last week, former European commissioner for climate action Connie Hedegaard told journalists that the world has noted Australia's lack of ambition on climate change ahead of the United Nations , COP21 or CMP11 to be held in Paris later this year.The Abbott government has set an emissions reduction target of at least 26 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030.While criticised by many as lame, the Prime Minister's hand-picked economic modeller Warwick McKibbin has argued that compared with other countries in terms of economic costs, Australia's target is at the higher end of commitments.Business is emerging as the pace-setter in Australia amid ongoing policy uncertainty, according to chief executive of think-tank and advocacy group Sustainable Business Australia, Andrew Petersen. ""Business has always known that climate change would be a big disrupter,"" Mr Petersen said. ""They see opportunities.""Much of the work is around ""stranded asset risk"" - the quickly diminishing value of assets that are suddenly on the nose, like coal.Some commodity companies and property groups are struggling to convince major shareholders that diversifying away from a singular asset class is good for value creation into the future.Mr Bell said it is not unusual for big investors to pressure businesses to stick to their knitting even though its unwise in the medium to long term.""[Some] investors prefer to adjust their portfolio to manage risk,"" Mr Bell said.

"COP21","Australia","COP21_Australia17","'Writing is on the wall' for fossil fuels: Rockefeller","December 3, 2015 Thursday 08:22 AM GMT","AFR Online","Resources companies are growing increasingly nervous about fossil fuel divestment as the numbers of investors that cut or reduced their exposure to oil, gas and coal surged in the lead up to critical climate talks in Paris, according to the head of one of America's best-known philanthropic foundations. Green investment campaigners HYPERLINK http://350.org350.org and \~ HYPERLINK http://divestinvest.org/Divest-Invest on Wednesday claimed more than 100 institutions representing $US800 billion under management divested at least some of their fossil interests in the 10 weeks ahead of the United Nations in the French capital.Companies such as BHP Billiton believe the divestment campaign led by 350.org is having an impact on the attitudes of professional investors including fund managers and superannuation funds. The Australian Financial Review reported on Tuesday that the coal divestment lobby HYPERLINK http://www.afr.com/business/mining/coal/bhp-and-rio-tinto-are-quietly-exiting-coal-20151202-gldo0ohas stopped campaigning against BHP""I think they [resources companies] are getting a little nervous,"" said Stephen Heintz, president of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. ""The writing is on the wall.""The divestment groups found the number of institutions reducing their exposure numbered 500 with more than $US3.4 trillion in assets under management. This represents a substantial rise on the 181 institutions representing around $US50 billion in assets that had made a similar commitment a year ago.Divest-Invest and 350.org described the numbers as ""another impressive leap for the divestment effort"" but conceded some of the commitments were ""only partial divestments, and the $US3.4 trillion represents the total amount of assets represented by institutions, not the amount of money divested, which is difficult to track due to varying degrees of disclosure"".Charities, churches, universities, government pension funds and municipal governments have shown a far greater willingness to divest fossil fuels than conventional investment firms. However, Europe's largest insurance company, Allianz, divested ???630 million from coal - and announced plans to pour over ???4 billion into wind energy - in the weeks before the UN conference.

"COP21","Australia","COP21_Australia18","COP21: the half-way mark","December 7, 2015 Monday","Business Spectator","The half-way mark in a marathon is always a testy time. So too is the mid-way point of the Paris climate negotiations.The speeches by 150 heads of state on the opening day of the conference were intended to inject some early momentum into the negotiations. Yet as soon as the formal negotiations began, the parties climbed back into their well-worn trenches and progress became painfully slow.The plan, and hope, was that the negotiators would whittle down the hefty draft text of the \' Paris Agreement' into a shorter and relatively cleaner text for the ministers to finalise by the end of the second week.Nonetheless, the hot button issues are plain to see. Those include the temperature target and the long-term goal of the agreement, the review mechanism, transparency and accountability, and above all, the crucial cross-cutting issues of differentiation and climate finance.The most vulnerable parties are desperately fighting for a temperature target of no more than 1.5 degrees. That's resisted by many major economies and especially Saudi Arabia.There's no consensus yet on whether the long-term goal should be decarbonisation (rejected by fossil fuel states), zero global emissions, net zero global emissions, carbon neutrality or a long-term low emissions transformation --\~to name only some of the bracketed options.Nor is it clear whether a specific date or time period for achieving this long-term goal can be agreed. Options include 2050, 2060-80, end of the century, or as soon as possible after mid-century. The review mechanism debate revolve around whether and how the 188 \' intended nationally determined contributions' (INDCs) that have been submitted by the parties for the post-2020 period should be reviewed, and whether subsequent contributions in the ongoing cycles of commitment must represent forward progression or simply just not go backwards. The latter would fail to generate the dynamism to drive a rapid ratcheting-up of ambition to hold warming to below two degrees (let alone 1.5 degrees).The key division in the debate over transparency in mitigation action and support turns on how much flexibility should be accorded to developing and least developed countries. The US and EU want the transparency and accountability rules to apply to all parties while many developing countries reject a one-size-fits-all approach.Cutting across and infusing all of these debates are the crucial issues of differentiation and climate finance.Developing countries have continued to point out that developed countries haven't fulfilled their obligation to lead in mitigation under the 1992 Convention or to provide adequate finance and other support to developing countries, which was promised in the Copenhagen Accord in 2009.In response, many developed countries point out that the world has change since 1992 and the old binary between developed and developing countries, as reflected in the annexes to the 1992 Convention, are now well and truly outdated.As a consequence, the draft language on finance is a sea of brackets and the multiple references to differentiation throughout the text are heavily bracketed.The US and China have made it clear that they are strongly committed to reaching a deal. However, there are 194 other parties that must also consent to this agreement.The problem is that the hyper-flexible approach favoured by the G2 doesn't provide the more climate vulnerable parties with the assurances they need to ensure their continuing existence. Saudi Arabia has also been playing its usual blocking game by rejecting proposals designed to strengthen climate protection.Sorting out these and many other differences will require major compromises. A commitment to scale up climate finance and other support (technology transfer and capacity building) by developed countries (and possibly some major developing countries) will certainly help to unlock many, if not all, of these differences.Without this support, many developed countries won't have the means to pursue a clean energy pathway and adapt to the warming that's already locked in. They also argue that they are entitled to this support given their pressing development needs and the fact that many in this large and diverse bloc are the least responsible for emissions and the least capable of adapting to a dangerously warmer world.The irony is that the lower the ambition and dynamism of the Paris agreement, the greater pressure major donor countries will face to scale up climate finance and other support to vulnerable countries for mitigation, adaptation and, increasingly, unavoidable loss and damage. If they don't pay now, they'll be called upon to pay a great deal more as time goes by.The French President of the conference, Laurent Fabius, has made it clear that he is committed to an orderly process of negotiations that respects the rules of procedure to avoid any derailments of the kind that plagued the Copenhagen negotiations.The negotiations in the second week of COP21 will be conducted in a single setting to ensure transparency for parties and observers, with smaller group negotiations over contentious issues reporting back on a regular basis.The conference President and his diplomatic team will have to draw on all of their skills and political capital, along with a little bit of wizardry, to orchestrate an acceptable text at the end of the week if an agreement is to be adopted by all 196 parties in the closing plenary.Robyn Eckersley\~is professor and chair of the Discipl"

"COP21","Australia","COP21_Australia22","Paris climate conference: Everything you need to know about COP21","November 27, 2015 Friday 4:15 PM AEST","ABC Premium News (Australia)","The United Nations climate meeting in Paris from November 30 is possibly the last chance the world will have to create an international treaty to prevent dangerous climate change.Temperatures are a whole degree above the long-term average and scientists predict more warming unless the world acts to limit fossil fuel use and forest clearing.Climate change has the potential to affect all of humanity as well as countless plants and animals the world over.Here is everything you need to know about the Paris climate talks:Who's meeting?In 1992, a new global treaty was drawn up at a United Nations meeting in Rio de Janeiro to try to address climate change. It became known by the not-very-catchy name of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change or UNFCCC.Since then countries which signed up to the convention (which is almost the whole world) have met regularly. This meeting in Paris is the 21st Conference of the Parties, making it COP21. Much like any 21st, there will be many long, rambling speeches.Why are they meeting in Paris?The location for the COP moves around each year. In 1997 it was in Kyoto, where the famous Kyoto Protocol was written up. In 2009 it was in Copenhagen, a meeting which ended in anti-climax. It was decided two years ago in Warsaw that the 2015 COP21 meeting would be in Paris. Country representatives also have smaller meetings all throughout the year mostly in Bonn, Germany.Next year it will likely be held in Morocco. In 2017 COP23 will be held somewhere in the Asia-Pacific region. We hear Australia's lovely this time of year.What will they be doing? HYPERLINK http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/adp2/eng/8infnot.pdftext has already been drafted and discussed, with points of contention marked in square brackets.Nations will make their cases for which of the square bracket options they think should stay.Countries will also discuss related matters such as forests and funding for poorer countries to deal with climate change.How does it work?The UNFCCC is an umbrella term for a whole family of committees, working groups, and assorted official bodies. In addition to the plenary session of official national delegations working on the treaty text, many of these other bodies will hold meetings at the Paris gathering.All of them are working towards the common goal of limiting greenhouse gas emissions to prevent climate change from getting out of hand. Trying to get 196 countries to agree to anything makes the process slow going.In 1997 the world signed the Kyoto Protocol which asked countries to limit their emissions but only developed countries needed to do any of the heavy lifting. It gained legal force when Russia ratified it in 2005.It's never been a trouble-free treaty. Some countries even walked away from it before it was due to expire in 2012. But in the absence of anything else, it's been extended to 2020. The real work of Paris is to come up with new text ultimately to replace the troubled Kyoto Protocol.Who will be in Paris?Who won't? Global leaders, presidents and prime ministers will lead delegations of diplomats and public servants. They will hash out the details of the new treaty text.Observer groups will be allowed to monitor the talks, staying alert to anything untoward and making helpful suggestions, if asked.In addition, lobby groups will stalk the halls trying to button-hole delegates with persuasive argument. Business people, attracted by the potential opportunities, fly in from all over. Despite their activities being curtailed by heightened terrorism concerns, protesters will find a way to make some colour and noise outside the conference hall. And the media, never one to miss a party, attend in their thousands.Why is this meeting important?Every new piece of climate research has scientists repeating more loudly their call for action to address climate change. As far back as 2006, economist Nicholas Stern pointed out that the sooner human-kind takes steps to deal with our greenhouse gas emissions, the easier and cheaper the steps will be. Meanwhile, our greenhouse gas emissions continue to climb.With the Kyoto Protocol in a holding pattern, the deadl"

But it would be surprising if he stayed away from an event that ranks with the Kyoto Protocol as a signature moment in efforts to prevent the planet warming by more than 2 degrees Celsius, on pre-industrial levels, by the end of this century.With an agreement among participants representing the developed and developing world looking increasingly likely, it would make no sense for the representative of the world's largest per capita emitter to stay away.Insufficient to go beyond minimum obligations HYPERLINK in which he rightly points out that direct action is policy making ""on the cheap"" and will be insufficient to meet Australia's obligations beyond the bare minimum.Whatever Turnbull might say about existing policy to avoid unpleasantness with those on the right waiting to pounce, you can be sure he will edge towards a more comprehensive solution when the time is right.His planned travel schedule represents an extraordinary quota of rushing about, and might invite questions about whether Turnbull is neglecting the home front, but at a time of global turmoil it would be hard to argue against such engagement.Not least of the advantages will be an opportunity for a new prime minister to gauge global economic challenges in conversations with leaders of the industrialised world.In his travels, Turnbull will engage US President Barack Obama, China's Xi Jinping, Merkel, Russian President Vladimir, Japan's Abe, France's Hollande, and Britain's Cameron, among others, over a period of three or four weeks at separate gatherings.This will amount to a process of force-feeding for a new Australian leader that is fortuitous - and unprecedented. Turnbull needs to make the most of these opportunities to reset Australian foreign policy in his own way separate from the heavy duty emphasis of his predecessor on national security.Reading Turnbull's foreign policy speeches during his time as opposition leaders - and in his six years of exile - gives encouragement to the belief he has thought a great deal about Australia's place in the world.As Andrew Carr of The University of Melbourne points out, the new Prime Minister is fond of quoting Thucydides, a general and a chronicler, whose Melian dialogue is a classic description of power relationships.Let's take him at his word.Tony Walker is the AFR's International Editor\l"

I think by 2 degrees many of the Pacific nations will disappear.""Our message to COP21 is look out, we may disappear - please save us.""""You have to see through your own eyes how desperate these people are,' he said.Mr Punja was among a number of delegates talking to 70 Canberra high school students as part of the Young Leaders Climate Conference at Telopea Park School.The panel discussion included representatives from the European Union, the United States, China, France and Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.Aside from listening and asking questions of the panel, the group of teenagers discussed climate change and renewable energy and held their own mock summit, representing some of the major players heading to the Paris negotiations.European Union ambassador to Australia Sem Fabrizi said he was impressed by the students' enthusiasm and their knowledge of the complexities of climate change.""The future belongs to them and I think the students today are very aware of it,"" he said.""There's an inter-generational duty to lead the next generation to a better place. The students have clear understanding that climate change ... isn't something vague, isn't something remote, isn't something that doesn't affect them.""Mr Fabrizi said the European Union had set a ""very ambitious commitment"" to climate action ahead of the Paris summit from November 30 - including reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent between 2020 and 2030 - and hoped other countries would show similar ambition.He said announcements, HYPERLINK http://www.canberratimes.com.au/environment/un-climate-conference/paris-2015-china-adopts-a-drastically-different-stance-on-climate-change-20151103-gkp70f.html?skin=text-onlysuch as France and China's proposal to revisit the progress of any global climate pact every five years, helped create ""the right political climate"" for a successful summit.Asked if Australia was doing enough to tackle climate change, Mr Fabriz said our country was ""very much engaged in Paris, working very closely with us and sharing our own commitment to make Paris a successful outcome"".""It is a collective exercise and we have to ensure the agreement is applicable to all"".While Wednesday's students fell just short of negotiating a 2 per cent target among themselves, Canberra College student Egshiglen Chuluunhuu??? said the event had changed her view of climate change.""It's kind of unnerving because we're going to be living in the world they [world leaders] are making decisions for.

In the next few weeks, he will get the chance to try it out on most major Western leaders.When Malcolm Turnbull sits down with Indonesian President Joko Widodo in the middle of this coming week to ""reset"" Australia's relations with Indonesia after the troubled Tony Abbott period, Australians will begin to get a series of snapshots of a more nuanced - and expansive - foreign policy.We can be fairly sure Turnbull will not be undertaking to ""shirt-front"" Vladimir Putin, or describe Japan as Australia's ""best friend"" in Asia.In the next four weeks an Australian leader will embark on a merry-go-round of international engagements that will take him to Jakarta (Nov 12), Berlin for a meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel (Nov 13-14), Antalya in Turkey for the G20 leaders' summit (Nov 15-16), and back to the region for an APEC summit in Manila (Nov 18-19) and on to the East Asia summit in Kuala Lumpur (Nov 22).Turnbull will come back to Australia briefly before going to Malta for a Commonwealth heads of government meeting (Nov 27-29), and then to Paris on November 30 for the leaders' meeting at the United Nations known as COP21.Turnbull strategists are leaving open the possibility of whether he goes to Paris or not. But it would be surprising if he stayed away from an event that ranks with the Kyoto Protocol as a signature moment in efforts to prevent the planet warming by more than 2 degrees Celsius, on pre-industrial levels, by the end of this century.With an agreement among participants representing the developed and developing world looking increasingly likely, it would make no sense for the representative of the world's largest per capita emitter to stay away.Readers might reference a useful commentary this past week by my colleague Alan Mitchell - Turnbull must tread carefully on climate change policy transition - in which he rightly points out that direct action is policy making ""on the cheap"" and will be insufficient to meet Australia's obligations beyond the bare minimum.Whatever Turnbull might say about existing policy to avoid unpleasantness with those on the right who are waiting to pounce, you can be sure he will edge towards a more comprehensive solution when the time is right.Not least of the advantages will be an opportunity for a new prime minister to gauge global economic challenges in conversations with leaders of the industrialised world.In his travels Turnbull will engage America's Barack Obama, China's Xi Jinping, Germany's Merkel, Russia's Putin, Japan's Abe, France's Hollande, and Britain's Cameron, among others, over a period of three or four weeks at separate gatherings.This will amount to a process of force-feeding for a new Australian leader that is fortuitous - and unprecedented.Turnbull needs to make the most of these opportunities to reset Australian foreign policy in his own way separate from the heavy duty emphasis of his predecessor on national security.Reading Turnbull's foreign policy speeches during his time as opposition leaders - and in his six years of exile - gives encouragement to the belief he has thought a great deal about Australia's place in the world.As Andrew Carr of The University of Melbourne points out, the new Prime Minister is fond of quoting Thucydides, a general and a chronicler, whose Melian dialogue is a classic description of power relationships.Let's take him at his word.\l"

Climate Institute deputy chief executive Erwin Jackson said the process in the lead-up to Paris had put pressure on countries including Australia to pledge emissions reduction targets.""(The conference) won't fix everything but the best possible agreement will be one that very clearly sets the world on a path to... avoiding global warming of two degrees,"" he said.""We do not expect, under any of the possible outcomes, that the world will do a U-turn on clean energy investment trends.""However, the agreement must ensure accountability while being bankable and fair, he said.Australia has pledged to slash carbon emissions by 26 to 28 per cent on 2005 levels by 2030, a goal the institute believes is weak and places the nation at the back of the developed pack.The collective pledges are expected to limit global warming to 2.7 degrees, higher than the ultimate goal keeping warming below two degrees.However, leaders insist the Paris summit is the start of the process.\l"

But Alan Finkel, an engineer, neuroscientist, businessman and inventor, has joined Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to reject calls for a moratorium on new coal mines. Dr Finkel, the chancellor at Monash University, said Australia was at a critical stage when science and technological innovation could deliver prosperity and productivity. My vision is for a country, society, a world where we don\' t use any coal, oil (or) natural gas because we have zero emissions electricity in huge abundance and we use that for transport, for heating and all the things we ordinarily use electricity, he said.However, to replace transport fuels, gas for heating and coal for electricity would require a five-fold increase in power generation. It\' s not unreasonable to look at all viable alternatives, Dr Finkel said. Nuclear energy is a zero emissions energy but it comes with issues.  It\' s something that should be absolutely considered for a low emissions or a zero emissions future, if that is what we are looking for. Another possible way forward with better storage could be solar and wind power. About 60 eminent Australians have signed a letter asking world leaders to support a moratorium on new coal mines and put coal exports on the agenda at the United Nations in Paris.Mr Turnbull said a moratorium would make no difference to global emissions because the coal would be sourced elsewhere.  Arguably it would increase them because our coal, by and large, is cleaner than the coal in many other countries, he said.He said it was not a sensible policy economically, for jobs or to combat global emissions.

So the next 24 hours is even more important because there are options, and we can have a really good agreement or we could have a less good agreement.I hope we will understand.

It's a first generation biofuel,"" he said.""What we are seeing globally though is a move in terms of science and technology being able to go past ethanol into more advanced fuels, [such as] butanol.""So what you see is, once you build the infrastructure and you get the knowledge on how to develop these renewable fuels, it opens a pathway into much more valuable fuels, chemicals and materials."" The Queensland Government is putting in place legislation that will mandate a level of 2 per cent ethanol in all fuel sold at the bowser.The policy is designed to grow the state's ethanol sector, which is small but considered by many to hold great potential.Prof Bressler said putting a mandate, or some other government regulation, in place could be a good idea, but the most important consideration was to ensure the policy was secure for the long term.Bioenergy comes in several forms, as Prof Bressler explained to the audience in Mackay.He said Australia had competitive advantages if it chose to spawn new bioenergy ventures.""What you guys [in Australia] have at your disposal, is very cheap feed stock at very large volumes, which is very important,"" he said.""You have a high-tech culture, you've got the infrastructure and the support in the universities to be able to support this.""And thirdly, you have port infrastructure all through, so you can move to global markets of very large scale quite easily.""So, you are in a perfect position to take advantage of what is happening in the carbon economy, especially with what's happening in Paris in December [at the United Nations ], and the move towards carbon strategies globally on how we reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.""\l"

When first conceived, the project included more than 150 wind turbines. The Department of Planning forwarded the revised Assessment Report, on February 1, 2016, to the NSW Planning Assessment Commission for its determination. The Commission gave its approval on March 30. This marks the end of the Epuron project's journey through the planning assessment process.Epuron describes the Coppabella hills as having £n excellent wind resource and nearby grid connection. This wind farm has the potential to be a key contributor to the energy supply of NSW and will assist significantly in the reduction of the State's emissions.''Epuron looks forward to the Yass Valley Wind Farm progressing to construction as swiftly as possible to capture the full benefits such projects can bring to regional communities,' the company said in a statement on Thursday.'We again thank the community, particularly the involved landowners and local business and community leaders, for their ongoing support and patience, which has been rewarded by this approval.'This approval for the 79 wind turbines of the Coppabella precinct will deliver clean renewable electricity and significant greenhouse gas reductions, although the reduction in number of turbines from 124 reduces the available benefits of the full wind farm by approximately 36 per cent. The greenhouse gas reductions available from the project will help Australia meet its commitments made at the November 2015 United Nations held in Paris.'Should the windfarm proceed to construction and production, the local community would benefit via a community fund to the tune of $2,500 per wind turbine, or up to $197,000 per annum if all turbines are built.'Emissions in NSW from stationary energy will continue to be significant while its electricity generation is over 80 per cent fuelled by coal. It's time to deliver on the NSW Renewable Energy Action Plan. NSW must start to proactively capture the important jobs and investment from large scale wind energy projects which to date have mainly been secured by other States,' Mr Poole said. \l"

"COP21","Australia","COP21_Australia110","Symbols of climate concern; opinion OUR SAY","July 14, 2015 Tuesday","Newcastle Herald (Australia)","POLITICS might be ""the art of the possible"", but the value of compromise is sometimes overshadowed by a need to make big symbolic statements.In terms of compromise, the proposed T4 coal loader has been inching its way, literally for years, towards a conclusion of the planning process.Proponents and opponents alike have had a number of opportunities, in various forums, to put their cases, and the arguments in all directions have been extremely well ventilated.Given all that has happened so far, it will surprise few if the Planning Assessment Commission comes down in favour of the project.Veteran environmental activist John Sutton described this week's final round of consultation as ""window dressing"", but it's an opportunity to present a point of view that dozens and dozens of the coal loader's critics have been keen to take advantage of.And that's at least partly because the T4 loader has effectively become much more than just a single industrial project. It's a symbol - and an appropriate one at that - of the reality that is the coal industry in the 21st century: an industry that usually gets its own way, but in a world where more and more people are questioning the cost of fossil fuels.Such questions will only intensify in the months leading up to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris from November 30.Australia's pro-coal stance is well-known internationally, and successive federal governments have justified continued support for the coal industry on the grounds of national interest.Under Labor, the continued growth of the coal industry was balanced by at least the semblance of an interest in promoting renewable energy.Various government agencies, including the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, were mandated to work with the private sector on building Australia's expertise in clean power.Given coal's dominance of the national power grid, most people would describe all forms of renewable energy as ""emerging"".And given the global tide of opinion forming against coal, it would surely seem in Australia's best interests to ensure it did not have all of its energy eggs in the one unwanted basket.If the Clean Energy Finance Corporation had a long track record of failure, or if its investment portfolio was manifestly unbalanced, then Prime Minister Tony Abbott might win more support for a move that Opposition Leader Bill Shorten has aptly described as ""strange"".By associating this week's move with an earlier failure to win Senate support to abolish the corporation, Mr Abbott has reached for the symbolic big stick.From this viewpoint, it appears to be the wrong weapon, on the wrong target.\l"
"COP21","Australia","COP21_Australia111","Trading our way to prosperity","June 18, 2015 Thursday","Newcastle Herald (Australia)","THE signing in Canberra on Wednesday of a free trade agreement between Australia and China puts the seal on a document that was agreed to in November, after extensive negotiations that began in 2005.As a list prepared by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade makes clear, the agreement with China is only one of 18 such bilateral or multilateral agreements that Australia has signed, or is in the process of negotiating with other countries.Together, these documents help define Australia's rights and obligations in a world where international trade is increasingly free of the systems of tariffs, quotas and other restrictive barriers that were built up in earlier times. Given what is at stake for any sovereign state signing such important documents, there will always be debate about individual aspects of a particular agreement.When the China deal was struck late last year, the Australian dairy industry described the increased access to Chinese markets as a ""game changer"". Sugar, wheat, cotton and rice growers, however, were left disappointed.An annexe to the main document shows China will have up to 15 years to phase out some of its import duties, whereas Australia is obliged to phase its out within five years.Still, the agreement should be viewed in its totality - and in relation to other trade deals - before the full picture can be drawn.Even so, it's the fear or perception of disproportionate benefit, as well as a loss of sovereign power, that is at the heart of much public disquiet over these types of international agreements.While Australia is signing its pact with China, the United States is in the midst of a major political debate over a multilateral agreement known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which involves 12 nations, as things stand, including the US, Australia, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia and New Zealand.Attention is also turning to the United Nations climate change conference in Paris in December, which has implications for Australian coal.In each of these negotiations, Australian politicians, diplomats and bureaucrats are empowered to broker deals that may have losers as well as winners. Job security, especially in sectors facing competition from imports, is always a concern in trade deals. But Australia was built on international trade, which, by definition, is a two-way street. Negotiated strongly, such agreements help us prosper, and meet our international obligations.\l"

"COP21","Australia","COP21_Australia114","Preparing for COP21 in Paris","November 20, 2015 Friday","ABC Transcripts (Australia) Science Show 4:19 PM AEST","Robyn Williams: Way back when the world first tried to negotiate changes to emissions of greenhouse gases, they went to Kyoto. Our representative there was environment Minister Robert Hill. Here, putting aside concerns about terrorists, he reflects on what could happen in Paris.Robyn Williams: One thing that puzzles me, Robert Hill, is how you go to a COP conference, say in Paris coming up, with 40,000 people milling around, how can you do that and make effective policy changes that stick?Robert Hill: Well, it is true that there is now a lot of theatre associated with the COPs, thinking Kyoto '97 we had about 8,000, and then Copenhagen 2009 was probably about 25,000, and by 2015 we were up to 40,000. So of course most of the 40,000 don't ever get into the inner circle, but their presence indicates a broad public interest in the issues. It's a good thing in the sense that people feel that they want to participate, and they get to participate in a lot of the side events which tend to be relating to the sort of programs that need to be implemented to actually bring about change. So some will be focusing on reforestation, some on soil carbon, some on the built environment, and so it goes on.Robyn Williams: So it's not simply a milling around, in other words a gigantic junket, as some newspapers suggest?Robert Hill: Well, most of the 40,000 would have paid for themselves and they are going there because they feel that they are making a contribution and they want to contribute to better outcomes. So no, I don't see it as a junket.Robyn Williams: This time they've done something slightly different with the timing itself so that you've got many of the leaders arriving early rather than at the last minute so that there is a kind of extended drama; will there be a decision or will there not? So do you think that's a good move?Robert Hill: This time it's entirely different because the design is not to lead to an outcome on targets. The targets are now voluntary targets and leaders will come on the first day and confirm the target that they are prepared to accept, and then they'll leave, whereas Copenhagen they came on the last day and couldn't reach agreement and the whole thing fell apart. Well, France wasn't going to fall into the same mistake. So the targets will be known from the beginning, and then the rest of the conference, as far as it is an agreement between nation states, will be looking at issues such as whether it can be enforceable, transfers of technology, and particularly finance for the developing world to adopt green technologies.Robyn Williams: How did you find Kyoto yourself when you turned up as an Environment Minister representing Australia?Robert Hill: Well, Kyoto was much more serious I guess in terms of national interest because there was to be determined for you a target which was going to be legally binding, and you knew that target would have economic consequences. So it only applied to the industrialised countries. There was an overall saving in carbon determined and then it was a question as to what each of the industrialised countries would accept to achieve that target. So you didn't quite know what would be the outcome until the last moment when the targets were read out by the chairman and the gavel was brought down before anyone had a chance to stand up and object. But of course it doesn't quite work like that because we had all pre-negotiated our targets. But still, there was an element of uncertainty and tension in the air and it was quite dramatic.Robyn Williams: Well, legend has it that you, like a poker player, held out until the last moment and did this wonderful deal for Australia. Are you implying that wasn't quite the case?Robert Hill: Well, I've never quite expressed it like that, but what we had determined is what we could afford, taking into account that carbon abatement costs in Australia were very high and we had built our economy on cheap coal and large transport costs and also a strong agricultural bias, so the costs of abatement were comparatively very high. But we had determined a target that we believe we could meet and we stuck with that target, and the COP agreed to our figure. And the best thing about it was that Australia actually achieved its target within the time frame. So we are one of the few countries in the world that has actually achieved a target that has been set for us at a COP.Robyn Williams: Well, it was suggested that we actually got away with quite a lot in the sense that the concessions that you got for clearing of land were terribly generous.Robert Hill: Well, no, not in those terms. What we also negotiated was the language, and we negotiated a clause which came to be known as the Australia Clause which dealt with the issue of land clearing. Land clearing in Australia is different to the rest of the world. The Europeans can't get their head around Australian scrub, and therefore didn't want to agree to stopping clearing of scrub being allowed.But the facts were that land clearing in Australia was contributing significantly to Australia's greenhouse emissions. In many ways our emissions' profile was closer to that of a developing country than a developed country. And when we finally convinced them of that, we got the Australia Clause we needed, we got our target, which was +8 at that point, and so it ended.But people said that +8 was high. Well, on the face of it you'd say it's higher than others, but the concept was that we would all equally share the burden. So that was the challenge, to try and work out what was a fair distribution of the burden among the industrialised countries.Robyn Williams: Given the time that's elapsed since Kyoto and some of the dire predictions from some quarters, some of the scientists about climate change, what do you think must come out of Paris this time?Robert Hill: Well, in an ideal world I would like an outcome whereby the international community...and we have got to the stage now where we are looking for an agreement between all nation states, not just the industrialised world. That has become essential because the big developing countries are now very major emitters. I'd like the aggregate of the bids of the nation states to amount to something that would keep climate change under the two-degree figure. I don't think we are going to achieve that but it's going to be a much better outcome than we've had in the past. And I think attitudes are changing, I think the mindset of the nation states is changing. They are taking the issue more seriously.There's a lot more opportunities now through energy efficiency, new technologies, the development of renewable energy and the like to find alternative ways to produce energy. So it's taking a long time. Kyoto was 1997, Paris COP is 2015, and unfortunately the climate situation continues to worsen. But I think that the outcome of Paris, from my perspective anyway, will be that actually nation states have decided that they do need to address this issue seriously and they do need to get to figures that will lead to that reduction to under the two-degree figure. So I don't think that will all be achieved at Paris but I think we will be on the path to achieving that goal.Robyn Williams: The process itself, is it a friendly one or is it clenched teeth? Robert Hill: No, it's very serious, particularly if you are small developing country that, in the worst instances, actually sees yourself going out of existence through rising sea level, and it's not surprising that there is a lot of passion and that they'll point the finger at those who have created the problem in the first instance and at the same time grown wealthy from it. So there is that tension in this debate and we should understand and respect that. But in the end we are all in it together and we have to find a solution as a global community. And I would like to think we are closer now to finding that solution than we have been in the past.Robyn Williams: Let's hope he is right. Robert Hill was Prime Minister John Howard's Environment Minister, and then our ambassador at the United Nations.\l"

"COP21","Australia","COP21_Australia116","New carbon target will hit economy","August 12, 2015 Wednesday","The West Australian (Perth)","Tony Abbott has admitted Australia\'e2\€  s post-2020 emissions cuts will be a drag on the economy amid criticism from experts they will still fail to limit temperature rises to less than 2C. The Prime Minister announced yesterday Australia would commit to reduce its carbon emissions 26 to 28 per cent on year 2005 levels by 2030. The target, to go to a crucial United Nations climate change conference in Paris this year, puts Australia in the middle of the pack. But it is well short of the recommendation of the Government\'e2\€  s independent adviser, the Climate Change Authority, for a 40 to 60 per cent cut by 2030 on 2000 levels for Australia to do its fair share.Business reaction was mixed. The Australian Industry Group said delivering the target with existing policies would cost up to $250 billion in unadjusted terms. The Minerals Council of Australia said the target was credible and appropriate but would strain the economy.Climate Institute chief executive John Connor said the target was weak and if other countries took the same approach, the world would warm a dangerous 3C to 4C.Mr Abbott said the target led the world because it halved Australia\'e2\€  s per capita emissions.The centrepiece of the Government\'e2\€  s direct action policy, the Emissions Reduction Fund, would be responsible for more than one-third of the target by continuing to pay polluters to cut emissions.\'e2\€  It\'e2\€  s a good, solid economically responsible, environmentally responsible target,\'e2\€ Mr Abbott said.In a marked change, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said letting industry buy cheap overseas carbon credits was an option, though it would be possible to meet the target without them.Though the PM lambasted Labor for its carbon tax as a threat to jobs and the economy, he conceded the Government\'e2\€  s target was not painless.It would reduce gross domestic product 0.2 to 0.3 per cent by 2030 \'e2\€  the equivalent of $3 billion to $4 billion today.Mr Abbott said extending the ERF would cost taxpayers only an extra $200 million a year and the policy did not depend on the coal industry\'e2\€  s demise to get deep reductions. Ms Bishop confirmed she would lead the team in Paris, though Mr Abbott said he would go if a substantial number of world leaders attended.Carbon market analyst RepuTex said Australian emissions were projected to grow 12 per cent over the next decade because of deforestation and growth in coal and gas exports. Strong action would be needed to curb that, let alone reduce emissions, executive directer Hugh Grossman said.\l"

Mr Miles said that jump had already had ""a very substantial impact"" on the world's reefs, including the Great Barrier Reef, and was in danger of becoming worse. ""It looks like we will be getting a sneak peak over Christmas, early next year, unfortunately, of what climate change will do to the Great Barrier Reef,"" he said.""Scientists are predicting a high likelihood of the worst ever coral bleaching, because basically, El Nino is super-charging ocean temperatures.""It is a real worry, but it is also what we will see more of as temperatures continue to rise - 90 per cent of the extra heat goes into the oceans, and if the species can't adapt, they won't survive.""Coral bleaching occurs when the relationship between coral and zooxanthellae, a tiny marine algae that lives inside its tissue and gives coral most of its colour, breaks down, revealing the coral's white skeleton. Most coral relies on the algae for food and begins to starve without it. While the coral can recover if conditions return to normal - bringing the zooxanthellae back - the stress usually causes decreased growth and reproduction, and makes the coral more susceptible to disease.Scientists have been HYPERLINK http://www.smh.com.au/environment/more-than-a-third-of-worlds-coral-reef-face-major-bleaching-event-20151008-gk49ns.htmlwarning since OctoberIt's only the third of its kind in recorded history and some predictions show more than 12,000 square kilometres of reef worldwide was at risk.

Global warming is already causing changes to climate that have serious and costly negative impacts over the next two decades.They will become even worse over time unless warming is restricted.Research recently completed in Townsville via a pilot study funded by the Queensland Government through the Local Government Association of Queensland is meant to better inform councils of the level and cost of the adaptation they already face.Townsville has the prospect of 4200 homes being flooded and a bill for $1.7 billion just to protect its inner city, work that must be done by 2027.Climate change mapping for the Sunshine Coast indicates the extent of our vulnerability and asks the obvious question of why we keep adding to it through poor short-sighted planning decisions. Those who profit from that short-sightedness won't be the ones to pay its costs. That responsibility will fall to the next generation, our kids and grandkids, the ones who some in this community would sacrifice the environment for, to provide them with jobs and to ensure they lived next door.Stupidity and ignorance have never in the history of this planet succeeded over knowledge and science, though they have repeatedly caused both to be ignored, at great cost. More than 140 countries are gathering in Paris seeking consensus on targets to address a shared threat.It will require a global response and certainly one greater than our Government's commitment to reduce greenhouse emissions by 2030 by between 26% and 28% on 2005 levels.That's a Tony Abbott commitment that belongs with him - in the past.Labor's 45% reduction may be considered ""brave"" by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, but it also falls well short of the zero emission target already proven possible by research from groups like Beyond Zero Emissions.The world is in transition. Our choice is to profit from being ahead of the curve or to lag behind it. What is certain is a failure to act in any meaningful way will make ludicrous any pretensions the Sunshine Coast may be the healthiest place on Earth by 2030 or a model for sustainability.Both worthy ambitions have no hope while all three levels of government remain transfixed by ""growth"" and jobs the next real estate development deal will bring.French president Francois Hollande told the opening session of the Paris talks that ""what is at stake is the future of the planet, of life"".He is right.So too is Mohamed Adow, climate advisor for UK-based Christian Aid, who warns developing countries will suffer significantly even if warming is contained to a 1.5 degree increase.It's more than time to dismiss ignorance and stupidity in favour of a future our children can live in.\l"

The state Economic Development Board has held business meetings in Adelaide and Melbourne in a bid to discover the opportunities posed by low-carbon nuclear energy, should SA proceed.""The challenge is to try and put some credible numbers around those opportunities,"" Rear Admiral Scarce said.""There's a range of views within business. Some believe such a large capital-intensive project is beyond Australia's capabilities. Others believe it's a wonderful opportunity to reinvigorate the business environment because of that potential for clean energy at a reasonable cost."" At current rates, Australia will not meet the goal of zero emissions from electricity generation by 2050.Rear Admiral Scarce said the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris from November 29 might again change the landscape.Australia will be represented at the conference, which runs until December 11, at various stages by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop and Environment Minister Greg Hunt. Rear Admiral Scarce said he was encouraged by the renewed national debate on nuclear issues, triggered by Mr Turnbull's appointment last month of Dr Alan Finkel as Australia's next chief scientist.Dr Finkel, whose advice Rear Admiral Scarce will seek, has declared nuclear energy should be considered as part of a low-emissions future.""We've said all along that this can't be a South Australian decision,"" Rear Admiral Scarce said. ""It's a debate that's critical to the industry.""Whatever way it goes, South Australia cannot manage this activity by itself. If we did go ahead, that bipartisan environment would be essential, both local and federal."" The Royal Commission this week will start public sessions examining low- and high-level nuclear waste dumps.Federal Resources Minister Josh Frydenberg on Friday released a shortlist of six sites earmarked for a National Radioactive Waste Management Facility, three of which were in South Australia.Rear Admiral Scarce said the federal tender process was completely separate from the Commission's work and it was not involved in the process.

I'm glad to note that you did get down to the alternative peaceful gathering at the Chinese Gardens during the day, too.At the 'Fill this space with Respect' community gathering, families and genuine Bendigonians of all ages and walks of life enjoyed a free barbecue, music, colourful children's activities, great conviviality, informed conversation and an enlightened, bravely self-deprecating speaker in 'Go Back To Where You Came From' participant, Andrew Jackson.I was proud to be part of a gathering at which there was no slogan chanting and no one screaming obscenities over a loudspeaker. There was no belligerent hate-based patriotism, no flag-wearing disgraced and no disgraceful City of Greater Bendigo councillor.There were no extremist flag-festooned 'patriots' or mask-wearing 'socialists' from who-knows-where furthering their own dubious agendas at Bendigo's reputational expense. There was no police presence, no flag-burning, no capsicum spray, no violence and, somewhat unsurprisingly, very little media attention.Despite our smaller numbers, I remain convinced that we represent the majority of Bendigo residents who are diverse, inclusive and respectful.I would like to reply to a recent letter by saying that I am very thankful that I had religious education both at school and Sunday school as a child. I am now old (91-years-of-age) and the religious education that I had as a child has given me something very precious to remember both in strength of mind and always doing what is right to myself and other people.I am very much in favour of religious education in schools.

The powerful conservative wing is leading the charge to prevent a free vote, while moderates are still working - publicly and privately - to make it happen.On the conservative side, standard-bearers Eric Abetz and Cory Bernardi have been the most vocal. The leaders of the moderate insurrection are Warren Entsch and Teresa Gambaro, who will co-sponsor this month's bill. Malcolm Turnbull, Josh Frydenberg, Kelly O'Dwyer, Ewen Jones and Wyatt Roy have all publicly declared support for the reform and called for a free vote.In July, the gay marriage lobby estimated that 15 Liberals supported the reform, 25 were undecided or undeclared and 62 opposed it. With any parliamentary vote on the bill set to be close, these numbers will be the difference between success and failure.ThespeakershipThe backbench has chosen to flex its muscles when it comes to Bronwyn Bishop's successor in the chair. As soon as Mrs Bishop was out and the candidates were emerging, Liberals were demanding the Prime Minister back off and not subject them to another ""captain's pick"".Mrs Bishop's elevation to the speakership was itself one of Mr Abbott's earliest captain's picks. Other unilateral decisions that have attracted the ire of both the public and Coalition MPs include the reintroduction of knighthoods and the subsequent decision to bestow one on Prince Philip, the paid parental leave scheme, citizenship changes and banning ministers from appearing on the ABC's Q&A program.On Tuesday, even the Prime Minister mocked this history and said he understood why people would ""scoff away"" what could be a ""kiss of death"" for a candidate for Speaker.After the handling of the expenses scandals in the past three weeks, Mr Abbott's authority is weakened. When it comes to the new Speaker, if the Prime Minister is seen to be too interfering, it will anger many inside the party.CarbonemissionsThe government's post-2020 climate change policy is expected to be presented to cabinet and then the party room this week.Environment Minister Greg Hunt has said these targets will be ""serious and credible"" and more ambitious than the 2020 target (5 per cent reduction on greenhouse gas emissions). He and the government are under significant public, political and international pressure to deliver on this promise.However, with scepticism rife, there will be party room opposition to tough targets, with some MPs not accepting the scientific consensus on the matter and concerned about economic impacts.The independent Climate Change Authority, a body the government attempted to abolish, has recommended that Australia push for a 30 per cent reduction by 2025 and 40 to 60 per cent by 2030. The United States announced emissions reduction targets of 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2025 and 80 per cent by 2050.

They are driving the way in which investors need to think about the impact of climate change [on their portfolios],"" Mercer global business leader responsible investment Helen Birgden said.That number of policy responses could dramatically increase towards the end of the year, with the United Nations Climate Change Conference set to negotiate a new climate agreement for the first time in two decades in Paris in December.The report estimated the potential impact of increases of 2, 3 and 4 degrees above pre-industrial global temperatures on returns for portfolios, asset classes and industry sectors between 2015 and 2050.The biggest differentiation was at industry level, and of the biggest losers, it found the average annual returns from the coal sub-sector could fall 18 to 74 per cent during the next 35 years. Conversely, renewables would deliver an increase in returns of 6 to 54 per cent.""At a superficial level, it might seem like a no-brainer but we've done the rigorous work, under the influence of these risk factors, coal, electrical utilities and so on are being impacted,"" she said.The most pronounced effects on the coal sub-sector would be during the next decade, the report says.""Coal is most impacted by policy. It has a very negative exposure to policy, whereas gas has a lesser exposure to policy change and technology, because it is going to be a transition fuel to the lower-carbon economy,""Ms Birgden said investors should heed the warning to ""look under the bonnet"" and look at the drivers, such as policy and economic conditions, that were changing at the sector level, as Australian portfolios were internationally exposed.""It requires investors to be really engaged with their investment manager, to help them understand and make sure they're on top of these risks, they can get a measure of their exposure to their issues and take a carbon footprint of their portfolios.""But it's not all bad news. The report also found that a 2-degree increase scenario did not have negative return implications for long-term diversified investors up to 2050 and even beyond.At 2 degrees higher, return benefits were found for emerging-market equities, infrastructure, real estate, time and agriculture.

The timing of the intervention will be a headache for Mr Hunt who has over recent months moved the government towards accepting tougher emissions targets, as revealed by Fairfax Media on Tuesday.A Liberal moderate who will attend the federal council meeting said the group of elected Liberals and members behind the motion should be given an audience with the Pope so they can be ""brought up to speed by a new age person living in this century"".The party's regional and rural committee, chaired by WA farmer Brian Mayfield, has submitted the motion, which will call for a House of Representatives committee to ""examine the scientific evidence that underpins the man-made global warming theory"".It also calls for investigation into ""the reasons for the failure of computer models, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and prominent individuals to predict, among other things, the pause in global warming this century"".""In light of the uncertainty around this issue, Australia does not sign any binding agreement at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris later this year,"" it says.Mr Mayfield decl"

"COP21","Australia","COP21_Australia140","Paris deal a first step on long road; FINANCIAL REVIEW","December 14, 2015 Monday","Australian Financial Review","The United Nations climate change conference that concluded in Paris on the weekend marks a welcome contrast from the debacle of the 2009 Copenhagen summit in that the 195 countries involved could agree on a broad framework for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. That is a massive relief, given the need for the world's nations to collectively guard against potentially catastrophic global warming.The Copenhagen failure proved to be a fatal setback for the Rudd government, which did not anticipate the hostile position of the Chinese government six years ago. With China being more co-operative, the Turnbull government has emerged with credit from Paris. Australia successively pushed for regular reviews of voluntary targets, with the final agreement requiring ""stocktaking"" meetings that would require all countries to report on their progress within a common reporting system.While that amounts to a big first step towards a global effort to limit emissions, it replaces the one-size-fits-all approach that delivered the Copenhagen debacle. In its place, individual countries will be permitted to nominate their own targets, so-called ""nationally determined contributions"". And only some sections of the final agreement are legally binding. The all-important emissions targets remain voluntary, to avoid the deal being classified as an international treaty which would then have to be ratified by the US Senate.This means that much still depends on the naming and shaming power of the treaty and just how far individual countries are prepared to go, particularly when times are tough. Australia can claim some credit for its target, settled on when Tony Abbott was prime minister: to cut emissions by 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. While these have been criticised, Malcolm Turnbull and Environment Minister Greg Hunt can claim that, in per capita terms, this pledge is second in terms of ambition only to Brazil among G20 nations.Whether the many pledges made at the Paris meeting, assuming they are adhered to, are enough to keep the earth warming to two degrees above pre-industrial levels (one degree from now) or the more aspirational 1.5 degrees remains to be seen. Although this newspaper has always said that scientific advice should be heeded in this area, if only as a precaution against worst-case scenarios, climate science is not exact enough to precisely link carbon dioxide concentrations with specific atmospheric temperatures.After bungling climate change policy so badly under both the Rudd and Gillard governments, Labor would be wise to pull back from its calls for Australia to commit to even deeper cuts to carbon emissions. Similarly, Mr Turnbull should work on reducing the costs of Australia's haphazard jumble of climate change policies before getting out ahead of the rest of the world again. As we report elsewhere today, the mandated growth of renewable energy, for instance, is injecting considerable volatility and cost into Australia's electricity networks.The lesson of the past decade or more of climate change politics is that Australian governments need to identify that global frameworks struggle to recognise the particular structure of the Australian economy, as an efficient producer and exporter of fossil fuels. Global emissions may actually have fallen slightly this year due to a slowdown in economic growth, in China, which accounts for 28 per cent of global emissions. Yet China also has 100 gigawatts of coal-fired generation capacity under construction or approved and intends to curtail emissions through a range of measures such as coal-washing plants, retrofitting coal-fired power plants and coal chemical operations and by controlling residential use. With hundreds of millions of people yet to be connected electricity, India inevitably will increase its coal-fired generation, including with Australian coal. Australia should seek to aid such noble economic development while minimising the overall risk to humankind.\l"

In September, BHP became one of the first big resources companies to publish the results of ""stress testing"" its portfolio of mines and energy projects against the UN's goal of capping global temperature rises at 2 degrees - a target that is likely to result in global cut in greenhouse pollution and a higher carbon price.""Australia has a carbon intensive economy which is exposed to the regulatory, physical and market risks of climate change. Investors who are managing financial risk for the long term, need to be managing for climate change. Regulators need to have good visibility of the system-wide implications,"" said Emma Herd, chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change. ""Good carbon risk disclosure is the foundation of good risk management.""Investors are putting greater pressure on companies to report their exposure to climate change with fossil-fuel divestment campaigns by green finance activists continuing and moves by some regulators such as the New York State Attorney-General to sue companies for not disclosing all risks related to global warming.Mr Carney has done more than most to make climate change a mainstream issue. In a London speech in September, the Canadian-born regulator warned investors and insurance companies with interests in resources companies could face ""potentially huge"" losses if tougher government action on carbon emissions meant that reserves of coal, oil and gas became uneconomic or ""stranded assets"".Mr Bloomberg, who has made a $US40 billion ($54.5 billion) fortune from his financial data and media company, has a long history of advocating for environmental issues. He is the UN's Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change.The taskforce will consider the physical, liability and transition risks associated with climate change and what constitutes effective financial disclosures in this area. It will seek to develop a set of recommendations for consistent, comparable, reliable, clear and efficient climate-related disclosures.The taskforce plans to complete its work by end of 2016 when it will make a series of recommendations.

But in the French capital, however, three events will make it singularly different. First, Parisians will still be living in the shadow of death caused by the massacres of two weeks ago, second, 40,000 representatives from almost 200 nations - including the heads of 139 of them - will be in the city for climate talks. Among them will be the Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Third, this year is the hottest on record, says the World Meteorological Organisation.The United NationsClimate Change ConferenceThe Paris talks have a better chance than other summits in that they have an overarching different framework.The United Nations lives by acronyms and one of the most important for these talks is INDC. It stands for Intended Nationally Determined Contributions. Each country is taking one to Paris. Australia's aim is a 26 to 28 per cent cut below 2005 levels by 2030. Environment Minister Greg Hunt has indicated that Australia will use Paris to state that it has reached its 2020 target of a 5 per cent cut below the emission levels of 2000.While Australia is, per capita, the worst polluter in the world, by other measures, we are small fry. This is not to suggest that we should not tackle the threat or consign it to mere symbolic action. It is too important, the most important thing confronting the state of the planet. The domino effect of climate change is profound and, without wanting to appear obvious, global. It does not discriminate, is not selective. Its consequences, of course, manifest themselves according to region. Melting ice caps, disappearing glaciers, rising sea levels, droughts and storms. Some experts believe that the 2 degree limit is not enough, and too late to put a substantial brake on the process. Even if the Paris agreements were met, it still wouldn't be enough. The WMO says average surface temperatures this year probably would reach 1 degree above the pre-industrial period. The past five years has been the hottest five-year period in recorded history, and the 10 hottest have all been after 1998.A report in The Washington Post last week makes this graphic point: ""The last time the planet experienced so much melting was at the end of the last Ice Age, about 12,000 years ago, when volcanoes and a changing ocean discharged huge quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere."" It quotes Jeremy Shakun, an ecoscience academic: ""We've already raised CO2 by more than it increased at the end of the Ice Age. And we're on track to go up much higher.""Indeed, according to a recent report in The Economist, coal supplies 41 per cent of global electricity. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is two-fifths greater than at the start of the Industrial Revolution.How to combat this, indeed how to reverse this, requires more than a patchwork quilt of solutions that changes colour within each country according to the political leaders of the day. More than any time in the past 100 years, it requires radicalism of thought and deed. The system does not need pulling down. It needs rebuilding. It needs to adapt to the changes it itself created.\l"

It will also feature fish and turtle specimens borrowed from the Australian Museum and Paris's Museum national d'Histoire naturelle, where it will be displayed.Laurence hopes to tug on viewers' heartstrings by displaying small corals on beds transfused with colour that suggest babies in a hospital. ""I'm really aiming to bring a much more empathetic, emotional side into the work for people to be drawn into it on an intimate level.""Other coral specimens in what Laurence calls her ""hospital for the reef"" will be wrapped in bags that she says resemble morgue bags.Laurence's site-specific work will also be displayed during Paris' International Contemporary Art Fair in October and then at the Australian Museum in 2016.Laurence is one of 30 artists from 23 countries selected to exhibit work in Paris during the climate change talks. Other artists showing work inspired by climate change include Olafur Eliasson, Pedro Reyes and Song Dong.The world's biggest coral reef system, the Great Barrier Reef has occupied minds at the UN in recent times, with the World Heritage Committee deciding in July not to declare the reef ""in danger"". However, the committee said it would monitor the state of the reef over the next four years.The Australian Museum's artist-in-residence, Laurence spent six days at the institution's Lizard Island research station on the northern Great Barrier Reef in July, working with scientist Mandy Reid to take underwater photographs and set up what Laurence calls ""underwater homeopathic treatments for bleached coral"".The main focus of Laurence's artwork is coral bleaching. But she says: ""it's also on the acid waters, the crown of thorns starfish, the fact that shells are getting less robust, thinner, you know, the fragility of so much life there due to the polluted and warming waters"". Laurence says the reef also bears the scars of recent cyclones, which are thought to be intensifying as a result of climate change.The museum's chief executive Kim McKay says climate change is a ""scientific fact"".People were entitled to their opinion, but policy should be guided by expert opinion, she says.

The report comes just days before representatives from 130 countries, including heads of state, are due to sign up to the COP21 Paris Agreement at the United Nations headquarters in New York on Friday.Cambridge Econometrics is funded by the European Climate Foundation, whose own backers include activist shareholder the Children's Investment Fund, a major shareholder in Australian wind power player Infigen Energy.But under COP21The findings compare with an analysis by the International Energy Agency in its World Energy Outlook late last year, which found that in a scenario where the world acted to limit global warming to 2 degrees, global demand for oil in 2030 would be about 86 million barrels a day rather than 104 million.For Australia, the study calculates that spending on oil due to lower demand would save $6.4 billion a year. If actions were taken on a global scale that pushed down global crude prices as calculated, Australia would save a further $2.9 billion a year.\l"

None would go on the record admitting that, however.But a new paper out this week in Nature Geoscience is not so shy.""No scientific assessment has clearly justified or defended the two degree target as a safe level of warming,"" write the authors.Lead author Reto Knutti is a Swiss professor of climate science.""We can quantify the risks of 1.5 degrees or two or three degrees but we can never use science alone to justify any target. It's always a question of what values we have,"" he said.""We need to decide as a society how much risk we're willing to take.""Ultimately the two degree target is a political consensus that takes into account what policy makers at that time considered to be both realistically achieve and tolerable. It is high time for a scientific assessment.""It's a compromise of the best we can hope for and the worse we can tolerate.""The accepted history of the 2C target is that William Nordhaus, a Yale economist, came up with the number in one of the earliest papers on climate change an its economic implications.In 1975 he wrote: ""If there were global temperatures more than 2C or 3C above the current average temperature, this would take the climate outside of the range of observations which have been made over the last several hundred thousand years.""He graphed a rough sketch of historical temperatures and added a label at 2C: ""Estimated maximum experienced over last 100,000 years.""Climate science has honed those estimates in the past 40 years. We now know that temperatures have dropped dramatically over 100,000 years - as low as -20 - but in that time they have never been as high as they are now. And they certainly have not surpassed two degrees.But before scientists had ironed out such details, the 2C target was already making it into official documents. Europe was largely responsible for its ultimate inclusion in the United Nations agreement that came out of Copenhagen in 2009.Enshrined as an official target, it became a signpost beyond which ""dangerous climate change"" apparently lay.Degrees of differenceThere is only half a degree between the two targets. Given that humans live in places that experience temperatures as low as -60C and as high as 50C, it seems ludicrous to spend so much energy haggling over half a degree.However Will Steffan, a member of the Australian Climate Council, said ""those temperatures that we scientists use are not to be confused with daily temperature ranges that people experience"".Even though they are both measuring temperatures, he said they are better thought of as a measurement for what the whole climate system is doing.""A five degree world doesn't just mean it's going to be five degrees warmer in Canberra or Sydney or Darwin or wherever,"" he said.""It means is a world that will likely have little or no polar ice. Large areas will be uninhabitable for humans.""The last ice-age was only five degrees cooler in global average temperatures and yet a lot of north American and northern Europe were under a couple of kilometres of ice.""As scientists have improved our understanding of climate change, there's been a growing realisation that two degrees is likely to be quite dangerous after all.""At two degrees we'd have several metres of sea level rise,"" Professor Steffan said.""Several small island states would not exist.""He said extreme weather such as heatwaves, bushfires, heavy rainfall, and drought would be more common at 2C.""Coral reefs would almost certainly not be around at 2 degrees. They'd be struggling at 1.5,"" he said.Most worrying for Professor Steffan is there is a chance the world would pass certain tipping points that would spell planetary disaster, such as masses of greenhouse gases escaping from melting Siberian tundra pushing climate change beyond anything humans can control.The rise of 1.5Howard Bamsey, a veteran negotiator for Australia at the UN climate conferences, said a 1.5C target has always been on the table. When 2C became official in 2009, there was provision for revisiting 1.5C in 2015. The imprimatur from such a senior climate figure gave the lower target the legs it needed to carry on through several years of lack-lustre negotiations.Meanwhile continuing science repeatedly found that at 2C, climate change would be more dangerous than might be acceptable.Mr Bamsey said 1.5C's rise to prominence this year is a result of a long-term push from the nations most vulnerable to climate change: the island nations.At the beginning at this year's negotiations US president Barak Obama posed for a photo with leaders of some of the least powerful and most vulnerable island nations.The photo was a strong symbol that the US was willing to side with the tiny nations and their long-held dream of a 1.5 target.Australia signed on to the 1.5 target when it cut a deal with St Lucia, a Caribbean island nation, to back the target in exchange for being allowed to carry over its savings from the Kyoto Protocol.

It will generate a large number of new jobs for those people currently employed in areas that will gradually be reduced or replaced in the transition, as well as providing job opportunities for our young people.While it may sound quite ambitious, a well-planned process can be formulated and successfully implemented. Not only will there be more jobs for Australians, there will be more goods and services to export, and better health for all Australians as we remove so much pollution from our atmosphere.Here in Tasmania, it could particularly be a great boon to Hydro Tasmania which is currently in the doldrums, having suffered as a result of the axing of the carbon levy by the Abbott government, as it would encourage investment in renewable energy.Toni McLean Lymington Unite for children THE 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen was universally accepted to be a dismal failure.Next week, the world leaders again gather - this time in Paris - to consider the problems of a changing climate. Drastic decisions need to be made at this UN conference, but whose voice will be heard? The voice of the multinationals or that of the ordinary people.Given the Pope Francis encyclical, Laudate Si, on - care for our common home - and statements forthcoming from the recent World Council of Churches gathering on the same theme, I am amazed and disappointed that little has been heard from the various Tasmanian church leaders in support of their global leadership.In the case of the Catholic Church, there appears to be too much attention to lesser issues and a focus on tradition and dogma rather than reading the signs of the times and being supportive of Francis. How often have we heard from the churches on the right to life issue - isn't this about protecting the life of the unborn! It's time to become vocal!I have grandchildren. What sort of planet will they experience? This weekend rallies will be held in the major cities around the globe voicing the need for the world leadership to accept the realities of human-caused climate change and its consequences and to take realistic measures to reverse the proven trends. The Hobart rally on the Parliament lawns is next Sunday, November 29, at 1pm.Given the statements out of the Vatican and the World Council of Churches, I would expect the Tasmanian church leaders to be there and be well supported by their various flocks, whom they will have encouraged to attend.Not only did they support coal in 1981, but also campaigned against growing trees and using wood. According to latest greenhouse gas figures, sustainable logging in our native forests and growing plantations has removed over 33 per cent of our emissions since the Kyoto base year to address climate change.It is a pity the greens don't do a backflip and rather than be divisive and vilify forest communities, they promote the timber workers and their families as climate heroes.Alan Duggan Cradoc Taxing argument A READER suggests we give incentives to companies to reduce their carbon footprint by granting tax reductions proportionate to the percentage reduction of carbon.

The PM's office is huge and Malcolm has 48 hours to move office and he only has 15 people at the moment.""He has to be running the nation within 48 hours and he doesn't need to name all those tiny (cabinet or parliamentary secretary) positions.""After the ballot, Mr Laming said he congratulated Mr Abbott ""for being a great prime minister"".The backbencher said he spoke with Mr Turnbull ""a number of times"" on Monday as the events unfolded in the corridors of Parliament House but was not a main player in the ousting of Mr Abbott.ALP v LNP: ""In politics there is only one poll that matters but there are a whole lot of polls in between that represent the Australian people trying to give government a message.""ECONOMY: ""We will be focussing on the new economy as opposed to the old economy and attracting new foreign capital chasing bit projects in finance and technology.""TURNBULL v ABBOTT: ""The real difference between Malcolm and Tony is there will be a subtle shift from the old economy to the new economy and Turnbull will be a little more creative around where the new jobs are.""SAME-SEX MARRIAGE: ""It is really only a matter of timing on the proposed plebiscite and I think we're heading in the right direction.

"COP21","Australia","COP21_Australia156","Turnbull's biggest test: climate policy change","September 19, 2015 Saturday","The Age (Melbourne, Australia)","Malcolm Turnbull's powers of persuasion propelled him into the prime ministership. Despite having been previously dumped as Liberal Party leader, he convinced his colleagues, many of whom still dislike him intensely, to repudiate Tony Abbott only two years after he led them to government in a resounding victory. Mr Turnbull's capacity, it is widely held, is the result of high intelligence buttressed by instinct for parry and thrust. The new Prime Minister ought to bring the full force of his advocacy to adjusting the way our nation seeks to meet its economic, environmental and moral responsibility to properly participate in the international effort to reduce the threat of anthropogenic climate change.On this front, Mr Turnbull's debut has been disappointing; he has backed the inadequate muddle Mr Abbott, a man who once dismissed the science on human-induced climate change as ""crap"", has been trying to pass off as a credible policy. Paying billions of taxpayers' dollars to the biggest polluters to pollute less, and planting some trees, while failing to create incentives to sufficiently invest in renewable energy technology, is a costly and inefficient melange unlikely to achieve what are, anyway, unduly low emission-reduction targets. The current policy does not even come close to meeting the tenets of good public policy.Mr Turnbull this week has repeatedly referred to the intelligence of the population; indeed it was central to his withering public pitch for the top job. We urge him, then, to start the process of shifting climate change policy from something most people know is sub-standard to the market-based mechanism experts the world over know is the best way to cut carbon emissions.The science is beyond reasonable doubt. Even Mr Abbott finally admitted that. So, the question is how best to limit global warming. The answer is to have a market mechanism to reflect the costs of pollution and benefits of abatement. As well as stating this week that he would explain policies and convince people of the need for change, Mr Turnbull rightly extolled the virtues of markets. The uncharacteristically limp argument he has thus far given for sticking with Mr Abbott's climate policy is that it is the goal that is important, not the means. We hope that once he has settled into his role he will start to skilfully distance himself from this policy by setting out the compelling arguments for change. After all, it is no secret that he believes a cap-and-trade market mechanism is the optimal approach. That was the policy then-prime minister John Howard took to the 2007 election. That was the policy Mr Turnbull himself championed as opposition leader. That is the policy so many business leaders support. And that is the policy Mr Turnbull should take to the United Nations in Paris later this year. We would also urge him to argue for bigger reduction targets than those his predecessor was planning for the Australian government to present in Paris.The urgent need to mitigate global warming is mankind's biggest challenge. It is Mr Turnbull's most important challenge; he must make our nation - one of the highest polluters per capita - an exemplar in averting a potentially existential catastrophe. Mr Turnbull's ascension was not merely a function of his ability to argue; all of his colleagues want to hold their parliamentary seats and many were spooked and even panicked by persistently poor results in the opinion polls. They voted for self-interest. For the same reason, if for nothing else, they should join us in urging their new leader to alter the government's current policy on reducing carbon emissions towards the market-based mechanism so many voters have been wanting for so long. With power comes duty. Should Mr Turnbull fail to advocate for a change he knows is right, history will condemn him.\l"

There were a lot of bleary eyes at the conference centre today after negotiators worked through the night. Parties first met as a cohort to give ""indaba"" responses to the draft released yesterday, and then split up to smaller groups to hash out the areas that will need more work to find consensus.""Indaba"" refers to a process where each member at the table gets to speak and be heard. The inclusive process has a Zulu name that\~first appeared in the 2011 Durban meeting. That meeting provided the key breakthrough that recognised that all countries, including China and India, would offer broad climate action commitments. The Kyoto model, where only developed countries make emission reduction commitments, formed the basis pf a major argument used by some against the UN process and climate action more generally.Among the usual lamentations about the exhausting negotiation process, there were also murmurs of agreement that yesterday's text was an improvement. But not everyone saw their priorities in there yet.As Thursday has now drawn to a close with a text that is mostly clear of square brackets (which highlight disagreements or alternative options). It suggests broad agreement on a range of issues but the following remain clearly contested:how to build a common system of transparency for country actions;how to address unmanageable climate change impacts in vulnerable nations; andhow to financially support poor nations participate in climate change solutions.This is a strong, carefully balanced text. It includes the formal review and updating of targets every five years starting, in 2019. This would be done against the reference to limiting global warming below 1.5-2oC by the end of the century and achieving net zero emissions or 'emissions neutrality (the science on this suggests all greenhouse gases would need to be at net zero by 2050 to have a chance at 1.5\'b0C and between 2060 and 2070 for 2\'b0C. CO2 emissions from energy and industry, which last longer in the atmosphere, would need to be at zero earlier than other gases). Finance contributions would be scaled up to the poorest and this would be tracked through time.There are a number of challenges in here for Australia, which will need to recognise that its pollution reduction targets are more aligned to 3 to 4 degree warming and would leave us with the petro state of Saudi Arabia as the highest per capital polluters in 2030.However, this text is not the final agreement. With a desire to present a penultimate version in the morning and make history by closing the meeting on time, with a final agreement Friday evening Paris time, the French president of the COP has called for ""solutions indabas"".The journey to where we are now in Paris has been a long and difficult one; ministers could still tumble at the final hurdle.\l"

He previously attended the 2009 COP talks in Copenhagen.""Paris will be an absolutely crucial milestone in the long overdue international effort to keep to a 2 degree world,"" Prince Charles told the meeting on Thursday, referring to the climate change ""speed limit"" set by scientists.The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that an average temperature rise of 2 degrees by 2100 would come with increased risk of sea level rise and extreme weather events, but beyond 4 degrees the effects quickly become much more dangerous.The prince said a ""4 degree"" rise would be ""impossible, I think, to adapt to"".COP21The UN's climate chief, Christiana Figueres, said earlier this week that a global carbon price would not be set at the Paris summit - but the world would move towards one in the future.Around 60 jurisdictions including the European Union already have a carbon trading scheme or tax, and multinationals including big oil companies have called for a global carbon price to spur investment in low-carbon energy.The prince has previously indicated his support for economic strategies to tackle climate change.In 2012 the Prince of Wales' Corporate Leaders Group released a ""Carbon Price Communique"", making the case for setting a price on carbon emissions.And at a speech in July this year for the University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership (CISL), he said ""we will absolutely need a different kind of economy"" to avoid dangerous climate change.The day before he will meet with new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in Canberra.However it is not clear whether the prince will take the opportunity to urge Mr Turnbull to make a u-turn on the carbon tax.A Clarence House spokesperson said ""we wouldn't go into what might be raised in private meetings"".Mr Turnbull has said the government will review its climate change policies in 2017, but has avoided signalling any return to an emissions trading scheme.\l"

People will suffer. Economies will suffer. Entire nations will find themselves under severe, severe problems; more drought, more floods, rising sea levels, greater migration, more refugees, more scarcity, more conflict.WILL OCKENDEN: The other, a global agreement to cut emissions.BARACK OBAMA: The other path is to embrace the human ingenuity that can do something about it. The time to heed the critics and the cynics and the deniers is past. The time to plead ignorance is surely past.Those who want to ignore the science, they are increasingly alone; they're on their own shrinking island.WILL OCKENDEN: President Obama's comments were addressed at the opening of the GLACIER conference in Anchorage, Alaska.GLACIER stands for Global Leadership in the Arctic: Cooperation, Innovation, Engagement and Resilience.The comments come ahead of a key meeting, the United Nations , which is scheduled to be held in Paris in DecemberHis speech is being seen as a way of building international support, so countries can reach an agreement to cap emissions and therefore a maximum global temperature rise of two degrees Celsius.Barack Obama says 2015 must be the year an agreement is reached, and attacked politicians who deny the science of climate change.BARACK OBAMA: Any so-called leader who does not take this issue seriously or treats it like a joke is not fit to lead. On this issue of all issues there's such a thing as being too late.WILL OCKENDEN: As the world's largest economy, and its second biggest emitter, the United States is key to any world agreement and any meaningly action to cut global emissions.President Barack Obama has recently annoyed his political opponents in Congress by introducing standards to reduce CO2 emissions from power plants.He admits that the US is a big part of the problem, but says he believes the country can solve it.BARACK OBAMA: America will reach the emission target that I set six years ago. We're going to reduce our carbon emissions in the range of 17 per cent below 2005 levels by 2020. And that's why last year I set a new target, America's gonna reduce our emissions 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 10 years from now.

Already the world is seeing changes, with the World Meteorological Organisation saying temperatures have now risen 1 degree Celsius since the industrial revolution, and 2015 is set to be the hottest on record.Paris will not be about trying to impose a ""top-down"" legally binding target on all countries to force them to reduce greenhouse emissions, as was attempted in Copenhagen, widely seen as chaotic. The conference will instead determine a process for regularly reviewing the carbon reduction targets each country has already nominated for the years after 2020.In 2013, nations agreed to submit their voluntary 2030 targets, and so far most, including the major emitters, have submitted theirs - covering about 94 per cent of global emissions.The countries will then look at determining a way of assessing progress towards meeting these pledges.There are also expectations of a statement about decarbonising the economy, and agreement on the amount of ""climate finance"", or loss and damage costs, to poor countries who suffer the most from global warming.COP21, short for the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

Mr Cameron lost a previous vote, but turned around opinion on strikes in Syria by asking MPs if they wanted to take on Islamic State in its Syrian heartlands or ""do we wait for them to attack us?"".MPs decided they wouldn't wait and nor did Mr Turnbull's predecessor Mr Abbott when he joined with America in sending in Australian aircraft to bomb Islamic State targets in Syria.Another opinion on bombing targets in Syria was offered yesterday by former chief of the Australian Army and now director of the National Security Institute at the University of Canberra, Peter Leahy.The former general says air strikes will help win the battle but ""the heart of this problem is an ideology and you can't bomb an ideology out of existence"".That is why it is important to increase pressure on terrorists following the attacks in Paris and in other countries, including Australia.Mr Turnbull may soon find himself saying that he has received a call from the White House and he has changed his mind.Putting combat troops on the ground in some capacity in Iraq and Syria would seem inevitable.There is an accompanying terrorist danger on home soil that needs the help of the Muslim community if it is to be defeated.Eighteen-year-old Abdul Numan Haider was shot and killed after stabbing two police officers in Melbourne and 15-year-old Farhad Khalil Mohammad Jabar was shot dead after killing a police accountant in Parramatta in NSW.There has been a dramatic increase in the number of young men coming to the attention of Victoria Police, many of them teenagers.Mr Turnbull has returned from the United Nations in Paris to find a number of government MPs are calling on the Muslim community to do more to prevent attacks at home.Liberal MPs are concerned that Islamic extremism is spreading and that the Muslim community has a responsibility to prevent radicalisation among Muslim youth.Reclaiming their religion from extremists who promote a corrupted concept of Islam is pivotal in preventing growing numbers of Muslim youths from being recruited to terrorism.The broad majority of the Muslim community deplore terrorism and are best placed to win the trust of vulnerable members of their community who may be attracted to it.All Australians must confront terrorism and its supporters, which makes a failure to take appropriate action against an Islamic extremist in the New South Wales courts all the more farcical.Milad bin Ahmad-Shah al-Ahmadzai has repeatedly refused to stand in the dock when the judge enters the court during his trial for attempted murder.Al-Ahmadzai, who is already in jail for having threatened to cut the throat of an ASIO officer, says he is ""not at the behest of any authority other than Islam"".In his most recent appearance, al-Ahmadzai was brought into court after Judge Gregory Farmer, SC, was seated, supposedly to avoid any question of contempt.

I think that what you are doing is you're going to be forcing electricity prices up, obviously because you will be forcing more renewables onto the market, because we don't, for instance, have nuclear power as an option to reduce those electricity-generated emissions.BRENDAN TREMBATH: Dr Jensen was disappointed that the Government's target was given to reporters before the backbench.But another Coalition MP Andrew Laming was more positive about the Government's plan.In an interview with ABC News 24, he called the cuts ""responsible"".ANDREW LAMING: You know, they trim two thirds of a billion dollars off your economy each year at 2030 results in slightly slower economic growth, but I think we all have to chip a little bit of that together. And then remember, when you get there to Paris, we all negotiate anyway, so this is simply what you're taking to the table.BRENDAN TREMBATH: The ABC understands the Cabinet agreed on a cut of between 26 per cent and 28 per cent depending on the economic impact.The base date is 2005. The Opposition climate change spokesman Mark Butler told Radio National that a 26 per cent target would put Australia at the back of the pack.MARK BUTLER: Countries to which we often compare ourselves, like the US and the United Kingdom, Germany - countries like that - all have targets in an equivalent time-frame into the 40 per cent range; so 41 per cent for America, 48 per cent for the UK.BRENDAN TREMBATH: The Australian Greens party accuses the Federal Government of manipulating the numbers, by picking a base year of 2005 when emissions were higher.Greens MP Adam Bandt:The Government must not fudge the numbers; the Government must use the same basel"

Speaking on the eve of the United Nations ""COP21"" climate talks which will see more than 150 world leaders converge on the French capital, Mr Turnbull indicated that any credible attempt to curb global warming would require a unified commitment from national governments to cut greenhouse emissions but also the mobilisation of the private sector to develop green technologies.Mr Turnbull, who was speaking at the HYPERLINK http://www.afr.com/news/world/turnbull-meets-the-queen-as-commonwealth-chooses-first-woman-secretary-general-20151127-gla9nxCommonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Malta on Saturday, said he hoped COP21 would result in a ""a strong durable agreement"" that ""puts all countries on a common platform and allows them to periodically update their targets that sets us on the right path"".However, the Coalition leader also linked the arguments Australia will be making in Paris over the two-week conference to the innovation agenda he unveiled while rolling Tony Abbott for the prime ministership in September.

""The solutions to the climate change challenge lie very much in the field of technology and innovations, which is a very key part of my government's priorities.""Mr Turnbull had been critical of his party's climate change strategy under Mr Abbott but has not changed policies, including the taxpayer-funded Direct Action carbon abatement scheme, carbon reduction targets of 26-28 per cent by 2030 and a contribution of $1 billion over five years to the UN's Green Climate Fund set up to help developing countries adapt to climate change.

Drought, flash-flooding, stronger storms, poor water quality and intense heat waves are all events that can have devastating effects locally, and are direct outcomes of climate change.Throughout the series of negotiations at the summit - Australia maintains a 2030 emissions reductions target of 28 per cent.This is comparable to many other developed countries, but in any case, targets are one thing - a roadmap to get there is another entirely.Without doubt however, one of the key policy instruments to help achieve this target is the federal government's Renewable Energy Target (RET), which has a target of 33,000 gigawatt hours of renewable energy output by 2020.The share of renewable energy in NSW's electricity mix has almost doubled over the past 5 years, supporting over 13,000 jobs.However, more work is needed towards mitigating the 115 million tonnes of CO2 pollution emitted by NSW annually (Australian Bureau of Statistics 5220.0).A key issue has been who should adopt responsibility for taking action?Obviously mitigating climate change is a benefit accrued to everyone.NSW's inland cities have always been the backbone of the state through farming, crops, vineyards and a diverse range of agriculture, and now as a society we look towards the people and resources of the Central West as the cornerstone of a cleaner, more sustainable future.The Central West has an abundant and diverse renewable energy resource including solar PV in Manildra, wind in Bodangora, and Hydro at the Burrendong Dam.These projects offer a simple solution for reducing our reliance on fossil fuel and high pollutant electricity generation, and at the same time offer employment opportunities, tourism and better infrastructure.The agreements that will come out of the Paris Climate Summit mean that in order to reach our emissions target the Central West will play an integral role.This enables an incredible opportunity for Central NSW to maintain its lead in embracing renewable energy, and benefit from the increased jobs and investment in the region.Henry BlumentalsInfigen Energy\l"

The desire for short-term (next 30 years)energy security has re-invigorated investment in fossil fuel technologies andled to a North American boom in fracking, as well as protests by environmentalcampiagners against the technique.In an academic opinion piece for Environmental Science & Technology,co-authored with Professor Michael Depledge from the European Centre forEnvironment and Human Health, Dr Staddon states that addressing climate changeand meeting the world's energy needs are two of the greatest challenges thatsocieties face, and that the search for inexpensive and plentiful energysupplies appears to be at odds with climate change mitigation commitments.Evidence suggests that recent climate change arises primarily from humanactivities that release greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide, andmethane, into the atmosphere.""Lowering greenhouse emissions requires reduced dependence on fossil fuels,rendering...the search for new sources of oil and gas particularly perverse,""writes Dr Staddon in the piece.""Expanding fossil fuel extraction capabilities sends the message that rapidclimate change mitigation is neither urgent nor essential.""The opinion piece highlights that the carbon footprint of shale gas carbon isvery similar to that of coal when compared over 100 years and that evidencecontradicts the view that shale gas is a ""clean"" or ""environmentally friendly""energy source.""The dangers posed by ""greenwashing"" shale gas as a route to climate changemitigation, are well documented. It is unimaginable that oil and coal reserveswill be left in the ground, therefore shale gas represents an additional sourceof greenhouse gas emissions,"" writes Dr Staddon.Dr Staddon, whose research looks at the response of ecosystems to environmentalchange, especially climate change, added: ""Government ministers are meeting atCOP21 to discuss worldwide limits to greenhouse emissions, yet fracking forshale gas will extend the fossil fuel age, increase the costs of mitigation anddrive up the cost of adaptation required to support human societies in a lesshospitable climate. The negative financial impacts on economies and to humanhealth will be externalised and borne by those often poorer societies mostaffected by climate change.""Source: Xi£n Jiaotong-Liverpool University\l"

""This is the first major policy change we've seen following the Paris agreement,"" said Ben Collins, a climate campaigner at the Rainforest Action Network advocacy group in San Francisco.""It's a step away from financing coal, which we see as the dirtiest and most carbon-intensive fuel,"" he said, adding it would be better if banks immediately halted all support for coal mines and power plants.Shareholders want companies such as ExxonMobil and Chevron to stress test their business plans against the Paris accord's goal to reduce carbon pollution and limit global temperature rises. Other companies such as Marathon Oil and Anadarko are being asked to disclose ""stranded asset risks"", or the potential that fossil fuel reserves will become unusable.""These resolutions are a powerful signal that the world is shifting to a clean energy, low-carbon global economy, and that fossil fuel companies need to be ready,"" said Mindy Lubber, president of the non-profit group Ceres, which helped co-ordinate the filings.

"COP21","Australia","COP21_Australia193","Man who shook up the world","October 31, 2015 Saturday","The Australian","Over time, David Pocock hopes to change the world. For the moment, however, he is focusing on changing the rugby dimension of it.Certainly the game will never be played quite the same way after his performance at the World Cup. Nathan Sharpe, the former Australia captain, believes that No 8 play has been forever revolutionised after Pocock was moved into that position. Traditionally, it has been reserved for the biggest, most destructive player in the pack but Pocock has exposed a previously unglimpsed range of new possibilities.Previously, as an openside flanker, he would attempt to make the tackle then immediately jump to his feet and work towards gaining a turnover. Now, he leaves the tackling to Michael Hooper or Scott Fardy or others. His role is to go for the kill, to rip the ball from the enemy or at least force him to hang on so desperately he concedes a penalty.In this he has been so successful, he has moulded the World Cup to his will and been the player most responsible for the Wallabies advancing to the final. Now comes the ultimate test, the All Blacks, who have already lost one Test in large part because of him, in Sydney in August, and are intent on stopping him from taking another.When the All Blacks run out at Twickenham tomorrow morning for the Rugby World Cup final, Pocock is the man they will fear most. He gave advance notice of his impending greatness in 2011 when he virtually single-handedly beat the Springboks in the quarter-finals of the last World Cup, defying their massive behemoths with more turnovers than a French pastry chef. But then it all was put on hold as two knee reconstructions each cost him a season. Only this year he returned to football and it would have to be said it is quickly catching up with him.He is bruised and battered already, with two panda-like shiners, a gashed eye and a broken nose but no doubt by kick-off, he will look back on that as the good old days, when he still had his looks. More than any other Australian, he is the man who stands between the All Blacks and victory and they are coming for him. Good thing he has a few distractions.Pocock admits he would be trying to save the planet even if he wasn't a rugby player. The fact that he is, the fact that he may have become the best rugby player in the world, opens up a whole new level of political activism. Fame has its price and restrictions, but one of the benefits is that now when he speaks, people listen.""It's something I'd be doing if I wasn't a rugby player,"" he says of his activism. ""I feel that climate change is an issue that needs to be taken seriously in Australia and historically, it hasn't been. It's been a political football. There hasn't been bipartisan support for a way to actually lead on it. As a citizen, that's really frustrating."" He was given a stern talking to by the Australian Rugby Union when he chained himself to mining equipment in NSW as part of a protest against new coalmines but, while he apologised, at no point did he pledge not to take a political stand again.He made a stand on gay bullying, though, to be fair, when he approached the referee about a Waratahs player calling one of the Brumbies ""a faggot"", he has no idea he was going live into every living room courtesy of ref cam. Still, it pulled the player up and he subsequently apologised and even trained with the gay rugby team. Yes, he also paid a $20,000 fine but you sensed the whole incident was one of poor habit rather than in-built sexual discrimination.Pocock and his partner Emma have vowed not to get married until gay marriage is legalised in Australia but you wonder whether, with all the battering he is taking, that will hold good if he suddenly starts snoring. No, only kidding. They're good.Even at the World Cup, he has been busy, signing an open letter urging world leaders to agree on a moratorium on coalmining at the in Paris in December.Yet he also does a lot of his speaking one-on-one. And with Wallabies coach Michael Cheika admitting the Wallabies cover the political spectrum from extreme left - which you assume means Pocock - to centre right, there would seem to be fertile ground there for him to plough.""Yes, we definitely talk,"" he said. ""You get 30 guys together and we definitely talk. And guys are pretty open to talking about current affairs."" Nor does he feel he has a monopoly on the truth. ""You've always got to be open to learning. If someone has a better opinion \'e2\€ \£6 but there's no one running around with an agenda trying to get -people to change their minds and it's just casual conversation."" He would like nothing more than to see his hero, wildlife documentary maker and activist David Attenborough at the World Cup final. Even a rugby champion has people he looks up to.You suspect, however, that he is going to be disappointed. Instead, it will be Richie McCaw, Kieran Read and Jerome Kaino bearing down on him like he's all that stands between them and the World Cup.Which in many ways he is.Mark Ella P44\l"

New Wind noticed some French hostility to the giant wind turbines of wind farms, but says that people who have despised the giant turbines and never thought they'd warm to wind power are charmed by the wind trees.They have gone into production and, for the moment, they are really rather expensive. A prototype is erected in the Place de la Concorde in Paris to beguile those potentates and boffins who will be in Paris for the looming (November 30 to December 11) United Nations .This futuristic column pricked up its ears at discussion (on the BBC's World Business Report on ABC Radio National at dawn on Wednesday) of the wind trees. We have been much engaged in the debate about the big wind turbines (like the ones at Lake George), taking issue with the philistines (like Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey) who see no beauty in them and in the way in which they sometimes enhance a landscape.But up to a point the French trees seem to be a response to French versions of Abbotts and Hockeys, to complaints about conventional wind turbines' size, noise and landscape-transforming looks. With enough of the little trees in neighbourhoods there may in time be no need for giant wind farms as we have known them, their massive forms arranged all along windswept hills.New Wind was started by Jerome Michaud-Lariviere.

The ""synthesis report"" brings together individual country reports on their emissions policy, the so-called ""intended nationally determined contributions"" (INDC) provided by 155 countries covering 88% of the world population.The UNFCCC is presenting the final figures in a straight fashion, but wrapping them in something of a bow, with UNFCCC executive secretary Christiana Figueres calling them a ""determined down-payment on a new era of climate ambition"", which appears to be a double-distancing from a statement of actual achievement.In fact, the synthesis report projects, on the INDC figures, a rise in temperature of 2.7 degrees by 2100, way above the 2-degrees limit that has been set as the de facto boundary between major damage, and the start on the road to catastrophe.

We should let our energy choices be governed by the ultimate end outcomes we desire rather than a simplistic, knee-jerk moralistic judgement that a particular fuel source is evil or good. Yet from a pragmatic perspective, having countries sign onto such a moratorium would act as a very useful buttress to what countries are already promising they will do.Turnbull observed: ""Coal is a very important part, a very large part, the\~largest single part in fact,\~of the global energy mix and likely to remain that way for a very long time, so that's not my forecast but the International Energy Agency's forecasts.""He also noted that there are a lot of other countries with lots of coal, so if Australia were to completely stop its exports of coal then there are other potential sources of supply.These points were reasonably accurate but kind of missed the point of what those pushing a moratorium on coal were specifically putting forward.While it is indeed true that coal currently makes up a very large proportion of the global energy mix, findings from an International Energy Agency analysis of every nations' Paris conference emission reduction pledges suggests the world's leaders have effectively promised that they won't require the coal from new coal mines (except for India).

"COP21","Australia","COP21_Australia201","It's time to lead a vision for a cleaner economy","December 4, 2015 Friday","Sydney Morning Herald (Australia)","I represent the youth who face a climate-changed future. I haven't lived a year of my life that hasn't been above average temperatures in Australia. I have also grown up in a 25-year trend of economic growth; Australia was until recently number one on the human development index, top of the global living standards. These phenomena seem like dichotomies - but in fact they are directly connected.Next week, Australia will sign on to a new global climate agreement at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's 21st conference of the parties (COP21) in Paris. After two years of policy uncertainty choking a growing renewables market, now is the moment for Australia to ignite an economy-wide vision of a renewable powered Australia.There is a momentous shift taking place in Paris towards global co-operation - 85 per cent of the global economy has put forward commitments to cut carbon emissions. China and the US agreed to curb emissions and work together to do so. India launched an International Solar Alliance with more than 120 countries. European states have drastically increased their climate finance contributions.The real question is whether these actions are sufficient to achieve the 2 degree global warming limit by 2100 crucially needed to minimise climate impacts.The Australian government has an obligation and a responsibility to abandon its climate stagnancy, set a political vision and build enduring policies that create a cleaner, brighter future for us all - human, plant and animal systems. This begins with committing to a meaningful emissions reduction target at home and supporting a robust framework to drive increasing ambition and accountability in a new international agreement at Paris. At the Paris meeting, developing nations will fight for resources and finance to roll out renewables but Australia and economic superpowers should lead by example.The target of 26-28 per cent reduction on 2005 levels by 2030 is weak and continuation of business as usual, putting the planet on track to 3-4 degree warming by the end of the century. Despite our renewable capacity, this puts us on par with Saudi Arabia as the worst polluters in the G20.Australia's climate finance pledge of $1 billion is insufficient to meet the needs of the most vulnerable countries; many are our nearest Pacific neighbours and have come to Paris to shed light on the devastating climate impacts they face. This money is not new and will be redirected from the existing, already depleted, foreign aid budget. Though an increase from a woeful $200 million, it is not our fair share as the wealthiest country in our region.As Australia attempts to look forward with the National Adaptation and Resilience Strategy announced this week, we remain bound to fossil fuels and the taxpayer subsidies that keep the industry afloat. Wind and solar are now cost competitive to deploy and iron ore prices have dropped below $US40/tonne. The refusal by Australia to sign the communique to phase out fossil fuel subsidies suggests the government is more committed to vested fossil fuel interests than the future of our young people and the planet.So Paris becomes an opportunity. We must encourage governments to seize this leadership role, not stay hiding, clutching to a fossil fuel past. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change calls for collective action. The hundreds of thousands around the world who took to the streets for the People's Climate March last weekend demonstrated that each government and citizen is a part of that collective - we have responsibility for our actions and a responsibility to act; for youth and future generations.Jacquel"

"COP21","Australia","COP21_Australia203","... but there's good reason to be optimistic","December 18, 2015 Friday","Hobart Mercury (Australia)","In Paris for the recent climate talks, Alice McGushin is full of hope for futureThe international agreement on climate change does more than improving the world's health - it helps ours.Climate change is the biggest global health threat of the 21st century. The direct health impacts from global warming include disease, injury and death from weather events such as heatwaves, floods, storms and bushfires. Changes to our environment brought on by increasing greenhouse gas emissions will multiply the risk of infectious diseases, like malaria and dengue fever, and impact agricultural yields and water resources, which lead to food and water insecurity, undernutrition and even the loss of livelihoods.Displacement and migration resulting from extreme weather events, rising sea levels and movement to areas with adequate food, water and work bring about their own health risks. Such changes place a strain and increased tension on society, especially those areas of the world already most vulnerable.The World Health Organisation conservatively estimates that between 2030-2050, climate change will cause 250,000 additional deaths a year. It's dispiriting. But on the flip side, this means action on climate change presents a huge opportunity to improve health. WHO director general Margaret Chan described the Paris agreement as one of the most important public health agreements of this century.Policies that support the Paris Agreement will have huge immediate benefits for human health. Actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from energy, transport, buildings and agriculture will see significant reductions in the seven million premature deaths a year from air pollution.Importantly, the world's leaders know it. The atmosphere in the La Seine Plenary Hall was electric as COP21 President Laurent Fabius brought down the leaf-shaped hammer on the Paris Agreement. I was there. I spent two weeks at COP21 with little sleep and irregular meals as one of six medical students from worldwide, representing the International Federation of Medical Students' Associations.We spent our time following the negotiations, lobbying countries, attending meetings and events and giving press conferences to ensure that the health effects of climate change are adequately addressed in this agreement. It was a very intense two weeks, but it was worth it for the experiences I had, the people I met and the final agreement at the end.Growing up in Queenstown - where the landscape warns visitors of how environmental neglect takes decades to rectify - it is hard to understand how it's taken more than 20 years to achieve an agreement such as the one adopted in Paris.Australia played a constructive role finalising this agreement (pushing for the 1.5C target and five-yearly reviews) yet there remains a disconnect between the Federal Government's actions in Paris and their actions back home. Its climate change policies won't help the country pull it's weight when it comes to limiting global warming and by extension, our health.There's no denying the community wants it. In the lead up to the Paris talks, we saw almost a million people around the world mobilising in people's climate marches, including 150,000 Australians. People from all areas of society have joined like never before to commit to meaningful action on climate change, including students, academic staff and the wider community calling on the University of Tasmania to remove fossil-fuel investment.We require real action from our governments, industries and all sectors of society for the good of our health.Alice McGushin is a University of Tasmania student. Since starting medical school in 2010, Alice has been advocating for action on the health impacts of climate change at a local, national and global level with the Australian Medical Students' Association, the International Federation of Medical Students' Associations and Doctors for the Environment Australia.\l"

It's something that our people have been waiting far too long, and now it has come to a point that the world has agreed. So at least something has been agreed. What's next?

I was sitting onstage at the closing plenary of the Global Landscapes Forum, the main NGO event at the COP21 climate talks in Paris. Just the previous day I was amazed to listen to the chief executive of BP Bob Dudley speak with ambition about the oil industry's engagement with the environment at a business roundtable with United Nations secretary-general Ban Ki-moon and United States secretary of state John Kerry. More about that later.I was next at the podium and had to follow a remarkable 25-year-old Eritrean youth leader, Salina Abrahams, who had clearly just stolen the show. When she wasn't getting the under 30s to stand on their feet (and how telling was it that it seemed the only people not standing were on the podium?) Abrahams spoke of priority and urgency, and this mirrored the pervading mood in the corridors and meeting rooms of COP21.Only 61,000 orangutans are left. They share 97 per cent of our DNA. More than 2 million acres of tropical rainforest was lost in Indonesia in 2012 alone. By 2030, at the current rate of conversion, 99 per cent of their habitat will be impacted. But my friends from Indonesia described more than an environmental problem.We know it is severe that carbon emissions from Indonesian land ravaged by fires over the past few months have exceeded those of industrial Germany. But the problems run deeper. According to the government of Indonesia, the fires have caused more than $US34 billion ($46 billion) worth of damage since the middle of this year - not including costs borne by neighbouring countries. This is more than the total value of palm oil produced in 2014 in Indonesia. Not only is this one of the world's worst climate events but it is also a health and economic calamity.Cry for helpAs the country confronts this crisis, President Widodo in Paris last week made an unprecedented appeal for assistance to the global community. Part of the tragedy is that these fires are and were predictable and preventable. While the immediate focus is and must be on remedial actions and firefighting, permanent solutions can only be found through policy-led changes on the ground. These must be informed by solid science and supported by an extensive outreach, education and capacity-building program.There are some fantastic organisations working at the coalface seeking solutions to these complex problems, and the Australian government and global business are starting to play a major role. Leading NGOs describe their work with the oil palm industry in East Kalimantan, where they work with smallholders, logging companies and the district government to find solutions and alternatives. They are helping local communities have a say in forest management, connecting them to financial and other incentives to encourage land swaps, and helping to solve long-standing land tenure issues. At the other extreme, major users of palm oil led by Paul Polman, the CEO of Unilever, are not just committing to stopping forestation but also to a program of reforesting degraded land.This is a great opportunity for Australia to rebuild relations with its neighbours. Leading research institutions such as the Centre for International Forestry Research are already working on long-term solutions, with the help from the Australian government and others, and believe they are within reach in three years. Everyone agrees the private and corporate sector must be front and centre on climate and the environment. This is a great opportunity for Canberra and Jakarta to open the phone l"

Photo by Neal Gowen T he French, grateful for our former prime minister's contribution this week of ideas on how to solve Europe's migration problems, have leapt to thank us by drawing our attention to a bright idea of their own.A French invention the Wind Tree, a three-metre tall, tree- looking wind turbine (pictured), is imagined by its inventors New Wind as a relatively petite, pretty, softly spoken wind-power generator for urban places. New Wind noticed some French hostility to the giant wind turbines of wind farms, but says that people who have despised the giant turbines and never thought they'd warm to wind power are charmed by the wind trees.They have gone into production and, for the moment, they are really rather expensive. A prototype is erected in the Place de la Concorde in Paris to beguile those potentates and boffins who will be in Paris for the looming (November 30 to December 11) United Nations .This futuristic column pricked up its ears at discussion (on the BBC's World Business Report on ABC Radio National at dawn on Wednesday) of the wind trees. We have been much engaged in the debate about the big wind turbines (like the ones at Lake George), taking issue with the philistines (like Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey) who see no beauty in them and in the way in which they sometimes enhance a landscape.But up to a point the French trees seem to be a response to French versions of Abbotts and Hockeys, to complaints about conventional wind turbines' size, noise and landscape- transforming looks. With enough of the little trees in neighbourhoods there may in time be no need for giant wind farms as we have known them, their massive forms arranged all along windswept hills.New Wind was started by Jerome Michaud-Lariviere.

Hunt refused the invite but agreed to a weekly ministerial phone call.However, for policy areas directly under the Prime Minister's control, it's been a dismal few months for climate action, not least CSIRO's assault on climate science launched on February 4 that will see dozens of leading researchers sacked among as many as 450 jobs to go.Despite pleas of budget penury, the government somehow managed to find $15.4million a couple of weeks later for a new Oil, Gas and Energy Resources Growth Centre to, among other things, ""foster community support"" for non- renewables, including coal and nuclear energy.The federal government also forked out $3.3million to two researchers to examine the effects of wind farms on health.Just four researchers made submissions for the cash, a remarkably small number, according to Sydney University public health expert Simon Chapman.And a fresh concern surfaced this week with 61 leading scientists writing to Turnbull decrying the government's decision last month to end grants from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA). Originally set up by the Rudd- Gillard government, the agency still had $1.3billion in funding to disperse by 2022. Instead, it will now work with the Clean Energy Finance Corp to offer $100 million in loans annually for 10 years to foster ""clean and renewable energy"".The end of ARENA's grant funding removes ""an essential component of technology innovation"", the mostly solar researchers said in the letter obtained by Fairfax Media.Forty years of such grants over had allowed Australia to contribute ""very far above its weight"" in renewable energy. By contrast, reliance on equity returns ""have rarely been effective"" in advancing early-stage research, the scientists said.Richard Corkish, chief operating officer of UNSW-based Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics, said his facility faced ""an existential threat"" if the $4million in annual ARENA funds ended.

"COP21","Australia","COP21_Australia247","Paris pledges 'wishful thinking, not optimism'","November 10, 2015 Tuesday","The Australian","EXCLUSIVEFull implementation of all carbon-dioxide savings pledges made at the Paris climate change conference would reduce global temperature increases less than 0.05C by 2030, analysis by policy researcher Bjorn Lomborg has found. Even if the promised actions were continued for the following 70 years and there was no ""CO2 leakage"" to noncommitted nations, the reduction in temperature increases since before the industrial age would be just 0.17C by 2100, the peer-reviewed paper says.Dr Lomborg's findings are at odds with official statements and comments by UN climate chief Christiana Figueres that a Paris agreement could lead to a 2.7C rise instead of a 4C or 5C increase by 2100.Dr Lomborg said Ms Figueres had ""entirely misrepresented the world's options"". He said adopting pledges made before this month's Paris conference by countries representing the vast majority of global greenhouse gas emissions would do little to stabilise the climate and any benefits would be undetectable for many decades.Using accepted modelling and methodology, the Lomborg paper, to be published today, rates individual pledges made by major emissions nations China, the US and EU and the world combined.Published in the journal Global Policy, the Lomborg paper said the best-case scenario for President Barack Obama's pledges for the US, if continued for a century, was a reduction in temperature increases of 0.031C.For China, it was 0.048C and for the EU it was 0.053C.Australia is included in the ""rest of the world"" where combined policies had a maximum potential of reducing global -temperature increases 0.036C by 2100.The paper concluded: ""If we want to reduce climate impacts significantly we will have to find better ways than the ones currently proposed."" Dr Lomborg has been a controversial figure in the climate change debate despite accepting that rising levels of CO2 from human sources will have an -impact on global temperatures.Academic protests have blocked attempts to open a res-earch centre in Australia, either in Perth or Adelaide, with backing from the federal government.Rather than rejecting climate science, Dr Lomborg's core position has been that greater attention needs to be paid to the economics of combating climate change.Releasing his new paper, he said negotiators in Paris were trying to tackle global warming in the same way that had failed for 30 years.He said this included making prom-ises that were individually expensive, that would have little impact even in 100 years and that many governments would try to avoid.""This didn't work in Kyoto, it didn't work in Copenhagen, it hasn't worked in the 18 other -climate conferences or countless more international gatherings,"" Dr Lomborg said.""The suggestion that it will make a large difference in Paris is wishful thinking."" He said a Copenhagen Consensus on Climate project involving 27 of the world's top climate economists and three Nobel Laureates found the best strategy would be to invest in green research and development.""Instead of trying to make fossil fuels so expensive that no one wants them, which will never work, we should make green energy so cheap everybody will shift to it,"" Dr Lomborg said.Climate change negotiators have said the Paris pledges are a starting point. The conference will convene on November 30.In a statement, COP21 president Laurent Fabius, France's Foreign Minister, said national contributions could make a difference and help avoid the worst-case scenario of global warming of 4C-5C or more.""It confirms that it is possible to achieve a trajectory where warming is kept below 1.5C-2C by the end of the century, but this will -require additional efforts over time,"" Mr Fabius said.""Some estimates put us on a trajectory of a 2.7C-3C increase by the end of the century.""This confirms the importance of reaching an agreement at COP21 in Paris that will lay down the rules for periodically -revising the national contributions upwards."" Ms Figueres, the executive -secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, said a Paris agreement could lead to a 2.7C rise instead of 4C or 5C increase.Dr Lomborg said Ms Figueres had ""entirely misrepresented the world's options"". ""The 2.7C comes from the International Energy Agency and essentially assumes that if governments do little in Paris and then right after 2030 embark on incredibly ambitious climate reductions, we could get to 2.7C,"" Dr Lomborg said.""Figueres's own organisation estimates the Paris promises will reduce emissions by 33Gt CO2 in total. To limit rises to 2.7C, about 3000Gt CO2 would need to be -reduced - or about 100 times more than the Paris commitments. That is not optimism, it is wishful thinking."" The latest Lomborg paper uses the MAGICC climate model, which has been used across all five IPCC reports and was co-funded by the US Environmental Protection Agency.Dr Lomborg said it had been run with standard parameters, and sensitivity analysis had shown that different assumptions of climate sensitivity, carbon cycle model or scenario did not substantially change the outcome.Dr Lomborg said the paper had used the same basic methodology of climate scientist, Tom Wigley, who analysed the Kyoto Protocol in a much-cited paper in 1998.\l"

These are difficult to envisage. If the emission reductions are achieved by reducing energy use, that means forcing people and firms to substitute energy for some other inputs, something that they would only do at some cost. Alternatively it means a replacement of low cost with high- cost energy, which brings unambiguous losses to individuals, firms and the economy as a whole.Losses are greatest for fossil fuel resource-rich economies like Australia, because coal has higher emissions of carbon dioxide than oil and gas. Without technological breakthrough, coal use would be eliminated first.Insisting on CCS for coal would be a bonanza for all the renewable funders trying to hobble a competitor that is one- third of their own products' costs.One outcome of the Climate Roundtable's objectives is, therefore, to sterilise Australia's coal reserves. This would entail a considerable loss of wealth to the nation.Australia has 76 billion tonnes of proven coal reserves - split roughly 50/50 into thermal and coking coal. Industry sources suggest that proven reserves of thermal coal with no infrastructure attached to them are worth between $1 and $4 per tonne. Coking coal is worth rather more but is difficult to price. If proven reserves of coal were to be worth only $4 per tonne, this would value Australia's 76 billion tonnes at over $300 billion, almost $12,000 per person. Australia renouncing its coal wealth would incur a deadweight loss of this magnitude. And the measure would have negligible effect on carbon dioxide emissions unless everyone else did likewise.These matters aside, the irony is that measures the Climate Roundtable advocates are not necessary to stabilising global temperatures at a 2 degree increase.The 2013 International Panel on Climate Change report put its estimated range of temperature increases from a doubling of carbon dioxide at 1.5 to 4.5 degrees. In its most recent report, the IPCC actually reduced their 2007 report's estimate of 2 to 5 degrees. Scientists like Massachussetts Institute of Technology's Richard Lindzen and the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre's Willie Soon demonstrate the maximum theoretical increase in global temperatures from carbon dioxide and its equivalent ""greenhouse gases"" is, in the absence of other factors, 1 degree. Increases greater than 1 degree depend on a magnification effect from the emissions through water vapour. This drives IPCC climate models used to project temperature increases.Lindzen rejects such a magnification. He also considers that the increased temperature from carbon dioxide has already occurred. As evidenced by the so-called ""pause"" in temperature increases since the mid-1990s, such views appear to have been corroborated.There are, moreover, few adverse consequences of temperature increases even of a 2\'c2\'b0C magnitude. The one economic study the IPCC referenced for that, estimated the effects of an increase in temperatures of 2\'c2\'b0C put the global income loss at a trivial 0.5 per cent of GDP incurred over a 50-year period. And this employed highly pessimistic assumptions about floods, human health, loss of tourism and the like. Abandoning low-cost energy would impose a far greater cost.Much is at stake for those firms that have invested in high-cost renewables in the hope that government regulations and subsidies will continue to offset their crippling uncompetitiveness. We will see an intensification of lobbying for ongoing government support in the lead-up to December's UN conference on climate change in Paris. Hopefully this will not further damage the Australian economy before the inevitable failure of that conference allows the costs of climate action to be wound back.Alan Moran is the editor of Climate Change: the Facts, published by Stockade Books\l"

The US has declared a 2025 emissions reduction target of 26-28 per cent on 2005 levels. Such an outcome would enable Abbott respectably to show his face in Paris along with other leaders, including Obama and China's President Xi Jinping, to sign a new protocol that would lay out global emissions targets beyond 2020.Progressive ministers in the Abbott cabinet, including Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Environment Minister Greg Hunt, are said to be arguing the case that Australia should bring itself into l"

But it has to be at prices that people are willing to pay. Our first goal is solar and wind. Then hydro and nuclear,"" he said. ""The balance will be met by what is our cheapest source [of energy] and one that we know how to use - coal.""Some of it is produced in India. Some of it imported from countries like Australia,"" he said. ""There is a place for Australian coal in India.""New Delhi - which regards itself as something of a champion of developing countries - argues that curbing coal consumption would exacerbate widespread ""energy poverty"" and harm economic development. India argues that developing economies should not have to shoulder most of the burden for cutting greenhouse gases emissions because it is the richer nations that caused the problem in the first place.The split over how developed and developing nations should allocate responsibility for global warming and disagreements over a commitment by richer nations to mobilise $US100 billion every year from 2020 to help developing countries adapt to climate change will be critical to the success of the Paris summit known as COP21.Developing nations led by India are resisting attempts led by France, the US and Australia to have any Paris agreement include tougher five-year reviews of national climate pledges made in the lead up to COP21 in order to help meet the UN's goal of capping global temperature rises at 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels - a level most scientists regard as safe. However, government officials are also reluctant to embrace measures directly aimed at phasing out fossil fuels given coal is the country's second-largest export earner.""Mostly I thought we were over the neo-colonial moment where the wealthy decide what happens to the poor,"" said Environment Minister Greg Hunt, when asked on Tuesday why the government had approved the Carmichael coal project in Queensland to be build by India's Adani.

Annual exports of metallurgical coal used in steel making grew from 11.5 million tonnes in 2001 to 40.1 million tonnes in 2014. Only Japan (42 million tonnes) and China (46.3 million tonnes) imported more. Annual exports of thermal coal used by Indian power stations grew from 1.4 million tonnes to 6.4 million tonnes over the same period.However, some observers believe it is impossible to ignore India's coal total consumption - which is not expected to peak for many decades - given it is now the world's third biggest emitter of carbon. Former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, who came up against Indian opposition during the Copenhagen negotiations in 2009, said India was facing ""all sorts of difficulty over its own coal transition"" which he said was about ""about 30 years behind China"".""[But] we can't walk away from the reality of India's carbon dependency given where it is in the industrialisation cycle. It's heavily coal dependent,"" he said. ""Therefore we've got an obligation to work with the Indians on helping them through that with technology and energy infrastructure investment rather than just saying, 'It's all your problem sunshine'.""Dr Mathur, who is currently director general of India's Bureau of Energy Efficiency, said India had not always done a great job of communicating its position on fossil fuels. He noted many countries including China and the US were still using more coal in absolute terms than India while India's carbon emissions measured on a per capita basis are well below those two nations.""In per capita terms most countries of the world will be using more coal than we are in 2030,"" he added.Key pointsAustralian coal imports are set to play a critical role in lifting India out of poverty.All nations must strive to reduce emissions, India says.\l"
"COP21","Australia","COP21_Australia254","Turnbull still a chance to screw up, says Rudd; Paris climate conference","December 3, 2015 Thursday","Australian Financial Review","COP21 India and island coalition could refuse to sign climate deal.Kevin Rudd is familiar with the difficulties of pulling off a global climate change agreement, having been in the room when China derailed the 2009 Copenhagen talks.But the former Labor prime minister is more optimistic about whether the 190 countries attending the United Nations conference in Paris can reach a binding agreement to cut carbon emissions over the next fortnight. ""Copenhagen at this stage - we would have given ourselves about a three or four out of 10 chance of success,"" he told The Australian Financial Review in the French capital. ""I would give ourselves here in Paris about a six or seven out of 10 prospect of success, which means there is still plenty of opportunity for everyone to screw up.""Mr Rudd is only half joking. France has learnt from the mistakes of Copenhagen - where the likes of US president Barack Obama spent the final hours scrambling to salvage a deal - by getting world leaders to set the tone by attending the opening day of the conference.China, which Mr Rudd memorably accused of ""ratf---ing"" the negotiations six years ago, is far less likely to be an obstacle, given the world's biggest carbon emitter has nominated its carbon reduction targets, indicated it is prepared to accept five-year reviews of its emissions and agreed to a ""common vision"" with the United States.However, there is a risk that developing countries such as India and a coalition of small island nations could baulk at signing up to an agreement they regard as inequitable. Mr Rudd, who is in Paris as president of the Asia Society Policy Institute and is accredited by the UN, says the key question for the Paris summit is: will the richer nations of north end up paying for the south?""Remember in Copenhagen the two opposed leading governments in the world were China and India together,"" he said. ""I know because I was there in the room. What is truly remarkable in five years is the 180 degree shift in China's position, for which the world should register some genuine appreciation to the Chinese.""Poorer countries argue they should not have to shoulder most of the burden for cutting greenhouse gases emissions because it is the richer nations that caused the problem.India is pushing hard for innovation on solar and other renewable energy technologies but argues it needs to continue using coal to generate power for nearly 300 million of its citizens that do not have access to electricity.""India is in all sorts of difficulty over its own coal transition - it's about 30 years behind China,"" Mr Rudd said. ""The big coal hump, frankly, in India's demand curve is emerging. China's has emerged and is stabilising.""[But] we can't walk away from the reality of India's carbon dependency given where it is in the industrialisation cycle. It's heavily coal dependent. Therefore we've got an obligation to work with the Indians on helping them through that with technology and energy infrastructure investment rather than just saying, 'It's all your problem, sunshine'.""A key sticking point will be how developed nations handle a promise made in Copenhagen to ""mobilise"" $100 billion every year from 2020 to help developing countries adapt to climate change. Mr Rudd nominates this issue of climate finance as well as a push from countries such as Australia and France for the five-yearly reviews as two critical challenges. ""If [the reviews don't] come about I believe we are in a world of pain,"" he said.With a series of national carbon reduction pledges made in the lead-up to the Paris talks expected to cap temperature rises at 2.7 degrees to 3 degrees above pre-industrial levels, well above the UN's 2 degree target deemed safe by many scientists, Mr Rudd says the Paris conference could deliver a result, ""that is infinitely better than business as usual which would have us on track for 4 degrees-plus"".Mr Rudd was sitting with the Papua New Guinea delegation on Monday when Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced Australia would ratify the second stage of the Kyoto agreement as part of his speech on ""leaders' day"". Mr Rudd signed Australia up to the original Kyoto agreement in 1997.""I attended his speech. Absolutely. It was the right thing to do,"" Mr Rudd said. ""The sooner we retain an enduring bipartisan consensus in Australia on climate change, the sooner we can put these mindless domestic debates to bed and get on the with the business of long-term adaptation to clean, green economies.""Mr Turnbull retained his predecessor Tony Abbott's Direct Action climate policies - and his promise not to reintroduce an emissions trading scheme - to secure enough support to roll Mr Abbott for the prime ministership in September. Mr Rudd said he has no sympathy for the conservative wing of the Coalition. ""On climate change and a range of other policy directions, Malcolm's challenge is to deal with that considerable array of right-wing nutjobs within his own party. And they continue to draw breath.""\l"

Australia has in the past been criticised for not doing enough compared to other developed countries.Canberra points to its decision to ratify the second Kyoto agreement, a doubling of investment into research and development of clean energy, and a shift in aid funding towards mitigation and adaptation as proof it is doing its bit.Premier Jay Weatherill, preparing to leave yesterday for the summit, said Australia's part in solving the climate crisis ""will depend on whether (Mr) Turnbull is able to essentially get free of the right wing of his party, who are a bunch of climate-change sceptics"".Ratifying the Kyoto agreement framed three years ago is largely symbolic, but the PM said it had been carefully considered by both the party room and the Cabinet and was a very important part of the Government's commitment to action.Environment Minister Greg Hunt said it was "" a very, very powerful symbol to the world"".However, Mr Turnbull disappointed many by refusing to sign the communique promising a swifter end to fossil-fuel subsidies, which Nationals fear could affect the diesel fuel rebate for farmers.PAGE 13: TORY SHEPHERD PAGE 45: AID CASH WELCOMEDSPECIAL REPORT: HOW BIOFUELS COULD POWER SA'S ECONOMIC FUTURE ADVERTISER.COM.AU\l"

"COP21","Australia","COP21_Australia258","World commits to cutting carbon emissions","December 13, 2015 Sunday 10:02 AM GMT","AFR Online","Representatives from almost 200 countries in Paris have signed an historic climate accord aimed at preventing unsafe global temperature rises that would for the first time commit nations to lowering greenhouse gas emissions and could force business to sharply reduce its use of fossil fuels. The landmark United Nations climate talks were concluded just before 7.30pm local time amid sustained applause, hugs and a few tears among the delegates on the floor of the vast conference centre in the north of French capital including French President Francois Hollande, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop. ""This is a small gavel, but I believe it can do big things,"" said French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius as he approved the deal. Mr Fabius had previously reminded delegates of the ill-fated 2009 Copenhagen meeting, which failed to result in a global agreement. He said if that was to happen again ""trust in the very ability of the concert of nations to get a solution to climate change would irrevocably be lost"".The final agreement is built around the over-arching UN goal of holding global warming at ""well below 2C above pre-industrial levels"" as well as a pledge to ""pursue efforts"" to stop warming beyond 1.5C. In order to meet these targets the agreement says countries should aim to reach a ""global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions"" as soon as possible.Critically, the agreement appears to contain a goal of net zero emissions after 2050 by calling for ""a balance between man-made emissions"" and reductions from forests and other carbon sinks that absorb greenhouse gasses. ""Achieving a balance between [man-made] sources and sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century will require net carbon dioxide emissions to be reduced, in effect, to zero,"" said Professor Myles Allen from Oxford University. ""It seems governments understand this, even if they couldn't quite bring themselves to say so."" A smile!

Christiana Figueres (@CFigueres) HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/CFigueres/status/675744635038400512December 12, 2015The agreement followed three sleepless nights of negotiations between ministers and several last-minute phone conversations between world leaders, including US President Barack Obama, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and China's Xi Jinping. It marks the first successful UN climate change agreement since the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 - and the first ever that required all countries to confront the problem.As chair of the Umbrella Group of non-European Union developed nations, Ms Bishop was the second foreign minister to respond from the floor once the deal was approved by the French hosts.""Our work here is done and now we can return home to implement this historic agreement,"" she said. ""No country will see this as the perfect outcome. Certainly it does no include everything that we envisaged. However, this agreement does give us a strategy to work together over the coming years and decades.""Speaking to the media afterwards, Ms Bishop described the agreement as ""ambitious"" and indicated the government will adjust its Direct Action climate policy after an already scheduled 2017 review. ""It certainly means there is flexibility for us to do more,"" she said. ""The spirit of the agreement is to encourage countries to be ambitious, to aim higher and to take into account their circumstances"". Asked what the deal meant for Australia's large reserves of coal, gas and other fossil fuels, Ms Bishop said ""nobody expects countries to destroy their own economies, that would be self-defeating"". However, some observers are predicting Australia will find it difficult to switch to a ""low-carbon economy"".""Basically the message from here [in Paris] to the world is that this is the end of the fossil fuel era,"" said Keith Tuffley, a former head of Goldman Sachs in Australia and the chief executive of business group, The B Team. ""We've taken far too long to transition our economy. Australia has been so dependent on fossil fuels.""The final text reflects a series of compromises between developing and developed nations over who should shoulder the burden of curbing greenhouse gases and how much funding should be provided to help poorer countries adapt to climate change. Developing countries have argued they should not pay for a historical problem they did not create but developed countries including Australia argue this position is no longer realistic because India and China now make up two of the world's top three emitters.These divisions have dogged UN climate talks for decades but the new agreement goes some way to changing the dynamic of ""differentiation"" by requiring some form of action from all countries. The new agreement acknowledges ""common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities in the light of different national circumstances"" and compels developed countries to engage in ""absolute"" reductions while calling on developing nations to ""continue enhancing their mitigation efforts"". This wording is critical for a nation such as India which will rely heavily on relatively cheap sources of energy like coal for many decades given 300 million of its citizens live without access to electricity. Final positions on the major sticking points include: A promise by richer countries to mobilise at least $US100 billion in annual aid from 2020 to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change and build up renewable energy generation was moved from the body of the deal into an accompanying decision. This is expected to make it easier for President Obama to ratify the agreement without relying on the support of a hostile Senate. However, developing countries have secured a pledge for a new, larger funding commitment to be delivered by 2025. Carbon reduction pledges made by 187 countries before the Paris talks will be reviewed every five years, with the first to be carried out in 2020. Nations can only change these pledges to make them more ambitious. India pushed unsuccessfully for reviews to be held every ten years. The agreement retained measures to support small-island countries and other nations most vulnerable to loss and damage from rising sea levels, drought and other adverse effects of rising temperatures. But in a nod to concerns that this could make richer nations legally liable, it says ""the agreement does not involve or provide a basis for any liability or compensation"". One of the key demands from developed countries including Australia was a commitment to set up common rules for checking national pledges. The agreement allows for a ""Capacity-Building Initiative for Transparency"" that requires developing nations to provide regular national ""inventory reports"" of emissions. However, richer nations still regards these measures are too vague. The deal requires a five-yearly global ""stocktake"" of all elements of the Paris agreement starting in 2023. ""This Paris agreement...signals to communities, investors and companies around the world that the shift to clean energy is now unstoppable,"" said John Connor, chief executive of the Climate Institute.Mr Connor said Australia's decision to support the zero net emissions goal and join the ""high ambition coalition of nations"" which championed the reference to 1.5C represented a positive contribution to negotiations.""However, Australia's domestic actions now need to match these fine outcomes and aspirations in Paris,"" he said. ""Without stronger action, for example, 2030 country commitments will leave Australia as the highest per capita polluter in the G20 alongside just Saudi Arabia, one of the most obstructive forces in the Paris negotiations."" Countries are not set emissions reduction targets under the Paris agreement. Instead they made individual national pledges to reduce greenhouse-gas pollution. However, analysis by the UN predicts these national pledges will reduce global temperature rises by 2.7C - well short of the 2C goal. ""This is a good agreement,"" said India's Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar. ""This means that all together will act to mitigate the challenge presented by climate change.""

Regardless of the direction of world temperatures, they left Paris happy that the UN's Green Climate Fund, which aims to reach $US100 billion a year by 2020, will give them cash for anything they can pass off as remotely -related to their intended national contributions to world CO2 -reduction. They argue this is only fair. Poor countries fare worst from climate change and must be compensated for unspecified damage and their share of repairing the West's legacy. You can bet $US100bn a year won't do it.Overwhelmingly, the money for the fund will come from 42 guilt-racked wealthy nations. That is their moral responsibility. They caused the warming. They threaten the planet. It's time for them to repay their climate debts.It matters not that there is no empirical scientific evidence to support these claims. Even the 2C target is not based on science, it was originally plucked out of thin air by the European People's Party for election purposes. But then climate change is not about credible scientific evidence. It has its roots in Marxism, and ultimately the Green Fund is presided over by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, run by Costa Rican Marxist Christiana Figueres. The ""paradigm-shifting"" fund will provide employment for an army of green bureaucrats who will offer ""concessional finance"" for the development needs of less advanced countries.China, the leading emitter, venting one billion tonnes of CO2 a year more than it admits to, has been adroit in dealing with the politics. It approaches its domestic air quality crisis under the banner of climate action and so turns a domestic necessity into a global virtue. From this and its lack of interest in aid for itself, China projects moral authority and, while there is no cap on its emissions and only a promise that they will peak by 2030, promotes emission restraints for others, for its own competitive advantage.India has adopted a similar l"

CBD apartments are playing catch-up to the 35 per cent cut over the three years to 2014 that the city's commercial buildings made through Sydney's Better Building Partnership program.Growing recognition of the role buildings play in the wider climate-change agenda has been recognised through the inclusion of a Buildings Day in the Paris COP21 conference on Thursday. More than 30 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions are building-related and the figure could rise to 50 per cent by 2050 without significant change.Thursday's discussions aim to create an alliance of property and construction-related organisations that will commit to putting the industry on a ""below 2-degree path"" - to boost collaboration and exchange so the industry can become more sustainable and help limit the increase in temperature to no more than 2 degrees celsius above the world's average pre-industrial level. ""The buildings sector offers one of the most cost-effective and economically beneficial paths for reducing energy demand and associated emissions while at the same time supporting adaptation and resilience to climate change,"" the Global Buildings Performance Network, a Paris-based organisation, says.The development and ownership structures of high-rise apartments made it harder to take actions like green retrofitting, said Romilly Madew, chief executive of the Green Building Council of Australia.Commercial buildings generally had a small number of long-term owners who understood the financial as well as commercial benefits of lower-emitting buildings, Ms Madew said.""The ownership [of apartment towers] is slightly different,"" she said. ""If you're talking about multi-unit residential, a developer will own the building and then sell each unit in a strata title and will move on to the next development. It's up to the owner of the unit about whether they care, whether they buy into a green development or not.""\l"

""Nothing, except that people are favourably disposed towards you. You're not being elected. You haven't got the power to become prime minister. The problem is that you are credited with more wisdom and apprehension than is the case - which is quite easy actually. People think you know everything, but of course you don't!""It's a TV image and a very one-dimensional image at that. You certainly don't get more money for being a national treasure. There is no national treasure premium."" A pause, before he bursts into infectious laughter.""Have we exchanged notes about geriatric moments? No."" Attenborough is rare in the world of television in that he actually seems interested in what other people are saying. He leans forward and listens, intently yet politely, to your thoughts. He is as much a receiver as a transmitter, and that is what makes him such a superb communicator.As Attenborough reaches this great age, he is clearly still fired up by the same tremendous curiosity that has powered his career for the last seven decades. He possesses a contagious lust for life that shames people 40 years younger.Attenborough is reckoned to have travelled further than any other human being apart from astronauts, and yet his trademark passion shows no sign of waning.What is most appealing is that even after such a stellar career, he does not take anything for granted. He continues to be commendably modest and grateful for all the opportunities he is offered.Attenborough observes that: ""I can think of an awful lot of my own contemporaries who got into jobs where after 10 or 20 years, they were thinking, 'I've had enough of this'. But they're stuck with it because it's what their career is and they have a pension. They're counting the years off until they get to 65, and then they do nothing but play golf."" By contrast, he continues, ""I'm fantastically lucky.""I think, 'Oh, I'll go to the Amazon next year - why not?' I'm more grateful than I can say that people still want me to do things."" Some 62 years after presenting his first natural history program, Zoo Quest, Attenborough's documentaries continue to inspire successive generations. That is because he has never lost his magnetic sense of wonder about the natural world.""Experience has taught me how amazingly big and unpredictable the natural world is. When you're young, you think you know it all about the natural world - 'Yawn, yawn, everyone knows about that'. ""But in fact we only know a tiny proportion about the complexity of the natural world. Wherever you look, there are still things we don't know about and don't understand, as recent discoveries about, say, the behaviours of puffer fish and peacock spiders prove.""There are always new things to find out if you go looking for them. They will last me out."" The presenter responsible for nine seasons of the landmark Life series still believes in the power of television to educate, inform and entertain.""Our job as natural history filmmakers is to show that the natural world is unbelievably amazing. The world is unimaginably varied, quite beyond our comprehension.""But the paradox is that according to the UN over half of the human race is now urbanised. We're out of touch with nature in a way that my great great grandfather, who was working in the fields, never was. And yet now the population know more about animals and how varied they are and why they do what they do than my great great grandfather ever did.""That is something natural history TV programs can claim credit for. If you can show the natural world on television, people will be fascinated by it."" He adds that ""these programs have changed people's minds. There is now a bigger sympathy for the natural world among city-dwellers than there ever was. Our comprehension of the animal kingdom has changed beyond recognition. Now taxi drivers talk to you about biological concepts. 'What's all this about altruism, David? Don't you think that it will affect evolution'?"" Attenborough is also very engaged with environmental issues, making an impassioned and influential speech at the UN conference on climate change in Paris last year.""It's never been more important. We are completely dependent on the natural world and yet we are wrecking it and endangering ourselves. If we are going to care for it, people have to change their behaviour, and to do that they have to know about what goes on in the natural world. That's one of the things TV can do.""I certainly embrace conservation causes. You have to be very, very dogmatic and have a closed mind not to see the overwhelming evidence about climate change. It would be amazing if we hadn't had an effect on the climate. The time comes when you have to look at the evidence and make a stand.""\l"

ELLIS, West Launceston.Simple celebrationDID anyone else notice the demeanour of Ross Taylor, the New Zealand batsman, on passing the 200-run mark?No running the length of the pitch, no jumping in the air, no punching the air, no kissing the New Zealand emblem, just acknowledgement of the crowd and a handshake from his partner.I found it very refreshing.Price of dieselAFTER spending 18 weeks on the mainland, and buying diesel in Victoria, NSW and Queensland, we noted that diesel was always about 10 cents a litre cheaper than unleaded.On returning to Tasmania in September we noted that it is still about 1-2 cents higher than unleaded.Will the report currently under review on fuel prices by Dr Michael Schaper mentioned in The Examiner, November 14 let us know who is making this extra 10 cents a litre difference in price between diesel and unleaded.No hope for terroristsONCE more the world is reeling from a terror attack involving people innocently going about their business.The Paris attacks - where scores of people have been left dead and injured - is an affront to humanity and to all the values held dear by people of goodwill throughout the world.This further attempt in France to destabilise and undermine democracy must be met not only with waves of revulsion but also with a steely determination to never allow terrorists to have their objectives realised.United NationsClimate Change ConferenceThese murderers of innocent victims have nothing to do with religion, but are simply a group of thugs who relish terrorising the population for the benefit of territorial gains and the dissemination of a warped ideology.The world gathering in Paris will help affirm that terrorists will never succeed in spreading a climate change of fear and anxiety.- ED SIANSKI, West Moonah.Do your own researchWhat he omits in his statement is the unprecedented rate of change, (World Meteorological Organization, 2013), with the planet warming faster since the turn of the century than ever recorded.The likely rate of change will be at least 10 times that of any climate shift in the last 65 million years. (Stanford, 2013; Diffenbaugh/Field, 2013).""Ecosystems have responded to a few degrees of temperature change over thousands of years"", now that change is ""to occur over decades"" (Marcott, 2013).With regard to the emotive issue that is climate change, it is very important to do your own research on the subject.Indeed, do not take my word or other correspondents on this subject.But please ensure that what you read has been properly peer reviewed.This process reinforces the veracity of the research.- MARTIN HAY, Rosevears.WOMEN and adolescents are being sent to interstate drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities because of a shortage of services within Tasmania (The Examiner, November 16).That's only if you can afford it.What happens to those who can't afford it?Pathways Tasmania offers a Hobart-based addiction program Live Free Tassie, but it is open only to young men.Why? A Launceston couple hope to open a dedicated rehab centre in the former Meander Primary School to deal with the issue.Let's hope they're not as selective with who they offer treatment.- A. R. TROUNSON, Needles.Delivery delaysON Wednesday morning, November 4, I took a card into the counter at the George Town Post Office.I asked how much for a stamp, the address was checked (a post office box in George Town 7253), it was a standard sized card so no extra was required.I paid for the stamp and left it with the staff member and left.The card arrived at its destination, the above PO box on the following Tuesday, November 10.The card only had to be taken out the back of the post office and posted into the private box, yet it took a week to be delivered.I queried the delay in delivery, from the front counter to the back office, and was told that unless I specify that it is for local delivery, all mail goes to Hobart for processing and then is returned for delivery. - JANET McMULLEN, George Town.No easy solutionSPEAKING of the evil Islamic terrorists who killed in Paris, The Examiner rightly said ""our world is not for some crazy, deranged extremists to hijack and subjugate, in pursuit of warped totalitarianism"".But, the editorial could equally have been directed at the Americans and their allies who stupidly invaded Iraq and Afghanistan, killing thousands of innocents and thereby creating the vacuum that this new group has filled.Put troops on the ground?It will take a lot deeper thinking than that to find a solution.- MICHAEL MANSELL, Launceston.Leave Quadrant as isI work in this area , and people are constantly saying what a pleasant area it is, to sit and eat, or just contemplate life.If the cobbles are a problem, why not re-grout and clean them.The seats and lights suit the area, particularly with the decorations to suit.- CHRISTINE BEST, Launceston.Paying for your crimesTHE editorial in (The Examiner, November 13) was spot on, suggesting that criminals should contribute to court costs of $50 or $150.Someone has to pay, why should it always be the long-suffering taxpayers.The decision to commit the crime was theirs, so they should at least cover some of the costs. As for the Legislative Council voting it down when it was part of the government's agenda that it took to last election, I can only say how left wing some MLCs have become.It is on record that our local member voted against the legislation, so he will never get my vote in the future.We are fast moving towards a society where criminals have more rights than the majority who are law abiding.- GRAEME BARWICK, Riverside.Taking the hard l"
"COP21","Australia","COP21_Australia301","Savings add up for going solar","November 25, 2015 Wednesday","The Age (Melbourne, Australia)","There are many pros and cons to installing solar panels. Do your homework writes David Potts.Solar panels are landing on rooftops just as the Hills Hoist invaded backyards. If you're not solar-powered, you're not with it.In a few days' time the United Nations climate change conference will start in Paris, taking up where the previous talks in Copenhagen failed.In the six years since Copenhagen, the cost of solar panels has plummeted and battery technology has improved dramatically. If households can generate electricity by day and then store it to use in the evening, it would revolutionise electricity distribution.There are forecasts of a coming boom in solar batteries to rival the boom in panel installation of the first Kevin Rudd era. US-based Greentech Media claims Australia will be a leader in installing batteries, forecasting solar storage capacity to rise from 6.6 megawatts to 75 megawatts in 2016, hitting 800 megawatts by 2020.As the costs of panels and batteries keep falling, who would pay an energy company 45\'c2\£2 a kilowatt hour when you can generate the power yourself, with some assistance from the sun, for 8\'c2\£2 to 12\'c2\£2 a kilowatt hour?Especially when it's never been easier, or cheaper, to finance a solar installation.The other thing that's changed since Copenhagen, and Australia's previous solar boom, is the rise of leasing or pay-as-you-go options.Still, solar panels aren't always as kind to your pocket as they are to the environment. If you buy a system that's too big they can even lift your bill when, for the first time, electricity prices are falling.As a rule solar pays off after five years in Sydney and seven in Melbourne due to the difference in the amount of sun in each city. Let's not go there. It's also because Melbourne has cheaper conventional power so the benefit is also slightly less.These payback periods stack up well against other investments that don't have the feel-good green benefits. For most shares and investment properties the payback period is more like 10 years or longer.The panels should be good for at least 25 years, though parts of the system might need replacing after a decade.Looked at another way - which is to say dispassionately by me - in Sydney it's a 15 per cent annual return after tax on your investment.Finance options for solar Then again, these days you can lease a solar system and, in NSW only, you can get one that's as free as the sunshine itself in return for buying all the power it generates. More on that later.Leasing a system works pretty much like car finance so interest is built into the monthly payments. Typically at the end of the lease you'll be able to buy the system outright at its depreciated value.An advantage is that you never have to worry about maintenance, not that there's much anyway. The reason the panels are tilted is so they self-clean when it rains.Roughly speaking, a leased system will cost you about 15\'c2\£2 a kilowatt hour. That compares with 8\'c2\£2 to 12\'c2\£2 if you generate your own power - about what you pay off-peak from the grid. Trouble is, the grid's version of off-peak is different from your own. Do you really want to do the washing at 11pm?Oh, and did I mention the grid price can be as high as 46\'c2\£2 a kilowatt in peak periods?""The rule of thumb, depending where you are, is that the cost to you from solar will be 8\'c2\£2 to 12\'c2\£2 a kilowatt hour which avoids 25 to 30\'c2\£2 [conventionally],"" says Damien Moyse, policy and research manager at the Alternative Technology Association.Energy companies are even offering Harvey Norman-style interest-free terms though there is a small deposit. Origin Energy, for example, charges $199 upfront plus monthly interest-free payments for two years - a total cost of $3295 for a two kilowatt system.The cheapest personal loan is Hunter United's green saver loan at 9.74 per cent.So if you don't have the cash, the cheapest way to go solar is putting it on the mortgage. Next comes leasing.Hang on, what was that about a free solar system? Under a power purchase agreement you have to buy what the system generates, even if you don't use it. While the charge will be higher than solar costs, it'll still be less than the energy company's regular electricity.Choose the wrong-sized system for your home, however, and the payback period can be longer than half your working life, which would detract somewhat from the warm inner glow of doing the right thing.""The payback range is huge - it can be five years to longer than the asset life, which is 25 to 30 years,"" Moyse says.""If you're at work so the only power you're using during the day is the fridge, forget solar. Like to burn the midnight oil? Sorry, solar's not for you.""That's without batteries of course. It's not economic just yet to store the energy your solar panels generate, but it's close.Next month Enphase Energy will roll out a system that can store solar energy and lets you monitor your consumption.Tesla, of electric car fame, will roll out a battery next year as well but don't hold your breath. Although the price of solar batteries is falling it's still prohibitive for the average home. And they have less than half the life of the panels.""International forecasts show an 8 to 10 per cent drop per annum in the battery price. By 2020 you'll be able to have a battery economically,"" Moyse predicts.Solar costs fallingMany people believe that it's become more expensive because government subsidies are falling. In fact the cost of installing a system has fallen faster than the government subsidies.A 1.5 kilowatt system, which should satisfy about one-third of the average household's electricity consumption, costs between $3000 to $6000. A souped-up five kilowatt affair, probably enough to light up a whole suburb, will cost $7000 to $11,500.Incidentally the reason for the big price range for each size is that a lot depends on how many panels you need, what your roof is made of, and sundry things such as whether you need a new meter and wiring or trees have to be removed.Most systems installed are under three kilowatts, according to a survey by Choice last year. The average cost was $8783.These costs take into account the federal incentive of small-scale technology certificates, which trade in the market like shares. These are credits for every megawatt hour it's estimated your system will generate over the next 15 years.Usually they're ""sold"" to the installer, who gives you a discount of the same amount.Energy companies buy the certificates because they count towards their mandated renewable energy target and are cheaper than building wind farms.If you're keen enough you can hang on to them and sell them in the market though it involves more paperwork. The price is set by the market and so bobs about but for all intents and purposes is capped at $40. Quotes are available from Trade in Green tradeingreen.com.au or Green Bank green-bank.com.au. When I looked the price was about $39.Another myth is that you need lots of sun. The truth is that you can have too much. Solar operates best at 25 degrees but roofs can get as hot as 60 degrees.Darren Gladman, policy manager at the Clean Energy Council recommends a check by an installer every five years.Selling to the gridAs for the once thriving cottage industry of selling power back to the grid, it's too late.These days you're only paid a fraction of the cost of producing solar.Action plan for solarCheck your last four energy bills to see how much power you use and when.

The abiding lesson he learnt was the importance of having sufficient working capital.As he tells Chanticleer in an interview: ""People who supply you want cash and customers want credit.""But 40 years later, he can rightly claim to be the ""Sun King"" of Australian energy markets.When you include the new Clare Solar Farm, which employs tracking technology to optimise output, Origin will have more solar generation than AGL, which is the country's largest privately owned investor in renewable energy.Origin's power purchase agreement (PPA) with the Clare Solar Farm, which is about 80kms south of Townsville, is seen by many as a turning point in Australia's renewable energy market.Origin signed a 13-year PPA to purchase the Clare Solar Farm energy output plus renewable certificates for a bundled price of $80 a megawatt hour. That is below the parity price for wind power.Credit Suisse analyst Mark Samter said last week that this deal was a milestone in the transition to renewables because solar prices have fallen to levels which the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) had targeted for 2020.He said ""this could herald the start of a renewables investment boom"".""We believe the stunning drop in solar PPA prices does put a cap on how far wholesale electricity prices can rise,"" Samter said.""However, we retain the view that tighter climate policy will necessarily lead to higher wholesale electricity prices which will benefit Origin and AGL's existing portfolio.""King says investment in renewable energy died in 2014 and 2015 because of policy uncertainty about the renewable energy target (RET) and the sum of the value of electricity in the wholesale market and subsidies called renewable energy certificates (REC).But this year the economics have all changed according to King.The REC prices have doubled, there is bipartisan agreement of a RET of 33 terawatt hours by 2020 and there is a falling cost curve for installing renewable generation.Another way of looking at this is in relation to the necessary investment. It is likely that about $6 billion in renewable generation will need to happen over the next five years to ensure about 25 per cent of electricity generation is from renewables.King is not alone in believing that utility scale solar will come into its own over the next few years and become even more attractive if there can be bipartisan agreement about what happens after 2020.Australia is going to the COP21 conference in Paris later this year with a commitment to reduce carbon emissions by at least 26 per cent and up to 28 per cent by 2030 from 2005 levels.If climate change becomes a hot election issue there will be a stark difference between the Coalition and Labor, which has promised 50 per cent renewables by 2030.King won't drawn on the politics of climate change but he says if we are to meet out COP21 targets there will have to be significant investment in renewables.Origin brings a unique perspective to the debate about renewables policy because of its involvement in utility scale solar in Chile for the past decade.Its 40 per cent investment in the 69 megawatt Javiera solar project in Chile's Atacama Desert has provided the upper echelon of Origin's management with an understanding of the rapid decl"

A search uncovered a stash including 15 MDMA capsules, LSD, liquid ecstasy and cash, police said. On the same day, a 24-year-old Victorian man was stopped by a police dog and handler. Police say he had more than 7g of MDMA, cocaine, 45 LSD tablets and cannabis. Both men were granted conditional bail to appear before Raymond Terrace Local Court in January.Search for Lord Howe snorkeller winds down The search for a snorkeller missing off Lord Howe Island for a week has been scaled back, police say. ACT man Jake Barrett was reported missing by friends after he failed to return from a snorkelling trip about 20m off Middle Beach last Wednesday. Emergency services wound back their search for the 20-year-old on Monday, but police continued to comb the area on foot yesterday. Commercial fishermen and private aircraft were enlisted to scope the area, police said. Mr Barrett was reportedly holidaying on the island, 600km east of Port Macquarie.Accused attackers 'left phone with selfies' Two men have been charged following a bashing and attempted robbery in Sydney's west. A 20-year-old and his alleged accomplice reportedly left a phone behind with selfies on it when they tried to break into a car. Police say a 48-year-old man woke to noises outside his Condell Park home early yesterday morning. He confronted the pair, who were believed to be known to him, before they bashed him and fled, leaving behind items including the phone. The victim was treated by paramedics at the scene before being taken to Bankstown Hospital. One man has been charged with assault and another, aged 20, with four offences including assault occasioning actual bodily harm in the company of others. Both men were refused bail.Woman accused of shooting at cyclists An 18-year-old woman has been charged after two youths on pushbikes were allegedly shot at from a car in Sydney's west. Witnesses reported seeing a green Holden Commodore driving through a Shalvey intersection last Thursday where shots were fired at two males riding in the area, police said. An 18-year-old woman was arrested in Guildford on Monday and charged with five offences, including carrying a firearm and driving while disqualified.Territory joins alliance to cut greenhouse gasThe ACT government has committed to a sub-national alliance for greenhouse gas reduction. Environment Minister Simon Corbell said the territory's government had committed to assist in reducing urban greenhouse gas emissions by 3.7 gigatons annually by 2030.

These plans are incompatible with the world's objective of limiting global warming below dangerous levels.""Over the next 10 years Australia plans to double its coal exports.

It is really significant to have two prime ministers in two high-intensity economies who get it,"" Mr Tuffley said in an interview with The Australian Financial Review.""Companies are now relieved they are not bullied into not talking about the issue. There was a sense the previous leadership would have reacted in an adverse way if they did.""Mr Tuffley said there were business opportunities for Australia in the move away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy like wind and solar.""On any factual basis, Australia has been lagging, both at a government level and a corporate level,"" he said.""There are very few Australian companies that have made any commitments but it's starting to shift. We're a high carbon economy. We're dependant on oil, gas and particularly coal. The future is not about fossil fuels, the future is about clean energy.""There's a growing recognition there is huge economic opportunities from this necessary economic shift. Renewable energy creates more jobs than digging out coal.""Mr Tuffley will speak at the Australian Climate Leadership Summit in Sydney on Thursday which is an official lead-up event to the COP21 Paris climate talks.The summit will announce that 13 Australian companies including Westpac, National Australia Bank, ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, Origin Energy, AGL, Brambles and Bank Australia had endorsed 40 climate commitments under the ""We Mean Business"" climate leadership platform.

"COP21","Australia","COP21_Australia312","CLIMB FOR SURVIVAL; THE Brief. / NEWS","October 9, 2015 Friday","Australian Financial Review","From the Antarctic to the equator, Tim Jarvis is shedding light on climate change.One hundred years ago, the sound of splitting hull timber signalled the beginning of the end for polar explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton's ship Endurance, 100 kilometres off the coast of Antarctica. The probably apocryphal advertisement recruiting for the expedition - ""Men wanted for hazardous journey ... safe return doubtful"" - aptly summed up the crew's situation, thousands of kilometres from help and with no means of communication.But Shackleton defied incredible odds to save his men, first by eking out an improbable existence on the ice for almost a year, then by the most audacious of open-boat journeys across the storm-ravaged Southern Ocean, with a handful of the strongest men in one of the ship's tiny lifeboats. After reaching a whaling station on the remote subantarctic island of South Georgia, and a treacherous climb through its mountains, he returned to rescue those left behind. Sir Edmund Hillary described it as the greatest survival journey of all time and few disagree.How he did it has been the subject of endless analysis and is the reason many of the world's leading management schools cite Shackleton as the ultimate exemplar of crisis leadership. Having recreated only the final pieces of Shackleton's epic journey in a replica of his boat, in 2013, I feel humbled in knowing the totality of what he managed to achieve and privileged to have gained insights into the leadership required to achieve it.Central to this was his innate understanding that all teams are made up of individuals and getting them to work together to the best of their ability to achieve a common goal requires communicating to each in subtly different ways.As an environmental scientist, I am struck by how relevant this key aspect of his leadership is today when applied to a big issue such as climate change.Many different stakeholders and positions all need to be brought together to pull as one, using different language, evidence and argument.And the place this needs to occur is at the United Nations climate change talks, in Paris, from November 30. COP21 is the 21st such meeting - a process that in two decades of trying has failed because of the pursuit of individual self-interest.My 25zero project involves teams climbing those mountains at the equator that still have glaciers, and broadcasting images and information about their disappearance because of climate change into the conference and to global media and the public.The project is designed to appeal to a range of stakeholders and to support the Worldwide Fund for Nature's climate change projects.

Both represent primary indicators concerning global economic activity. Both commodities are absolutely necessary in producing economic growth. During the boom times, both commodities are used at incredible levels to fulfil global economic demands. Australia's economy has enjoyed a decade of strong economic growth due to Asia's insatiable appetite for its natural resources.That era is coming to an abrupt end, quicker than anticipated, especially for Australia.Today, both commodities are now trading at near, or below, $40 per tonne (iron ore), and below $40 per barrel (oil). These collapsing market prices for two primary resources have not been seen in several years.As a result, the profit margins for global mining companies and oil producers, and their profit-seeking investors, have utterly vanished. And, with the global marketplace, once again, standing at the edge staring into another black and foreboding economic abyss, international financial analysts are frantically scrambling to find any good news in any commodity sector.In truth, the commodities markets, and the workers in them, are facing an absolutely brutal near future.Second, the COP21 (the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties) in Paris was an exercise in futility.In short, things are not looking good on the home front for many nations. Point of fact, there is not one world leader who has, or is going to, publicly step forward and sacrifice whatever economic growth is occurring in his/her nation for the sake of reducing carbon emissions.Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, US President Barack Obama, Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister David Cameron, Chinese President Xi Jinping, and the other nearly 150 world leaders who attended the global extravaganza, will never commit political suicide on the world stage for this particular issue. Why?It has been recently discovered that several nations, especially those in the developing world, are either being strategically disingenuous, or are simply lying about their domestic environmental records.For example, Australian scientist Tim Flannery wrote in his new book, Atmosphere of Hope, that China's overall use of coal during the first half of 2014 had actually dropped for the first time in the 21st century. In truth, China has recently admitted that it under-reported its use of coal - substantially.Considering its future energy needs, and its already approved government policies, these factors do not bode well for the global environment.Professor Flannery, like many global environmental and climatic reports which are being produced, based his recent book on faulty statistics provided by the Chinese Government.Professor Flannery has experienced what world economists have confronted for years. It is widely accepted, and assumed, by financial analysts that China's economic numbers have been ""cooked"" for years.China's true growth figures have always been always viewed with an irrefutable degree of scepticism by the West. Why should China's coal figures be viewed any differently?In an article, ""Airpocalypse Now"", published in Newsweek magazine last month, Bill Powell wrote that China's Government seriously understated its annual (2014-2015) use of coal by 17 per cent.The Chinese Government's statistical bureau reported this statistical error last month.Hence, during the prior 12 months, China burned an additional 600 million tonnes of coal. This additional amount represents about 70 per cent of all the coal used in the US in one year.Though China has vowed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by ""around"" 2030, its Government has approved the construction of another 155 coal-fired plants by 2020.Hmmmmm. Does this sound like climatic progress?Of course, not.But, here is another undeniable fact, the Chinese deeply resent the criticism directed toward them from the West, and the developed world, concerning its environmental shortcomings.In fact, as I write this article, Beijing, the nation's capital, has announced a ""smog emergency"". Yet, the leaders of China have called such Western-based attacks on their environmental record as ""environmental imperialism"".So, at the end of the COP21 event, the participants joined in a final group picture, and signed an agreement.But the Global North and the Global South will still be arguing about who should sacrifice the most. The rich nations and the poor will refuse to recognise each others' vital national interests.Now what?Third, and rather ironically, considering what I have written about so far, the US has experienced another mass-shooting.This time 14 individuals were killed during a holiday luncheon at an Environmental Health Services Department in San Bernardino, California.Though most Americans are cognisant of the fact we literally slaughter thousands of each other every year with various weapons, we remained shocked to learn that one or two individuals can literally wipe out a holiday luncheon in California, a classroom of schoolchildren in Connecticut, or unarmed teenagers in South Chicago.Thus, in closing, I want to share with my readers in Tasmania, and, perhaps, even those on the Australian mainland, about a story that I came across this week that was truly disturbing and more than a bit unnerving - even by American standards.The article was published in Z Magazine, written by Eric Rodriguez, a Trustee Emeritus of Brown University and a Term Member at the Council on Foreign Relations.Rodriguez decided to call on a longtime friend in the old neighbourhood that he grew up in Los Angeles, California.He asked his old friend about getting a ""piece."" The former Ivy League Trustee explained that he wanted to show US politicians how simple it is to buy an assault weapon in America.Rodriguez asked his friend how long would it take to get a AK-47 or an AR-15? Though Rodriguez's friend was somewhat taken aback by this unexpected request, nevertheless, he told the former professor that he needed to make a few phone calls.Incredibly, the answer to Rodriguez's initial question was two hours. Rodriguez did not want to buy the guns, he just wanted to know their availability, and accessibility, on the black market.Rodriguez got his answer.So the next time you hear about another slaughter in America remember Eric Rodriguez's spontaneous experiment.In truth, I cannot provide a better example, or story, that explains the incomprehensible insanity that continues to exist and haunt US society in the 21st century.Based in the US, Dr Randall Doyle will be teaching at Northeastern University in Shenyang, China, in 2016. A regular visitor to Tasmania, he is researching a book on Australia's new geopolitical importance in the 21st century.\l"

Think about what steps they can take to reduce their risk, if we do see more physical damage [to the planet],"" Ms Ambachtsheer said.The Mercer executive said institutional investors were increasingly using tools relied on by the insurance sector, such as plotting their real assets on a world map.""We are looking at investors with exposure to real assets, infrastructure, timber, agriculture, real estate, actually putting their assets on a map of the world and analysing their vulnerability and exposure to things like a rise in sea water.""Mercer's report, Investing in a Time of Climate Change, examined rises of 2, 3 or 4 degrees in temperature above pre-industrial global temperatures by 2050.It found energy and utilities were most impacted with average annual returns in the coal sub-sector falling by between 18 and 74 per cent over the next 35 years.""We expect, UK, Australian and Canadian equities to be more sensitive to climate risk, given the higher exposure of these regional equity markets to carbon-intensive sectors,"" the report said.""Australian equities [will be] more sensitive to a climate change policy shock, given the greater level of policy uncertainty in this market and the historical lack of support from the Australian government.""Ms Ambachtsheer said while there were big risks there were also enormous opportunities such as a projected increase in returns for renewables of between 6 to 54 per cent, even for passive investors. ""On the passive side there are also a number of low-carbon indices which track a broad market index with a significantly reduced carbon footprint.""\l"
"COP21","Australia","COP21_Australia315","No Headline In Original","December 18, 2015","Central Western Daily","ON the last day of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (called COP21Getting this many countries to agree was in itself a huge achievement, given their different industries, socioeconomic levels and cultural influences.The attempt to reach an agreement for countries to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions has been going on since COP1 in 1995, 20 years ago. The world had come near to agreement on several occasions before; COP3 in 1997 gave rise to the Kyoto Protocol, which Australia signed in 1998 but did not ratify until 2007. As early as 1990, the Australian federal government under Bob Hawke estimated a greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of 20 per cent below 1990 levels by 2005. In the United Kingdom, Margaret Thatcher was stating the same intention and targets at the same time. The United Nations has been talking about the dangers of warming our planet with greenhouse gases since 1988 and scientists for years earlier.These words were printed in the Sydney Morning Herald in mid-1998: 'Scientists have warned about the 'greenhouse effect' for years. Now it is no longer a scientific nightmare; it has arrived.' Things were looking good at this point. Governments were knowledgeable on the issue, the media was reporting the facts, scientists were being heard and targets were being discussed. So what happened? Since 1990, the science hasn't become any less clear on climate change. The UN, through its International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, has consistently forecast the same impacts from a warming planet, only with more certainty. The predicted increase in ferocity of bushfires, floods, droughts, heatwaves, hurricanes, typhoons and other events have all come to pass.Yet since 1990, annual global greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels has gone up 60 per cent and, all the while, consecutive attempts to get countries to agree on clear targets have failed. At the same time, media coverage has become less clear as fossil fuel industries have exerted their influence in both media coverage and on government policy.Why then, has the Paris COP21 conference managed to commit all countries to keeping warming well below 2 degrees, with the ultimate goal of staying below 1.5 degrees and to being continually monitored as to their success in ramping up their reduction targets?Perhaps the incredible scale of the plight of Syrian refugees gave the world an idea of what the predicted 50 million climate refugees by 2050 would look like (some say it will be as high as 200 million at today's emissions rates).Perhaps the 785,000 people in 175 countries hitting the streets for People's Climate March events managed to create enough pressure to counter that of the fossil fuel lobby.Whatever the reason, we can celebrate today but now the real effort starts. The pledged emissions reductions of all countries at COP21 deliver half of what is needed to keep warming below 1.5 degrees. To get there, most fossil fuels will need to remain in the ground and countries will need to rapidly transition to renewable energy sources.Load-Date:\~December 21, 2015\l"

Their tenants' tablets and mobile devices are slashing power usage too.A city-led program covering 92 commercial buildings has already met half of the emissions reduction target that it set as its 2030 goal, lord mayor Clover Moore said.Under the Better Buildings Partnership (BBP), modelled on a British program, the buildings that make up just over half the CBD's commercial office space have pledged to cut their carbon dioxide emissions 70 per cent from the 2006 level of 318,079 tonnes.Office towers in the partnership, which include 255 George St, One Shelley St, One Bligh St and One Darling Island Road in Pyrmont, had by the end of June cut their collective emissions 45 per cent. That was an increase of 10 percentage points on the 35 per cent reduction achieved by June last year and equated to a combined saving of $30 million a year, Ms Moore said.""Sydney's biggest landlords have shown it makes financial sense to cut emissions,"" said Ms Moore, attending the Paris Climate Change conference. ""The Better Buildings Partnership's ongoing success is a model for how much progress can be made when government and the private sector work together on sensible, effective climate policies.""Buildings account for about 77 per cent of emissions by the City of Sydney, which itself makes up about 3 per cent of total NSW emissions.For the first time, however, the emissions cut includes the reductions that have come from sourcing green power or other carbon offsets. Between three and four percentage points of the total resulted from these measures rather than the direct improvement of the buildings' emission performances, said Paul Edwards, BBP chairman and head of sustainability for developer Mirvac.""It is a recognition that to get to a 70 per cent reduction in the future, there may be a need for us to include green power and carbon offsets, so we stated that from a transparency perspective,"" Mr Edwards said.In 2004, when Lendlease's groundbreaking sustainable 30 The Bond building was built, the replacement of desktop cathode-ray tube computer screens with flat screens was cutting the average ""small power"" consumption of office tenants to 22 watts a square metre, according to Che Wall, the sustainability engineer who consulted on the building and a co-founder of the Green Building Council of Australia.Since then, the replacement of PCs by laptops and increasingly to iPads and smartphones has cut that figure to 12 watts a square metre, Mr Wall said on Wednesday.""That's almost half of what The Bond was in just 10 years,"" he said.Mr Edwards said the BBP's emission cuts and lower power usage didn't include tenants' plug-in power consumption, but it indirectly benefited through measures like reduced airconditioning.\l"

The action plans for reducing emissions, required by all governments, will be accepted and reviewed, and discussion will then move to what comes next.The Paris talks will not agree to any mandated action, rather endorsing what will be a range of targets and plans - such as a floating trading scheme or one with a set floor price, as well as mixed measures of regulation and incentives.Australia's direct action plan - which Turnbull dismissed as useless when it was announced by Tony Abbott but now has to live with as a price of getting the top job - sits at the ""lower-action, greater-expense"" end of the spectrum of policies, even though it has had one successful round of implementation and looks like having a second.Paris might dissolve in disarray and argument because of the great dilemma at the centre of climate policy.The push for action - and most of the progress that's being achieved - comes from the rich, developed nations who have prospered after 150 years, benefiting from everything that flowed from the invention of the steam and internal-combustion engines.Developing nations want some concessions in drawing up emissions-reduction plans, and there's an argument about how to establish and spend the planned $US100 billion-a-year ($138.43 billion) fund to help poorer countries adopt new policies and adapt to a hotter world.In its pre-Paris edition, The Economist said the best way to design and implement climate action is to have both ambition and realism - accepting the rigid ideas that caused Copenhagen to fail aren't going to cut it now, and there is a need for significant investment in new technologies and processes, clearer thinking on adaption (living with higher temperatures) and short-term responses such as artificial cooling.""In short: thinking caps should replace hair shirts, and pragmatism should replace green theology,"" says The Economist.Dennis Atkins is The Courier-Mail's national affairs mailto:editor.dennis.atkins@news.com.aueditor.dennis.atkins@news.com.au\l"
"COP21","Australia","COP21_Australia320","An International treasure","May 14, 2016 Saturday","Northern Territory News (Australia)","I had to ask David Attenborough how he felt about the title of 'national treasure' - actually it should be international treasure - with which he is habitually labelled.""What does 'national treasure' mean?"" he replies, with a twinkle in his eye. ""Nothing, except that people are favourably disposed towards you. You're not being elected. You haven't got the power to become prime minister. The problem is that you are credited with more wisdom and apprehension than is the case - which is quite easy actually. People think you know everything, but of course you don't!""It's a TV image and a very one-dimensional image at that. You certainly don't get more money for being a national treasure. There is no national treasure premium."" A pause, before he bursts into infectious laughter. ""It's a national scandal."" They say you should never meet your heroes, but I'm delighted to have met this one. In person, Attenborough is exactly the way you'd hope he would be: charismatic, compelling and charming.Eruptions of jollity such as the one above punctuate our hour together. At one point, he reflects on the fact that both he and the Queen are 90 this year. ""Have we exchanged notes about geriatric moments? No."" Attenborough is rare in the world of television in that he actually seems interested in what other people are saying. He leans forward and listens, intently yet politely, to your thoughts. He is as much a receiver as a transmitter, and that is what makes him such a superb communicator.As Attenborough reaches this great age, he is clearly still fired up by the same tremendous curiosity that has powered his career for the last seven decades. He possesses a contagious lust for life that shames people 40 years younger.Attenborough is reckoned to have travelled further than any other human being - apart from astronauts - and yet his trademark passion shows no sign of waning.What is most appealing is that even after such a stellar career, he does not take anything for granted. He continues to be commendably modest and grateful for all the opportunities he is offered.Attenborough observes that: ""I can think of an awful lot of my own contemporaries who got into jobs where, after 10 or 20 years, they were thinking, 'I've had enough of this'. But they're stuck with it because it's what their career is and they have a pension. They're counting the years off until they get to 65, and then they do nothing but play golf."" By contrast, he continues, ""I'm fantastically lucky. I think, 'Oh, I'll go to the Amazon next year - why not?' I'm more grateful than I can say that people still want me to do things."" Some 62 years after presenting his first natural history program, Zoo Quest, Attenborough's documentaries continue to inspire successive generations.That is because he has never lost his magnetic sense of wonder about the natural world. ""Experience has taught me how amazingly big and unpredictable the natural world is. When you're young, you think you know it all about the natural world - 'Yawn, yawn, everyone knows about that'.""But in fact we only know a tiny proportion about the complexity of the natural world. ""Wherever you look, there are still things we don't know about and don't understand, as recent discoveries about, say, the behaviours of pufferfish and peacock spiders prove. There are always new things to find out if you go looking for them. They will last me out."" The presenter responsible for nine seasons of the landmark Life series still believes in the power of television to educate, inform and entertain.""Our job as natural history filmmakers is to show that the natural world is unbelievably amazing. The world is unimaginably varied - quite beyond our comprehension.""But the paradox is that according to the UN over half of the human race is now urbanised. We're out of touch with nature in a way that my great great grandfather, who was working in the fields, never was. And yet now the population know more about animals and how varied they are and why they do what they do than my great great grandfather ever did.""That is something natural history TV programs can claim credit for. If you can show the natural world on television, people will be fascinated by it."" He adds that, ""These programs have changed people's minds. There is now a bigger sympathy for the natural world among city-dwellers than there ever was. Our comprehension of the animal kingdom has changed beyond recognition. Now taxi drivers talk to you about biological concepts. 'What's all this about altruism, David? Don't you think that it will affect evolution'?"" Attenborough is also very engaged with environmental issues, making an impassioned and influential speech at the UN conference on climate change in Paris last year.""It's never been more important. We are completely dependent on the natural world and yet we are wrecking it and endangering ourselves. If we are going to care for it, people have to change their behaviour, and to do that they have to know about what goes on in the natural world. That's one of the things TV can do.""I certainly embrace conservation causes. You have to be very, very dogmatic and have a closed mind not to see the overwhelming evidence about climate change. It would be amazing if we hadn't had an effect on the climate. The time comes when you have to look at the evidence and make a stand."" Attenborough has long since passed the age when most of us would be reaching for the pipe and slippers. However, as he prepares to make more documentaries, including Planet Earth 2, he shudders at the very word 'retirement'.""You never tire of the natural world. Putting your feet up is all very well..."" casting me one last smile, Attenborough concludes: ""but it's very boring, isn't it?""\l"

Australia is expected to announce its post-2020 targets for emissions reductions in the next few weeks, amid little international confidence it will commit to ambitious cuts. But Mr Lecourtier said France would ""spare no effort"" to drum up support for an international commitment at the Paris talks to limit the increase in global temperatures to less than 2 degrees compared to pre-industrial levels.""We urgently need to gain more political momentum in the coming weeks,"" he said.""This has to come from political leaders all over the world, at the highest possible level. But also by involving, as it is the case today, every stakeholder that shares the view that our generation must act in a fully responsible way before the bell tolls."" Already too lateScientist, conservationist and former Australian of the year Tim Flannery, who is also speaking at the forum in Sydney, said he believed it was already too late to avoid an average temperature increase of 2 degrees within the next two or three decades. Such warming would cause severe harm to the Great Barrier Reef, the Kakadu wetlands and to southern alpine environments, as well as having extensive impacts on agriculture and water availability.Professor Flannery said one of Australia's key problems was its reluctance to tackle the use of fossil fuel. He called for recognition that biological sequestration of carbon and carbon capture and storage would be useless without measures to reduce the burning of coal.The potential Paris alliance targeted in December by the French government would incorporate national contributions on emissions reductions by all 196 countries and a financial commitment to provide $US100 billion ($128 billion) to developing countries by 2020 to boost investment in carbon-free technology, Mr Lecourtier said. After the recent G7 commitment to reach carbon-neutral fossil fuel use by the end of the century, the next step would be at the United Nations level, with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and French President Francois Hollande to hold a meeting of leaders on September 27-28 in New York, Mr Lecourtier said.France was considering inviting heads of state for the first day of the COP21 climate talks in Paris ""to give as much political momentum as possible to the conference"", he said.Mr Abbott will be in the region for the G20 and for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Malta in late November but it is not known if he intends to attend the Paris climate talks.\l"

This is dangerous. I think that by 2020 we can live without it,"" he told Al Arabiya television. It is an extraordinary claim for a government that has historically relied on oil exports for 90 per cent of its income and has yet to achieve much success in building alternative industries. Gulf veterans say his words should be understood as poetic licence.Prince Mohammad, a 31 year-old tornado determined to smash the status quo, has amassed immense power over the economy and defence that belies his title as deputy crown prince, filling the cabinet with modern technocrats and startling his sinecure cousins from the Al Saud family with the unfamiliar prospect of hard work.The plan, known as ""Vision 2030"", aims to slash $80billion of wasteful spending each year and impose some degree of order on the kingdom's chaotic finances with a consumption tax and fresh levies. The reform blueprint is inspired by a McKinsey study - Beyond Oil - that laid out how the country can double GDP over the next 15 years and reinvent itself with $4 trillion of investment across eight industries - electrical manufacturing, cars, healthcare, metals, steel, aluminium smelting, solar power and tourism.""I don't think they can pull this off,"" said Patrick Dennis from Oxford Economics. ""The riyal peg is grossly overvalued and that makes it even harder. We think market pressures will become overwhelming if there is little evidence of real reform by 2018.""Under the plan, Riyadh will sell up to 5 per cent of the state oil giant Aramco to global investors, and convert the secretive behemoth into a modern holding company with transparent accounts. The aim is to transfer the proceeds into the country's sovereign wealth fund, using the money to diversify into global investments. It is unclear how this Saudi fund can plausibly reach $3 trillion unless oil rises back above $100 a barrel, and stays there for a long time. The country is currently depleting its foreign exchange reserves by $10bn a month to cover a budget deficit still near 15pc of GDP, drawing down its overseas wealth to fund its military build-up, a war in Yemen, life-support for Egypt and paying state salaries.The Saudis may have left it too late already to break oil dependency in time, especially as renewable technology reaches parity and the COP21 climate accords signal a move to worldwide carbon pricing..The parlous state of Saudi finances was made clear in a Bloomberg interview when the prince's economic guru, Mohammed al-Sheikh, said the country would have gone ""completely broke"" by early 2017 without drastic austerity measures.This was screened from the world last year.

How to get away with (political) murder. It was either a historic agreement or a massive failure: making sense of COP 21. One of the biggest myths about coal debunked. Andrew Bolt's unusual replacement. The Lake Solution, and other bizarre findings from the Hazelwood mine fire inquiry. And the nominees are ... voting is now open in the 2015 Crikey awards.In retrospect, the decision by the Turnbull government to issue a normal Mid Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook rather than use the opportunity of a political reset and a new Treasurer to undertake a mini-budget looks increasingly flawed.Tomorrow's MYEFO will show a significant revenue write-down from lower iron ore prices, lower wages growth and lower economic growth projections. Even putting aside Scott Morrison's weird fiscal denialism in his repeated assertions that Australia ""doesn't have a revenue problem"", there is also the challenge of spending. Morrison has made much of the need to get spending from 26.2% of GDP, the level it reached under Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey, back to the budget forecast for this year of 25.9%.Hockey took a deliberate decision to continue to pump tens of billions of deficit spending into the economy in the 2014-15 and 2015-16 budgets, and was correct to do so given the tepid economy and unemployment above 6%. But 25.3% of GDP - where spending will still be at in 2018-19 - is too high given an improving economy.Morrison should be aiming for something closer to the 24.1% of GDP Wayne Swan managed in 2012-13. Regardless of how the tax reform debate plays out and whether Morrison ever snaps out of his ""there's no revenue problem"" delusion, the path to surplus lies in a more rapid reduction in spending than the current lazy plan put forward by the government. And the first step on that path should have been tomorrow's MYEFO.\l"

Industrial countries would also ""endeavour to limit"" temperatures even further, to 1.5C, in a key demand of small island nations and other poor and vulnerable countries.The deal would also mean mobilising a minimum $100 billion a year from 2020 to help the developing world cope with global warming.

Some of the questions posed in the story still seem very familiar. How much of the changes to the climate are due to natural variation and how much are to do with human activities?In 1992, an international treaty was drawn up with the goal to stabilise atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations at a level that would prevent dangerous effects on the world's climate systems. The 196 parties who signed it have since met regularly to assess progress. The 2015 Conference of the Parties (COP 21) in Paris will run from November 30 to December 11.The goal now is not to prevent global warming, but to limit it to less than 2 degrees Celsius.

They have 20 operational reactors now and there's probably another 25 or so that are under construction or planned.""Also Indonesia, Vietnam, South Korea, all of these sort of countries have nuclear reactors planned.""Nuclear energy not a focus of Paris climate talksProfessor Greig said it was surprising that nuclear energy did not receive much attention or subsequent media coverage at he recent climate talks in Paris (COP21).""I mean, it's very low carbon, near zero, just as the renewable energy sources are.""And it is a base load, always available, electricity source, so in that sense you would think there was a lot of merit in it being a serious option.""Base load power is defined as the minimum amount of electricity delivered, or required, over a period at a constant rate into a power grid.Traditionally fossil fuel sources like coal, gas, hydropower and nuclear power have been considered as the only way to provide base load power at affordable prices.Base load power has been considered necessary to provide energy, even in systems that have renewable energy sources, to ride out the intermittent peaks and troughs created by lack of wind and sunshine.However, that is being contested by some in the renewable energy sector, who believe renewables can provide base load power, HYPERLINK as argued using a computer modelRetired US scientist Dr David Mills has produced a paper saying base load energy is ' HYPERLINK http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2010/12/02/3081889.htmno longer a relevant prerequisite for modern power generating systems' but can be achieved with a mix of renewables and fuels like nuclear and gas.Rise of battery power for renewable energy storageIn recent times, batteries for storage of renewable energy have been developed, such as those by Tesla, which generated much talk at COP21 of developing countries ""leapfrogging"" directly to renewable power sources.Professor Greig supports the use of batteries in certain circumstances and for specific requirements.However, he does not believe battery storage technology has been developed enough, or is affordable enough, for developing countries to dismiss fossil fuels.""I think [the ability of] battery storage is a little overhyped, although it certainly has a role to play,"" Professor Greig said.""I think it will be a strong niche in the residential sector, and perhaps the commercial sector, but it's not going to be a player in large scale industrial requirements and grid scale storage.""Battery storage is still very expensive, and it's all very well for us to chart a theoretical pathway to a lower carbon future and say 'there you go, we've got an answer', but we haven't delivered that.""At Paris, we heard of grand plans and talk of [non-mandatory] targets that were set, but I don't think we heard a lot about any kind of mechanism or implementation plans to get us to the emissions reduction that we spoken of.""The 'how to' bit is still to come and in the meantime, developing countries will move ahead with developing their energy needs, some of which will be met by nuclear.""China and India planning significant renewable energy programsSome of the discussions at the climate conference were about plans by China and India to develop significant renewable energy programs.However Professor Greig said these announcements and what they really meant needed to be recognised.""Let's be clear, the targets that are being set for China and India are not about reducing emissions,"" he said.""They're about peaking their emissions by 2030, or in a similar time frame.""There's a big difference between emissions continuing to rise until 2030, compared to commitment by developed countries to reduce their emissions.""But as a percentage of China's renewable energy program, it is similar or smaller than their renewable energy sources [hydro, wind, solar].""The final outcome will depend on the true reduction of their emissions post-2030.""Costs of developing nuclear power plantsThere is no denying nuclear power plants are expensive to build and a number of projects have suffered significant cost blowouts.But Professor Greig compares costs to other forms of energy over the lifetime of power plants, not initial costs.""Yes, the cost of nuclear is very high in initial [construction and commissioning] costs, as is the cost of hydropower in many instances, but the ongoing costs are very low compared to the cost of other fuels,"" he said.""It also depends on the jurisdiction; I think the Chinese seem to be building nuclear in reasonably cost effective terms.""So I don't think it's fair to say it's going to be more costly although certainly, some projects in the US and Europe have blown out.""But we have to question the issues as to why. A lot of [cost blow outs] are decisions by governments and even delays caused by public reaction and environmental activism.""Australia's role in nuclear futureAustralia has around 40 per cent of the world's known nuclear reserves and with restrictions being lifted in states like Queensland, that will possibly grow.It seems like the next mine to go ahead, if any do, will be in Western Australia.The current spot price is $US34 per pound ($AU46.70)Professor Greig said Australian producers may benefit with the growth of nuclear energy, but as with everything it would be dictated by the market.""Potentially, it could increase but a lot of it depends on what the uptake of nuclear at a global scale really is,"" he said.""And I think that depends on how the challenge of decarbonisation is met.""I think at the moment there's a strong view by some that renewables can dominate this, but I'm a little sceptical there.""If we want to get real about decarbonisation, we are going to need some base load decarbonisation options, like nuclear.""And therefore, in decades to come, I expect the demand for nuclear power to increase, and therefore the potential for uranium markets to increase.""\l"

They want to know where they stand. ""You're getting a sense of inevitability that this is the path, and now the question is how are we going to get on with it,"" says AGL Energy chief executive Andy Vesey, who will join business leaders flocking to Paris-Le Bourget.It is certainly not a Damascus conversion: the statements many chief executives have put their names to are meticulously worded and come with plenty of caveats from companies on the side on the realities of the energy mix, and of continuing reliance on fossil fuels.Green groups say they do not go nearly far enough and question whether some of the commitments constitute much more than ""greenwashing"".But an open acceptance of the necessity to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels and of action to support that has been signed by Vesey, as well as his peers at fossil fuel producers BHP Billiton, Santos and others. Such a public recognition would have been inconceivable for some of those involved several years ago.""Early global agreement on the steps to achieve this goal will allow for a responsible transition to decarbonised and sustainable economic development,"" the CEOs say in the September declaration. An open letter published last week by the CEOs of 78 companies with operations in 150 countries gave an idea of the breadth and depth of the business push on climate.The letter, signed by the heads of companies as diverse as Indian steel producers, confectioners Nestle and engineering giant Siemens, called for ""bold action"" at Paris ""to secure a more prosperous world for us all"".Rhetoric changes Photo: Brendan EspositoThe rhetoric from business is quite different this time compared with the run-up to the failed Copenhagen climate talks in 2009, says Emma Herd of the Investor Group on Climate Change, which represents institutional investors with more than $1 trillion of funds.Herd says the investor action of past years has helped galvanise business, which now has a much more sophisticated understanding of the issues, the carbon risks and how they should be positioning themselves in response.""There's much more understanding and consensus around the need for long-term commitment, but also that has to translate to more-regular and transparent review processes. Rather than having this all-or-nothing, do-or-die international agreement, the process is much more important.""The investments potentially at risk are huge. Limiting global warming to 2 degrees, a level widely seen as avoiding the worst of the impacts from climate change and a key goal for some at the Paris talks, means no new coal mines will be needed, oil demand will peak near the end of the decade, and growth in gas demand will disappoint, according to respected British-based firm Carbon Tracker.It calculates that fossil fuel producers risk wasting up to $US2.2 trillion on uneconomic projects during the next 10 years that would be ""stranded"" under a 2-degrees deal, including $US103 billion in Australia.This week federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt recognised the need to achieve net zero emissions ""over the course of the century"", while Opposition Leader Bill Shorten went further, saying a Labor government would target net zero emissions by 2050.The investments potentially at risk are huge. Photo: Getty ImagesLabor would target a 45 per cent cut from 2005 levels by 2030, a bigger reduction than the 26-28 per cent target that Australia is taking to Paris, but falling short of the 58 per cent backed by the Investor Group on Climate Change. To achieve ""net zero emissions"" every tonne of carbon pollution produced would need to be balanced by sequestration or carbon offsets, so effectively stabilising atmospheric concentrations of CO???. To lower concentrations, further would be required - moving to ""net negative"".""There is a new dynamic afoot here and there is a new number that matters - zero,"" Connor says.""People are now beginning to work out how their business engines can drive under a zero-carbon economy.""The notable change in past months is how the traditional early movers in climate, insurance and finance companies, are being joined by energy majors and some miners.AGL, the country's biggest carbon polluter from its huge coal-fired generators in Victoria and NSW, and Origin were among those that headed off shareholder AGM resolutions on climate change by pre-emptively announcing commitments on emissions reductions and reporting.BHP Billiton in September became the first big miner to release analysis on the impact to its business from international moves to limit temperature gains, and revealed for the first time the assumptions on carbon prices it uses to test every project investment.Origin has voiced support for Australia's coal-heavy electricity sector to become ""carbon neutral"" by 2050 and has signalled it would close down its Eraring coal-fired generation in NSW by 2030. Origin last month became the first energy company to sign up to all seven of the We Mean Business Coalition climate initiatives, joining international companies such as Air France-KLM and IKEA. AGL has adopted some of the commitments.Others are standing further back and emphasising the realities of energy supply and demand, with coal producers particularly on the back foot. Pure-play coal producer Whitehaven Coal wouldn't comment for this article but its website accurately points to forecasts from the International Energy Agency this month that coal will still account for 30 per cent of global electricity output by 2040.Whitehaven managing director Paul Flynn has pointed to the less-polluting qualities of Whitehaven coal, and some other Australian coals.Rio Tinto head of coal and copper Jean-Sebastien Jacques appeared dismissive of coal's contribution to the climate problem, telling a Sydney audience this week that despite the ""PR challenge"" faced by the fuel, it ""will be part of the global energy solution for years to come"".At the same time, however, the resources giant has done away with the energy division that held its coal business, and has been selling mines in Australia.""We fully acknowledge there is a climate change issue and we believe we need to be part of the solution,"" Jacques said on Thursday.Oil-and-gas play Woodside Petroleum maintains its support for a greenhouse gas regulatory regime that allows Australia to meet its international climate change commitments but goes no further.Chief executive Peter Coleman used a global energy summit in Paris in June to extol the greenhouse benefits of gas compared with coal.It is these tensions among fossil fuel producers that give a local slant to the international coal-versus-gas debate that has taken hold in Europe and North America this year. Coal is ""still the cheapest way of bringing people out of poverty"" and is ""not going to be wished away"", said Glencore's coal chief Peter Freyberg.Momentum buildsThe airl"

The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and the UN Paris climate summit, , will take place from next weekend.The East Asia Summit is the first to have regional security at its core even though the nominally economic summits, the G20 in Turkey, and APEC in the Philippines, became overwhelmed by the tragic killings in Paris a week ago, and the bloody aftermath.Those events, and Friday's attack in Mali, west Africa, have made authorities especially nervous in managing events with such senior gatherings of world leaders.With the relatively recent inclusion of both the US and Russia, and membership including China, Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam, the EAS brings these big and small powers together on strategic matters.High on the agenda this year is the ongoing and potentially worsening stand-off between the world's emergent strategic and economic superpower, China, and numerous member states over Beijing's territorial expansion in the South and East China Seas.Mr Turnbull was due to meet with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang??? on Saturday evening - the second bilateral discussion with the Middle Kingdom after a one-on-one with President Xi Jinping??? last week. Mr Turnbull is expected to reiterate his message that China's rise must not only be peaceful, but must be seen by its neighbours to be peaceful.In September, such comments had incurred the wrath of Beijing, with a foreign ministry spokesman stating: ""We hope that Australia will stay committed to not taking sides on issues concerning disputes over sovereignty.""With an asylum-seeker vessel making it almost to Christmas Island on Friday, there are fears the resolve of the Turnbull government, which has stuck by Tony Abbott's policies but toned down the bellicose rhetoric, could be tested by people smugglers.US President Barack Obama is among the attendees and expects that the meeting will focus heavily on the Chinese territorial claim to the Spratly archipelago in which it has constructed a number of artificial islands.The White House has also made clear via a fact sheet released just days ahead of the meeting, that it expects its strong allies in the region to support such actions - although Mr Obama stopped short of specifically requesting either Tokyo or Canberra to send ships into the Chinese claim.""We are increasing the maritime security capacity of our allies and partners, to respond to threats in waters off their coasts and to provide maritime security more broadly across the region,"" the fact sheet stated before listing several ways in which this would be achieved including gifting warships to the Philippines and: ""Coordinating with our strong allies Japan and Australia on maritime security assistance to align and synchronise regional security and law enforcement assistance programs for maximum effect"".\l"

Implementing the pledges would dramatically uncouple power-sector CO2 emissions from electricity demand, with emissions staying broadly flat, out to 2030, despite electricity demand rising by more than 40 per cent, ""We estimate that all countries' INDCs will have a substantial impact on the growth in coal, more than other fossil fuels, in particular gas,"" Mr Sadamori told Drilling Down. ""We consider that in the next medium-term coal market report we would expect slower coal demand growth than the one last year.""Last year's version of the report, published in December, forecast 2.1 per cent a year demand growth for coal for the following five years to pass 9 billion tonnes by 2019.

Photo: MAGGIE MILES Climate activists descend on Paris to fly in face of bans By Larissa Dubecki Hundreds of thousands of climate activists descending on Paris ahead of the UN Climate Conference are preparing to defy a ban on street protests in the wake of the recent terror attacks.The carnival-esque combination of street acts and political activists that has accompanied previous global climate summits, including Copenhagen in 2009, is threatened by a state of emergency declared in the wake of the November 13 attacks that killed 130 people.Environmental activists had hoped for more than 200,000 people to take to the streets of Paris for the People's Climate March on Sunday. But the government of Francois Hollande last week issued a ban on protests, marches and other ""outdoor activities"" during the 12-day summit, which will be attended by 40,000 official delegates.Demonstrations in closed spaces or in places where security can be ensured can proceed, the government said.Activists are split on the ban, with some, including Greenpeace, believing it will simply shift emphasis to thousands of planned protests across the globe, including in Melbourne on Friday and Sydney on Sunday.""We respect the French government's decision to ban the Paris march,"" said Greenpeace Australia spokesman Ben Solity. ""We believe it will be the largest mobilisation in Australia's history.""But others have accused the French government of using the terrorist attacks as an excuse to crack down on lawful protest.""It's telling that they aren't banning football matches or night markets,"" said ClimActs co-founder Deborah Hart, in Paris with their performance art group Climate Guardian Angels.""I respect that they must take measures to ensure the safety of their citizens and visitors, but I believe they are cynically taking advantage of these horrific terrorist attacks to silence community voices during COP21 [the Paris Climate Conference].""ClimActs and other activist groups are planning ways to get around the ban.""Fortunately our modus operandi of highlighting environmental catastrophe through performance art in uniquely effective under crackdown conditions. What could possibly be threatening about a group of women in angel costumes?""said Hart, the author of the recently released Guarding Eden.Hart noted that federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt will be in Paris.""Without giving too much away, the Angels are very good at drawing attention to particular politicians,"" she said.Samantha Castro, Friends of the Earth operations co-ordinator and co-founder of the Wikileaks Australian Citizens Alliance, said she expects the ban to be ineffectual.""The global community is descending on Paris. I can't imagine going all that way and people not being on the streets. I do believe that by the end of the conference the French police won't be able to contain them,"" she said.The question remains whether the ban could affect the outcome of the talks, widely seen as the world's last chance to cap greenhouse gas emissions to contain global warming below the two-degree threshold scientists warn will lead to catastrophic global warming.The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has urged Australians in Paris to avoid public spaces and exercise a high degree of caution.The Angels and many of their activist friends remain undeterred.""I have no doubt some of us will go in hard, especially towards the end of the conference.

"COP21","Australia","COP21_Australia348","Paris climate talks must embrace India to succeed","December 12, 2015 Saturday","The Australian","Developing nations must be part of any global accordIn the politics of climate change, we often see gestures triumph over policy. Countries and individuals are often more interested in being seen to do the right thing rather than taking the most effective action. So, conscious of the massive carbon footprint generated by the 40,000 people descending on Paris for the COP21 climate talks, organisers have conjured offsets so they can claim the event is carbon neutral. Such deals are more about public relations than environmental outcomes - what really matters are the commitments offered by participating nations and the agreement they reach. And - as has become standard for such talks - the haggling and posturing is keeping the outcome uncertain until the final hours.Despite years of preparation and a fortnight of intense diplomacy, the much anticipated Paris talks have reached their endgame with the core aims still to be realised. It is most likely that a deal will be struck soon but it must be judged on the extent to which it succeeds in bringing the major emitters of greenhouse gases into a single tent. It has always been the case that without substantial buy-in from the US, China and India - as well as the EU - any climate agreement will be largely window-dressing. Yet despite much positive spin in the lead-up about how China, in particular, was committed to action, the reality of negotiations has been somewhat more challenging.Three issues have emerged as stumbling blocks: Who will contribute to and manage a $100 billion a year climate fund from 2020? How will the voluntary pledges from all countries to take action on emissions be measured and verified? And how will the responsibility to act extend to all countries, not just the developed world?The issue of differentiation, which has separated the world on the basis of past actions and economic status, is laden with philosophical and strategic importance for many developing nations, not least India. Without an agreement that provides a clear pathway to bring everyone into a shared plan of action, Paris will have been a failure. This is because without co-operation and openness from developing nations the task is simply not achievable. US Secretary of State John Kerry has outl"

Developed nations and Island states vulnerable to climate change has pushed for strict reviews of the pledges which are aimed at encouraging countries to be accountable and progressively lower their emission reduction targets. However, some developing nations such as India - which argue fossil fuels are essential to economic growth and the provision of electricity in poorer areas - are resisting strict reviews or asking for the start date to be pushed back.

Implementing the pledges would dramatically uncouple power-sector CO2 emissions from electricity demand, with emissions staying broadly flat, out to 2030, despite electricity demand rising by more than 40 per cent.""We estimate that all countries' INDCs will have a substantial impact on the growth in coal, more than other fossil fuels, in particular gas,"" Mr Sadamori told Drilling Down. ""We consider that in the next medium-term coal market report we would expect slower coal demand growth than the one last year.""Last year's version of the report, published in December, forecast 2.1 per cent a year demand growth for coal for the following five years to pass 9 billion tonnes by 2019. That was down from 2013's forecast for 2.3 per cent annual growth for the following five years and the actual growth of 3.3 per cent each year between 2010 and 2013.But Mr Sadamori's words signal the IEA is expecting the deceleration in growth to pick up, as long as the estimated $US13.5 trillion in investment in energy efficiency and low-carbon technologies required to implement the pledges is indeed forthcoming.

Negotiators are meeting behind closed doors, businesses are spruiking their wares, and NGOs are rushing from meeting to meeting, pushing governments to do more. It is a gushing torrent of ideas, advocacy and activity.Foreign Minister Julie Bishop arrived in Paris on the weekend and hit the ground running. She delivered Australia's ministerial statement to the rest of the world around lunchtime Monday. Her speech largely reiterated past statements by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and committed to funding programs to help women engage in climate change decision-making (go to any energy policy conference in Australia and you will see why this is needed - they are all-male affairs). She reiterated that the ""new agreement must promote further ambition and action over time"".Building further action through time is one of the core ingredients for the outcome in Paris. Past climate agreements have not established a system for political leaders to regularly stand up among their peers to commit to do more. We saw the start of this process in advance of Paris when countries representing over 95% of global emissions put forward new emissions reduction targets. If implemented, we will be on a path for just under 3 degrees of global warming - better than the path of 4-6 degrees we were on before the Paris process.From COP21In this regard, two things here are different from past summits.First, the desire from most countries to deliver a durable agreement that can stand the test of time. Investors, communities and the climate can't afford the time it will take for the global community to negotiate a brand-spanking new agreement every time they gather. So, future major summits should be more focused on stocktaking global action and finding ways to step it up, not be about reinventing international frameworks and rules every few years.Secondly, never before has there been such recognition from a broad range of countries that warming of 2 degrees is too risky. So we need to consider limiting warming to less than even 1.5 degrees. This goal has created solidarity among many vulnerable countries in the developing world. Developed countries such as the USA, China, Australia and those within the European Union have also been open to recognising this in the agreement.In her speech, Bishop\~re-iterated the messages from the government's innovation statement. But when it comes to climate action that will avoid two, and let alone 1.5 degrees warming, national policies will matter as much as technological innovation. In Australia's energy system, for example, all the best innovations will only be deployed around the edges - unless we have a plan to replace the ageing and inefficient coal-fired power stations that are blocking the modernisation of the power system.As we enter the rapids of the last week of the Paris summit, we are in a position where the key elements exist for an outcome that can build on recent momentum and boost global action. A best possible outcome from the meeting is now possible. It is up to ministers to knuckle down and find the compromises that will deliver a durable agreement that keeps countries coming back to the table with stronger actions.\l"

Photo: AP W ant your country to enter the European Union? Want better access to Indian agricultural markets? Want some extra aid funding? Perhaps a seat on the UN Security Council? Which would you like? How can I help you? Step right in. Welcome to the biggest foreign policy swap meet since Copenhagen in 2009.The Paris climate talks are not just about climate change. Paris isn't full of scientists, engineers or even economists. It's full of trade negotiators and lobbyists, most of whom know little about, and care even less about, what burning fossil fuels is doing to the atmosphere.Anyone who has ever solved a problem or chaired a meeting knows that it doesn't take 40,000 negotiators and ""observers"" to break an impasse or solve a problem.Indeed, a cynic might argue that the creation of a process that requires so many participants was designed to ensure that the market for coal and oil continues to grow each year.In 1992, world leaders first agreed that burning fossil fuels caused climate change, that we needed to burn less fossil fuels, and that rich countries should act first. Fossil fuel consumption and production have risen steadily since.Intriguingly, the same countries that tell us how hard it is to tackle climate change move quickly when it comes to wars and ""real human tragedies"" like the near collapse of the big banks in 2008. When the banks were in trouble, world leaders found time in their diaries to meet, trillions of dollars in their budgets, and trust not just in each other, but in the role of government.It's often said that there are no atheists in a foxhole, well, now we know there are no free marketeers in a banking crisis. There are plenty when it comes to climate change though.One thing is for sure, it did not take 40,000 delegates to rescue the banking system. And not once did the rich countries trying to ""rescue the world economy"" suggest that they couldn't act to save capitalism unless all the poor countries ""pulled their weight"".As the banks fell, and public cash was flying, no one knew ""with certainty"" that anything would work, and no one stopped to ask what the ""fair share"" of effort for Bangladesh would be.In what rich countries saw as a real crisis, no one demanded certainty or equity. They just wanted to avoid catastrophe, so they acted.It is time for those working to prevent dangerous climate change to admit that the vast majority of the world's leaders do not see climate change as a crisis; they see it as an opportunity. An opportunity to do ""real foreign policy"".Even the ones who are prepared to act see it as an opportunity to convert that willingness into some other foreign policy bauble.Why do it quickly and for free when you will get a reward if you drag your feet and look reluctant for long enough?It is wrong to dismiss the COP21 as a talk fest. It is much more than that.The talks about climate change are just the cover story for the real work of 195 countries twisting each other's arms and scratching each other's backs in ways that, by and large, are unrelated to task of shutting down coal mines or building more renewable energy.As in any negotiation, not all players start with the same resources, and not everyone is playing for the same objectives, but in a broad sense there are three broad ways the climate change bargaining chips are being played.The small island states that face submersion in the lifetime of their current inhabitants typically throw all of their chips on the table early.In the most passionate speech I have yet heard at the Paris talks, the Fijian Minister for Emergency Services, a man on the front l"

The growing demand by investors to align their savings with their beliefs. "" An increase in activist groups engaging with the finance sector.

He spoke to Sky News UK.PRINCE CHARLES: There is very good evidence indeed that one of the major reasons for this horror in Syria was a drought that lasted for about five or six years, which meant that huge numbers of people in the end had to leave the land.And increasingly they came into the cities, and this combined to create a very difficult situation.REPORTER: Are you suggesting that there was a link between climate change and conflict and terrorism?PRINCE CHARLES: Absolutely.SIMON LAUDER: That interview was recorded several weeks ago, and has been released ahead of the Paris climate talks - now just a week away. Many climate scientists are cautious about linking individual weather events with climate change, so the suggestion that climate change is responsible for the Syrian crisis is open to debate.But it's not the first time it's been suggested. A paper published in March in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences concluded that climate change exacerbated the country's drought and contributed to Syria's conflict.Professor of global Islamic politics at Deakin University, Greg Barton, says the drought was a contributing factor.GREG BARTON: This is a very sensible position. It's been widely put around over the last year or so that the drought in Syria from 2006 to 2009 which pushed up food prices added significantly to social stresses, and that was one of the precipitating factors in the civil war breaking up.So, actually Prince Charles was entirely sensible.The former chief of the Australian Defence Force, Professor Admiral Chris Barrie, says climate change is a significant and growing national security threat.CHRIS BARRIE: Of course there are a whole range of reasons why that conflict broke out. We simply argue that climate change consequences was one of the impacts, but interestingly enough, even though a major effort was made in 2008 to try and resurrect the problem over food, now the consequences of the civil war are making the situation even worse.SIMON LAUDER: Do you think there is a growing awareness of this link between climate change and its effects and global conflict?CHRIS BARRIE: Somebody like me - I am a member of the Global Military Advisory Council on Climate Change, we've been at this for several years now. To have somebody like the Prince of Wales talk about something elevates that conversation to a much higher level.SIMON LAUDER: And of course since the assaults on Paris earlier this month, there's been intense focus on terrorism. Do you think that will take away from efforts to address climate change?CHRIS BARRIE: People who are going to Paris for COP21 are going to experience a high level of security, and along with that, some nervousness about things that are going on.Whether that will detract, I think, from the negotiations that will take place, both in the public forums and behind closed doors, I doubt that because to be honest I think my read is people are now taking this seriously.They realise that the game is up and the planet and all of us - I mean all of us - have to really start doing something much more drastic in order to try and contain the impacts.SIMON LAUDER: The climate conference opens in Paris on the 30th of November.TIM PALMER: Simon Lauder reporting.\l"

It finds that no new investment in LNG is required by Woodside Petroleum in the next decade, nor by majors Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron and BG Group.""This picture questions whether the gas industry can expand its LNG capacity significantly in the next decade beyond what has already been committed to,"" Carbon Tracker's report said.""Shareholders need to question whether the strategy presentations of the companies add up.""The group's findings are based on expectations of much lower demand for gas than the companies themselves are forecasting, assuming international commitments to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius. It allows for some growth in global gas demand through to 2040 - unlike for coal and oil - but at a rate that enables only the most competitive supply projects to go ahead.Even after 2025, only minimal new investment in LNG supply in Australia is required, Carbon Tracker found, adding that the depressed demand outlook would allow only for projects with a supply cost of less than $US10 per million British thermal units.That rules out Woodside's Browse floating LNG project in Western Australia, its Sunrise project in the Timor Sea and its Kitimat venture in Canada, as well as any expansion of the Queensland coal seam gas ventures by BG Group, Santos or Origin Energy, according to Carbon Tracker's cost curve of new projects. ExxonMobil's Scarborough LNG project off WA also misses the cut, as does an expansion of Chevron's Gorgon venture.In a sobering assessment of growth prospects for Shell after its $US70 billion takeover of BG Group, Carbon Tracker calculates that the combined group has $US58.9 billion of proposed projects for which there is no need through to 2025, rising to $US85 billion in the period through to 2035. It finds that only $US6 billion of Shell-BG projects would be required through to 2035 if gas demand is as low as it is assuming.Carbon Tracker finds that only three major gas companies have projects that require investment in the next 10 years - Italian major Eni, the US terminal developer Cheniere Energy and US oil and gas producer Noble Energy.""Investors should scrutinise the true potential for growth of LNG businesses over the next decade,"" said James Leaton, Carbon Tracker's head of research.""The current oversupply of LNG means there is already a pipel"

While growth of coal slows sharply, it is still seen rising by 0.5 per cent a year through to 2035, driven by India and south-east Asia.Mr Appleby said the Paris accord had caused BP to step up its forecasts for renewable energy use, with the 2035 projection some 14 per cent above last year's. But it sees renewables still only accounting for 9 per cent of primary energy by 2035, much lower than estimates by the International Renewable Energy Agency.Expectations around energy efficiency have also been ramped up, Mr Appleby said.BP's estimates for continued modest growth in coal use, including in China, have also alarmed environmental groups, some of which argue Chinese demand already peaked in 2013.Although it has slashed the growth rate, BP's base case still sees China's coal demand expanding by 0.2 per cent annually through 2035, down from more than 8 per cent in 2000-14.

""The Premier spending nearly $900 of public money per night to stay in Paris is excessive and doesn't meet public expectations."" Asked why such an expensive hotel was chosen, a spokesman for the Premier said it was an important moment for the climate change issue.""The Premier was in Paris representing the state at the COP 21 Climate Change Conference,"" the spokesman said.""This was the largest gathering of world leaders and sub-national governments around the issue of climate change in history.""During the trip, Mr Weatherill also visited London at taxpayers' expense to inspect a British soccer club aiming to become ""environmentally sustainable"" and meet green energy advocate Dave Vince, the chief executive of wind turbine company Ecotricity, who showed him around facilities at Forest Green Rovers, which he owns, in Gloucestershire.\l"

"COP21","Australia","COP21_Australia375","Why on earth does Australia still have tariffs?","December 15, 2015 Tuesday 08:00 PM GMT","The Age (Melbourne, Australia) - Online","The global summit season ends not with a bang, but with a whimper. We've had the G20, APEC, and the Paris COP21.Expectations of the conference could hardly be lower. Nearly 15 years of Doha round talks have delivered little, and prospects remain bleak.The talks hit a wall in July of 2008. Various observers thought an agreement was close at that point, but talks broke down over disagreements about agriculture - chief protagonists included the US on one side and India on the other.Since 2008, agreement on the Doha round has become even more difficult. The large emerging countries have grown more powerful, and the world of yesteryear, where an agreement rose or fell on the basis of a US-European deal, is gone. There are new kids on the block.A minor triumph occurred at the Ninth Ministerial in Bali in 2013. The ""Bali Package"" was born. An important part of the package was the Trade Facilitation Agreement, which basically was an agreement to cut red tape.Remarkably, agriculture was an issue again. For agreements forged in the 21st century, it is striking that we always seem to get stuck on issues that belong in the 19th. In any case, a compromise was reached in 2014, and now the agreement is set to enter into force once enough WTO members have ratified it.The whole episode highlights how difficult things are.And so we find ourselves in Nairobi, with little progress in sight. A draft communique has been HYPERLINK https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news15_e/hod_draft_decl_27112015.pdfreleased before the meetingsThere is no doubt the WTO has disappointed. Proponents of bilateral and regional deals, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, argue that this disappointment leads us naturally down the route they prefer. If a global deal is out of reach, so the argument goes, these deals are now the only game in town, and so we have to sign on.That's wrong. They are not the only game in town. Unilateral liberalisation is still on the table.Why on earth does Australia still have tariffs? We could eliminate them tomorrow if we wished. And we should.However, advocates of these preferential agreements suggest the deals will pave the way for global reform in a way that unilateral liberalisation cannot. The hope is these agreements can be stitched together one day and facilitate a truly global deal.If that's the case - and it's a big if - a lot of thought needs to be given to the design of these agreements. If they are stitched together, then their terms will, by default, form the basis of the hoped-for global, consolidated, settlement.One area where it appears little such attention has been paid intellectual property.Intellectual property protections seem to be motivated by a desire to increase innovation and economic growth. However, there is a considerable amount of economic literature suggesting existing intellectual property protections actually inhibit innovation.One of my favourite books, Against Intellectual Monopoly by Michele Boldrin and David Levine, summarises this literature. They argue that more intellectual protection leads to less innovation, as companies divert attention away from creation toward legal manoeuvring intended to protect their intellectual turf.Yet many preferential agreements, including those that Australia has signed up to, enshrine in international treaty strong intellectual property protections. These protections go further than existing multilaterally agreed minimums.Concern about this practice has led many reviews of Australian policy to suggest caution in adopting these intellectual property provisions. Examples include the Harper Review, the Pharmaceutical Patents Review, and the Productivity Commission's review into free trade agreements from 2010.The Productivity Commission has been asked to conduct an inquiry into Australia's intellectual property arrangements that may look at this issue in detail once again. I certainly hope they do apply their intellectual firepower to this question ???again! However, I fear that just like its forebears, any recommendations in this area will be left to gather dust.We have a new Prime Minister who emphasises innovation. There is potentially no more important part of our trade policy than how it relates to innovation. And we look to be getting it wrong. In Australia and globally.\l"

Ten months later, another 126 or more are dead, many slain at restaurants and bars close to the offices of Charlie Hebdo.The face of terrorism is constantly shifting. In the week that we learn the Islamic exe-cut-ioner known as Jihadi John was killed, a new plague of terrorists, some speaking French, have brought one of the world's most beautiful and civilised cities to its knees.While the latest perpetrators have not declared themselves, they have in common with other Islamic fundamentalists a hatred of those of us who do not adhere to their extremist rhetoric of hate. In scenes unparalleled in modern peace time, France has closed its borders, declared a nationwide state of emergency and sent the army into Paris. What this means for the global Paris COP 21 climate talks at the end of the month which Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, United States President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron are due to attend cannot yet be known.Those details can wait. Today, every decent person is gripped by grief that terror has struck Paris again. The news spread with a rapidity we now expect from modern communications.Hostages held inside the Bataclan concert hall tweeted their terror to the world; Facebook implemented its Safety Check tool so people could check through a central point that friends and family were safe.And the Twitter hashtag #ouvreporte directed people to homes willing to take in those seeking safety. All this made real the trauma Parisians were going through.Two days before the killings, President Francois Holland tweeted a message for Remembrance Day, telling people to remember that peace was fragile and war never far away.Yesterday, he called for the nation to summon its strength because it had been called on again to vanquish terrorism in its midst.The terrorist must not win, but Paris - the home of liberty, equality and brotherhood - reminds us of the price that must be paid to uphold the civilising principles in which we believe.The world must continue to rally behind France. This is a battle they do not fight alone.Responsibility for all editorial comment is taken by The Editor, Andrew Holman, 31 Waymouth St, Adelaide, 5000\l"

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia1","ENERGY MINISTER TO VISIT SPAIN FOR UNITED NATIONS CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE","December 7, 2019 Saturday 3:54 PM  EST","Australian Government News","CANBERRA, ACT, Dec. 7 -- The Department of Environment issued the following news: From 7-11 December, I will travel to represent Australia's interests at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) in Madrid. At COP25 We will strive to finalise the outstanding elements of the Paris Rulebook and demonstrate to the world the real and meaningful action Australia is taking to reduce emissions. We have a track record of which all Australians can be proud: we have beaten our first Kyoto target and are on track to overachieve on our 2020 target by 411 Mt CO2-e. Australia's emissions have also fallen to the lowest level since 2015-16 and are lower than when the Coalition came into Government in 2013, despite huge growth in emissions-intensive exports like LNG. These exports are lowering global emissions by up to 159 Mt CO2-e a year by displacing more emissions-intensive fuels overseas. The Government's Climate Solutions Package also maps out, to the last tonne, how we will achieve our 2030 Paris target more than a decade ahead of time. By working with our international partners and taking strong domestic action, the Australian Government will continue to deliver reliable, affordable energy and address the challenges of climate change while ensuring a strong economy.

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia2","Turnbull warns against cutting climate corners","December 11, 2019 Wednesday","Sydney Morning Herald (Australia)","Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has criticised the Morrison government's emissions reductions plans at a critical point in international negotiations, while a trade analyst warns Australia's relationship with the European Union could be soured by the perception it's ""weaseling out"" of its climate commitments. Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor is in Madrid representing Australia at the United Nations Climate Change Conference , also known as COP25 . He is arguing to preserve the right to count Australia's over-achievement on Kyoto Protocol commitments towards the Paris commitment to reduce emissions from 2005 levels by at least 26 per cent by 2030. Most of the 185 signatories to the Paris Agreement don't count their carryover credits - including EU nations - with just Australia and potentially Brazil, Russia or the Ukraine seeking to do so. Mr Turnbull told Smart Energy Summit in Sydney yesterday that using carryover credits to hit the 2030 goal left Australia needing a ""superhuman effort"" to meet the ultimate Paris target to reach net zero emissions by 2050. ""My concern about using them for nearly half the lifting is that leaves you then in 2030 with an even bigger mountain to climb, going into 2035 and 2040,"" Mr Turnbull said. Professor Ross Garnaut has said the use of carry-over credits would cost the economy more than taking immediate and decisive action. Lowy Institute's Herve Lemahieu, who visited the UN headquarters in Brussels last week, said Australia's ""friendly and benign image"" in Europe was changing. ""Australia has residual good faith in Europe, but that is being undermined by the headlines that Sydney is choking in smoke, bushfires are rampant and the government is ambiguous about the link between emissions and climate change - and the government is also weaseling out of its climate commitments at the negotiations in Madrid,"" he said. ""There are a lot of overlapping interests and Brussels is waking up to Australia's strategic role in Asia. That's the good news. But the bad news is they [EU diplomats] warned that the longer the trade negotiations drag on, there is a window for the divergence in climate policy to become a big issue."" Last month Trade Minister Simon Birmingham rejected France's push to set binding climate change targets in an EU trade deal. Mr Taylor said Australia has an ""enviable record"" to promote at COP25 and no country should be penalised for exceeding both their Kyoto or Paris targets. ""We are a world leader in renewable energy investment, we are expected to beat our [Kyoto Protocol] 2020 target by 411 million tonnes, and we have a fully-costed plan to meet our 2030 Paris commitment,"" Mr Taylor said. \"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia3","BHP faces strikes in Chile as workers join countrywide protests","October 31, 2019 Thursday 02:20 PM GMT","The Sydney Morning Herald (Australia) - Online","The wave of anti-government protest sweeping Chile has spread to Australian mining giant BHP's copper mining operations in the country's north, where striking workers have walked off the job. BHP chief executive Andrew Mackenzie said the mass civil unrest in Chile, which ""flared up with very little notice"" following a public transport fare hike earlier this month, had led to workers at the Escondida open-cut copper mine taking part in limited strikes as a show of solidarity. But Mr Mackenzie assured investors on Thursday that while strikes had slowed operations they had so far not taken a significant toll on the copper production volumes at Escondida, the world's largest copper mine. At the height of the unrest, Mr Mackenzie said, staff were not showing up for work for fear for their families' safety. ""People were concerned for their homes and their families because people were killed and a lot of people were injured,"" he said. The unrest, which began following a now-suspended 3 per cent metro fare hike in Santiago, have since expanded to a nationwide uprising calling for wide-ranging political and economic reforms. They have caused mass riots and looting and have so far resulted in 19 deaths and more than 7000 arrests. In a sign the troubles threaten to persist, Chilean president Sebastian Pinera this week announced the country would pull out of hosting two upcoming major international summits, including a United Nations climate change conference and an APEC trade forum, due to the continuing unrest. ""I think the president's decision not to have COP25 and APEC in Chile was a good one ... to take a risk with his international reputation in the interests of keeping the country calm,"" Mr Mackenzie said. The Escondida mine in Chile's Atacama desert produces 1.2 million tonnes of copper a year. The mine, which is managed by BHP, is also 30 per cent owned by rival miner Rio Tinto. \"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia4","Australia is copping it at COP25","December 10, 2019 Tuesday","Canberra Times (Australia)","This week the world's climate ministers, including Australia's embattled Minister for Emissions Reduction Angus Taylor, are meeting in Madrid for international climate talks. It should be a wake-up call that our position on thermal coal exports is undermining Australia's world standing. It has already been an inauspicious start to the COP25 UN Climate Change Conference, where Australia is receiving a well-deserved kicking from the international community for its inaction on the issue. Australia bagged the infamous Fossil of the Day award from environment groups on the opening day. The satirical award, presented each day of the conference, was in recognition of the Australian government's downplay of the link between climate change and the bushfires that continue to devastate communities across the country. As the talks continue, we shouldn't be surprised to see members of the European Union, who are leading the way in tackling climate change, taking aim at Australia for our weak climate commitments. Trade Minister Simon Birmingham recently got a taste of this when France pushed Australia to adopt enforceable climate change targets as part of a planned trade deal with the EU. COP25 should be a wake-up call that our domestic climate policies and position on thermal coal exports are undermining Australia's standing in the world. With climate concerns at record highs at home and growing international pressure, could this be a turning point for Australian climate politics? As the bushfires have shown, inaction on climate change has huge social and economic costs. What many Australian policymakers don't yet understand is the economic opportunity of acting on climate is equally big - in fact, it's enormous. Australia's sunshine, wind and large land area are the envy of our neighbours. Australia has some of the best solar and wind resources in the world. This puts us in an excellent position to become a major exporter of renewable energy to the Asia-Pacific region, creating new industries and new jobs. And it turns out this economic transformation and positive vision for Australia is a story that Australians want to hear. WWF-Australia recently conducted national research to better understand what climate change stories resonate with middle Australia - the people who've been called ""the quiet Australians"". Australians want to hear messages that are positive, that are solutions-focused and that tap into their love and optimism about Australia. By far the most popular message was this: we are a nation of quiet achievers, at the individual, community, and business level. We invented WiFi and EFTPOS - technology that is used all over the world today. The modern solar cell was invented by an Aussie, and Australia has one of the highest rates of household solar in the world - with one in seven households having solar panels on their roofs. This message appealed to people across the board, regardless of their stance on climate change. It should come as no surprise that Australians want to feel pride in Australia. And there are many things to be proud of. Australian companies - big and small - are spearheading clean energy solutions like grids, batteries and electric vehicles. We are also seeing an increasing number of Australian companies power their operations with clean, renewable electricity; more than 240 organisations joined the Business Renewables Centre Australia in its first year. But what our research also tells us is that Australians are good at thinking big and trading globally. Not only can we power our own economy with 100 per cent renewables, we can produce so much more, and sell this surplus energy to the world in the form of liquid sunshine, expertise and solar-powered products and metals. Now we have heavyweights sharing this vision. The good news is we are starting to get on with making this vision a reality. Already South Australia and Queensland are funding renewable hydrogen pilot projects. Andrew ""Twiggy"" Forrest and Mike Cannon-Brookes have invested in a bold plan to export 10GWs of solar from the NT to Singapore. But we must do more - the global criticism at COP25 should bring that point home. Australia has the capacity to be the world's leading exporter of renewable energy inside the next 10 years. At WWF we're embarking on an ambitious campaign to help Australia make this happen. If communities, governments and industry work together, we can unlock the investment needed to build new renewable export infrastructure, create a renewable knowledge economy and decarbonise some of our most intensive industries. In so doing, Australia could then show the international community that we can transform from climate laggard to climate leader, by not only decarbonising our own economy but helping our neighbours to do so too. Seven hundred percent renewable energy is a big, audacious goal - but Australians have always been up for a challenge. Better we act now to be a future global winner than a fossil of yesteryear. Dermot O'Gorman is chief executive of WWF-Australia. \"

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia7","Climate talks at COP25 a 'disappointment' as Australia gets special mention","December 16, 2019 Monday","Analysis and Opinion","Disappointment. That is the word many are using at the close of the latest United Nations climate talks in Madrid. And many of those people are pointing to Australia  among a handful of countries  as part of the problem. While the world agreed in Paris four years ago to stop global warming at well below 2 degrees Celsius, and to try to stop it at 1.5C, the details of how countries will be held to account are still being worked out. Enter COP25 , the second meeting of the parties to the Paris Agreement (and the 25th UN Climate Change Conference). Up for discussion this time were a host of technical matters related to carbon markets, as well as details on how poorer countries would be compensated for climate-related damage, and wording for how countries would ratchet up their ambition next year. Despite the conference being extended for two days past its planned ending, HYPERLINK http://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-16/un-climate-summit-ends-with-no-deal-on-carbon-markets/11801772 the conclusion was beset by watered-down compromise on some issues, while others were kicked down the road with no decision being made . Climate activist Greta Thunberg, who spoke earlier at the conference about ""loopholes"" in climate negotiations, tweeted that the event appeared to be ""falling apart"". ""The science is clear, but the science is being ignored,"" she said. Australia received special attention at the event for its HYPERLINK position demanding it be allowed to use so-called ""carryover credits"" to meet its emissions reduction targets; getting it off the hook for having to reduce actual emissions. Carry-over credits kicked on Australia has promised to reduce its emissions to 26 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, and it plans to get 90 per cent of the way there by using ""carry-over credits"" from a different climate treaty: the Kyoto Protocol. Australia claims it gained those credits by beating targets set in the Kyoto Protocol  targets in which Australia was, for some time, allowed to actually increase emissions. It says only about 10 per cent of its Paris target needs to be achieved using actual emissions reductions between 2020 and 2030. At the conference, Australia appeared to be isolated in its demand, with no other countries pushing for a measure widely described as a ""loophole"". Costa Rica's Environment Minister, Carlos Manuel Rodr\'edguez, fingered Australia, along with Brazil and the US, for blocking progress. ""Some of the positions are totally unacceptable because they are inconsistent with the commitment and the spirit that we were able to agree upon [in Paris in 2015],"" he said. What happened? According to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, the talks were a lost opportunity. The decision on carry-over credits was part of what's been called the ""rulebook for Paris"". As a result of disagreement on key clauses, its finalisation has been kicked down the road for next year's COP26 in the UK. The push by developing countries for stronger wording on increasing finance for compensation over damage caused by climate change was rebuffed, as were calls for updated targets at next year's conference to be ""ambitious"". While Australia contributed to the stalemate by pushing for carry-over credits to be allowed, Brazil and the US also played a significant role in things coming to a halt. Brazil was pushing for a way of accounting for emissions reductions that many countries saw as double-counting, and the US took a hardline approach to compensation for developing countries. What's next? The last UN climate change conference before the Paris Agreement takes effect is set to be in Glasgow in November 2020. At that conference, countries are required to either update or ""communicate"" their climate reduction targets. Central to the Paris Agreement is a ""ratchet"" mechanism, where countries are expected to lift their ambition over time. Current targets are not enough to stop global warming at 1.5C or even 2C, instead taking the world to 3C of warming or more. Inside and outside the conference room, many commentators have pointed to a polarisation in the debate around climate action. While some world leaders advocate a conservative approach, there is also an increasing push for urgent action from some members of the public. Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy at Union of Concerned Scientists, said she had been attending since 1991 but had ""never"" seen anything like the almost ""total disconnect"" at COP25 . ""[That is] between what the science requires and what the climate negotiations are delivering in terms of meaningful action."" ""Led by the youth, growing numbers of people around the world are demanding that their leaders take bold, ambitious actions to tackle the climate crisis... But most of the world's biggest emitting countries are missing in action and resisting calls to raise their ambition. Richie Merzian was a climate negotiator for Australia for almost a decade, and is now at the progressive think tank The Australia Institute. Before heading back from Madrid, he said: ""Despite clear and dire warnings from scientists, record levels of protests and unprecedented climate impacts, the conference fell victim to the base positions of a handful of major polluting countries, Australia included."" Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor was contacted for comment. \"

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia10","Australians must target zero figure: British Tory","February 28, 2020 Friday","Sydney Morning Herald (Australia)","London: Former British Conservative Party leader William Hague has called on Scott Morrison to end Australia's climate wars and adopt a net-zero carbon emissions target ahead of the United Nations climate change conference to be held in Glasgow this November. Lord Hague, also Britain's former Foreign Secretary, was highly critical of the Australian government's approach to climate policy and called on climate denialists within conservative ranks to acknowledge that the science was accepted and settled. He said leaving the issue of climate change to left-wing politicians would result in responses that were socialist, rather than driven by technology or market forces. The coalition should also consider carbon pricing as a way of curbing emissions. The Australian Labor Party last week adopted a net-zero target, without saying what mechanisms would be used to curb carbon emissions. This prompted a scathing attack from Morrison, who said in Parliament this week: ""I'm not going to put a tax on them to get emissions down."" Speaking exclusively to the Herald at Australia House in London as president of the Britain-Australia Society, Lord Hague rejected the idea that Australia's reliance on fossil fuels meant it could not achieve the same 2050 net-zero target adopted by the Tories in Britain. ""Absolutely it's more difficult but [Australia] is a technologically advanced society and it's really in the fulcrum of the consequences of climate change,"" he said. ""Climate change consequences are increased drought, higher temperatures, rising sea levels. Well, all of that hits Australia."" He said the summer's bushfires had ""affected the British people deeply"" due to the ""common sense of pain"" shared between the two countries. Hague said preserving the environment was the natural position of the centre-right to take and warned Australia's coalition MPs against leaving climate change mitigation up to the left. ""If you believe in conserving the best in life that has to include the natural world, which is endangered,"" he said. ""If you leave this argument to the left, their solutions will be very socialistic about high taxation, about regulation."" \"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia11","Cold hard facts on climate;   Market forces leading politics to sustainable energy future  ","December 13, 2019 Friday","The West Australian (Perth)","T en years ago this week, I was standing knee-deep in snow with about 300 other journalists and observers waiting to get into the United Nations ' climate change conference in Copenhagen. We stood in that bleak, serpentine queue for about five hours getting smashed by an uncompromising blizzard as the organisers blundered and bungled their way through the registration process. The UN hadn't anticipated such an enormous demand for access to its COP 15 conference. It was overwhelmed by its own success. That would be the first, last and only time the word ""success"" would be associated with that shambolic affair. Copenhagen was a catastrophe. The light bulb moment for me came at the end of the third day when I was sitting in a conference hall, drifting in and out of consciousness after a succession of sleepless nights, listening on my headphones to the English translation of the latest in an endless stream of speakers. ""This guy is making sense,"" I thought in my dreamy delirium. What I believed was a moment of clarity, turned out to be a moment of sleep-deprived madness. The guy was Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez. I'm still not entirely sure what he was making, but it certainly wasn't sense. Internecine rivalries and domestic political jealousies coalesced to deprive that conference of any hope, even before it began. The result was an impotent communique, brokered by then-US president Barack Obama and Chinese premier Wen Jiabao, ""recognising"" the case to limit global temperature increases to 2C without the barest commitment to doing anything about it. It proved, once and for all, that the United Nations was indeed an oxymoron. These nations were many things, but they were rarely, if ever, united. Fast forward a decade and the 25th Conference of the Parties, or COP 25 , is producing a similar lack of inspiration in Madrid. Just as in Copenhagen, the bulk of those countries making significant commitments to increase their Paris emissions reduction targets are smaller, developing nations. Some mid-level powers have announced ambitious cuts in response to growing pressure from their voters, but the world's biggest emitters are again largely silent. Donald Trump has even made a virtue of pulling out of the Paris Agreement altogether. COP that world. It is becoming increasingly apparent that politics won't lead us to a solution on climate change. But it will be led there. Whether it likes it or not. The market is showing the way. Just follow the money. The stream of investment into solar, wind and other renewables is becoming a tidal wave. The Australian Energy Market Operator predicts the use of rooftop solar will almost triple by 2040, providing between 13 and 22 per cent of our total energy needs. That will produce a faster than expected phase-out of coal as technology and capital races towards newer, cheaper and cleaner energy sources. Politics will follow. It'll have no other option. We saw signs of that this week. Having claimed during the election that Labor's 50 per cent renewable energy target would send a wrecking ball through the economy, the Government has now effectively adopted it as its own unofficial target. Scott Morrison warned darkly on the campaign trail that independent modelling proved Labor's targets would strip $472 billion from the economy, slash more than 336,000 jobs, cut the average wage by more than $9000 a year and force wholesale electricity prices up by more than 58 per cent. The Government has obviously now binned that dodgy modelling. This week, it began distributing a meme on social media boasting that under its direction Australia would produce 50 per cent of its energy from renewable sources by 2030 (Labor's target) - but, almost magically, with positive impacts on growth, jobs, wages and electricity costs. Meanwhile, Anthony Albanese is touring coal country in central Queensland talking about how Labor will support the continued export of coal in the transition to renewables. If it wasn't politics, a world of consistent inconsistencies, it would be gobsmacking. The political landscape has entirely flipped in the space of just seven months. But while our politicians flip and flop and duck and weave and talk in puffs of smoke, the real world is moving inexorably towards more sustainable energy sources. And if our political leaders don't catch up before the next election, they can expect voters to turn as chilly as a Copenhagen blizzard. -----QUOTE---- If our political leaders don't catch up before the next election, they can expect voters to turn as chilly as a Copenhagen blizzard.

Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama appeared to target Australia's push to count its emissions reductions under the Kyoto Protocol in meeting the Paris Agreement in the speech in Madrid overnight. ""Instead of taking ambitious steps forward, we're seeing backwards attempts to re-write the Paris Agreement and bring in credits that have already been created under the Kyoto Protocol,"" Mr Bainimarama said. Australian officials recently said they believe Australia is the only country seeking to use so called ""carry-over credits"" from its emissions reduction commitment under the Kyoto Protocol to meet its commitments under the current Paris Agreement. According to the Australian government, the country's ""over-achievement"" of its commitments under the previous Kyoto agreement can be counted towards the current reductions target. It's been reported up to 100 countries are seeking to have this disallowed under the agreement to come from the current conference in Madrid. ""The Pacific is concerned that humanity is on the cusp of a terrifying scenario: the abandonment of science,"" Mr Bainimarama said. ""While our climate change projects have to be science-driven and evidence-based in order to be approved, certain actors are happy to pay lip service and not meet the demands that well-established science has revealed. ""Worse still, others have put on blinders, and are denying the very existence of an immense wealth of information and science."" Mr Bainimarama also said the world to ""must adjust course to avert catastrophe"". Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor didn't address the carryover credits explicitly in his own speech at the beginning of the high-level segment of the conference, but focused on technological innovation and talked up Australia's emissions reductions. Mr Taylor called for a ""clear path"" to help countries deliver their goals. ""We need to finalise arrangements for Paris Agreement carbon markets that give us confidence that traded carbon units represent genuine emissions reductions.""

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia13","Beware herbicide apps","December 6, 2019 Friday","Mudgee Guardian","Catchment Corner The ongoing dry conditions experienced over much of the state are cause for concern amongst land managers and gardeners for several reasons. The primary, and most obvious, concern is for the provision of adequate water and forage for the health and productivity of livestock. Another cause for concern may be the disruption in the annual spray programmes to reduce weed species. When plants are moisture stressed translocation and respiration slow dramatically, restricting the movement of herbicides to their sites of action. Plants experiencing high temperature, low humidity and low soil moisture conditions tend to have a thicker cuticle (the protective cover of the leaf) with more waxy deposits on the surface. This reduces the absorption of foliar herbicides. Soil moisture influences soil microbial activity which assists in the breakdown of herbicides in the soil. Dry soil conditions prevent the biological and chemical processes that degrade herbicides, making them more likely to persist and injure subsequent germinations of perennial pasture plants. When weeds are growing under extreme moisture stress it may be best to wait to apply herbicide until conditions improve. Maintaining adequate groundcover is very important at all times of the year. Good groundcover protects the soil from extreme climatic conditions, supports biological activity within the soil, and reduces weed seed germination and growth through competition. When prolonged dry conditions break it is often with heavy a downpour, especially if this occurs within the summer months. These 'gully rakers' can cause much damage to farm infrastructure if there is no groundcover to absorb the moisture or to slow the flow of water across the landscape. There would be many in the district who can remember when drought breaking rains have reduced farm dams to a stinking crust of animal manure and other organic matter. Alternative methods of weed control might be looked for in prolonged dry periods. Annual plants can be slashed or mown before their flowers mature and perennials can be chipped, pulled up if numbers are small, or slashed several times. These methods are labour intensive and therefore more costly, however perennial pastures will be protected and persistent herbicide residue in the soil will not be an issue. An added benefit will be the mulch of slashed, chipped or mown weeds covering the soil, protecting it from extreme climatic conditions and providing soil organisms with a food source. Watershed Landcare Earth First Australia COPS out On Monday the 25th Conference of Parties ( COP 25 ) commenced in Madrid. The purpose of COP 25 is to finalise groundwork to support the Paris Agreement to curb the rise in global temperatures to below two degrees by 2050. The backdrop to the conference is one of extreme weather events and concerning UN Climate reports. The need for action is clearly stated in remarks made by UN Secretary General Antonio Gutterres who said ""We have two choices. One is the path to surrender, where we sleepwalk past the path of no return, jeopardising the health and safety of the planet. The other option is the path of hope. The path of resolved sustainable resolution- a path where fossil fuels remain where they should be- in the ground, and where we are on the way to carbon neutrality by 2050."" The urgency is reflected in the COP25 slogan, which is ""Time to Act."" Australia's response to the urgent message of COP 25 will not be well received by the conference. We must expect international criticism for our lack of policies and weak emissions targets. .At home the Morrison government is being faced with increasing pressure form the Australian electorate as more and more citizens are becoming angry and frustrated about the inaction of leadership in the face of intensifying extreme weather events which have been linked to climate change. Kate Allen is the Founder of Extinction Rebellion Central West. She expresses her frustration, and that of many others when she says "" Watching the evening news I see item after item about the climate disasters around the world. I don't understand why our leaders aren't doing anything. This is a climate crisis, and if they won't act, then we must."" Like Kate Allen, Kate Hook, from Futuring Orange is also determined to take action. She says, ""We are already in the lifeboat. It's taking in water and starting to sink. Some people might sit there and watch it happen, but if ever there is even the tiniest bailing cup, I'm going to be grabbing it and bail out water, hoping that I can inspire others to do the same.

On Wednesday the British government announced it had postponed the United Nations climate change conference that it was set to host in Glasgow in November. It is expected to reconvene next year. Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor said the federal government remained ""committed to the Paris Agreement"" and the Morrison government has previously promised to release a long-term emission reduction strategy ahead of the UN talks, backed with an ""investment road map"" to guide government expenditure on emissions reduction technologies. Anna Skarbek, chief executive of the ClimateWorks policy advisory body with Monash University, said the actions needed to achieve our climate commitments were compatible with economic stimulus to recover from the pandemic. ""Basically a lot of the action for meeting climate goals involves upgrading equipment to emissions-free versions, and bringing forward investment in infrastructure that enables more use of renewable electricity and other zero emissions solutions, and reduces energy waste,"" Ms Skarbek said. There were ""shovel-ready"" solutions in waste management, energy efficiency and power generation to be deployed in industries that could generate new installation and manufacturing jobs, she said, a ""double win"" for the economy. ""Let's do that in a way that locks in zero-emissions buildings and infrastructure and supply chains and, importantly, doesn't lock out the chance to halve emissions in the next decade."" Top climate scientists agree for Australia to meet its Paris Commitment, which is to act consistently with limiting global warming to under 2 degrees, it must achieve net zero global emissions before 2050. Innes Willox, chief executive of employer association the Australian Industry Group, said ""technology adoption and policy action"" could be deployed to achieve ""both a strong recovery and a lower emissions trajectory for the economy"". On Tuesday Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told a meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bankers that fellow rich nations must find a way to lead global recovery from the health crisis. ""It must co-ordinate the lifting of travel, transport and production restrictions, and commit to fiscal actions that will stimulate a rebound in business activity and get people back to work,"" he said. Minerals Council of Australia chief executive Tania Constable said she supported ""continued action on climate change, Australia's participation in the Paris Agreement and a transformation to a low emissions global economy"". Mr Taylor said the federal government would continue to pursue its ""practical and responsible"" emissions reduction policies. ""Our commitment is achievable,"" he said. \"

More artificial intelligence on mine sites could also play a role in moving Australia to a lower emissions future, along with getting microorganisms to eat our waste and produce biogas via anaerobic digestion. More electric vehicles and scaling hydrogen to drive cost reductions will be among medium-term strategies through to 2030. And potentially moving to a nuclear future, more hydrogen fuel cell transport options and greenfield energy intensive low-emissions manufacturing will be in the long-term vision through to 2050. Nuclear power - which was recently the subject of a major parliamentary review and is banned under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act - will continue to be closely monitored. The report says it has major potential for emissions abatement in the longer term, in line with the benefit from other renewable power sources such as solar. However the roadmap makes clear there are still hurdles to future deployment of nuclear reactors in Australia, including more research and development and overcoming cost, environmental and social acceptability factors. For homeowners looking to reduce emissions, smart appliances, inverter refrigerators, heat pump pool heaters, induction cook-tops, solar and batteries are all supported options to aim for a cost benefit within 10 years. Energy Minster Angus Taylor will today announce annual low-emissions technology statements. He is supported by a panel chaired by Australia's Chief Scientist Alan Finkel and including other members such as Macquarie Bank chief executive Shemara Wikramanayake and Coca-Cola Amatil managing director Alison Watkins. The first statement will be delivered in the third-quarter of this year before the release of Australia's long-term emissions reduction strategy. That strategy will be released before the next United Nations climate change conference . Mr Taylor said the roadmap was ""about ensuring that mums and dads and small businesses are paying a fair cost for energy"" and not simply being slapped with new taxes. ""Real action on technology, not taxes, is the pathway to increasing global ambition,"" he said. Climate change and emissions reduction was a hard fought issue during last year's election campaign, with Labor promising to boost Australia's commitment to a 45 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030 based on 2005 levels. The Coalition, however, kept its target at 26-28 per cent and instead promoted looking to new technologies as the solution. Written submissions on the technology roadmap are open until June 21. \"

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia19","CLIMATE GABFEST A COP-OUT FOR EMITTERS of all sizes","December 21, 2019 Saturday","The Australian","The international gathering must stop wasting time and focus on technology Another year, another COP. Or to give it its full title, Conference of the Parties, UN Climate Change Conference. The one just gone was held in an industrial part of Madrid. The plan was for it to be held in Chile, but that country cancelled. It was COP25 . Individuals representing all sorts of environmental groups and other assorted activists from around the world somehow find the funds to attend the conference, which goes for two weeks. An extra two days were added to COP25 in the hope that the 200 countries represented could reach various agreements. They could not. It follows on from a series of unsatisfactory COPs, including most famously the one held in Copenhagen, but also the last four. The one exception to this long list of COP flops was COP21, which was held in Paris and established the framework for the latest international climate change agreement. Many of the details of that agreement were not settled at the time. Ever since, it has been one argument after another on those details with nary any resolution in sight. Indeed, we are now at a stage where it is worth posing this question: what is the point of COP? In this context, it's interesting to observe how the COP process has developed across time; it began in 1995. Initially, the conferences were narrowly focused and country representatives and a small group of scientists attended. An ongoing source of tension was the role that developing countries should play in terms of reducing the growth of greenhouse gases. For many years the consensus position was that developing countries should be completely exempt because they had not caused the problems in the first place and were not well-placed to bear any costs that emissions mitigation might entail. This was the deal under the Kyoto Protocol. Note that in the 1990s and early 2000s, the contribution of developing countries to emissions was relatively small, even including China. Fast forward to the present and China is now the largest single emitter of greenhouse gases and India is also a substantial emitter. Last year's increase in China's emissions of carbon dioxide exceeded Australia's emissions in total and were close to the total emissions of the EU. The way the Paris Agreement handled the issue of developing countries was to defer any commitments they might make to reducing emissions until after 2030 and to seek some voluntary reductions to the emissions-intensity of their economies in the meantime. In exchange for these promises, developing countries would be compensated via a fund that would pay for climate change mitigation and adaptation. The targeted figure to be donated by developed countries was $100bn a year by 2020. Unsurprisingly, the contributions received by the fund have not been remotely close to the target. While the US initially provided $1bn of funding, the withdrawal of the US from the Paris Agreement means there have been no further contributions. Australia, likewise, has ceased to contribute, having made a small initial donation. The Prime Minister has declared that overseas aid directed to climate change will be spent closer to home. Back at COP25 , there were some trivial commitments of additional donations - less than $100m spread across several years. At this stage, it looks as though the fund mechanism will fail, an outcome that disappoints a very large number of countries that eagerly signed up to the Paris Agreement in the expectation of an additional flow of funds. The main agenda of COP25 related to article six of the Paris Agreement: voluntary co-operation/market and non-market based approaches. The core of what needed to be worked out was the definitions and principles that should govern international trading in carbon credits. The argument is that countries or companies should be able to buy carbon credits from overseas countries to meet their obligations rather than undertake more costly domestic abatement. Brazil, which remains a signatory to the Paris Agreement, sees real advantages in carbon trading in relation to past and future forest management activity. The sticking point came when Brazil sought to count this activity as a contribution to its own carbon abatement while also trading the associated carbon credits. This double-counting was a bridge too far for the other participants. In the end, there was no agreement in relation to article six. And notwithstanding the coverage by the local press, the issue of Australia's use of the Kyoto carry-over credits was not even on the agenda. Given that the vast majority of countries have no carry-over credits to use - Canada, for instance, failed miserably to abide by its Kyoto commitments - it's not surprising that there is little support for their application. Having said that, it's a complete sideshow when it comes to the main issues. And that's not even acknowledging the fact Australia may make its 2030 Paris commitments without recourse to the use of the carryovers. COP25 really demonstrates is that the vast majority of countries will not put moral purpose before their economic interests. It's all very well for activists such as Jamie Henn of 350.org to moan that ""the level of disconnect between what this COP should have delivered and what it's on track to deliver is appalling and is a sign that the very foundations of the Paris Agreement are being shaken up"". But the reality is that it's impossible to see the COP process delivering anything more than vague and unenforceable commitments while the costs of mitigation remain so high. That's why the focus of the COP26, to be held in Glasgow at the end of next year, should be on technology. It's only with technological breakthroughs that there is a chance that most countries will act to reduce emissions because it makes economic sense as well. Claiming that renewable energy is now cheaper than fossil fuel-generated energy is simply misleading in the context of the absence of effective and economical storage. It's why China is powering ahead with the construction of coal-fired electricity plants. Carbon capture and storage has real potential but needs further R&D funding. A more systematic discussion of adaptation to changing climate patterns could also be useful.The alternative is for the UN to abandon the COP process altogether, although that seems unlikely. To paraphrase Ronald Reagan, COP looks distinctly like a form of eternal life. After all, Greta Thunberg will need somewhere to hang out next year. \"

As he arrived in Madrid for ministerial talks as part of the COP25 climate summit, Mr Taylor said using carry-over credits from the Kyoto agreement to meet the 2030 Paris targets was a legitimate strategy. ""Our target is a floor, not a cap. It is sensible and prudent in how we forecast and plan to use the carry-over,"" Mr Taylor told The Australian Financial Review. ""We think Australia should be given credit where it's due. As always, we will seek to do more where we can."" By signing up to the Paris Climate Agreement, Australia has promised to reduce its carbon emissions by 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. This equates to 695 million tonnes of carbon. The so-called ""Kyoto carry-over"" would allow 367 million tonnes of excess emissions from the 2020 target to be rolled towards the 695 million tonnes abatement task. This reduces Australia's carbon reduction task to 328 million tonnes. Critics of the carry-over scheme say it would result in Australia only reducing its real emissions by 15 per cent below 2005 levels and was not in the spirit of the Kyoto or Paris agreements. The COP25 climate talks do not require countries to outline tougher emissions reduction targets but to show how they are going to reach their Paris targets. Mr Taylor said he expected other countries to criticise Australia for the use of carry-over credits, but he would not back down. ""It's important to explain this to the world. We're extremely credible,"" he said. ""We don't set targets and then miss them like other countries. We have been consistent. ""I'm extremely confident [of meeting 2030 targets]. We're meeting and beating our 2020 targets by a long way. Now, ahead of 2030, we're also ahead."" Figures from the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory released last month showed Australia's greenhouse gas emissions fell by 0.1 per cent in the year to June to 523 million tonnes of carbon. Emissions from the electricity sector fell for a third year in a row, down 2.1 million tonnes. The report showed lower agricultural production as a result of the drought had contributed to the fall in carbon emissions. However, emissions from the liquefied natural gas export industry in Queensland had increased by 22.3 per cent over the same period. Mr Taylor said the figures showed Australia was on track with its emissions reduction targets, despite the surge in gas industry emissions. ""The big thing putting pressure on emissions is LNG exports. But it's a good thing for the economy and the world is growing,"" he said. Malte Meinshausen, founding director of the climate and energy college at the University of Melbourne, said it was not a great look for Australia to be using carry-over credits towards its Paris climate targets. The head of Macquarie Business School's Centre for Corporate Sustainability and Environmental Finance, Martina Linnenluecke, said COP25 would also sharpen the focus on international carbon trading rules. ""Australia has seen a significant development of its carbon farming industry, and the opportunity to connect carbon farming to international schemes would allow it to scale up Australia's domestic efforts,"" she said. Critics say the scheme is not in the spirit of the emissions reduction agreements. \"

The findings, that 26.8 per cent of Australians back the Coalition plan compared with 25.5 per cent for Labor's, are surprising given Prime Minister Scott Morrison and other members of the government are often criticised by climate activists for doing too little to stop global warming. The survey also finds that most Australians want a carbon tax, which was introduced by the Gillard Labor government in 2011 and removed by the Abbott Coalition government in 2014. Asked if they would support a carbon tax, 65 per cent agreed. The automated telephone survey of 1636 voters is backed up by other polls that have found many Australians regard climate change as the greatest threat to the world. Forty-seven per cent of people strongly agreed with that statement, and 14.6 per cent strongly disagreed. The Coalition policy known as Direct Action, where the government pays companies to reduce emissions reduction targets, the Snowy Hydro 2.0 battery, another undersea power line from Tasmania to the mainland, a national electric vehicle strategy and encouraging energy efficiency, were more popular among every age group, except those over 65, than the Opposition's policy. Labor's plan for steep emission reduction targets, pollution limits for polluters, a national electric vehicle policy and reinstating the Climate Change Authority was more popular in Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania. The UNSW survey is consistent with other polls that found that climate change is the top concern of most Australians.

The UNSW survey, commissioned by professors Rosalind Dixon and Richard Holden, was conducted to promote their plan for a $50-a-tonne carbon tax that transfers the revenue to every person aged 18 and older. Dubbed a ""carbon dividend"", the plan is designed to encourage companies to cut emissions, without raising taxes. Prices would likely rise, but individuals would receive an average $1300 a year.

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia23","Labor hits out at 'accounting rort' on climate","December 19, 2019 Thursday","Australian Financial Review","Australia would struggle to reach its 2030 climate target without the ""accounting rort"" of carry-over credits, let alone the end goal of net zero emissions by 2050, according to Labor. While the Morrison government is increasingly confident of meeting Australia's international commitments without the use of the so-called Kyoto credits, Labor's climate change and energy spokesman Mark Butler said they should never be used. Mr Butler said the failure to have a coherent national energy policy was making it harder to achieve emission reduction targets. He said the Coalition had placed no meaningful controls on pollution levels from big industry, including fuel efficiency standards in the transport sector. ""Instead of arguing for higher global ambition, the government spent all its energy at the recent climate conference in Madrid trying to pull an accounting rort,"" he said. Australia was chastised by some countries at the COP25 climate talks in Madrid for proposing to use over-achievement from earlier Kyoto agreements to count towards their Paris targets. Federal Energy Minister Angus Taylor said the carry-over credits issue was not raised with him by other delegates at COP25 . It was also not on the formal discussions, which focused on Article 6 and the trading of carbon credits. Mr Taylor told The Australian Financial Review yesterday that Australia had been ""over-achieving"" in its emissions reduction, and would continue to every year until 2030. The latest projections from the Department of the Environment and Energy said Australia needed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 395 million tonnes to reach its commitment of 26 to 28 per cent (based on 2005 levels) by 2030. If 411 million tonnes from previous Kyoto agreements is included, Australia will overachieve by 16 million tonnes, according to the figures. If the ""Kyoto carry-over"" was removed, Australia would have to achieve emission reductions of about 40 million tonnes a year to reach 2030 targets. Some experts, such as Frontier Economics climate change head Matt Harris, said the 2030 targets were achievable without Kyoto credits, even if the ""low-hanging fruit"", such as gains in the electricity sector, had already been made. Australian Industry Group senior policy advisor Tennant Reed said that closing the gap between the current projections required current policy measures to include other sectors of the economy such as heavy industry. \"

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia25","There's nothing 'natural' about natural disasters","January 6, 2020 Monday","Canberra Times (Australia)","In a press conference on Friday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison repeatedly referred to the raging bush fires across Australia as ""natural disasters"". As someone who lectures on disasters, I can confidently state that there is no such thing as a ""natural disaster"", particularly not in this age of climate change. Politicians like the language of ""natural disasters"" as it allows them to claim that the fires are something akin to an ""act of God"", rather than take any responsibility for the failures of planning and preparation. I imagine Mr Morrison hopes the term ""natural disaster"" allows him to avoid the real link between climate change and drought, rising temperatures and the subsequent bush fire season that we are now facing. He hopes that the term ""natural disasters"" will fool us into thinking that his climate-denying government is in no way responsible for the devastating fires across Australia. It is this ongoing climate change denial that has cost Australians so dearly in recent weeks. In the last month I have participated in two vastly different but closely related events at where I watched Australia's climate-denial policy play out. In the week before Christmas I flew back from the United Nations climate change conference in Madrid, where I was a negotiator for the Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu. Last Thursday I drove with my family back from the Narooma evacuation centre where we had been holed up escaping the fires that have devastated Australia's South Coast. These events are related. The same political choices that have made Australia an international pariah in climate change negotiations, are now evident in the lack of political support for adequate preparation and planning ahead of the devastating bushfires. The Morrison government's political decision to undermine effective climate action impacts Australia's reputation internationally, and especially in the Pacific. Vanuatu, like all Pacific Island nations, emits almost no carbon and yet people are severely impacted by climate change. In Vanuatu the impacts of climate change include more cyclones, like Tropical Cyclone Pam in 2015, and more droughts, which will have severe impacts given that most people are subsistence farmers. In the future people in Vanuatu, as elsewhere in the Pacific, may need to resettle, leading to loss of attachment to place, where ancestral connections have been maintained for thousands of years, as well as languages and culture. These are the issues people refer to when they speak of climate justice. Is Australia prepared to provide access to finance to compensate countries who are facing the impacts of climate change from carbon emitting countries? The answer from Australia, the United States, Brazil and other developed countries has historically been no. But Australia went further in recent climate change negotiations. It argued for an exception that no other country was asking for - questionable counting of credits in a way that undermines any credible commitments to reducing carbon emissions. Just as our leadership has failed to provide adequate climate change action at an international and regional level, the fires also show that they have failed to adequately plan and prepare. Hosted by generous locals and aware of the Herculean efforts of rural firefighters, I think Australians are also becoming increasingly aware of the lack of co-ordinated planning around emergency management - and of the failure of our leadership to meet with our expert fire chiefs when they warned of the impacts of climate change on the bushfire season. We are also critically aware of a leadership that is largely missing in action, in part because of climate-denial paralysis. The bushfires demonstrate not only the profound lack of Australian political leadership on issues related to climate change, they also demonstrate the huge costs associated with climate change inaction. There is nothing natural about the disasters we are facing. I refuse to accept that this is the new normal. Future generations deserve better. They deserve beach summers like we remember as children. We must all require more of our leadership. The costs of climate inaction at home, and across the globe, are too high.

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia26","Many harbingers of the climate change problem","December 14, 2019 Saturday","Wagga Daily Advertiser","RAY'S REASONiNG The past weeks have really put climate change centre stage on the world's agenda. First came the news that we may have already crossed several ""tipping points"", which I will explore in some detail below. Then came news that the European Union had declared a ""climate emergency"", which was followed by last week's opening of the next UN Climate Summit COP 25 , in Madrid. And as the summit opened, the former Tuvalu prime minister told ABC TV's Q&A that Scott Morrison denies climate change is happening in Pacific. Then we learnt of the government's plan to produce hydrogen from ""dirty"" brown coal. Let's look first at the tipping points. The world may already have crossed a series of climate tipping points, according to a stark warning from scientists. This risk is ""an existential threat to civilisation"", they say, meaning ""we are in a state of planetary emergency"". Tipping points are reached when particular impacts of global heating become unstoppable, such as the runaway loss of ice sheets or forests. In the past, extreme heating of 5c was thought necessary to pass tipping points, but the latest evidence suggests this could happen between 1 and 2c. Also ahead of the UN COP25 Climate Change Conference in Madrid, the European Parliament approved a resolution declaring a climate and environmental emergency. Like the EU, a number of countries and local administrations have declared that our planet is facing a climate emergency. But, closer to home, not the Australian parliament and Wagga Wagga City Council. At the opening of the UN climate summit, UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres introductory remarks showed that he is well aware of looming tipping points when he warned that governments risked sleepwalking ""past a point of no return"" if they remained idle. Mr Guterres warned that existing pledges made under the Paris accord fall far short of the kind of transformational action needed to avert the most disastrous consequences of global warming in terms of sea-level rise, drought, storms and other impacts, according to scientists. He also contrasted the leadership and mobilisation shown by the world's youth on the climate emergency with the lack of action by governments, which were failing to keep up with the urgency of the problem despite increasing signs that the climate was reaching breakdown. Australia is one of the countries banned from speaking at the conference. The criteria for being banned include building new coal fired power stations, granting fossil fuel subsidies, and failing to increase national targets for emission reductions. Countries like Australia, Japan and South Africa who support the coal industry were removed from the summit's speaking list, along with countries that have been critical of the Paris climate accord, such as the US, Brazil and Saudi Arabia. What a rogues' gallery for us to be a member! Which leads me to note that the former prime minister of Tuvalu, Enele Sopoaga, who, in reference to the Pacific Islands Forum last August, told Q&A he was ""taken aback"" by Morrison's behaviour at the meeting. ""Unfortunately, prime minister Scott Morison of Australia [was] expressing views that completely denies there is climate change happening already in the Pacific"" he said. Virisila Buadromo, an advocate for women's and human rights in Fiji, also urged Australia to take more action. ""I think Australia, as the largest emitter of carbon in the region, you need to stand with our family ... to fight against climate change,"" she said. These comments paint Australia in general, and our PM in particular, in a bad light. But as I watched Q&A, I had just read an equally depressing story in The Saturday Paper, which explained that the PM and Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor plan a great future for our country as an exporter on a grand scale of hydrogen - reputedly the energy source of the future. However, not by cleanly producing it from water, which can easily be done by using electricity generated from renewables. Instead, it seems the government is planning to produce hydrogen by burning brown coal. This would completely negate hydrogen's one great advantage, which is that its only byproduct is water. Are the Liberals and Nationals so desperate for funds from big coal that they will so willfully contribute to more global warming, and so bring on the tipping points? \"

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia28","Ministers urged to attend conference","November 22, 2019 Friday","Canberra Times (Australia)","Australia should use the upcoming COP25 climate conference to bolster its action against climate change, instead of fighting for the use of controversial carryover credits, an expert has warned. The UN Climate Change Conference (referred to as COP25 ) is set to be held in Madrid from December 2 to 13, after Chile pulled out as host this month. Australia will be represented at the conference by new Ambassador for the Environment Jamie Isbister, who was appointed to the role on Monday, but it is unclear whether Foreign Minister Marise Payne or Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction Angus Taylor will attend. A spokesman for the Foreign Minister said ""any announcement about ministerial attendance will be made in due course"". Prime Minister Scott Morrison was criticised for failing to attend the UN Climate Action Summit in New York in September, despite already travelling in the United States. Climate and energy program director at the Australia Institute Richie Merzian said Australia was already seen as a laggard on climate action. ""As the only country to dismantle a working carbon price, and the Prime Minister's absence at the New York Climate Summit - that even [US President Donald] Trump attended - was noted and cost Australia."" One of the major issues to be discussed at the conference will be whether carryover credits from the Kyoto protocol can be used by countries in order to meet their carbon emission reduction targets. Referred to by critics as an ""accounting trick,"" carryover credits allow countries to use credits from surpassing their targets under the Kyoto protocol towards their Paris commitments. Australia's policies rely on using these credits and at a Senate estimates hearing in October officials conceded they knew of no other countries doing so to meet their targets. ""It is important for a minister to represent at these climate conferences where the deals are secured in small rooms at a high level,"" Mr Merzian said. ""Australia has a particular interest in advocating for the use of carryover credits and it is alone in prosecuting this interest."" A decision to prevent countries using carryover credits to reach their 2030 goals would have an impact on Australia, with 367 million tonnes of the 695 million tonne reduction in carbon emissions required to reach Australia's target to come from the credits. Mr Merzian said Australia needed to use its diplomatic power to back smaller countries from the Pacific calling for climate action. ""I'd like to see Australia pledge additional financial support for developing countries to undertake climate action, including through the Green Climate Fund. I'd like to see Australia commit to increasing its 2030 targets, which many other countries are doing and I'd like to see Australia be an advocate for its Pacific family in pushing all parties to do more."" \"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia29","Nats threat to derail 2050 carbon plan","February 17, 2020 Monday","Australian Financial Review","Prime Minster Scott Morrison faces another damaging split over climate policy, with the Nationals preparing to oppose any effort for Australia to join countries cutting carbon emissions to net zero status by 2050. Under pressure to differentiate from the Liberals, Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack declared the proposed target unworkable for the Australian economy, while former resources minister Matt Canavan warned he was prepared to cross the floor should the Coalition consider adopting the ""fantastical"" target. The idea of a target for net zero emissions by 2050 is being considered by about 80 countries ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference , also known as COP26, in Glasgow in November. The Australian business community last week threw its support behind a push for net zero emissions by 2050. Asked about the proposed target yesterday, Mr McCormack said: ""I think if you go down that path, what you're going to do is send factories and industries offshore, send manufacturing jobs offshore. That's not the Australian way."" ""What I don't want to see happen is our industries and our farmers being forced offshore, having to import food like there was no tomorrow."" The Coalition is preparing to take a new long-term emissions reduction target to the Glasgow summit, with a review into the potential economic impacts of adopting the 2050 goal due to be finalised later this year. Countries including the UK, and all of the states and territories in Australia, back the goal. Business groups and investors strongly support a net zero plan put forward by independent MP Zali Steggall but unhappy Nationals MPs have attacked Liberal colleagues pushing for Australia to do more to deal with climate change. The debate over whether taxpayers should support a new coal-fired power station proposed for the Queensland town of Collinsville has underscored disagreement within the Morrison government. Senator Canavan, who quit cabinet after supporting Barnaby Joyce's challenge for leadership of the Nationals earlier this month, said Australia should not take further action to cut emissions unless other countries did the same. Warning he might cross the floor to vote in the upper house, the Queenslander questioned how a target of net zero emissions by 2050 would work. ""How, as a country, can we commit to net zero emissions in 30 years' time, when we'll receive our last diesel submarine in 35 years' time? It doesn't seem to make a lot of sense,"" he told Sky News Australia. ""I haven't looked at the modelling or the cost and benefits of net zero emissions closely because it just seems so fantastical to me. It seems like the kind of things governments say because they're not doing much today but they'd like to try hoodwink people that they might do something in 30 years' time. Senator Canavan said the government-funded Collinsville feasibility study was an appropriate first step, because more electricity capacity was needed in Queensland. He did not see ""any prospect"" of another leadership spill against Mr McCormack, but did not rule out supporting a new bid to oust him. Climate politics remains a touchstone for Nationals MPs, some of whom expect a further move against Mr McCormack's leadership. Mr Morrison and Energy and Emissions Minister Angus Taylor would have to convince the Coalition party room of the benefits of any change. Ms Steggall said if Senator Canavan was able to cross the floor, MPs who supported the target should be allowed to as well. ""This is a matter of principle that requires a conscience vote, so everyone can represent their electorates,"" she said. North Sydney Liberal MP Trent Zimmerman said yesterday a net zero by 2050 target was ""something that we should be looking very seriously at"". Business Council chief Jennifer Westacott said last week the Steggall plan could provide a ""massive advance"". Support was quickly matched by Atlassian co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes, the Australian Industry Group and the Australian Energy Council. Labor leader Anthony Albanese said the opposition continued to examine its policy and 2050 ambitions. ""Business doesn't know what the government's policy is, because frankly, they simply don't have one,"" he said. Key pointsMichael McCormack says the proposed net zero emissions target is unworkable. Ex-minister Matt Canavan threatens to cross the floor over 'fantastical' idea. \"

Mr Taylor said Australia was backing an ""unprecedented wave of clean energy investment"" totalling $14.1bn last year and that ""strong messages and targets alone won't address climate change"". On the same day that Scott Morrison defended the government's climate change policies, Mr Taylor told the COP25 summit ""the world needs action to reduce emissions"" and that Australia backed technology to lead ""the global transition to lower emissions"".\'e2\€ \£fHe also called on COP25 delegates to finalise arrangements for ""Paris Agreement carbon markets that give us confidence that traded carbon units represent genuine emissions reductions"". ""The Paris Agreement sent a powerful signal to the world that countries are serious about climate action. Australia is committed to the Paris Agreement,"" he said. Australia has joined the Leadership Group for Industry Transition, a public-private partnership led by India and Sweden, aimed at reducing emissions in ""economically important industrial sectors"", including steel, aluminium, cement, aviation and shipping. The government will use the group, which also includes Britain, Germany and Korea, to encourage Australian businesses to participate and assist in working to lower emissions. Mr Taylor said global economies would transition to lower emissions ""only as fast as the deployment of commercially -viable technologies allow"". He also flagged the government would -release a long-term strategy to -reduce emissions next year, focusing on the deployment of ""cost--effective technologies"". ""This means we need to get the right technology to the marketplace when and where it is needed. In Australia, we are developing a Technology Investment Roadmap. The roadmap will establish an enduring, strategic approach to Australia's clean technology -investment,"" he said. Citing the government's national hydrogen strategy and boost to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, Mr Taylor said renewables supplied more than 25 per cent of the nation's electricity supply and that Australia had the world's highest uptake of household solar panels. ""This increase has not been without issues and one of Australia's challenges is to ensure energy remains affordable and reliable as these changes occur. We cannot move faster than the technology allows,"" he said. On Tuesday, the Prime Minister said the government's climate change policies were being developed from the ""sensible centre"".""Our actions on climate change are getting the results they're -intended to get - reducing emissions and meeting our targets,"" he said. ""The policies we're pursuing capture that sensible centre, which understands our need to balance both meeting the needs of sustainability in our environment and -ensuring that we meet the economic needs of our nation."" \"

Five of the last seven COP meetings failed to reach a decision on carbon market rules, indicating the extent of international divisions, and calling into question the disproportionate focus on carbon trading, given its HYPERLINK https://www.climatechangenews.com/2019/12/13/carbon-markets-will-not-help-stop-climate-change/ limited ability to address climate change.

Little progress was made on mobilising finance from developed nations. The US, which will soon exit the Paris Agreement, played a key role in stymieing progress. It resisted efforts for broad governance arrangements, and pushed for language in the rulebook which would exclude high-emittiong nations from liability for the loss and damage experienced by vulnerable countries under climate change. Read more: Global emissions to hit 36.8 billion tonnes, beating last year's record high At Glasgow, all nations under Paris are required to submit new emissions reduction commitments. It was widely expected that the Madrid meeting would strongly urge nations to ensure these targets were more ambitious than the last. Instead, the final text only ""reminds"" parties to ""communicate"" their commitments in 2020. 'Crime against humanity' When the COP finally closed on Sunday morning, the meeting had failed to reach consensus on increasing emissions reduction ambition to the level required. The results are disheartening. The world has let another chance slip by to tackle the climate crisis, and time is fast running out. The implications of this were perhaps summed up best by the low-lying Pacific island state of Tuvalu, whose representative Ian Fry said of the outcome: There are millions of people all around the world who are already suffering from the impacts of climate change. Denying this fact could be interpreted by some to be a crime against humanity. \"

Anthony Albanese's rejection of carry-over credits, which he -labelled an ""accounting trick"" to reduce emissions, comes as a -report released on Thursday commissioned by the Australia Institute claims there is no legal basis for using the credits to help meet the government's target under the Paris Agreement. Touring central west Queensland to try to win back blue-collar votes, the Opposition Leader -declared Labor remained committed to its pre-election policy to reject the use of carry-over credits. ""We need real action on -climate change and accounting tricks won't do it,"" he said. ""It is not surprising the world is pushing back on that because they want Australia to fulfil our commitments, not to the irony of (Energy Minister) Angus Taylor relying on the credits because of the action of a former Labor government."" Labor is re-evaluating its climate policies and has not decided on a 2030 target, amid concern within the party's ranks that hitting former leader Bill Shorten's ambitious 45 per cent emissions reduction target will be harder to meet following its election loss. The Climate Change Performance Index released on Wednesday, which annually monitors the climate policies and actions of 57 countries and of the EU, ranked Australia 56th of 61 countries. The index referenced experts who noted ""the new government is an increasingly regressive force in negotiations"" and called the Morrison government's target to -reduce emissions by 26 per cent to 28 per cent by 2030 below 2005 levels ""insufficient"". Government sources said it was unclear which Australian policies had been analysed for the CCPI report. Deputy Nationals leader Bridget McKenzie said she was ""absolutely confident"" the government would meet its Paris targets, but was not going to do it by putting people out of work. Mr Taylor said Australia had an enviable record to present at the UN COP25 climate change conference in Madrid and the government would use carry-over credits ""only to the extent necessary to reach the 2030 emissions -reduction target"". Rules for implementing the Paris accord, which aims to keep a global temperature rise well below 2C this century, will be discussed at COP25 . The government is relying on 411 metric tonnes of CO2 ""overachievement"" from the Kyoto Protocol period to meet its 2030 target. The AI report, produced by Climate Analytics, says there are many reasons why it is not legitimate or defensible ""factually, legally or from an equity perspective"" for Australia to use Kyoto credits for its Paris Agreement target.It says the two were separate treaties; the Kyoto Protocol does not permit the carry-over of credits beyond the 2013-20 period; the Paris accord calls for parties to present their highest possible ambition; and Australia's use of ""creative accounting"" could encourage others to use carry-over credits, which would undermine the Paris Agreement. \"

Last week, the UK left the European Union. Free to determine our future as masters of our own destiny, we are now forging ahead as a self-confident, global nation, ready to reinvigorate our ties with old friends. You can see it in our growing defence and security co-operation, whether it's promoting global security as members of the Five Eyes alliance, our collaboration on the next generation of naval frigates, or our investment in regional stability through Britain's diplomatic missions in Vanuatu, Tonga and Samoa. You can see it in our thriving trade and investment relationship, worth more than \£317 billion ($32.6 billion). The UK is the second-largest investor in Australia and the second-largest foreign destination for Australian investment. And Australia is Britain's sixth-largest export market outside the EU - a trading relationship we want to strengthen and grow. Every day, British citizens go to work for Australian companies, such as Lendlease and Macquarie, which I visited in Sydney. Those companies are investing billions of pounds in Britain, in places such as Birmingham and Manchester, and making an invaluable contribution to urban transformation and national infrastructure. British companies, meanwhile, continue to seek investment opportunities in Australia. But I hope you can also see it in our ambition for the future. Our co-operation is already deepening. So on Thursday I announced Britain would invest an extra \£31 million this year in counter-terrorism capacity-building in south-east Asia. And I also got to welcome the announcement by AstraZeneca of a \£3100 million investment in a state-of-the-art facility in Australia to focus on sustainable healthcare, which will benefit people around the world. But we can do even more. At home and abroad, I've been speaking a lot about our vision of a truly global Britain. And our close partnership with Australia is a key part of that vision. We want to be energetic champions of free and open trade, so we can boost small businesses, cut the cost of living, reduce barriers and create the well-paid jobs of the future for the next generation of Australians and Britons. So it's time to build on our deep and long-standing relationship with Australia to secure a comprehensive, high-quality free trade agreement as a key part of our future bilateral relationship. Officials from both sides have been laying the groundwork on this for years. Achieving that agreement is a shared ambition that we are both keen to start work on. But our vision of a truly global Britain is not just about the bottom line. It's also about sharing our ambition to be a force for good in the world. Working alongside Australia, we will remain true to our values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law. Britain will soon launch a new Magnitsky-style sanctions regime that will hold human rights violators to account. Of course, that regime will be more effective if like-minded allies such as the US, Canada and Australia work together. So I'm pleased the Australian Parliament is looking into its own regime of sanctions. And we will lead on the big global issues of the day, such as climate change. I am proud that Britain, in partnership with Italy, will host the United Nations climate change conference COP26 in Glasgow. We can and will rise to the challenge by harnessing all British - and Australian - talents in entrepreneurialism, tech and innovation to find creative solutions to climate change. It is in the tough times that friendships matter most. We've watched in anguish from afar the loss of life, destruction of property and devastation of your beautiful countryside. We are full of admiration for the bravery of your firefighters and the resilience of your communities. But whatever the challenges that lie ahead, we can be confident that, bolstered by a new and modern partnership, Australia and the UK are ready for the task. Global Britain will be a more ambitious and energetic partner in the Indo-Pacific region. From trade to security co-operation, that can only bring greater opportunities for our friendship in the years ahead. Dominic Raab is the UK Foreign Secretary. \"

At the same time, those women had little access to scientific research. In places where the labour is divided by gender, women and men learn different things about the environment.

Moreover, given the prevailing practice of ""bride prices"" among pastoral households, early marriages for young women and girls are a way to secure cattle.

Read more: Paris climate summit: why more women need seats at the table This everyday knowledge is crucial for identifying the full risk posed by climate change. However, women told us their knowledge was not always recognised within their communities - let alone at the national level. They blamed this on discrimination against women taking up decision-making roles, poverty and gender-based violence which dissuades women and girls from participating. Valuing women Even when countries have policies for gender equality in climate change responses, that doesn't mean women are actually given an equal voice. According to female community leaders and women working in government and non-government organisations in Cambodia, Kenya and Vanuatu, gender equality issues in climate change policies tend to be confined to ""women-only programs"". Gender inclusion is primarily addressed in social welfare programs, rather than ministries responsible for energy, meteorology, land and natural resources. To address these gaps, we need to to take women's varied expertise seriously. This begins with supporting their leadership within communities and villages. Women's access to education and careers in climate-relevant sciences is also crucial. Ideally, this will progressively bring in broader groups of women and girls to participate in climate change decision-making.

In Kenya, for example, one member of a women's network responding to drought and conflict told us: ""[W]e support each other. We want a collective voice because then we have more power."" These networks help women with female-specific issues, such as natural disasters that make women extremely vulnerable to abuse from men. But even in day-to-day life, these forums are valuable for women who would otherwise be barred from political activism.

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia36","Businesses want global rules on carbon trading","December 2, 2019 Monday","Australian Financial Review","Australian businesses are calling on governments around the world to develop international accounting rules for carbon trading, saying such a framework could lead to a carbon credit export boom. In a joint statement released to coincide with the first day of the United Nations COP25 climate conference talks in Madrid, business groups argued clear international trading rules would open up new business opportunities while radically reducing carbon emissions. ""Carbon would potentially trade at the scale of the commodities that underpin it, such as oil, coal and iron ore,"" read the statement, which was led by the International Emissions Trade Association and signed by Australian Industry Group, oil and gas lobbyist APPEA, and the Carbon Market Institute. "" COP25 Natural carbon ""sinks"" refer predominantly to tree planting, while industrial sinks include carbon capture and storage. The business groups claimed such a rule book could reduce CO2 emissions by 9 billion tonnes a year by 2030 - almost a third of last year's total global CO2 emissions, which the International Energy Agency put at 33.4 billion tonnes. They claimed a well-designed carbon trading scheme could also knock up to $320 billion off the global cost of meeting the emissions reductions targets of the Paris Agreement. John Connors, chief executive of the Carbon Market Institute, one of the signatories to the statement, said a clear set of carbon trading rules was ""the last piece in the puzzle"" of the Paris Agreement, and was likely to be a major focus of this month's talks. ""The science is clear that the global economy needs to get to net zero, and likely significant negative emissions, as we undertake the task of climate repair,"" said Mr Connors, who will travel to Madrid later in the week. He said the Australian government's emissions reduction fund, which pays the private sector to mitigate carbon emissions mainly through planting trees, had already stimulated a carbon farming industry in Australia. He said Australia's large landmass meant there was plenty of room to grow the carbon farming industry if there was a spike in global demand for carbon credits. But that would require an internationally agreed framework. Such a framework could also stimulate more carbon capture and storage, he said. The Madrid conference is the last COP meeting before the Paris Agreement comes into force in 2020. As yet countries have failed to agree on the concrete details of an international carbon market, which is only loosely defined in the agreement. That means at the moment the only international carbon trading framework is the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism, which allows developed nations to invest in carbon mitigation projects in developing countries, and count the resulting emissions reductions towards their own targets. The business groups said this scheme was a good start, but a much larger, up-to-date framework was now needed. Article 6 of the Paris Agreement calls for the establishment of a ""mechanism"" that would allow nations struggling to meet their targets on their own to buy carbon credits off nations who are beating their targets. The scheme would be voluntary, but would have carefully designed accounting rules to protect against ""double counting"" of the same emissions reduction in two countries. Nations came close to agreeing on the rules of this mechanism in last year's COP24 meeting in Katowice, Poland, but in the end Brazil derailed the talks when it refused to accept rules banning double counting of carbon credits. \"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia37","Most back net-zero emissions target","December 9, 2019 Monday","Canberra Times (Australia)","Almost two-thirds of Australians support a national target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 or earlier, a new survey has found. The Australia Institute said the survey of 1424 respondents found over half of coalition voters supporting such a target. The institute said every Australian state and territory already has a target of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, but the federal government has refused to commit to the policy. Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor is heading to Madrid for the United Nations-led climate change talks - COP25 - this week. ""Under the Paris Agreement, countries including Australia are required to bring forward a long-term climate plan by 2020, presenting an opportunity for Minister Taylor to back in a popular target of net-zero emissions by 2050,"" the institute's climate and energy director Richie Merzian said in a statement. He said New Zealand locked in this target in its Zero Carbon Act last month. Labor Leader Anthony Albanese attacked the Coalition in a speech on Saturday. ""Coalition members too often see climate change as little more than a conspiracy cooked up by academic scientists to get research grants, and by environmental activists to destroy the free market,"" Mr Albanese said. But Mr Taylor used a new report - Emissions Projections 2019 - to argue that Australia will exceed its target by 16 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. \"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia38","Wind's role in energy mix","July 30, 2019 Tuesday","The Examiner Newspaper","In 2000, John Titchen attended a United Nations climate change conference in The Hague. He had been taught the greenhouse effect during his schooling and university studies, but was taken aback by the seemingly defeatist attitude he encountered at the Conference of the Parties. ""The thing that struck me was the talk about adaptation - that climate change was impossible to avoid,"" Mr Titchen said. ""I found that a bit shocking. We're up to the 25th Conference of the Parties this year - 19 years later - and there's still sometimes a lack of clarity as to what our objective is."" He later became the managing director of Goldwind Australia, the developer of the 48-turbine, 148 megawatt Cattle Hill Wind Farm near Waddamana in the Central Highlands. The project was developed to help Tasmania reach 100 per cent self-sufficiency in power production should Basslink fail again. The state is above 90 per cent now, using wind, solar and hydro resources. But the wind farm's future role could go well beyond Tasmania. As the need to act on climate change grows more urgent, Tasmania will be needed to supply energy to the mainland as coal-fired power stations increasingly close down. This will be met through the Battery of the Nation project, dependent on a second interconnector - the Marinus Link. Mr Titchen said this was essential as Australia transitioned away from fossil fuels - and it needed to happen sooner rather than later if the country was to meet its Paris targets. ""That's a substantial change. The world is going to need to adapt now,"" he said. ""When we talk about if there's enough time with Battery of the Nation, we just need to be urgent about it. We need to manage the power system so it meets the needs of the community, but the backdrop is becoming more and more problematic. ""It's intangible when scientists are forecasting the future based on science. We can't afford to wait 20, 30, 50 years before we get a direct experience of what the problem is before we act. ""We will have locked in even more damage."" The substation and transmission line linking Cattle Hill to TasNetworks has been finished, and seven of the 48 turbines are up. The remainder will be installed by the end of the year, weather permitting, transported to the site from Bell Bay. It will add more energy available for hydro storage, providing enough power for 63,500 homes. Granville Harbour: The next step of many Last week, workers started pouring 700 cubic metres of concrete for each of the 31 turbine foundations at Granville Harbour. The substation is complete and, from September, the first turbine should be fully installed as equipment makes the long journey from Burnie to Tullah, then Queenstown, and finally up to Zeehan. The 112 megawatt wind farm is expected to be finished by May next year, providing power for 46,000 homes. Like with Cattle Hill, Granville Harbour was approved without the need for the second interconnector, with its primary focus on self-sufficiency in Tasmania. The power generated goes to Hydro Tasmania, which determines how it's dispatched. Project director Lyndon Frearson has managed the development of renewable energy in Australia and the Pacific, gaining a detailed insight into how it fits into the energy mix. He said adding further wind and solar needed to be carefully considered. ""My view as an engineer is that it is absolutely critical that we have cautious and considered engagement around all the options available to us,"" Mr Frearson said. ""To not be actively considering climate change would seem to be a foolish approach to how you manage systems. ""It's important to understand that, for 100 to 150 years, the energy sector was built on three rules: bigger was better for economies of scale, it was cheaper to build today than tomorrow because concrete and labour costs were going up, and operational costs were generally at least 50 per cent of the life cycle cost of the asset. ""What you see with renewable projects is that bigger isn't always better. They are modular and scalable, they can be placed in different areas that are appropriate for the resource and environment."" Granville Harbour and Cattle Hill will almost certainly not be the last wind farms to be constructed in Tasmania, despite the opposition to the Robbins Island proposal. Mr Frearson said the industry was increasingly recognising the potential of Tasmania. ""There are a number of locations around Tasmania that have wind resources similar to what we have at Granville Harbour,"" he said. ""There are plenty of farming areas that have that wind resource, it just waits to be seen how that relates to access to the network. Obviously there are develops running around looking into this. ""Quite a number of companies are looking at opportunities within the Tasmanian market. Some are based on existing opportunities, some are based on future outcomes from Marinus."" \"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia39","Riots force Chile to axe APEC, climate summits","November 1, 2019 Friday","The Australian","Chile has withdrawn as the host of an APEC summit next month at which the US and China had been expected to sign a deal to ease a trade war that has hurt the global economy, as raging street protests gripped the country. The country has also cancelled this year's UN climate conference scheduled for Santiago in December because of unrest sparked in part by the cost of measures to tackle climate change. The abrupt move plunged the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation meeting into disarray, with participating countries caught off-guard and no alternative venue lined up. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change said it was looking for a new location for its 25th annual meeting. Chile was chosen to host the conference after Brazil pulled out following the election of President Jair Bolsonaro. Costa Rica was due to share the conference with Chile but pulled out -because of cost pressures. Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said the decision to cancel the conferences had ""caused him a lot of pain"" but his government needed ""to prioritise re--establishing public order"". ""As president to all Chileans I must always put the problems and interests of Chileans, their needs, their desires and their hopes, first,"" he said in a brief statement at the La Moneda presidential palace in Santiago. UNFCCC climate change exec-utive secretary Patricia Espinosa said she had been ""informed of the decision by the government of Chile not to host COP25 in view of the difficult situation that the country is undergoing. We are currently exploring alternative hosting options."" Chile has been plunged into weeks of civil unrest sparked by proposed rises to the cost of public transport and electricity. The rises were due in part to measures designed to make the transport and electricity systems less polluting to combat climate change. At least 19 people have been killed in 13 days of unrest, more than 1000 injured and more than 380 supermarkets have been looted, a third of the total in the country. The metro system has run a partial service after more than 70 stations were damaged and security forces imposed a curfew for the first week. The APEC summit was scheduled to bring together 20 world leaders, including Scott Morrison, on November 16-17. US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, had been due to sign an interim agreement to end the 15-month-old trade war. The cancellation might deny the two leaders a chance to meet on neutral soil soon but the Trump administration said it still expected to sign the deal with China next month. A White House official told Reuters that Chile's cancellation of the trade summit had caught the administration by surprise. Climate change groups have seen the Chile protests as a reason for greater action. ""The mobilisation that we are seeing in Chile and other countries in Latin America are clear evidence of the need to -implement transformational changes of the current development paradigm towards a new model of development based on social justice and environmental sustainability which can be clearly achieved by implementing the proposals of the IPCC 1.5\'c2\'b0C report,"" said Alejandro Aleman, climate change officer, Centro Humbold, Nicaragua and Co--ordinator for Climate Action Network Latin America. The network said ""irrespective of where and when COP25 takes place, we will continue to pay close attention to the situation in Chile to ensure that the overarching principles of social justice and human rights are protected, especially also in the COP"".Oxfam Latin America deputy director Asier Hernando condemned what he said was the heavy-handed response of the Chilean government to the protests. ""The same flawed economic policies that have sparked protests on the streets of Chile are fuelling the global climate crisis and the global inequality crisis,"" Mr Hernando said. \"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia40","Australia holds firm at Madrid","December 16, 2019 Monday","Australian Financial Review","The Morrison government is standing firm on using ""carry-over credits"" to help it reach its 2030 emissions reduction targets despite being chastised at international climate talks. Australia - along with the US, Canada, Russia, India, China and Brazil - has been criticised for not setting tougher targets at the COP25 summit in Madrid. But federal Energy Minister Angus Taylor, who attended ministerial meetings in Madrid, has not budged on Australia's emissions reduction targets of 26 per cent to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. He has also said the Morrison government will not change its plans to use carry-over credits from the earlier Kyoto Protocol to count towards Australia's Paris Agreement targets. ""We are working professionally and constructively to finalise the outstanding elements of the Paris Agreement 'rule book',"" Mr Taylor said. The two-week Madrid talks were due to conclude on Friday but spilled over into the weekend. Countries were split over whether there should be tougher cuts than those in the Paris Agreement. The meeting, presided over by Chile, had been criticised for not issuing a strong enough statement on emissions reductions. The United Nations said 84 out of 190 countries had promised to enhance their national plans by the end of next year, with 73 saying they will set a long-term target of net zero emissions by 2050. \"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia41","Carbon can kicked down road as talks again splutter to a halt","December 17, 2019 Tuesday","The Australian","WORLD COMMENTARY The tagline for this year's UN climate talks, known as COP25 , held in Madrid was Tiempo de actuar: time for action. Its logo was a clock, showing a quarter to 12. Midnight duly passed on Friday, scheduled as the summit's last day, and then again on Saturday. Despite running nearly two days into overtime, finishing only on Sunday, the talks failed to produce real action on climate change. A final set of documents fell short on both main goals. They agreed on only weak and wat-ered-down commitments to the promised drastic cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases. And a decision on regulations for new international carbon markets was deferred until next year. Frustrated demonstrators punctuated the summit, as they have disrupted cities and schools around the world for the past 12 months, decrying political in-action. But in Madrid, the politics were still gridlocked. A coalition of governments including the EU, came to Madrid demanding a strongly worded text urging all nations to make promises in 2020 that they would cut their emissions more and faster than promised so far. So on Saturday morning, when it appeared the conference would do no such thing, there was outrage. The final text was scarcely an improvement, though a few -observers took comfort in its mention of the gap between the reductions promised in national pledges and what the science says is necessary to avoid more than 1.5C-2C of warming. A second sticking point was over what is known as ""loss and damage"" - a concept particularly important to the least-developed nations. They would like to see the UN make provision for money to help them cope with the impact of climate change, for instance in the aftermath of a hurricane. That is a red line for many rich emitters. They contend, among other things, that other disaster funds already exist and they do not want to open a conversation about liability. The third sticking point was the one for which COP25 will be -remembered. It concerned an -arcane and highly technical clause of the Paris Agreement known as Article 6, which offers a broad framework for international carbon markets. One analysis, by the Environmental Defence Fund, an advocacy group, found such markets could theoretically reduce the cost of meeting climate targets by between 59 per cent and 79 per cent. If those financial gains were reinvested in further efforts to mitigate emissions, cumulative -reductions in global emissions between 2020 and 2035 could potentially be double what is on the table in national pledges under the Paris Agreement. The task in Madrid was to establish the regulations that would make such markets work, by both offering financial incentives for green projects and generating real, measurable emissions reductions. That would depend on two conditions being met. First, that green projects - a solar power station, say, or a facility to flare methane from landfills - demonstrably reduce emissions above what the host country has already promised under the Paris Agreement. And second, that ""emissions credits"" granted for green projects are not double-counted. Delegates in Madrid wrangled over how a new carbon market, operated by the UN under the Paris Agreement, would link up with a similar one created under the Kyoto Protocol, a treaty signed in 1992, without compromising the whole system. Known as the Clean Development Mechanism, the Kyoto market allowed rich countries to buy carbon credits from green projects in poorer ones in order to offset the emissions they were producing at home. The issue plagued discussions at last year's summit in Katowice. Around noon on Sunday, Chilean Environment Minister Carolina Schmidt announced the question would not be resolved in Madrid, either. A decision was postponed until next year in Glasgow. Not since 1999 have COP climate summits ended on a Friday, as scheduled. The text was at last approved about 1pm on Sunday. Outside, an ice circus entertained its visitors with acrobats on skates. Another circus, a dispiriting one, was packing up.THE ECONOMIST \"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia42","Global drive for green recovery","May 18, 2020 Monday","The Age (Melbourne, Australia)","Just a few months ago there had been growing consensus among scientists, activists, economists and even investors that 2020 would be pivotal in the fight to stave off the worst impacts of climate change. Global warming had become manifest in the intensity of fires and floods, droughts and storms around the world, prompting politicians to catch up with the view of voters on the urgency of the problem. In November, world leaders were to meet in Scotland for the 2020 United Nations Climate Change Conference to set even more ambitious emissions targets and outline concrete plans on how to meet them in the effort to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees. But the Glasgow meeting has been cancelled and politicians are now focused on keeping citizens alive in the face of a more immediate threat. Rather than lose the momentum that had been growing, scientists and activists groups around the world are focusing on a campaign to ensure that economic stimulus packages being adopted around the world are green. On Friday, the World Economic Forum released a statement in support of the European Union's ""Green Deal"", declaring that it must become the ""cornerstone"" of Europe's pandemic recovery. ""Rather than rebuilding the 20th-century economy, we must focus on spending stimulus money wisely and on preparing Europe for a competitive and inclusive 21st century, climate-neutral future."" This month the University of Oxford released findings of a study of 700 previous stimulus packages which showed that a green stimulus created more jobs per dollar spent than a black one. One of the lead authors, Professor Cameron Hepburn, said he believed the decisions politicians made in coming weeks would decide how future generations experienced climate change. ""The recovery packages are vital to getting our economies going again and to putting us on a cleaner path to avoid the worst impacts of climate change,"" he said. The Oxford research was one of a wave of reports, studies and papers recently released as various groups seek to catch the attention of leaders. In one report, the World Bank suggested that tax concessions could be offered to low-carbon fuel categories while the current low prices might be an opportunity for countries to withdraw subsidies to the oil sector. The international Monetary Fund made similar recommendations advocating for measures to modernise grids, expand public transport and support climate change adaptation projects. United Nations secretary general Antonio Guterres declared that taxpayers' money deployed in stimulus should be spent on ""new jobs and businesses through a clean, green transition"" and that when it was used to rescue business, it should be ""tied to green jobs and sustainable growth"". The movement for a green recovery has some serious political backing around the world. Alongside the EU's moves towards green stimulus, Joe Biden, presumptive nominee for the US Democratic Party, has embraced the Green New Deal championed by elements of his party as part of his election platform. So far China's efforts have been mixed, with governments backing both new coal-fired power plants as well as high-tech grid improvements that could reduce emissions. In Australia, political signals are mixed. Asked if the pandemic presented Australia with an opportunity to set more ambitious reductions targets, Energy and Emissions Reductions Minister Angus Taylor advocated for increasing gas use and exports, saying that countries with access to cheap liquified natural gas were able to cut emissions faster. This is despite the increasing body of research showing gas to be as bad for the atmosphere as coal. But Mr Taylor has also backed hydrogen, which is increasingly seen as the crucial new clean energy technology, and a potential source of employment and export dollars. Last month, Fatih Birol, executive director at International Energy Agency, wrote that hydrogen technology today is at the same state of development and adoption wind and solar were during the crisis in 2009, when massive green stimulus packages supercharged their uptake and put them in the position of undercutting fossil fuels on costs today. But Mr Taylor has drawn criticism for backing so-called ""brown"" hydrogen alongside ""green"". Hydrogen emits no greenhouse gases when burned in engines or power plants, but splitting water by electrolysis to create hydrogen consumes electricity. Clean energy advocates argue that Australia has the space to build wind and solar power stations to become a green hydrogen export leader, but Mr Taylor has not ruled out a role for gas and coal. Leading economist and renewable energy expert Ross Garnaut says Australia's vast capacity to generate wind and solar energy could fuel not only exports but a boom in domestic heavy industry and replace petrol for transport. ""The full emergence of Australia as an energy superpower of the low-carbon world economy would encompass large-scale early-stage processing of Australian iron, aluminium and other minerals,"" Professor Garnaut said. He told The Age that Alcoa and Rio Tinto had already signalled they did not see a long-term role for the nation's three largest aluminium smelters in their portfolios under current electricity supply arrangements due to their high electricity cost and emissions output. He believes that if such plants made use of Australia's advantages in low-cost renewable energy, they could expand their output to meet demand during a global revival in aluminium demand. Similarly, Professor Garnaut sees an opportunity in production of silicon, which is in demand for photo-voltaic cells and computer chips, and whose key ingredients he describes as high-grade sand or quartz, carbon, which can be renewable carbon from biomass, and ""a huge amount of energy"". ""It is a natural for expansion,"" he says. \"

Australia bears a large share of the blame. The Australian team refused to support any serious suggestions that countries need to come up with more ambitious targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions in order to hold global heating to no more than 2C. Instead of actually lowering carbon emissions, Australia wants to use creative accounting to meet its greenhouse gas targets under the Paris Agreement. Instead of pushing for more ambitious targets, Australia actually lobbied to do less. This is woeful, embarrassing and criminal. Our government's climate policy is all smoke and mirrors, highlighted with untruths and spin. The truth is Australia's emissions are going up, not down. We will not meet our Paris targets as the government claims; we are on track to miss them completely. The government also likes to remind us that Australia only accounts for 1.3 per cent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions so our actions will make little difference. But 1.3 per cent is much more than our fair share as our population is 0.3 per cent of the global total. Most countries only produce 1-3 per cent of the global total. If we all claimed that our impact was insignificant, then the world would be cooked. Australia's position on climate action is significant, not only for the 1.3 per cent of greenhouse gases we produce, but for the potential influence on global policy. As a nation so proud of ""punching above its weight"" in fields such as sport and technology, Australia is missing a big chance to show global leadership on climate.Tony Fontes, Airlie Beach \"

[if !supportLists]? [endif]Pursuing the Paris Agreement pathway to limit warming to well below 2i?1/2C could allow a child born today to grow up in a world that reaches net zero emissions by their 31st birthday, and secure a healthier future for coming generations. \~\~ The report examined progress on climate change and human health in Australia, tracked across 31 indicators divided into five broad sections: climate change impacts, exposures and vulnerability; adaptation, planning and resilience for health; mitigation actions and health co-benefits; finance and economics; and public and political engagement. A number of new indicators were introduced this year, including one focused on wildfire exposure, and another on engagement in health and climate change in the corporate sector. Associate Professor Yuming Guo from the School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, who led section one of the report focusing on climate change impacts, exposures and vulnerability, said increases in heat continue to present a leading source of climate change-related health risk in Australia, and this trend is likely to continue. ""Despite uncertainties created by the large variability in daily and seasonal temperatures, there's been a striking upward trend in the rate of increase in maximum temperatures over the past two decades. ""Large increases in heatwave intensity are also evident over the same period, with consequent risks for health, particularly among people experiencing underlying vulnerability and disadvantage,"" said Associate Professor Guo. ""Additionally, hot years in terms of both maximum and minimum annual temperatures continued to be associated with higher suicide rates. ""We've found little evidence to suggest that Australia is acting effectively to mitigate these multiple heat-related risks for physical and mental health. This is particularly concerning in the context of a growing and ageing population,"" he said. Australia was the only country to produce its own national Countdown assessment report in 2018. It found that overall, Australia is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change on health, and that policy inaction in this regard threatens Australian lives. The current report presents the first annual update of this assessment tracking Australia's engagement with, and progress on, this vitally important issue, and found that Australia performed poorly across many of the indicators in comparison to other developed countries.

Clintel will present their ""No Climate Emergency"" petition at the Climate Reality Forum. This petition has already been presented to the UN Secretary General, the European Commission and the European Parliament. Clintel says that computerised global temperature simulation models are unfit for the purpose of setting climate policies - they have consistently run hot for 20 years. The real global climate has warm and cold cycles. Current global temperatures are about as warm as the Medieval Warm era (which was followed by the Little Ice Age). There is no uniform global temperature at any place or any time, and no one knows what ideal temperature we should aim for - the Frigid Zone would probably like it warmer, the Torrid Zone would probably like it cooler. It's time to stop the chasing. We need a grown-up debate allowing all sides to present their science on ""Man-made Global Warming"". Clintel says ""There is no climate emergency"".

He has no choice - the ocean is lapping at his doorstep. ""The problem here is we are facing rising sea levels right now,"" he told the ABC by phone. ""My home is one of the homes that is being touched by the sea."" His house, in the village of Narikoso on Ono Island in Fiji, is where his grandparents grew up. The villagers have planted mangroves and tried to build a seawall out of rocks, but the island is becoming inundated as the tide rises. Mr Saukitoga's house falls in an area severely prone to rising sea levels and it is a danger for his children, he told the ABC, as the sounds of his grandchild playing could be heard in the background. ""It upsets me, but there's no other option [than to move],"" he said. ""We're looking forward to the relocation because we're not looking after ourselves, but just we care about my children and my future generation."" Twenty million displaced each year Mr Saukitoga is one of the 20 million people internally displaced each year by climate change, according to a HYPERLINK http://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-02/greta-thunberg-late-cop25-climate-meeting-madrid/11758518 new Oxfam briefing paper People are now three times more likely to be forced from their homes by climate-fuelled disasters than by conflict, https://media.oxfam.org.au/2019/12/climate-fuelled-disasters-forcing-people-from-homes/ according to the charity's analysis Those figures would include HYPERLINK Australians who have lost their homes in bushfires . The Forced from Home briefing paper - Oxfam's analysis of Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre data - was released as the HYPERLINK United Nations climate summit HYPERLINK COP25 kicked off in Spain on Monday. Eighty per cent of those displaced by climate change live in Asia, and the Pacific is particularly at risk, according to the paper. Fiji is listed among the top 10 countries where people are most at risk of displacement due to extreme weather events, alongside Tuvalu, the Philippines, Vanuatu and Tonga. ""It is the world's poorest countries and communities, which bear little responsibility for global carbon pollution, that face the highest risk of climate-fuelled displacement,"" the Oxfam report says. It says extreme weather is the single biggest driver of internal displacement worldwide, but the number of refugees from conflict is also rising, and there is ""increasing evidence that the climate crisis is exacerbating instability in many regions ... and increasing the risk of conflict in the future"". In Tuvalu tropical cyclones have displaced 4.5 per cent of the population, while in Fiji Cyclone Winston in 2016 impacted 350,000 people, destroyed 24,000 homes, and cost the country one-fifth of its GDP in disaster-response funding. Fiji has since proposed the ambitious Climate Change Act, and has earmarked more than 80 communities for relocation. The now-abandoned village of Vunidogoloa is a case in point, the Oxfam report says, for ""how even the carefully planned relocation of a small community a short distance from its ancestral land can create considerable challenges"". Amid rising sea levels, HYPERLINK /news/2013-02-06/an-kiribati-buys-fiji-land-for-food-security/4503472 Kiribati has also purchased a portion of land in Fiji to ensure the country's food security.

""Australia is taking action to cut global emissions and our Climate Solutions Package sets out to the last tonne how we will meet our 2030 target,"" Mr Taylor said in a statement to the ABC. He said new data released last week showed Australia's emissions were lower than when the Coalition took power in 2013. Those figures showed the lowest emissions output was in 2016. ""The Pacific is Australia's home and we share the region's responsibilities and challenges - particularly in addressing the impact of climate change,"" he said.

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia52","Global emissions are way off target: what needs to happen","March 15, 2020 Sunday 7:20 AM EST","The Conversation - Africa","At the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, countries set goals that require halving carbon emissions by 2030. In a new piece in Nature, Professor Harald Winkler, as part of an international team, delivers the bad news that the emissions gap - between what countries pledged to then and what needs to be done now - is growing. He also points to small signs of hope that the climate crisis can still be addressed. 1. How much has the emissions gap grown by? How was this established? The emissions gap has grown significantly since 2010, when the first HYPERLINK Emissions Gap Report HYPERLINK https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00571-x comment in Nature led by my colleague Niklas H\'f6hne, professor at the University of Wageningen, reflected on these increases. Our \~ HYPERLINK https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00571-x analysis shows that the gap has widened by as much as four times since 2010. How much exactly depends on the details. Our conclusions are based on a synthesis of all 10 editions of the United Nations Environment Programme's gap report. Each year for the past 10 years, this report has examined the difference (the ""gap"") between what countries have pledged to do individually to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, and what they need to do collectively to meet agreed temperature limits. The 2015 HYPERLINK https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2016/09/the-paris-agreement-faqs/ Paris Agreement aims to keep global temperature increase to less than 2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels - and possibly 1.5\'b0C. There are three reasons for the gap: a HYPERLINK https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00571-x 14% increase in emissions from 2008 to 2018; \~ HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/cop21/eng/10a01.pdf#page=2 global agreement on a lower limit on global temperature; and insufficient commitments by countries. With more stringent global temperature limits now agreed, it's now \~ HYPERLINK https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00571-x projected that 25% lower emissions will be needed to meet the goal of 2\'b0C and 55% for 1.5\'b0C. 2. What are the implications? In our study of the gap reports, we found that the required emissions cuts from 2020 to 2030 are now more than 7% per year on average for the 1.5\'b0C temperature limit set in Paris and 3% for 2\'b0C. Had serious climate action begun in 2010, the cuts required to meet the emissions levels for 2\'b0C would have been 2% per year, on average. Instead, among the top seven emitting countries or regions, one has lower emissions (the EU), another slightly lower (India), three show no change (the US, Russia and China) and two are higher (Brazil and Indonesia). Together with other countries, the overall trend of rising emissions has not been reversed over the past 10 years - so now there is less time to reach the goal. The time window for halving global emissions has narrowed: in the words of the Nature report, in 2010, the world thought it had 30 years to halve global emissions of greenhouse gases. Today, we know that this must happen in ten years. In plain language, a decade of insufficient political action on climate change means that nations must now do four times the work - or do the same work in one-third of the time - to comply with the climate pact they made in Paris. The less action countries take collectively to cut carbon, the higher the temperature increase and the more severe the impacts. The poor, who are least responsible for greenhouse gas emissions, suffer the most from its impacts. 3. What are the urgent steps that need to be taken to reverse the trend? The gap is so huge that governments, the private sector and communities need to switch into crisis mode, and to make their climate pledges more ambitious. Immediate action is needed in a climate emergency - while ensuring equity. Given the delay in action, much more rapid emission reductions will be needed to keep the temperature goals in reach. Instead of developing in a way that involves high consumption and high emissions, countries need to provide people with basic needs through low emissions and sustainable development, tackling socio-economic inequality at the same time. Action is now required from all countries, including those that are still developing to meet basic needs. 4. What good work is being done to control emissions that others can follow? HYPERLINK https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/21252030%20Agenda%20for%20Sustainable%20Development%20web.pdf sustainable development goals One sign of hope is that the HYPERLINK https://www.irena.org/costs costs of renewable energy are falling fast, globally and in sub-Saharan Africa. In South Africa, President Cyril Ramaphosa presented a proposal to the HYPERLINK https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/ 2019 climate change summit HYPERLINK http://www.dirco.gov.za/docs/speeches/2019/cram0923.htm fund the faster phasing-out of coal without negative effects on workers and communities that depend on it. International climate finance is a critical ingredient to support a just transition. The comment in Nature also includes examples of what other emerging economies that depend on coal, such as China and India, are doing. They are adjusting the fuel price, capping its consumption, reducing plans for new coal-fired power plants and supporting renewable energy production. Much more must be done, and quickly - while addressing poverty, energy access and urbanisation - to address both development and climate change. The same is true for South Africa, which still depends on coal for 83% of its electricity and 59% of all http://www.energy.gov.za/files/media/explained/2018-South-African-Energy-Sector-Report.pdf energy . The country needs to adopt a vision for a just transition that includes net-zero emissions by 2050 or earlier, and put in place the laws, institutions and practical actions to achieve that goal. South Africa has a HYPERLINK https://www.gov.za/documents/carbon-tax-act-15-2019-english-afrikaans-23-may-2019-0000 Carbon Tax Act and in 2020 the country needs to promulgate a framework Climate Change Act.

To make the transition just, communities and workers who are dependent on coal will have to be integrally involved in the change, ensuring they have sustainable livelihoods.

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia53","Is Morrison up to the challenge of net zero emissions?","February 22, 2020 Saturday","The Australian","The climate change argument has moved from the science - whether it's happening or not - to whether, and how, the world can achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The implications of this change for Australia are impossible to overstate. This year's United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP 26, in Glasgow in November will be as significant a watershed as COP 21 in Paris in 2015, except this time it won't be about measuring and limiting degrees of warming, but about targeting emissions directly instead: the world is now being pressed to sign up to net zero emissions by 2050. Britain's Conservative government kicked off its chairmanship of the conference last month by calling for other countries to join it in pledging net zero. At the same time, the Business Council of Australia put its own stake in the ground with a ""scoping study"" also calling for net zero by 2050. The ALP on Friday formally adopted it as policy, which will ensure the government does not. But Scott Morrison has started working on his Glasgow speech, which looks like being a reworking of Energy Minister Angus Taylor's effort in Madrid last December - that is, it will be about technology. Apparently the government will put out a ""technology road map"" next month that will presumably be a series of kites to see which ones fly. Morrison's task will be to keep up with the new global conversation about climate change without uttering the words ""net zero"" and definitely without reheating the National Energy Guarantee and thereby alienating the Queensland section of the Coalition. ""We favour technology over taxation,"" Morrison declared this week. ""You want to get global emissions down? That's what you need. Meetings won't achieve that. Technology does and I can tell you taxes won't achieve it either."" The BCA has placed itself squarely at odds with this rhetoric with this month's scoping study, which says: ""The simplest, most efficient method of achieving this transition is a price signal that places a value on lower-emissions."" As the host of the bushfires that played a big part in shifting world opinion towards more radical action on climate change, the Australian speech in Glasgow will get quite a lot of attention, but whoever gets the job of delivering it (and it should be the Prime Minister, not the hapless Taylor) will have a tough job of sounding vaguely convincing while talking only about technology. Nowhere as tough, though, as the job of actually achieving zero net emissions by 2050 or of preparing Australia for a post-fossil fuel world. Australia's prosperity has been built to a large extent on selling fossil fuels, but we are now a tobacco company. The government has been deceiving coal miners and their communities that there is a future for their product, trying to play both sides of the Blue Mountains, and insisting that Australia can stand aside from the global push to decarbonise. But this has been a political rather than economic or scientific posture that was always going to be exposed as a lie. As Paul Kelly wrote in his article on this subject in these pages last Saturday: ""The coming epic clash over net-zero carbon emissions reduction targets by 2050 is not just about the economy and climate change; it is about Australian democracy in an age of globalisation and universal climate threat."" What the UK, the UN and now the BCA are calling for is nothing short of an economic and political revolution for Australia, but it is also what the world has been edging towards since Kyoto in 1997. It seems 2020 may be the year when the implications of this 23-year-long slow walk will be laid bare. In the Financial Times this week, economist Martin Wolf wrote that to achieve net zero ""we must move beyond (burning fossil fuels) almost completely"". A zero-carbon economy, he wrote, would require four to five times as much electricity to be generated as there is now, and all from non-fossil fuel sources. Hydrogen consumption would have to increase enormously. Hydrogen is one of the technologies that the Morrison government hopes will get it off the hook in November, but the transformation required is pretty much impossible on its own. In its scoping study, the BCA put a number on the investment needed: $22bn each year until 2050, in order for Australia to be part of the global investment requirement of $440bn per year that will be needed to deliver net-zero emissions. And that's on top of a price on carbon, not instead of. The task is not just about funding that, it will require a fundamental shift in how the Australian economy works, rethinking the viability of large parts of the country, and the role of government in supporting regional areas and intervening in the market. And don't forget livestock: there is a real and rapidly developing threat to the meat industry, partly from the need to limit greenhouse gas emissions from livestock to achieve net zero by 2050, but also from the global groundswell towards veganism and away from industrial-scale killing and processing of animals. And if you think that's not a big deal, you're not paying attention. In addition to that, we are currently getting a lesson in the vulnerability of exports to China - especially services like education and tourism - through the coronavirus epidemic.So Australia has been suddenly confronted with a series of external economic policy challenges, on top of the homegrown one of chronic low wages growth, that will require the kind of sophisticated national planning and consensus building that has been entirely absent for well over a decade - ever since the attempt to fashion a bipartisan energy policy in 2009 was torpedoed by the right-wing of the Liberal Party, led by Nick Minchin and Tony Abbott. Is the Morrison government even remotely capable of the leadership required to turn that around and come up with a plan based on national consensus?

One of its top four priorities is an agreement with Australia and Britain's Foreign Secretary will arrive here on Thursday to formally kick things off. What will be in it? The British High Commissioner to Australia, Vicky Treadell joined me earlier. High Commissioner, welcome back to AM. VICKY TREADELL: Thank you Sabra. Great to be here. SABRA LANE: Did you crack champagne or perhaps sip a British pint on Friday night when Brexit was done? VICKY TREADELL: Well, for me it will have to be craft beer. So it was, you know, a historic moment for Britain and that alone you need to recognise. SABRA LANE: Now that Brexit has happened, have talks officially started between Britain and Australia on trade? VICKY TREADELL: Well, we've been talking for the last two years. A lot of preparatory work has been done and even as the Prime Minister referenced in his speech yesterday, he was exchanging texts or WhatsApp's with your Prime Minister on Friday. So, our two trade ministers have made it very clear an FTA (free trade agreement) is a top priority and Australia will be one of the first four we hope to get over the line. SABRA LANE: You've previously said a trade deal with Australia should be bold and ambitious. What does that mean for ordinary Australians? VICKY TREADELL: I think we are open to discuss everything, to reduce tariffs or remove them across a range of sectors. We will want market access for areas of strength for us. So, for example, financial and related professional services, being able to come into the banking sector. Equally we know that agriculture is an important part of Australia's ask so Australian beef farmers, dairy farmers will be hoping for new and more open opportunities in the UK. SABRA LANE: What about broader work rights? VICKY TREADELL: Well, that is absolutely an area that will be discussed because we want the best talent from Australia across a range of sectors in our business and industry. We will always need skills and where we have labour shortages and likewise for Australia. We are looking at your points-based system as a model. We will need to tweak it for our particular context and industry base and where we see the ask. So, there will be opportunities, I think, ahead. SABRA LANE: Boris Johnson has given a speech overnight about trade and it sounds like he is talking tough about the new deal that certainly he wants to do with the EU. He is saying he wants to be a super man and he has also said that one option is a deal like Australia's with tariffs on some goods. Is that a second best deal given that many farmers are unhappy with the arrangements that Australia does have currently in the EU area? We're negotiating at the moment for a deal with the EU. VICKY TREADELL: Yet I wouldn't say it is a second best. We haven't really got into the details so we can't make a judgement on what the deal is. Best in class, second best or whatever but we know what our ambition is - to get the best possible deal and I think because of our comfort and understanding of each other, the closeness between our two countries, you know, when mates decide we want to make something really work, we have a much better chance of landing it in the right place. SABRA LANE: You've said that the Prime Minister wants this to be a template for others. How soon then do you want this done? VICKY TREADELL: Well, as soon as we can achieve it. This process will require both sides, our negotiators, our technical experts to really put their shoulder to the wheel. We've heard your Minister for Trade, Simon Birmingham, say within a year and I would think it would be something around that but not much more than beyond a year. SABRA LANE: The French have put Australia on notice saying that ambitious climate change policies will be a crucial element in any future deal that we do with the EU. Is that problematic for Britain? Do you want to see ambitious climate change policies in a deal that you do? VICKY TREADELL: Well, Britain has made it very clear that they want everyone to have a greater level of ambition. We are taking a global leadership role on climate change. We are hosting COP26 (2020 United Nations Climate Change Conference ) and at COP26 we will be asking all nations to look again at where they stand. Obviously we are working closely with the Australian Government to see what the art of the possible is. Now I won't go into details. These are ongoing conversations that we will have in the coming months but where we know we can work very closely with Australia is in the whole area of renewables, the new technology, the new jobs that will come. The transition of our own economy, the lessons we have learnt and how we can share that with others. SABRA LANE: Given there might be a trade shock around the world as a result of the coronavirus, will that turbocharge the ambition here to get it done? VICKY TREADELL: Well, these kinds of pandemics are a reality that we have to live with every few years and in each year that something like this breaks, the global economy will take a hit. You know, travel drops, we're seeing the impact on tourism for example. But whatever we do with an FTA has to be future-proof. We have to be agile, we have to be able to deal with the consequences of events like that. So here too, we have an opportunity to work together. SABRA LANE: High Commissioner, thanks for talking to AM. VICKY TREADELL: Thank you very much indeed. \"

The 25th Conference of the Parties ( COP25 ) meeting in Madrid is scheduled to debate the so-called ""rule book"" for the goals agreed by the nearly 200 Paris signatory nations. According to draft ""guidance on co-operative approaches"", one option for debate will be that ""Kyoto Protocol units, or reductions underlying such units, may not be used by any party toward its [nationally determined goals]"". The Morrison government has repeatedly said Australia is entitled to use ""surplus"" units the country will generate during the Kyoto period (2008-20) to count against the 2021-30 Paris target. Australia's latest emissions projections report, released at the weekend, showed the government is planning to count 411 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent from the Kyoto-agreement era. The use of such credits would mean Australia could meet its pledge of cutting 2005-level emissions by 26 per cent to 28 per cent by 2030 with minimal effort. Malte Meinshausen, co-director of the Energy Transition Hub at Melbourne University and a former climate negotiator with Germany, said it was good the Kyoto option appears ""on the table"". The use of Kyoto credits was ""a betrayal of the trust which all countries signed up to at Paris"", Professor Meinshausen said, noting New Zealand, European Union and Pacific states opposed them. While climate laggards such as Russia and Brazil may join Australia in opposing the Kyoto ""option"", ""it's a reminder that the international community does not want to give up easily the good co-operative fruits developed in Paris"", he said. Angus Taylor, the Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister who will attend the Madrid talks, said Australia had ""a track record of which all Australians can be proud"". Adam Bandt, Greens climate spokesman, said, ""Scott Morrison's dodgy climate accounting is now up in lights on the world stage. ""Australia is burning at home, and Angus Taylor is turning up at an international event asking for the right to keep on polluting.""

Science tells us that a major factor in these extreme weather events is human induced climate change, a hypothesis increasingly accepted by the Australian public. Growing acceptance has provoked a demand for leadership on climate change. Sadly, this is not forthcoming. The recently concluded Conference of the Parties 25 in Madrid was to provide a plan of action to limit climate change to below two degrees. COP 25 was not as successful as it should have been, due in part to the obstruction by wealthy nations, including Australia, to critical discussion points, such as trading of carbon credits, finance to assist developing nations to combat climate change and raising targets to a level consistent with averting catastrophic climate change. Because of lack of policies, advocacy for carry over carbon credits and obvious ongoing commitment to the use and export of fossil fuels, Australia's performance at COP 25 did little to inspire faith in its leadership either at home or abroad. Australia currently shows little inclination to improve performance, which is currently ranked 53rd out of the 58 countries assessed on the Climate Change Performance Index. Our leaders appear to be more interested in saving our fossil fuel industries than the fate of the planet. The lack of leadership and action reflected by our Federal Government has permeated to all levels of government.

There are those who would like to constructively confront the issue, but they have been howled down by the majority.

Australia is now exposed as a key blocker of the next global agreement on emissions reduction, which will no doubt please those in the clubhouse back home but might make it awkward next time Scott Morrison wants to claim that Australia is doing its bit. The Prime Minister started the year getting publicly shamed on climate change during a tour of the Pacific Islands in January and ended the year getting publicly shamed on the global stage at the UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid ( COP25 ). COP25 , which is that ""technology will be a key driver of the global transition to lower emissions"". He would have intended that as a distraction from the ridicule over Australia's use of carry-over Kyoto credits to meet Paris commitments, but it also happens to be true. So let's not end the year glumly surveying the charred wasteland of the government's climate change policies. In his fine, mostly optimistic book Super Power - Australia's Low Carbon Opportunity, Ross Garnaut describes how the nation can become ""the superpower of the post-carbon world economy"". Today's column, my last for the year, is devoted to two examples of how Garnaut's optimism and Taylor's distraction may be starting to come true: the Sun Cable project backed by Andrew Forrest and Michael Cannon-Brookes, and a startling invention by a small private company based in Sydney called Star Scientific. Sun Cable is a plan to build a $21bn, 10 gigawatt solar farm in the Northern Territory and export the power by cable to Singapore. It is being led by David Griffin, the Singapore-based -finance director of Dyson; Cannon-Brookes and Forrest have agreed to provide money for the initial feasibility studies. The project would involve 15,000ha of solar panels with large-scale battery storage (either in NT, Singapore or both) plus a cable running under the sea past Indonesia. There might also be a cable connecting it to the National Grid in Australia for trading any power not covered by the offtake agreement with Singapore. Does it stack up? An energy analyst friend ran the numbers on the back of an envelope (not -officially endorsed by Griffin). Assuming a 10GW solar array, with 22,000 MWh of storage and a 4000km high voltage direct current cable, there would be a solar capacity factor of 33 per cent and line and battery losses of 15 per cent on the trip. Power delivered would be 24.5 million MWh. Singapore's wholesale energy price is $112 per MWh - from LNG. My friend assumes an offtake agreement discount of 10 per cent, so adjusted price of $101. Estimated revenue is $2.5bn a year. Capex is $21bn over three years. With no debt and a 25-year life, the project generates an internal rate of return of 9.29 per cent - perfectly acceptable. However, there would be debt - possibly 60-70 per cent gearing based on a bankable offtake agreement with the Singapore government - in which case the IRR would be much more than that. So it stacks up. In a sense it's a way for Australia to ""export"" its land, and more specifically the vast amounts of sunshine landing on it in the outback. Sun Cable is very unlikely to be the only very large-scale solar project, and in fact Macquarie is working on another one already. Star Scientific claims to have discovered a way to replace the coal in existing power stations - using the same turbines - with hydrogen produced with renewable energy, not burning it but chemically combining it with oxygen to generate heat (and water). The company is 48 per cent-owned by Andrew Horvath, having been founded by his late father Stephen who, 50 years ago, had a dream to develop fusion energy. Private investors own the other 52 per cent. Fusion didn't happen but after Stephen retired, Andrew and his team stumbled on a compound material that acts as a catalyst to combine hydrogen and oxygen to create water - and generate heat. Horvath is claiming 700C and -potentially higher temperatures, with more catalyst surface area and more hydrogen. There isn't enough hydrogen in the air for the chemistry to work so it needs to be provided - in large quantities (there's -appar-ently enough oxygen in the air). I should add here that I haven't seen it working, so I'm taking Horvath's word for it. He says he has bought a 1.5MW turbine and leased some premises in Berkeley Vale, NSW, and plans to run it as a pilot plant next year. If he is right, and Star Scientific's catalyst converting hydrogen and oxygen into water can replace coal boilers in steam-driven power generators using the same turbines, it would be a game-changer. Not only could all the existing coal-fired generators be given a new lease of life, it would create a large-scale market for hydrogen, both here and overseas - potentially much larger than the electric vehicle market that hydrogen backers are currently aiming at. It would support the new hydrogen industry that Chief Scientist Alan Finkel has persuaded COAG to get behind. Horvath says the process would also work in very small-scale generators that would replace diesel generators or simply power specific factories and homes. The bottom line is that some combination of technology, renewables and hydrogen is the -future of energy, and the good news is that it probably doesn't matter what the government does, or doesn't do. It would be better if Morrison wasn't standing in the way brandishing a lump of coal, but very large-scale renewable energy now stacks up on its own, even if the electrons are exported.Alan Kohler is editor in chief of InvestSMART.com.au \"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia60","UN cautions: warming threat this century is dire","November 27, 2019 Wednesday","Australian Financial Review","Sydney | The concentration of climate-changing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has hit a record high as countries fail to curb emissions from fossil fuels and other sources, the United Nations has warned. In its 10th annual Environment Program Emissions Gap report, the UN says global temperatures could climb another 3.9 degrees celsius by the end of the century - which would be catastrophic. This made emissions reduction by the biggest emitters more urgent than ever, the UN said. Some countries would have to almost triple their emission-reducing efforts to hold temperature rises to the agreed maximum 2030 target of 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels. ""As things stand, temperatures can be expected to rise by 3.4 to 3.9 degrees celsius this century, bringing wide-ranging and destructive climate impacts,"" the report's authors warn. If nations were to meet the more preferable 1.5 degree warming limit, they would have to cut their emissions five times over, they warned. Relevant ministers and other experts from around the world will converge on Madrid in five days for the COP25 ""rule-book"" conference to check in on the implementation of the Paris agreement on reducing emissions. Even if all current national plans to cut emissions under the Paris plan were fully implemented, temperatures would climb beyond the the 1.5 degrees goal ahead of 2030, the report says. Greenhouse gas emissions have risen 1.5 per cent in the last decade, with China, the European Union, India and the United States contributing more than 55 per cent of the total. Within and beyond that, the G20 has contributed 78 per cent. In 2018, total global emissions of carbon dioxide reached a record high of 55.3 giga-tonnes. The bulk of these - 68 per cent - came from burning fossil fuels to generate energy. ""We need quick wins to reduce emissions as much as possible in 2020,"" said Inger Andersen, the UN program's executive director. Australia is hoping to secure a carve-out in Madrid by meeting its obligations through ""over-achievement"" credits accumulated since countries began pledging emission reductions. Australia would be the only country seeking this carve-out. ""If this carry-forward approach is not taken, Australia will not achieve its 2020 pledge,"" the report notes. Unless global emissions fall by 7.6 per cent each year over the next decade, the world would miss the chance to get on-track to limit global warming by 1.5 degrees, the report said. This is the preferred agreed temperature rise under the 2015 Paris accord, from which President Donald Trump withdrew the US in 2017. The gap between what countries should be doing and what they are doing has never been greater, the report says. Patricia Espinosa of the UN Framework on Climate Change said last week nations should reconsider the way they calculate total country-based emissions at the next round of negotiations. \"

Whether contending with melting ice or rising water in her performances, her aim is to ""create an image that might capture somebody's attention and imagination"". ""I see my work as a continuation of what my ancestors did; I'm continuing on in the way they used art to tell stories, to provoke thoughts, ideas and empathy."" A different kind of crisis In Melbourne for HYPERLINK https://dancemassive.com.au/ Dance Massive in May last year, Taumoepeau faced a different kind of emergency: a bacterial infection that ""went rogue"", causing meningitis and six embolic strokes.

'training' [exercises] that are really familiar to me as a trained dancer,"" Taumoepeau recalls. ""I created these sessions for myself where ...

""Even if I wasn't physically moving, in my mind I was moving these things,"" Taumoepeau says. ""The doctors expected me to recover, but the speed at which I recovered was a bit gobsmacking for them and for me."" The Last Resort Taumoepeau says she was determined to participate in this year's Biennale of Sydney, the first edition of the festival curated by an Indigenous Australian: artist Brook Andrew. ""It was so incredible to be a part of his vision, of HYPERLINK /news/2019-04-10/biennale-of-sydney-2020-nirin-to-bring-artists-at-edge-to-centre/10986152 a First Nations vision As part of this new work, titled The Last Resort, Taumoepeau and her cousin Taliu Aloua (a life-long collaborator) walked over a pile of glass bottles gathered from Sydney nightclubs, using brick sandals and an 'ike (Tongan mallet), to crush the glass.

Stacked sacks of empty bottles form an ""imaginary coastline"" of sandbags around the floor of broken glass. Taumoepeau says that by grinding the bottles down to their core material of sand - the material of islands and atolls - she was asking who, a result of rising sea levels, will be forced to do the work of ""reconstructing an island"". ""It's vulnerable Indigenous communities - the frontline communities - doing all the heavy lifting around the transformation that needs to happen in order for our planet to survive,"" she says.

The 16-year-old schoolgirl, who started her activism career by wagging school and protesting outside the Swedish parliament, is back in the headlines again after being named Time magazine's Person of the Year. Groups have been bestowed the honour 21 times and non-human entities such as The Computer and The Endangered Earth have won twice. But none has been more polarising than Greta, main picture. She is the darling of the Left, more popular than a popstar for the kids and a red flag to conservatives. Margaret Atwood, author of dystopian novel The Handmaid's Tale, compared her to Joan of Arc. Environmentalist actor Leonardo DiCaprio, pictured with Greta above right, called her a ""leader of our time"". Long-time activist Jane Fonda recently accepted the teenager's Glamour Woman of the Year award in the US. ""I'd been feeling anxious and depressed because I knew I wasn't doing enough in the face of the catastrophe that is looming."" Greta also graced the front pages of influential cultural publications such as i-D and Teen Vogue. These are not popularity awards but give kudos for disruption and notoriety. They are a culmination of a clever strategy driven by Team Thunberg and her wealthy and social media-savvy supporters. While she has been encouraging kids to strike for climate change across the world, lecturing leaders at the COP25 and sailing across the Atlantic sans fossil fuel emissions, people of significant profile have been clamouring to jump aboard her bandwagon. The schoolgirl was not alone on her highly publicised journey to the United Nations in New York and travelled on the Malizia II, a sailboat with a totally neutral carbon footprint that had no toilet, running water or hot food. Her team included the boat's owner, Prince of Monaco Pierre Casiraghi. Casiraghi, who is also a shareholder in a helicopter company, told London's The Times that he was not ""here to advocate change or how to do things ... I'm just transporting Greta"".

The conference that wrapped up last week in Bonn, Germany, debated, among other things, the rules of the Paris Agreement. The discussions included whether Australia should be allowed to count the surplus it expects to generate during the Kyoto Protocol period that runs to 2020. On the government's projections, 328 million tonnes of Australia's pledged cut of about 695 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent could be met by counting the Kyoto surplus for the Paris pledge over the decade from 2021-2030. The Association of Small Island states, including Tuvalu, opposed the use of ""carryover credits"". South Korea, the European Union and New Zealand were also against using the surplus, according to Kate Dooley, a researcher with the Climate and Energy College at the University of Melbourne, who was an observer at the conference. ""Discussions here in Bonn have made it clear that most countries do not accept the carry-over of Kyoto units into the Paris Agreement,"" Dr Dooley said. ""The world's most vulnerable countries have spoken out to say that accounting tricks, such as those the Australian government intends to use, are not consistent with limiting warming to 1.5 degrees."" Angus Taylor, the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction defended Australia's stance. ""We have made responsible, achievable and balanced commitments to reduce our emissions and we have a strong track record in meeting and beating our targets,"" Mr Taylor said. ""We will meet our Paris commitment to reduce emissions by 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 and we will do this while growing the economy, creating jobs, protecting our environment and keeping power prices down. ""We have already over-achieved on our commitment under the Kyoto Protocol, exceeding our 2012 targets and expecting to exceed our 2020 targets by 328 million tonnes - something few countries have done."" The Bonn talks were largely focused on preparing the rules for Article 6 of the Paris Agreement ahead of a Conference of the Parties ( COP25 ) summit in Santiago, Chile, later this year. The article is one of the main unresolved issues from the pact signed in Paris in 2015. The Carbon Pulse newswire said while the new text agreed at Bonn had the potential to scupper Australia's plans to use Kyoto credits without a specific prohibition in place, they would still be able to be banked.

After tweeting a picture of herself on the train floor, alongside five bags, Greta was forced to -explain that she had been sitting on the floor for only part of the journey because a train from Basel had failed. Greta admitted she had got a seat ""behind Gottingen"". ""Of course that's not a problem and I never said it would be one,"" she said, adding: ""Crowded trains are a great sign because it means that there is a great deman-d for rail travel."" Her account was backed up by a Swedish journalist who had written an exclusive story with the climate activist days before.

Cyclones, the odd fire and a flood made living here seem volatile, but not now. The issues we've experienced now seem like an inconvenience compared with the devastation in NSW and Victoria. Thanks to strict building codes, extreme weather events in our part of the world tend to leave our homes mostly intact (which is probably cold comfort to many flood victims who are only just moving back in) but a home that remains standing is something, compared with the nothingness of ash and charred ruins this growing group of victims face. It took days after Cyclone Yasi in 2011 for the ADF to get approval to assist with the clean-up. Once it relieved the overstretched SES, our streets miraculously cleared and life slowly returned to normal. This experience no doubt shaped policy for the next emergency, where immediate action was requested to prepare for the 2019 floods. ADF members hit the suburbs and went door to door with sandbags, then once the waters rose moved straight into evacuation and rescue mode. From personal experience the mere presence of these well-equipped professionals trained to deal with dangerous and stressful situations had an immediate calming effect; so to see our Chinooks and the navy finally called into action to help with the current bushfire catastrophe won't just help with logistics, but will bring indescribable relief. Should our ADF be expanded to include a National Guard component like the US, which report to the governor of their respective state unless called to protect US domestic interests in times of conflict or natural disaster? Despite emergency workers in each state being faced with an almost insurmountable job under catastrophic conditions, Scott Morrison refused to meet with the group of retired fire chiefs in April 2019. He has also refused to bring forward the Council of Australian Governments meeting (COAG) from March, and continues to endorse the smoke and mirrors 'carry-over credits' delivered at last month's COP25 . Volunteers stand up, while staff from essential services (and the media) are routinely called off leave to return to work. Yet incredibly, as townships burned, wildlife and stock were decimated and lives lost, the NSW Minister for Emergency Services, David Elliot, remained holidaying in Europe. He's now said he'll return by today. Our PM also copped flak for continuing his Hawaii holiday, yet despite $190,000 of our taxes spent on an 'empathy consultant' in October to help deal with drought-stricken farmers, he appeared oblivious to the expectation of leadership in an unprecedented crisis. This escalated when he returned to Australia to host a private fireworks-viewing party at Kirribilli, followed by a photo opportunity with the Australian cricket team the next day. How good are fireworks? When the PM finally ventured into the disaster zone, he was heckled and his handshakes refused by both residents and volunteer firefighters.

Greenpeace brought us this little dispatch from the conference. Fijian clergyman and climate advocate Reverend James Bhagwan had some words for Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison at the conference, which is dubbed COP25 . Without singling Australia out, the reverend used the biblical story of the good Samaritan to describe the role of some countries who claim ""they are part of the Pacific family but leave us lying, bleeding, dying on the side of the road"". ""So the question is, who really is our neighbour in the geopolitical context of climate change?"" The reverend told the audience that when Pacific nations were facing obliteration ""we're hearing words like 'come and pick our fruit'. That's not very loving as a neighbour,"" he said, referring to recent comments by Australian Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack. Earlier this year, the Nationals leader trivialised the plight of Pacific islanders by suggesting that even if their homes were swallowed by rising sea levels, Pacific people would survive because they could come to Australia to work in the agricultural sector as fruit pickers. ""Australia is on fire and the Pacific is drowning. Our collective futures hang in the balance,"" Reverend Bhagwan said. All this does make us wonder.

In its 10th annual Environment Program (UNEP) Emissions Gap report, the UN says that global temperatures could climb another 3.9 degrees celsius by the end of the century, which would be catastrophic. This made emissions-reduction by the biggest emitters more urgent than ever, the UN said. Some countries would have to almost triple their emission-reducing efforts to hold temperature rises to the agreed maximum 2030 target of 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels. ""As things stand, temperatures can be expected to rise by 3.4 to 3.9 degrees celsius this century, bringing wide-ranging and destructive climate impacts,"" the report's authors warn. If nations were to meet the more preferable 1.5 degree warming limit, they would have to cut their emissions five times over, they warned. The call for more aggressive emissions reduction comes five days before relevant ministers and other experts from around the world converge on Madrid, the Spanish capital, for the COP25 ""rule-book"" conference to check in on Paris agreement implementation. Even if all current national plans to cut emissions under the Paris Agreement were fully implemented, temperatures would climb beyond the the 1.5 degrees goal ahead of 2030, according to the report. Greenhouse gas emissions have risen 1.5 per cent in the last decade, with China, the European Union, India and the United States contributing more than 55 per cent of the total. Within and beyond that, the G20 has contributed 78 per cent. In 2018, total global emissions of carbon dioxide reached a record high of 55.3 giga-tonnes. The bulk of these - 68 per cent - came from burning fossil fuels to generate energy. The UNEP's executive director Inger Andersen said: ""We need quick wins to reduce emissions as much as possible in 2020."" Australia, for its part, is hoping to secure a carve-out in Madrid, by meeting its obligations through ""over-achievement"" credits accumulated since countries began pledging emission reductions. HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/22/australia-is-the-only-country-using-carryover-climate-credits-officials-admit Australia would be the only country seeking this carve-out. ""If this carry-forward approach is not taken, Australia will not achieve its 2020 pledge,"" the report notes. Unless global greenhouse gas emissions fall by 7.6 per cent each year over the next decade, the report found the world would miss the chance to get on-track to limit global warming by 1.5 degrees. This is the preferred agreed temperature rise under the 2015 Paris Climate Accord, from which the HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/world/donald-trump-seen-withdrawing-us-from-paris-climate-accord-20170602-gwiok5 United States president withdrew in 2017.

Only better technology will reduce worldwide CO2 emissions; UN pressure and current efforts won't do it. He is also to be commended for defending our efforts to be good world citizens and do what we were told was right (""We should be proud of our climate change efforts"", 31/12). But was it? Has all our massive spend on wind and solar power made any difference to the world's climate? With no way of checking such things our gullible politicians swallowed the ""CO2 is the problem, renewables will fix it"" line. This definitely changed our economy and power systems, but almost certainly not the climate. Our efforts have been an expensive folly. I would be delighted to have Angus set me right on this, but I bet he can't. Doug Hurst, Chapman, ACT In asserting that today's average Australian temperatures have risen 1.5C above the 1910-1950 average, Professor Eelco Rohling (""Slow the flow and let the soil drink its fill"", 31/12) would do well to check temperature records in the 1890s in rural NSW. In doing so, he should look at the handwritten records rather than the BOM's ""homogenised"" data as per Dr Jennifer Marohasy's investigations. He should also check the location of the recording equipment and heat island effects where asphalt, concrete and buildings have changed the temperature environment. Art Raiche, Killara, NSW I continue to hear climate change sceptics claiming the science behind anthropogenic global warming has been skewed to benefit vested interests. This is a laugh when you consider revenue generated from burning fossil fuels tops $100 trillion annually. Who stands to lose the most if we move to renewable energy sources? If for no other reason prudence should dictate we err on the side of caution and move toward both a sustainable energy solution and the reduction of global CO2 emissions. The fact is, most climate scientists believe a tipping point exists from which there may be no recovery. The consequences of getting it wrong are too horrific to consider for future generations. Tony Lewis, Noosa Heads, Qld Angus Taylor resorts to the overused ploy of using Australia's 1.3 per cent share of global emissions as an excuse for government inaction on climate change (""We should be proud of out climate change efforts"", 31/12). Our share of emissions may be ""only 1.3 per cent"", but we have only 0.3 per cent of the world's population: Australia ranks behind only Saudi Arabia on a per capita basis. If our coal exports were taken into account, as argued by some experts, we would be a long way ahead of the pack. That gives us no bragging rights and is hardly a platform from which to be lecturing developing countries on their carbon dioxide emissions. Despite the various claims by Taylor, Australia's emissions are still increasing, as they have since Labor's carbon price was repealed. To meet our Paris commitment, as promised by Taylor, Australia will use carry-over carbon credits from the Kyoto Protocol. We will be one of only three countries to use this accounting trick. All other countries regard this ruse as cheating and thumbing our collective nose at the world of climate change realists. Douglas Mackenzie, Deakin, ACT Angus Taylor says we need ""new productive technologies \'e2\€ \£6 that deliver emissions abatement while maintaining or strengthening economic growth"". Whether or not he participated in COP25 , he must have known the conference was told by the International Energy Agency that nuclear power must be part of the solution to global warming.

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia72","Drought pushes Australia's carbon emissions down","November 29, 2019 Friday 07:07 PM GMT","AFR Online","Drought, flood and the growth of renewable energy pushed Australia's greenhouse gas emissions down 0.1 per cent in the year to June 2019, ending a long period of rising emissions. Data released by the Department of the Environment and Energy on Friday showed that in the year to June, Australia emitted 532 million tons of carbon dioxide and equivalent greenhouse gases (Mt CO2 -e), down from 532.4 in the previous 12-month period. However, the Department said the reduction was a result of a recalculation of earlier measurements, and that in the June quarter emissions were flat on a seasonally adjusted basis, while on a trend basis they had actually begun to rise again by 0.3 per cent. Agricultural emissions exerted the strongest downward pressure, falling 5.9 per cent on the previous year to 67.4 Mt CO2-e, driven by decimated livestock numbers as a result of both drought and this year's floods in northern Queensland. Cows and sheep emit large volumes of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, during the digestive process, known as enteric fermentation. Electricity generation contributed 179.9 Mt CO2 -e, down 1.2 per cent for the year and 1.8 per cent for the quarter, although it remained by far the biggest single source of greenhouse gas emissions. The government said this reflected ""strong increases in hydro and windgeneration (42 and 14.8 per cent) and decreases in coal and natural gas generation (5.7 and 21.3 per cent) in the National Electricity Market"". Emissions in all other sectors increased. Fugitive emissions saw the biggest rise, going up 4.4 per cent to 56.4 Mt CO2-e, as a result of escaped methane during the natural gas extraction process. Gas production is booming, growing 10.1 per cent in the June quarter. Emissions from ""stationery energy"" - that is, fossil fuels burned directly by industry, rather than to generate electricity - increased 3.6 per cent to 100 Mt CO2-e. The result, which will be a welcome change in direction for the Morrison government after presiding over a period of rising emissions, comes ahead of next month's United Nations COP25 climate conference in Madrid. Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor focused on the reduction in emissions intensity and emissions per capita, both of which he said had fallen to their lowest levels in nearly three decades. ""For the first time, the Department of the Environment and Energy has prepared a consumption-based inventory. Emissions released in Australia and in other countries due to Australian domestic consumption have decreased by 4 per cent or 20 Mt CO2-e, to 450 Mt CO2-e in 2018-19,"" he said. ""Consumption-based emissions are 18 per cent or 102 Mt CO2-e lower in 2018-19 than in 2004-05."" Australia's Paris target of 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 is based on absolute emissions reductions, not per capita or in relation to GDP. Currently, Australia's emissions are 12.5 per cent below 2005 levels. Green group doubts Environmental groups doubted the reduction was the beginning of a downward trend. Climate Council Head of Research Dr Martin Rice said: ""Sadly, this drop is a blip. Renewables investment is set to dry up in the coming months. Our LNG exports are set to continue increasing. ""We need urgent and long-term cuts to our emissions in order to address the climate crisis. This requires our federal government to adopt a credible climate policy."" Mark Butler, Labor's climate change spokesman, seized on the 0.3 per cent trend rise in emissions in the June quarter. ""It's no surprise given Angus Taylor is too focused on picking political fights with local councils to deliver a credible national climate change policy,"" he said. ""This government's only plan is to waste an additional $2 billion, on top of the $2.5 billion already spent on Tony Abbott's failed climate policy which has only ever seen emissions rise."" \"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia73","Business steps up when government clearly is lacking","September 26, 2019 Thursday","The Australian","Scott Morrison was conspicuous by his absence at this week's UN conference on climate change , but Fortescue chairman Andrew Forrest was there to launch a global initiative to help cut the $US2.2 trillion ($3.2 trillion) in damage caused by plastic waste. In July BHP chief Andrew Mackenzie told a London audience of the miner's concerns about climate, which he later stressed was a board-backed pitch to extend BHP's minerals sales. After the tragedy of last year's collapse of the industry, consumer and state government-backed national energy guarantee scheme due to then-PM Malcolm Turnbull's lack of courage, the message is clear: if there is to be action on the environment, it will be led by business. Perhaps this explains why ministers are keen to lecture business on speaking about ""non-business"" issues. The government attacks on business miss the point, given climate change directly affects shareholder returns in multiple ways, so it is on any front a legitimate business interest. The lack of leadership from Canberra on many economic issues leaves a gaping hole for business to fill on this and other issues. Josh Frydenberg, who gallantly led the failed NEG initiative, is convening a meeting of state and federal treasurers on October 11 to talk up productivity, infrastructure, population and other -issues. Perhaps this might be a turning point where Canberra adopts a leadership role rather than its -recently preferred stance of telling others how they are failing in an attempt to shift the blame. The Treasurer has rightly reminded business it needs to invest more to lift productivity, and now we might see what he has planned when he talks up the now two-year-old Productivity Commission Shifting the Dial report. Next week's Reserve Bank meeting, which is widely tipped to cut short-term interest rates to 75 basis points, will again highlight the need for fundamental reform. As noted earlier, the full rate cut will not be passed on because bank deposit rates are already at 25 basis points, and at best any cut in rates risks fuelling a housing market that has already climbed off the floor. Punters have nowhere else for their money when stocks are -already fully priced, which -explains the -attraction of the likes of the imminent listing of a $750m Morgan Stanley-led KKR Global Credit fund, which will offer a yield of 4-6 per cent. This may well be the first of many listed credit equity raisings by global private equity funds. Private equity in Australia has plenty of money but listed targets are regarded as too expensive. Forrest's Minderoo Foundation has committed $US300m ($440m) to a new -industry--focused effort to reduce worldwide plastic waste. Forrest's Sea for the Future program aims to raise $US20bn a year through a voluntary levy on plastics resin based on its carbon footprint. Forrest said in a statement: ""The initiative will attach a greater value to fossil fuel plastics through the contribution."" It is not payable on recycled plastics, making it a cheaper alternative feedstock. ""This drives demand that dominoes through the value chain and turns plastic waste into a cashable commodity, driving collection efforts, poverty alleviation through dignified work and -recycling, particularly in Southeast Asia,"" Forrest said. He launched the initiative at the UN climate change conference, saying: ""Current efforts to stem the increase in global plastic waste are disjointed and inadequate, with most of the 350 million-plus tonnes of plastic produced every year entering the world's terrestrial and marine -environment. ""Industry, fully supported by governments and regulators, is the only sector that can drive the urgent global shift needed to save our oceans from plastic waste."" Forrest is working with plastic producers on the project. ""The global plastics supply chain, including major producers such as Coca-Cola, Walmart, Tesco and Unilever, have responded positively to the initiative."" The aim is to make a material contribution to reducing plastic-induced climate change by about 70 per cent by 2050. Forrest's Mindaroo has committed to underwrite up to five years in audit fees, or a total cost of $US260m, plus $US40m in establishment costs. The results will be posted on a central data base. The money raised will support the initiative while also imposing a global industry market-based scheme. Dairy do Mike Hurrell, boss of Kiwi dairy giant Fonterra, will take centre stage on Thursday morning when he unveils a plan to lift the co-op out of its financial doldrums. Fonterra sold its 50 per cent stake in DFE Pharma on Wednesday for $NZ63m ($58m) as part of its aim to reduce debt. The co-op is tipped to report a loss of more than $NZ600m caused by overexpansion and high farmgate milk prices. The move comes as the ACCC is due on Thursday to decide whether to let Canadian dairy giant Saputo proceed with its -proposed $280m purchase of the Lion specialty cheese business. Some in the trade suggest the purchase will be subject to the -divestment of -Saputo's Smithton plant in Tasmania. The market is already highly concentrated, with Fonterra controlling 55 per cent of the state's dairy production, Saputo, through its Murray Goulburn -acquisition, holding another 15 per cent, and Lion having 10 per cent, with the rest shared by smaller players -including food giant Mondelez. The acquisition would give -Saputo control of Lion's King -Island dairy and plant and its Burnie plant. The ACCC allowed Saputo last year to buy Murray Goulburn subject to the sale of the Koroit plant near Warrnambool in Victoria. Saputo is the world's biggest cheese producer with a strong market share in North America. Tasmania accounts for about 10 per cent of Australia's dairy -output. Fonterra's market share in Australia has fallen this year, -making Saputo the clear No 1 -producer. Hurrell is due to lay down his plans for the co-op, and there is some speculation he will change its operating structure, which is presently split between bulk power or commodities and consumer and food service items. Credit Suisse's half ton Credit Suisse celebrated its 50th anniversary in the Australian market on Wednesday night. The occasion also marked John Knox's final official function as the firm's chief executive, handing the reins to former Deutsche banker Richard Gibbs. First Boston became the first Wall Street firm to open in Australia two years later, in 1971, under Ross Bradfield, and in 1998 Credit Suisse acquired a stake in First Boston. In the same year First -Boston acquired a stake in Mac-cabi Clarke, a research-driven equities house.Knox took over from David Livingstone as CEO in 2015. \"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia74","The conversion our Prime Minister needs","December 19, 2019 Thursday","Sydney Morning Herald (Australia)","A Pentecostal Christian such as Scott Morrison would be aware of the conversion to Christianity of Saul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus. Saul, a Pharisee in Jerusalem after the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ, had been a hate-filled persecutor of Christians, assisting in murder and the imprisonment of innocent people, committed to wiping out the new Christian Church, clearly one of Jesus' cruelest enemies. He was en route to Damascus, with the written authority of the high priest to arrest any followers of Jesus. Saul and his colleagues were struck with a blinding light and he was taken to the city where he met an envoy from Jesus, Ananias, who convinced him that Christ had chosen him to deliver the gospel, not only to the people of Israel but to the Gentiles and their kings. Saul's sight was restored, he was filled with the holy spirit and baptised into the faith. He changed his name to Paul and became one of the most successful of the apostles, suffering persecution and finally martyrdom. While the climate challenge is not a matter of religion but of science and morality, Morrison needs to follow Saul's example - to accept the need for a climate conversion. Climate is not a political issue - not right v left nor conservative v progressive - but it can have significant political consequences. Right now, Morrison's arrogance, stubbornness and intransigence are damaging him politically. Morrison's sins of the past constitute significant ignorance and negligence: the lump of coal in Parliament, his consistent failure to admit the significance of the link between climate and droughts and bushfires, his support for fracking at a private dinner, and his gross misrepresentation of our capacity to meet our very modest Paris target, relying on fudging its delivery with carry-over Kyoto credits. A schoolchild might liken this to wanting to carry over the six gold stars received in year 6 to the HSC and university admission, but I recognise that Morrison doesn't like children pointing out his failings in terms of their future. It is pure arrogance to ignore the experts: the 97 per cent of peer-assessed climate papers, the National Farmers Federation on the need for a national program of regenerative agriculture to make our soils more resilient and drought-resistant, and the firefighters who now intend to move ahead with a summit - without the Prime Minister - to develop a national bushfire action plan. The result has been for our nation to be identified as ""the"" laggard. Australia is ranked last in terms of genuine progress towards our Paris commitment for 2030, which is only about half what was recommended by the independent Climate Change Authority. After COP25 , the UN climate meeting in Madrid, we are now tagged as a ""blocker"" as well. Ironically, climate probably offers Morrison his best chance to show leadership, and to earn the genuine support of the ""quiet Australians"". It will take honesty and courage. It is a cop-out, as it was for Malcolm Turnbull, to blame a small recalcitrant group of deniers in the government, especially when exhaustive voter polls, and a very significant list of business and civil society, have been begging for a decisive government-led response, in the midst of record bushfires and drought. Morrison just needs to out this rump in his government and discipline or manage them. It is no argument to say we are a small emitter, which ignores our position as a major exporter of fossil fuels; nor is it relevant to boast about Australia's falling emissions per capita when we are among the highest per-capita emitters in the world, and the ""fall"" is due more to our strong population growth, Moreover, being a small contributor hasn't stopped us joining wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, nor attacking the tech titans. Morrison's conversion needs to start with honesty. First, admit this is a hot and dry continent and climate change is making it hotter and dryer. Second, our emissions are still rising, and we can't reach our Paris targets without carrying forward our Kyoto credits. Then he needs to shift the focus from the 2030 target to, say, net zero emissions or better by 2050. He could do this by developing a detailed transition strategy for the next three decades - in power, transport, agriculture, buildings, industry. We may need an independent climate transition commission to drive this, but we could emerge as a global leader and as a renewable-energy superpower.

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia75","The public recognises the climate crisis - when will the politicians?","January 7, 2020 Tuesday","The Weekend Advertiser","RAY'S REASONING In 2019, opinion poll after opinion poll showed that the public had become very aware that human-caused climate change was real. We are now living through a climate emergency, as record temperatures and unprecedented bushfires clearly demonstrate, despite Scott Morrison saying ""we have faced these disasters before"". We haven't. This is new, and the way the world is going unless politicians act immediately and decisively. But at the local, state, federal and international level progress has been deliberately stymied. I'll use my column this week to examine why no real progress was made in 2019. Thankfully there are exceptions. Unlike Wagga, several local governments have declared climate emergencies. Many Pacific Island states are all too very aware of the results of global warming, and even the UK government declared a climate emergency. In late 2019, Time magazine selected Greta Thunberg as its person of the year. That wouldn't have been possible even this time last year. The biggest story in climate in 2019 is the way in which, after years of languishing outside the mainstream, climate activism finally broke through. Young people were the key. Self-organised, serious, and frank about their anger at seeing their futures denied by politicians who won't even live to see the consequences, they have lent a powerful moral drive to the entire movement. So now the link between the climate emergency and our own lives has never seemed clearer. Finally - after decades of activists struggling to push the crisis into the larger consciousness - poll after poll shows that public concern, and desire for action, is at an all-time high. The question that became clearer as 2019 moved on, was it possible to effect any actual political change? The spectacle of Thunberg and the larger youth climate movement arriving at international meetings and parliaments and accusing heads of state of hypocrisy to their faces made for good TV news, but climate politics itself still seems far from any genuine watershed moment. Indeed, there has been little concrete progress. What the protests have sparked, instead, is that some governments declared a ""climate emergency"". A few even reset future emissions targets. In previous years this alone would have seemed radical enough, but now, however, the gap between words and actions has widened too far, and credulity is in short supply. Climate researcher Rebecca Willis put it very succinctly when she said: ""Targets don't reduce carbon. Policies do."" True, there has been some glimmers of hope on that front. Parties in the recent UK election and candidates in the US Democratic primaries took on comprehensive climate platforms for the first time. These directly or indirectly reference the concept of a Green New Deal, pairing increased spending on climate with a larger social transformation, and breaking down the wall that separates climate policy from the rest of politics. Unfortunately, nothing similar has been brought forward by a government actually in power. Many had high hopes for the UN's 2019 climate change conference, COP, held in Madrid, which fell at the end of the year. It is the forum where countries affirm their climate commitments under the UN framework convention on climate change. This year's COP may not have been the worst, but a loose coalition of right-wing governments, including Australia, effectively sabotaged the conference's goal of strengthening the Paris agreement. As The Saturday Paper wrote, in Copenhagen in 2009, Australia took a leadership role in the fight against climate change. Ten years on, at COP25 , the winds had changed, and our government tried to use carryover credits from the Kyoto agreement to 'prove' we are meeting our Paris commitments. Countries opposed to Australia's cheating attempted to insert a ban into the Madrid conference's final statement, barring Australia from carrying over carbon credits. Unfortunately, in the end, the ban didn't succeed. It got even worse. Following the positions taken by Australia, Brazil, China, India and others on key issues up for negotiation, the international effort to secure the next stage of global action on climate change didn't succeed either. The Madrid meeting failed to set any new, binding targets. It's a sad end to a year that showed while the people have got the message many of the politicians haven't. Let's hope they start not only to listen, but in 2020 develop policies that will mitigate climate change before it is too late. Despite some last minute and very limited federal assistance, Messrs Morrison and McCormack have shown a distinct lack of leadership and should make way for those who can provide it. \"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia76","BHP in east coast gas for a good time, not a long time","October 31, 2019 Thursday 04:17 PM GMT","AFR Online","BHP does not want to be a long-term supplier of gas to Australia's eastern states despite soaring prices for the fuel, and the company says its beachhead in Canadian potash will help diversify its customer base away from China. BHP and ExxonMobil have been selling gas from Bass Strait into Australia's eastern states for 50 years. Those gas sales have become far more lucrative since Shell, Origin Energy and Santos among others started exporting huge volumes of gas from Queensland in 2015. Despite gas prices nudging above $9 per gigajoule this year, BHP chief executive Andrew Mackenzie said his company did not want to play in Australia's eastern gas market longer term. ''A lot of the [Bass Strait] fields are now in decline, we kind of arrested that decline a bit by some investments in new fields ... but there is only so much we can do,'' Mr Mackenzie said during a webcast to retail shareholders. ''By the time we get into the middle of the next decade we will start to see that decline accelerate, and if gas demand is static or growing in eastern Australia then we are going to have to find other sources. ""It will have to come from others and their ability to explore near to the market and develop."" The comments HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/exxon-puts-bass-strait-assets-on-the-block-20190918-p52soq come as Exxon seeks to sell its 50 per cent stake in the Bass Strait business it shares with BHP, and suggests two of the biggest suppliers of gas to Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane want out of the market. BHP and Exxon's Bass Strait fields are estimated to supply about 40 per cent of the gas consumed in Australia's eastern states. Asked why BHP had HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/companies/mining/bhp-us345m-closer-to-potash-approval-20191016-p531cu this month committed a further $US345 million ($510 million) to Canada's Jansen Potash project when it had not yet taken a final investment decision to go ahead with the mine, Mr Mackenzie said the spend should be taken as a sign of the company's growing confidence in the project. ''I think you should read our willingness to do a bit more engineering, a bit more de-risking by doing some construction at the bottom of the shafts, and spend $US345 million on that, as evidence of the growing confidence at board level that this is the right kind of project for BHP,'' he said. ''It is one we should be very seriously considering sanctioning in a year's time, and it is a very good medium- and long-term option"". Potash ambitions Mr Mackenzie has previously said BHP's attraction to potash was based on the notion that potash-based fertilisers would be increasingly in demand after 2025 as a growing global population demands a better diet from a reduced amount of arable land. He on Thursday added two extra reasons for BHP to like the Jansen project: the diversification it would give the company on both product and customer grounds. ''It is a diversification away from fossil fuels for example, it is actually a bit of a diversification away from having mainly China as a customer, so we like it on both counts,"" he said. Almost 55 per cent of BHP's revenue in fiscal 2019 was earned from Chinese customers, who bought $US24.2 billion ($34.9 billion) worth of products from the company. Brazil is seen by most potash players as one of the largest future demand centres, while Jansen is also well placed to supply North American demand for potash. Mr Mackenzie said BHP's Chilean copper mines had encountered some disruption from ""sympathy strikes"" over the past fortnight in reference to the severe protests that have gripped Chile. ''We were very surprised when things seemed to flare up with very little notice,"" he said on Thursday. ""We hope that the country with some new policies can come back to normal, because whilst it was at its worst, we struggled to get everybody to work, people were concerned for their homes and families. ''I happen to believe the decision not to have [the United Nations climate conference] COP25 and APEC [meeting of Pacific nations] in Chile is a good one, I think it was quite brave of President Pinera to make that decision, to in some ways take a risk with his international reputation in the interests of keeping [Chile] calm."" \"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia77","Disease turns up to ruin our Olympics excitement","March 3, 2020 Tuesday","Australian Financial Review","Things are pretty bleak here in Tokyo at the moment. We should be counting down to the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics and getting ready for our moment in the sun: that moment when Tokyo will shine and show off a bit. Thanks to the Brave Blossoms and their amazing effort in the Rugby World Cup last year, we got a sense of the national pride we might enjoy in 2020. That now feels a million miles away. Joy and jubilation has been replaced with coronavirus-fuelled confusion, fear and anger. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has called for Japanese to demonstrate ""restraint"" and stay home, where possible. All schools are to close until April, entire company workforces sent home to ""telework"", events cancelled, meetings moved, the much-loved cherry blossom parties panned. Sporting events are being played to empty stadiums. Fear of the unknown and the hard-to-detect coronavirus have combined to make people worried. How will they stay well and protect their children and older relatives? (Don't forget, Japan's population is a super ageing society, so many more are at risk). To me, and many of my Japanese friends, it feels very much like the immediate aftermath of the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown. Then, like now, we were left wondering who to believe, who to turn to for guidance and what information sources we should believe. Disasters have a habit of testing people and their leadership skills. Life in Tokyo is different now and things are flat as the proverbial pancake. The consumption tax hike last October only served to kick the dog while it was down, and the economy has whimpered along for a couple of quarters, technically popping us back into a recession. Ho hum. Sometimes people remind me that the two-plus decades of poor economic performance for Japan coincides with my time here, suggesting I might have something to do with it. Ha! The Olympics was meant to super-charge the economy and give business a well-deserved boost - not to mention a wage hike for long-suffering Japanese workers. We had already enjoyed a surge in the number of foreign tourists, from less than 10 million to more than 30 million in 2019, a robust stockmarket and unprecedented pricing highs in Tokyo real estate. All of this had us feeling flash and hopeful: then, boom! - COVID-19 strikes and brings with it further economic woes. The Japanese deal with a lot of disasters: earthquakes, floods, typhoons, landslides, volcanoes ... you name it, we have it. Just late last year, the COP25 climate conference ranked Japan worst among 181 nations for climate disaster damage in 2018. Compared with the average Australian, people here are a little better prepared and seem ready for something. We have a national day of disaster prevention, evacuation drills, and regular disaster-management awareness and training for kids at school. Most homes have a quake disaster kit replete with torch, a few days' supply of food, water and a phone charger with batteries. Mine also contains a wee bottle of Japanese whisky, as I am quite sure I won't be able to live alcohol-free in an evacuation centre. In the immediate aftermath of a disaster, the Japanese government moves to establish a task force. All communications, updates and disaster management are handled by the PM and relevant ministries through this vehicle. For a while the measures implemented to handle coronavirus and the public health risks it posed seemed to be going well. Japanese nationals in Wuhan were swiftly collected and brought home; the Japanese government established the taskforce and public health warnings were issued. Then things started to get wonky and panic set in. This was real panic - a lot more than what friend and frequent visitor to Tokyo Tyler Brule describes as ""Japanic"". Typical panic buying takes me back to those dark days in March 2011. A visit to the local supermarket yesterday found no rice, bread, eggs or frozen food; toilet paper has become a luxury. Masks are fetching premium prices online. A friend who works in hospitality sent me a pack of 200. I gave most to some older Japanese friends; one cried as she opened the Ziploc bag, remarking that she was very worried about how she might keep her and her 80-year-old partner safe. Japanese wear masks for myriad reasons - hay fever, colds, prevention - and while I have never worn them, here I am now, masked all the time - I am wearing it mostly in deference to my hosts. It is hard enough standing out in a society here - grey-haired older Australian riding her bike around Tokyo - without bringing additional attention to yourself. So, on with the mask it is! Sayonara for now. Melanie Brock is a consultant living and working in Japan. \"

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia82","The sinking islands at the coalface of climate change","July 13, 2019 Saturday","Sydney Morning Herald (Australia)","While Australia fails to act meaningfully on humanity's greatest ecological threat, the people of Kiribati feel its effects daily, writes Katerina Teaiwa. The office of Nei Tabera Ni Kai (NTK), a film unit based in the town of Taborio, in the small island nation of Kiribati, is a small concrete building situated two metres above sea level, 30 metres from the lagoon on one side and 45 metres from the ocean on the other. Stacked under the louvred glass windows of one of its small rooms are 200 internal hard drives taken from computers over a period of 20 years. The office has no air conditioning, and the air is salty; there are regular electricity blackouts; and higher than normal wave surges, or ""king tides"", threaten the town - and the whole southern end of the atoll, South Tarawa, on which it is located - more frequently than they used to. Once a Kiribati household name, NTK has not worked on major projects for a couple of years. One of the co-founders, John Anderson, cameraman and editor, passed away in 2016. His long-time partner, producer, manager and scriptwriter Linda Uan, has been dealing with the loss and reflecting on the best way to preserve their shared legacy. The independent film unit documented more than two decades of culture, history, creative arts practice, development, and social, heritage and environmental issues across the islands. In the absence of a national film agency or television media, NTK pieced together various sources of funding to work with government and communities to produce educational documentaries, feature films and ""edutainment"". Their output had a significant impact on the scattered Kiribati population - people from other islands travelled to South Tarawa by boat or canoe just to pick up the latest VHS, later DVD, of their productions. In March 2019, Uan attended the Maoriland Film Festival in Otaki, New Zealand. During a discussion panel, she spoke passionately about NTK's work over the years. She ended with a humble request for assistance with archiving, taking one of those rectangular hard drives containing raw footage from her handbag and unwrapping it from a lavalava (sarong), then holding it up for the audience to see. The group of New Zealand and international filmmakers gasped at the condition of the drive, and the prospective loss of decades of visual chronicles, exposed to the elements in Kiribati. All but one of the 33 islands in Kiribati are less than two metres above sea level. Large parts of the country are expected to be underwater by 2050. From 2003 to 2016 Kiribati was led by President Anote Tong, who successfully raised global awareness of the climate change threats faced by his country. At the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bonn in 2017, Kiribati was described as one of the world's most vulnerable countries. Annual temperatures in South Tarawa have increased by roughly 0.18 degrees Celsius per decade since 1950, according to the conference's briefing paper. This warming, coupled with increasingly ferocious tidal storms and coastal flooding, is destroying the island's ecosystems. Saltwater that floods the islands from storm surges devastates land and property, polluting reservoirs that capture and filter groundwater for consumption. Salt water also jeopardises resources such as coconuts, pandanus and breadfruit, which residents rely on for food and many other household needs. In the Kiribati population, there has been a rise in waterborne diseases, among other climate-change-induced illnesses, including cholera and dengue fever. Warming oceans, combined with increased ocean acidification, disrupts sea life, the cornerstone of Kiribati identity and the country's economy. Kiribati depends almost entirely on its fishing sector for food and revenue, but the catch potential is expected to decrease by 70 per cent by the 2050s. Kiribati is one of 48 nations in the Climate Vulnerable Forum, a partnership of countries most under threat from global warming. These include Tuvalu, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Vanuatu, Samoa and the Marshall Islands. Kiribati once chaired the forum, and under Tong was a vocal proponent for limiting the temperature rise from global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Beyond this temperature, sea levels are expected to increase to a point that would make Kiribati uninhabitable. Despite global campaigns calling for ""1.5 to stay alive"", the Paris Agreement on Climate Change seeks to limit the temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius. This is devastating for most Pacific island countries. Anote Tong was vocal about the need for Kiribati to face climate-induced migration ""with dignity"". However, the current government, led by Taneti Mamau, rejects this vision of mass migration, instead emphasising local development. The government aims to develop and increase the land area on South Tarawa by about 100 acres, and on Kiritimati (also known as Christmas Island) by 767 acres. It also owns 22 square kilometres of land on Vanua Levu in Fiji, with potential for forestry, livestock farming and other activities to shore up its food and economic security as Kiribati farmland comes under threat. Reality too much for many to fathom The level of carbon now in the atmosphere is more than 415 parts per million. The last time the Earth experienced these levels was during the Pliocene Epoch, between 5.3 and 2.5 million years ago. Then, global temperatures were 2 to 3 degrees Celsius higher, and the sea levels 25 metres higher. Pollution from climate change today is on track to push the Earth towards similar conditions. To many Australian voters, this reality is too much to fathom, presumed to be a hoax, or utterly unknown. Prime Minister Scott Morrison might support climate adaptation and mitigation programs in the Pacific through his ""Pacific step-up"", but he does not support similar domestic policies, such as increased climate change research or the introduction of a carbon price, and Australia has no renewable energy targets beyond 2030. It is the world's second-largest exporter of coal but faces falling demand as its biggest customers - Japan, South Korea, China, Taiwan and India - all shift towards cleaner energy. Burning coal is in Australia a bit like the right to bear arms in the United States: a freedom that causes major planetary harm, but the issue is severely politicised and many are not willing to imagine a future without it. This protection of the mining industry is not new. For more than a century Australia has had a relationship with the South Pacific region that furthered its economic interests. Australian mining companies have been present in the Pacific since the beginning of the 20th century, wreaking havoc on ancient cultures and sustainable environmental practices while extracting phosphate as quickly as possible from places such as Nauru and Kiribati. The value of phosphate, the superphosphate fertiliser it produced, and the growth effects it had on Australian farming production and exports were massive. In 1983, a monograph produced by the Centre for Resource and Environmental Studies described phosphate as ""the magic dust of Australian agriculture"". In the case of Banaba, an island of Kiribati, the mining infrastructure was left to rust and decay. People there live among the asbestos-riddled rubble, in a place that looks more like a post-apocalyptic lunarscape than a Pacific paradise. When Peter Dutton made his flippant aside in 2015 in response to a quip by Tony Abbott about how islanders are not good at keeping to time (Dutton said, ""Time doesn't mean anything when you're about to have water lapping at your door"") Tony deBrum, the former foreign minister for the Marshall Islands, posted on Twitter, ""Next time waves are battering my home and my grandkids are scared, I'll ask Peter Dutton to come over, and we'll see if he is still laughing."" Former minister for the environment Melissa Price's words to Tong were also offensive. When she was introduced to him in a Canberra restaurant, it was widely reported - and verified by others present - that she said, ""I know why you're here. It is for the cash. For the Pacific it's always about the cash. I have my chequebook here. How much do you want?"" That kind of attitude towards Pacific island leaders needs to change. Such leaders have been criticising the production and consumption of fossil fuels and their impacts on the environment for almost 30 years. The former Nauru ambassador to the United Nations, Marlene Moses, wrote in 2016, ""For the people of small islands, understanding the importance of the ocean to human survival is as natural as breathing. If the ocean is healthy, we are healthy; if the future of the ocean is uncertain, so is ours."" Pacific islands may be smaller states demographically and geographically, but the sea in which they sit covers one-third of the planet's surface area. Pacific leadership on climate change is necessary and inevitable. Since 1997, Nei Tabera Ni Kai has produced more than 400 films in both English and the Kiribati language focused on Kiribati knowledge, lives, issues and communities. They have documented what residents call ""te katei ni Kiribati"" - the Kiribati way. Their work should be stored in a well-funded archive. The name of the unit comes from a female ancestral spirit belonging to Linda Uan's clan, responsible for women's health and success. Climate change threatens not only the lands of families and clans such as hers, but the spiritual and cultural spheres associated with these landscapes. The knowledge inherent in these spheres has been the source of resilience for more than 2000 years in an oceanic environment with limited land, flora and fauna, allowing islanders not only to survive but to produce complex, creative societies. Australia is now saturated with messages about the existential threat of climate change, but the impacts will cut across all aspects of human existence - social, political, cultural, economic, environmental, and everything else that shapes our identities and relationships. Climate change is here today, not just in some distant future, and Pacific Islanders who cannot always crawl into climate-controlled bubbles experience its effects daily. While the people of the Pacific are resilient and have survived centuries of upheaval, climate change is already at emergency levels in the region - representing some of the first and starkest signs of the greatest ecological threat to ever face humanity. Katerina Teaiwa is an associate professor in the School of Culture, History and Language at the Australian National University. This is an edited extract of her essay ""No Distant Future: Climate Change as an Existential Threat"" published in Australian Foreign Affairs 6 on Monday. \"

She took great care to ensure that no names were released before all necessary forensic work for identification was completed in order to avoid unnecessary distress. This was a Prime Minister who understood her role. At times like this there is a real need to take the initiative in order to enter a climate of empathy, compassion and professionalism. John Gelling, Merimbula Things get better As I was driving home the other night something reminded me to look at our street lights. Over the last year or so we've had our street lights changed from the old mercury vapour lamps to new efficient LEDs. I personally find the light more natural, and because it's mostly directed down, I find distant lights don't dazzle me as much at night. I'm sure the Territory is going to be saving money both in the power usage and reduced break downs compared to the old lights. Another sign we live in a progressive, modern city. My brain now censors his letters when I see his name and don't read them. Thank you brain, I don't think I'm missing anything. Brian Hale, Wanniassa ACT Learn from Tony, Scomo Our Prime Minister is entitled to have a holiday but he's acting like an arrogant celebrity when he thinks he has a right to privacy. Not true. He is paid by the Australian taxpayer. Respect has to be earned. Is he afraid he's scared of people seeing him in some ugly board shorts ? Tony Abbott has been out there volunteering, holidays or no holidays. He was also one of the first to offer his condolences to the families of the firefighters who died. Melina Smith, Brighton, Vic Be afraid, very afraid Thank you for publishing ""You make the decision: Jim Molan's war"" (December 23, p8). It's an example of why we need freedom of the press. Kirsten Lawson's interview is literally frightening. When John Howard and Scott Morrison (and perhaps even Arthur Sinodinos) can collude to parachute self-aggrandising Molan into the Senate despite his party members and his electorate failing to vote for him, we know that our democracy is in dire straits. Be very scared of such a demagogue, defined in the Macquarie Dictionary as ""a leader who uses the passions or prejudices of the populace for his own interests"". Frank McKone, Holt Tommy rot and nonsense When native tribes performed rain dances, our ancestors, uninhibited by cultural sensitivity, either laughed quietly of openly mocked them. But the thinking behind the dancing is not dead. The Gods must be appeased. Today large numbers seem to think this can be done by closing coal plants and making other symbolic but very damaging gestures to return Australia to ""normal"", whatever that means. The rain dances didn't work. Nor will this nonsense. Climate is too complex and multi-dimensional to be fully understood, let alone controlled by anything we can do. Doug Hurst, Chapman Selective blindness Each day at the climate conference in Madrid ( COP25 ), reports came in about the devastation caused by the current Australian fire storm. Returning Australian delegates reported that the Minister representing Australia, Angus Taylor extraordinarily and seemingly without embarrassment, neglected to mention the droughts and fires that were sweeping the nation. Incredibly, Australia apparently joined with a group of nations including Saudi Arabia, the US and Brazil to undermine various elements of the Paris Agreement. If Australia, the nation that led the global phase out of CFCs to protect the ozone layer, cannot see just how bad things are now in a climate emergency then we are in serious trouble. We missed a golden opportunity to say to the world, ""we are burning, help us by cutting emissions well beyond the Paris targets"". Digby Habel, Cook Words do matter Mike Morris's call to change the language (Letters, December 20, is timely but does not go far enough. The deliberately ambiguous term ""climate change"" was coined by bullied reporters to appease the climate deniers' rage at even mentioning what should be called the ""climate crisis"" which will soon be an emergency, and later a catastrophe. Another term that should be changed is the reassuringly gentle phrase ""global warming"". This conjures up images of cosy doonas and hot-water bottles on winter nights. It should be ""global heating"", of course. A Moore, Melba Change the policy The PM's absence from the country was bad enough. But what's really unconscionable is every bit of policy the government clings to that feeds the underlying problem of escalating carbon emissions. This can be seen in its self-interested pandering to the coal and oil lobby, its mind-blowingly shameful undermining at the recent COP25 meeting of global action to curb emissions, its refusal to meet with the nation's top fire chiefs, and its attempts to silence and punish the many Australians who actually care about our future. Meanwhile, ironically, our PM plans talks overseas with India and Japan about ""security"". He likes to talk about the sort of security where other nations are seen as a threat, and for which the government committed $200,000 million in 2016 for new military hardware. However, much of our country is feeling pretty insecure right now from a different sort of threat. Would Morrison refuse to meet with the generals if another country were invading Australia, and would he find more to help the war effort than the microscopic $11 million he announced recently for more aerial firefighting capacity? At what point does a government become a danger to its own people? If humanity survives into the future, our descendants will ask why more of us did not rise up and demand action against our real ""security"" threats. They will laud as heroes those community members who are doing exactly that right now, and, of course, the super-heroes who are out battling the fires. Dr Sue Wareham, President, Medical Association for Prevention of War, Canberra Not anxious, just angry We weren't ""anxious,"" just very cross that our head prefect, Mr Morrison, had snuck off on a little family holiday without telling us (except for his besties). And this at a time when we were having fire drills. Mike Lynch, Isaacs TO THE POINT WIZARD OF OZ? The Great and Terrible Scomo, deliverer of political miracles, was exposed as nothing more than a humbug. How good is that? Nigel Thompson, Queanbeyan East, NSW FREE THE REFUGEES Scott Morrison says it is now time to be kind (""PM apologises for holidaying but says now is the time to be kind"", canberratimes.com.au, December 22). Perhaps his first act of kindness could be to bring the Sri Lankan family back from Christmas Island and let them return to Biloela. Robyn Lewis, Raglan TRUE LEADERSHIP Leadership defines a situation. Without it, people are rudderless. Leaders interpret and make sense of a situation and then guide their community to a better future. E Wensing, Nicholls THE REAL ISSUE Many will not begrudge our Prime Minister a family holiday. But his intransigence on climate change must be condemned. David Grantham, Melba WHAT'S THE POINT? Until the Prime Minister hastens Australia's emissions reductions and encourages other polluters to do likewise, he might as well have stayed in Hawaii. Surely his marketing background tells him ignoring climate scientists and fire experts makes him look like a smug fool or a tool of vested interests? David Hawking, Turner A SMIRK WON'T WORK He should have stayed away. A smirk won't work. Even the nodding National from Wagga Wagga realises a policy change is required. Murray Upton, Belconnen A VOTE CHANGER? Shame on you Scott Morrison for deserting our country while it burns. Two volunteer firemen are dead leaving their young families fatherless, others are in hospital with severe burns and hundreds of homes have been completely destroyed. I want a leader who is willing to support our country in a crisis, not one who was overseas on holidays. You have lost my vote. Aileen Hancock, Yarralumla PLEASANT SURPRISE It's so nice to see our ever shrill, hectoring, know it all Prime Minister has returned. Graeme Rankin, Holder SHOCKED AND APPALLED I thought I could not be shocked by anything that Scott Morrison said any more. But there he was on breakfast television Monday morning, with this gem about our reaction to the current crisis: ""Panic is politically motivated"". Words fail me.

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia84","Kyoto credits may not be needed; Exclusive","December 18, 2019 Wednesday","Australian Financial Review","The Morrison government is increasingly confident it will be able to reach its 2030 international climate targets without needing to use its controversial ""carry-over"" credits from previous agreements. While some countries continue to complain about Australia's proposed use of carry-over credits to count towards the 2030 target, federal Energy Minister Angus Taylor said the latest emission projections showed the nation was already heading in the right direction and ""over-delivering"" in reducing carbon pollution. ""We are already on track to beat our 2030 targets and every year we look to improve our position,"" Mr Taylor said in an interview with The Australian Financial Review. ""That's our approach, which is to over-deliver and we will look to over-deliver to 2030 as well."" This raises the scenario where the carry-over credits may not be needed and they could be just a safety net or insurance policy. Mr Taylor has previously insisted that Australia was well within its rights to use the ""Kyoto carry-over"" to reach the Paris targets, despite it being opposed by other countries. By signing up to the Paris Climate Agreement, Australia has promised to reduce its carbon emissions by 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. This equates to 395 million tonnes of carbon, according to the latest projections published early this month - down from the cumulative 695 million tonnes predicted in 2018. The so-called ""Kyoto carry-over"" would allow 411 million tonnes of excess emissions from the 2020 target to be rolled over towards, and exceed, the 395 million tonnes abatement task. The latest emissions projections from the Department of Environment and Energy show Australia has exceeded its emissions reduction task by about 43 million tonnes a year leading into the 2020 target - a figure the government is hoping will be replicated in the next decade. Mr Taylor said Australia was making good progress on achieving the 2020 target and was on the right track to 2030. ""Our track record for finding additional abatement year-on-year has been extraordinary,"" he said. ""There is a broad recognition that Australia has over-delivered. There are few countries with our track records."" Frontier Economics climate change head Matt Harris said he believed Australia would not need to use carry-over credits to reach its Paris commitments. ""I find it hard to believe we won't reach the 2030 target without the carry-over. It was only four years ago we had the same debate about the 2020 target,"" Mr Harris said. ""We've come down 3000 mega-tonnes in 10 years and there's another 10 years to go. If you look at that track record, it's always fallen, every update. It's now [falling] at least 120 mega-tonnes per update [year] for the 2030 target. That's the lowest it's fallen."" The 2019 projections of emissions up to the 2030 target now include the Victorian and Queensland 50 per cent renewable energy targets, which are being driven by the proliferation of rooftop solar as well as the Morrison government's $3 billion Climate Solutions Fund programs. Mr Harris said he believed the constant discussion of carry-over credits was a negotiating tactic ahead of Australia possibly increasing its carbon reduction targets at future climate talks. ""They are using it as a negotiating tool or a safety net. But if you think you are going to meet the targets 'in a canter' and you are so confident of meeting targets, why would you need to keep them?"" he said. Mr Harris said projections in about three years, or near the next federal election, will confirm carry-over credits won't be needed for the 2030 target. Grattan Institute energy program director Tony Wood said it was possible for Australia to reach its 2030 targets without carry-over credits, but it might require some more policies to deliver carbon reductions. ""The numbers say we are currently on track with carry-over credits but I wouldn't rule it out being without them,"" he said. ""Every year the numbers are coming down dramatically and the departments are shaking the tree pretty hard to get them."" Although not part of formal discussions at the recent COP25 climate talks in Madrid, Australia was chastised by some countries for using the so-called accounting short-cut to reach their 2030 climate targets. Mr Taylor said the carry-over credits was not the focus of the Madrid talks, which focused on Article 6 and an attempt to make international carbon markets work. An agreement on Article 6 could not be reached, with the decision being laid over until the next COP meeting, in Glasgow next year. ""It would have been better for it [Article 6] to be resolved this year. It means it's a priority to be solved next year,"" he said. ""Australia doesn't plan to use international credits, however Australian companies may want to use them in their international operations and we think it's important to have a market that has integrity."" \"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia85","Why we must talk about climate change","December 21, 2019 Saturday","The Courier","With catastrophic bushfires continuing to rage across NSW, Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia, recent statements by politicians implying it's offensive to talk about climate change in the face of bushfire victims' suffering, have prompted considerable backlash - from the nation's former fire chiefs, from the general public, and from bushfire victims themselves. Opinion: Mary Debrett For politicians who have failed to develop policies to effectively mitigate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions driving anthropogenic climate change, the current drought and wild fires are obviously embarrassing, since they reflect what climate scientists have been warning for over three decades. In Australia the climate has now warmed by 1.4C. It is predicted that globally, unless more radical action is taken, we are on a path to reach 4-5C warming by the end of the century - leading to a hostile, severely diminished environment. With the COP25 meeting in Madrid concluding, we know those talks have failed to secure commitment to cut emissions to the requisite level. As Greta Thunberg noted, nations have used 'clever accounting and creative PR' to escape doing what is needed to keep global warming within 1.5C. Australia's attempt to carryover carbon credits from the Kyoto Agreement signed in 2007, to prove it has met commitments made at the Paris COP21 in 2015-even as our own official figures revealed the lie-offer good reason for all Australians to talk about climate change. The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , which was released in September this year, found global mean sea level is rising faster, with increasing rates of ice loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets and glaciers, which combined with a warming ocean is also increasing the likelihood of tropical cyclones and extreme waves, exacerbating coastal hazards. The Report also later noted that increased absorption of CO2 is increasing ocean acidification. With IPCC and UN initiatives failing to secure national commitments to the needed emissions targets at the International level, and with elected politicians failing to develop adequate mitigation policies at the national level, it falls to our local councils and to us, as ordinary members of the public, to push back for climate action. Think global, act local was never as relevant as now. Certainly the Ballarat region has been performing quite well on that score. With the City of Ballarat having endorsed the declaration of climate emergency in 2018 and unanimously passed its own Carbon Neutrality and Zero Emissions Action Plan in 2019, and recently appointing an Environment Officer. This year also saw the launch of GNET-The Grampians Regional Roadmap to Zero-a collaboration between environmental group, Beyond Zero Emissions and the Committee of Ballarat. Funded by DELWP, GNET will identify pathways towards a 100% renewable energy and a zero emissions economy for the Grampians region by 2050. Talking about climate change helps to raise public consciousness about the impact of our consumer and lifestyle choices, as well as contributing to better understanding of the scale of the problem we are all facing. You don't have to be an expert. Firstly, this is not a political issue-it's an existential one, as many have noted. The science of anthropogenic climate change has been clear for decades, and is clearly evidenced in the devastating extreme weather events that have wreaked havoc around the globe in recent years-heat waves, floods, droughts and wildfires - even in the Arctic. We humans are the cause-through GHG emissions from burning fossil fuels, methane landfill emissions, and other unsustainable industrial and agricultural practices. Secondly, the new bushfire reality is about to hit us. As former fire chiefs who have spoken up have confirmed, hotter temperatures arising from climate change have spawned fire storms that create pyrocumulonimbus clouds, changing the weather, producing dry lightning and violent winds that can carry embers up to 30-40 kilometres. With temperatures continuing to rise former fire chief, Greg Mullins, and 22 colleagues have appealed to government for action on climate change. Thirdly, talk about your lifestyle choices. No matter how small they may seem, explain how these help to reduce GHG emissions, while also possibly saving you money and making you healthier-growing your own food, sewing your own clothes, riding a bike, catching public transport, planting trees, using produce bags, keep cups and re-usable water bottles, eating less meat and dairy, trying to buy less, monitoring your use of the air conditioner, putting solar panels on the roof. Fourthly, acting to reduce emissions-whatever path you take-is a great way to address the depression that increasing numbers of us are now experiencing in thinking about the climate crisis. Taking action and talking about it has therapeutic value too. Many among us, like the frog in the simmering pot, are still barely aware of the scale of changes now on the horizon. So don't be a quiet Australian. As Climate Councillor and former Australian of the year, Tim Flannery, once said, 'it is the army of mice' that will in the end be left to do most of the heavy lifting in transitioning to the changes we need. Community is where real climate action is happening. Mary Debrett, President BREAZE \"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia86","Pacific leadership on climate change is necessary and inevitable","July 13, 2019 Saturday 12:00 AM GMT","The Sydney Morning Herald (Australia) - Online","The office of Nei Tabera Ni Kai (NTK), a film unit based in the town of Taborio, in the small island nation of Kiribati, is a small concrete building situated two metres above sea level, 30 metres from the lagoon on one side and 45 metres from the ocean on the other. Stacked under the louvred glass windows of one of its small rooms are 200 internal hard drives taken from computers over a period of 20 years. The office has no air conditioning, and the air is salty; there are regular electricity blackouts; and higher than normal wave surges, or ""king tides"", threaten the town - and the whole southern end of the atoll, South Tarawa, on which it is located - more frequently than they used to. Once a Kiribati household name, NTK has not worked on major projects for a couple of years. One of the co-founders, John Anderson, cameraman and editor, passed away in 2016. His long-time partner, producer, manager and scriptwriter Linda Uan, has been dealing with the loss and reflecting on the best way to preserve their shared legacy. The independent film unit documented more than two decades of culture, history, creative arts practice, development, and social, heritage and environmental issues across the islands. In the absence of a national film agency or television media, NTK managed to piece together various sources of funding to work with government and communities to produce educational documentaries, feature films and ""edutainment"". Their output had a significant impact on the scattered Kiribati population - people from other islands travelled to South Tarawa by boat or canoe just to pick up the latest VHS, and later DVD, of their productions. In March 2019, Uan attended the Maoriland Film Festival in Otaki, New Zealand. During a discussion panel, she spoke passionately about NTK's work over the years. She ended with a humble request for assistance with archiving, taking one of those rectangular hard drives containing raw footage from her handbag and unwrapping it from a lavalava (sarong), then holding it up for the audience to see. The group of New Zealand and international filmmakers gasped at the condition of the drive, and the prospective loss of decades of visual chronicles, exposed to the elements in Kiribati. All but one of the 33 islands in Kiribati are less than two metres above sea level. Large parts of the country are expected to be under water by 2050. From 2003 to 2016 Kiribati was led by President Anote Tong, who successfully raised global awareness of the climate change threats faced by his country. At the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bonn in 2017, Kiribati was described as one of the world's most vulnerable countries. Annual temperatures in South Tarawa have increased by roughly 0.18 degrees Celsius per decade since 1950, according to the conference's briefing paper. This warming, coupled with increasingly ferocious tidal storms and coastal flooding, is destroying the island's ecosystems. Saltwater that floods the islands from storm surges devastates land and property, polluting reservoirs that capture and filter groundwater for consumption. Salt water also jeopardises resources such as coconuts, pandanus and breadfruit, which residents rely on for food and many other household needs. In the Kiribati population, there has been a rise in waterborne diseases, among other climate-change-induced illnesses, including cholera and dengue fever. Warming oceans, combined with increased ocean acidification, disrupts sea life, which is the cornerstone of Kiribati identity and the country's economy. Kiribati depends almost entirely on its fishing sector for food and revenue, but the catch potential is expected to decrease by 70 per cent by the 2050s. Kiribati is one of 48 nations in the Climate Vulnerable Forum, a partnership of countries most under threat from global warming. These include Tuvalu, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Vanuatu, Samoa and the Marshall Islands. Kiribati once chaired the forum, and under Tong was a vocal proponent for limiting the temperature rise from global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Beyond this temperature, sea levels are expected to increase to a point that would make Kiribati uninhabitable. Despite global campaigns calling for ""1.5 to stay alive"", the Paris Agreement on Climate Change seeks to limit the temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius. This is devastating for most Pacific island countries. Anote Tong was vocal about the need for Kiribati to face climate-induced migration ""with dignity"". However, the current government, led by Taneti Mamau, rejects this vision of mass migration, instead emphasising local development. The government aims to develop and increase the land area on South Tarawa by about 100 acres, and on Kiritimati (also known as Christmas Island) by 767 acres. It also owns 22 square kilometres of land on Vanua Levu in Fiji, with potential for forestry, livestock farming and other activities to shore up its food and economic security as Kiribati farmland comes under threat. Reality too much for many to fathom The level of carbon now in the atmosphere is more than 415 parts per million. The last time the Earth experienced these levels was during the Pliocene Epoch, between 5.3 and 2.5 million years ago. Then, global temperatures were 2 to 3 degrees Celsius higher, and the sea levels 25 metres higher. Pollution from climate change today is on track to push the Earth towards similar conditions. To many Australian voters, this reality is too much to fathom, presumed to be a hoax, or utterly unknown. Prime Minister Scott Morrison might support climate adaptation and mitigation programs in the Pacific through his ""Pacific step-up"", but he does not support similar domestic policies, such as increased research on climate change or the introduction of a carbon price, and Australia has no renewable energy targets beyond 2030. It is the world's second-largest exporter of coal but faces falling demand as its biggest customers - Japan, South Korea, China, Taiwan and India - all shift towards cleaner energy. Burning coal is in Australia a bit like the right to bear arms in the United States: a freedom that causes major planetary harm, but the issue is severely politicised and many are not willing to imagine a future without it. This protection of the mining industry is not new. For more than a century Australia has had a relationship with the South Pacific region that furthered its economic interests. Australian mining companies have been present in the Pacific since the beginning of the 20th century, wreaking havoc on ancient cultures and sustainable environmental practices while extracting phosphate as quickly as possible from places such as Nauru and Kiribati. The value of phosphate, the superphosphate fertiliser it produced, and the growth effects it had on Australian farming production and exports were massive. In 1983 a monograph produced by the Centre for Resource and Environmental Studies described phosphate as ""the magic dust of Australian agriculture"". In the case of Banaba, an island that forms part of Kiribati, the mining infrastructure was left to rust and decay. People there live among the asbestos-riddled rubble, in a place that looks more like a post-apocalyptic lunarscape than a Pacific paradise. When Peter Dutton made his flippant aside in 2015 in response to a quip by Tony Abbott about how islanders are not good at keeping to time (Dutton said, ""Time doesn't mean anything when you're about to have water lapping at your door"") Tony deBrum, the former foreign minister for the Marshall Islands, posted on Twitter, ""Next time waves are battering my home & my grandkids are scared, I'll ask Peter Dutton to come over, and we'll see if he is still laughing."" Former minister for the environment Melissa Price's words to Tong were also offensive. When she was introduced to him in a Canberra restaurant, it was widely reported - and verified by others in the restaurant - that she said, ""I know why you're here. It is for the cash. For the Pacific it's always about the cash. I have my chequebook here. How much do you want?"" That kind of attitude towards Pacific island leaders needs to change. Such leaders have been criticising the production and consumption of fossil fuels and their impacts on the environment for almost 30 years. The former Nauru ambassador to the United Nations, Marlene Moses, wrote in 2016, ""For the people of small islands, understanding the importance of the ocean to human survival is as natural as breathing. If the ocean is healthy, we are healthy; if the future of the ocean is uncertain, so is ours."" The Pacific islands may be smaller states demographically and geographically, but the sea in which they sit covers one-third of the planet's surface area. Pacific leadership on climate change is necessary and inevitable. Knowledge a source of resilience for 2000 years The knowledge inherent in these spheres has been the source of resilience for more than 2000 years in an oceanic environment with limited land, flora and fauna, allowing islanders not only to survive but to produce complex, creative societies. Australia is now saturated with messages about the existential threat of climate change, but the impacts will cut across all dimensions of human existence - the social, the political, the cultural, the economic, the environmental, and everything else that shapes our identities and relationships. Climate change is here today, not just in some distant future, and Pacific Islanders who cannot always crawl into air-conditioned, climate-controlled bubbles experience its effects on a daily basis. While the people of the Pacific are resilient and have survived centuries of upheaval, climate change is already at emergency levels in the region - representing some of the first and starkest signs of the greatest ecological threat to ever face humanity. Katerina Teaiwa is an associate professor in the School of Culture, History and Language at the Australian National University. This is an edited extract of her essay ""No Distant Future: Climate Change as an Existential Threat"" published in Australian Foreign Affairs 6 on July 15. \"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia87","Australia 'cheating' on Paris, says former UN climate chief","March 9, 2020 Monday 05:12 PM GMT","AFR Online","The Morrison government will be breaking international law and acting immorally if it uses Kyoto carryover credits to help it meet its 2030 emissions targets, says the chief architect of the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement. Christiana Figueres, who was executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change from 2010 to 2016, said Australia's overachievement of its targets under the Kyoto Protocol was irrelevant to its Paris commitments, and attempting to use the credits from that overachievement would be ""cheating"" . ""If you go as a tennis player to the Australian Open, and you get your final score and your final standing, do you then progress to Wimbledon and pick up the scores that you had from the Australian Open? It just doesn't make any sense,"" Ms Figueres told The Australian Financial Review. ""It is not legal, it is not correct, it is not moral. It is cheating, period. When you finish one tournament - and the Kyoto Protocol has finished - then you start the next. But you do not pull something from the previous efforts and the previous regulatory framework to the next one. Backed by professors ""There are few things that are black and white in life, but this is one. It's simply not allowed, period."" Her comments were backed up by nine law professors from Australian universities, who last week sent a letter to Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Energy Minister Angus Taylor, arguing it was legally invalid to apply the rules of one agreement to another. ""Our considered view is that the proposed use of these 'Kyoto credits' is legally baseless at international law,"" the letter stated. ""The Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement are entirely separate treaties. There is no provision in the Paris Agreement that refers to the Kyoto Protocol, nor to the units established under it."" The use of overachievement credits was permitted in the two-part Kyoto Protocol, which was signed in 1997 and expires this year. But the Paris Agreement, a separate agreement that comes into action this year and runs until 2030, makes no mention of Kyoto carryover credits. Nevertheless, the federal government plans to use its overachievement under Kyoto, worth a projected 411 million tonnes of carbon dioxide and equivalent greenhouse gases, to compensate for what could otherwise be a significant underachievement on its Paris target of 26-28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/policy/energy-and-climate/the-countries-with-the-biggest-hoard-of-kyoto-credits-20191216-p53kay It is the only country in the world to explicitly say it will do this . In real terms, by 2030 Australia's greenhouse gas emissions are projected to be approximately 16 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, rather than 26-28 per cent, according to the government's own projections. The government's claim it is on track to ""meet and beat"" its Paris targets assumes the use of Kyoto carryover credits. Ms Figueres, who will be in Australia this week to publicise her new book, The Future We Choose, was generally scathing of the Morrison government's position on climate change. ""I think it's very sad that Australia has gone back to the climate wars that it has had for over a decade. I think it's very sad that the issue is polarised along political lines. And I think it is tragic, absolutely tragic, that Australia as a whole, and this government in particular, has not realised the huge competitive opportunity,"" she said. The HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/government-buried-climate-risk-action-plan-20200110-p53qeg deadly bushfires over the summer Action is £dvantageous' ""The irony of that whole thing is that doing its part would actually be advantageous and competitive to Australia because there are few countries that are so blessed with the energy resources of the 21st century such as Australia is. So it's just tragic, it is unconscionable and it's not understandable,"" she said. Supporters of the use of Kyoto carryover credits - including HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/policy/energy-and-climate/bhp-backs-government-on-kyoto-carryover-loophole-20190923-p52u1u mining giant BHP and the Business Council of Australia - claim their use is valid \~ HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/policy/energy-and-climate/bhp-backs-government-on-kyoto-carryover-loophole-20190923-p52u1u because it rewards early action ""It's a legitimate provision of the Paris Agreement and, as we go forward, those sorts of provisions will be negotiated as countries renew and update the Paris obligations,"" BCA chief executive Jennifer Westacott said in an interview with the ABC in September. Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, who since leaving politics in 2018 has become a vocal critic of his party's climate change policies, said in a podcast with The Guardian that he believed the use of Kyoto credits was technically legitimate, but should be treated as a back-up rather than a policy.

In vulnerable hotspots, such as the arid lands of Kenya and Ethiopia, farming communities are already struggling with droughts and water scarcity that kill their cattle and threaten their very survival. The glacial-fed river basins of the Himalayan mountains, or the deltas of Bangladesh, India and Ghana, are increasingly prone to floods, landslides and powerful cyclones. As a result, men are often migrating further to keep their families going, looking for casual work in neighbouring towns or villages for a few days or weeks at a time, or to cities further away. Many try to return home when they can, with whatever they have earned. But during their absence, the entire burden of maintaining the family is on women. Read more: COP24 climate talks had a 'people's voice', but did anyone listen? Researchers are in a race against time to predict how climate change will affect these communities and help them adapt, with drought and flood resistant crops and cattle breeds for example. But it's often overlooked that climate change will affect one half of humanity significantly more than the other. Longstanding gender inequality means that within regions of the world that are particularly vulnerable to climate change, women are likely to suffer more than men. Isolated and overburdened HYPERLINK https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-019-0638-y.epdfshared_access_token=4mfTKRJS7Ul19oxvelJkt9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0M3vmHTwDEh-1oY0paTPagKQdnGNjWGwIVB8tSs27stsyJZ2ds4ieKlgqtw7u0bZ1aqc1ObZIFi-ZwH3qO1BBUKoHtU5JFuj4lcElA0EG9TlQ%3D%3D In a recent study , we found that extreme weather and unpredictable seasons disproportionately weaken the agency of women to find well paid work and rise above rigid gender roles, even when these appear to be bending after decades of reform and activism. Without support in the form of assured drinking water, energy, childcare or credit, women end up working harder and in poorer conditions for lower wages. Women already in poverty are increasingly finding themselves in a vicious cycle of low productivity, indebtedness and food insecurity as crops and livestock fail, as we found particularly in semi-arid parts of Africa and India. Women in northern Kenya complained that they could no longer afford meat, so ate rice and potatoes instead, even when this wasn't enough to satisfy their hunger. Read more: Climate change and migration in Bangladesh - one woman's perspective As environmental stresses accumulate, community support networks break down. When people are displaced and have to settle elsewhere, men search for work and women are left behind at home, often in unfamiliar surroundings and lacking support from friends and relatives. But even if they do know people, with all the challenges of running the household in a strange environment, there is little time to help others. With full responsibility for household chores, farming and caring for the children and elderly, women have less time to socialise or take part in community events, including meetings of the elected village government. If the state or charities can help, there's often competition for securing those benefits. In Namibia, people tend to stick with their ethnic groups to guarantee access through collective effort, but this means that ethnic minorities in the region are often excluded. In Mali, heavier burdens are placed on women who are young and less educated. In India or Pakistan, women belonging to a lower social class or marginal caste suffer the most. Gender relations differ in each place and according to each situation - they're often too variable to emerge in broad national and global assessments. We tried to find a way to generalise our findings across 25 very diverse locations, in Asia and Africa, without losing the nuance of each woman's experiences. The bare necessities If much of the problem is structural, then short-term solutions like cyclone shelters or drought relief won't address the underlying causes of poverty and precariousness. Social safety nets that can ensure the basic necessities of food and shelter are needed, like the public distribution system for cereals in India, or the pensions and social grants available in Namibia. To ensure that the health of people in these places doesn't irreversibly decline, women need to be supported with child and healthcare services, but also drinking water and cooking fuel. The role of community support is crucial during crises, but there's little that women can do to help themselves without resources and skills. Competitive labour markets are also undervaluing the labour of poor women. Ensuring minimum wages and fair working conditions would help, but these are hard to implement across borders. As climate change causes traditional livelihoods to collapse, migrant men are similarly exploited by new employers. Deprived of adequate food and rest, many end up sick and spend their earnings on medical treatment.

""Our research reaffirms that communities in the Pacific face particularly severe impacts from global heating, including being forced from their homes by extreme weather disasters. \~\~ ""The Australian Government needs to move beyond coal and back the Pacific Islands and other vulnerable nations in their calls for a new loss and damage finance facility under the Paris Agreement. It's only fair that we add our support to this, as well as further cutting our emissions, considering our much greater responsibility for the crisis."" \~\~ Small Island Developing States, including some of Australia's neighbours, make up seven of the 10 countries facing the highest risk of internal displacement from extreme weather events. On average, nearly 5% of the populations of Tuvalu, Cuba and, Dominica and Tuvalu, were displaced by extreme weather each year in the decade between 2008 and 2018. \~\~ However, Small Island Developing States per capita emissions are about a third of those in high-income countries The unequal impacts of the climate crisis are apparent across the globe. People in low and lower-middle income countries such as India, Nigeria and Bolivia are more than four times likely to be displaced by extreme weather disasters than people in rich countries such as the United States or Australia. About 80 % of all people displaced in the last decade live in Asia - home to 60 % of the world's population and more than a third of the people globally who are living extreme poverty. \~\~ Chema Vera, Acting Executive Director of Oxfam International, said, ""Our governments are fuelling a crisis that is driving millions of women, men and children from their homes and the poorest people in the poorest countries are paying the heaviest price. Governments can and must make Madrid matter. They must commit to faster, deeper emissions cuts and establish a new 'Loss and Damage' fund to help poor communities recover from climate disasters."" \~\~ The UN is due to conclude a review of the progress made under the 'Warsaw Mechanism on Loss and Damage' at the summit in Madrid, and developing countries will be pushing for a new fund to help communities recover and rebuild after climate shocks. Rich donor countries have largely left poor countries to cover the rising costs of extreme weather disasters themselves. New Oxfam analysis shows that economic losses from extreme weather disasters over the last decade were, on average, equivalent to two percent of countries' national income. That figure is much higher for many developing countries - up to an astonishing 20 percent for Small Island Developing States. \~\~ The briefing shows that it is the poorest in society who are most vulnerable to climate-fuelled displacement. For example, in March 2019 Cyclone Idai displaced 51,000 people in Zimbabwe. The most affected communities lived in rural areas of Chimanimani and Chipinge where poor infrastructure and housing were unable to withstand the heavy rains and wind. Displaced women are particularly vulnerable as they, for example, face high levels of sexual violence. \~\~ For media interviews with Oxfam climate change experts in Australia, the Pacific or Spain at COP25 HYPERLINK dylanq@oxfam.org.au \~\~ Notes to editors: The 25th UN Climate Summit takes place in Madrid, Spain from 2 - 13 December 2019 Oxfam's briefing 'Forced from home: Climate fuelled displacement' is available online. \~\~ Photos and testimonies available from: - Fiji, which was devastated by Cyclone Winston, one of the most severe tropical storms ever to hit the Pacific region, in 2016.

But when debating emotive and controversial topics such as climate change, the point at issue can become lost. So what to do? We can learn much from Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg - a master of staying on topic. A simple, unwavering message Thunberg is in the Spanish capital Madrid this week HYPERLINK for COP25 - a major conference of nations signed up to the Paris climate agreement. Thunberg's solo school strikes in Sweden last year sparked a global movement.

But the climate crisis has already been solved. We already have all the facts and solutions. Note how the burden is placed back where it belongs: on those who have the power to act now. Thunberg also refuses to be distracted by patronising comments. When meeting with the US Senate's climate crisis taskforce in September, she was commended for her enthusiasm and HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/17/greta-thunberg-to-congress-youre-not-trying-hard-enough-sorry replied : Please save your praise.

She describes it as a ""superpower"" https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/20/us/greta-thunberg-profile-weir/index.html which has ""definitely helped me keep this focus"".

But we can apply the lessons to our own conversations with friends and family. Let's say I'm having an argument with a cranky uncle about renewable electricity. I might argue that we should transition to wind and solar energy because it generates less carbon dioxide than burning fossil fuels. Read more: Misogyny, male rage and the words men use to describe Greta Thunberg My uncle might respond by saying I shouldn't use any energy at all. Maybe he'll say ""then stop driving cars"" or ""don't turn on your TV"". But this response is not addressing the point at issue - that renewable energy generates less carbon than fossil fuels. It is talking about something else: that any use of power is bad. Really, it's not so much about using power as how that power is generated. Moving off the point at issue is a classic "" HYPERLINK https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/strawman strawman "" attack, when the argument is misrepresented and argued from that point. Keeping the argument on track, and keeping it both civil and productive, is a key skill in critical thinking.

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia91","Will the fires kick up enough stink to get to our politicians?","December 13, 2019 Friday","Canberra Times (Australia)","The summer of 1858 was unusually hot in London. The River Thames was six-foot-deep in a sludge of untreated human waste and industrial pollution, a breeding ground for cholera, diphtheria, and typhoid. But that summer the smell was so bad it invaded the Houses of Parliament. Committee rooms and cabinet meetings were abandoned. The government contemplated moving to Oxford. In a vain attempt to mask the stench, the curtains were soaked in a solution of concentrated bleach. But Parliament was forced to act. By August, new legislation had been passed that set the scene for a radical new sewage treatment plan for all of London. It saved many thousands of lives. Dramatic improvements in life expectancy during the second half of the 19th century reflected a genuine public health revolution. The Great Stink was a turning point in that history. Politicians could no longer ignore the evidence of their senses. It finally dawned on them that public health did not just affect the poor: it affected everybody. We are in the middle of another Great Stink. For millions of Australians all up and down the eastern seaboard (and elsewhere), you only have to open a window to know the reality of climate change. A smoke haze is blanketing the country - a firefront 6000 kilometres long, millions of hectares of land blackened, rainforests up in smoke, lives lost, hundreds of houses destroyed. Hazardous air quality. Asthma attacks. Respiratory complications affecting children, old people, the sick and the vulnerable, in our cities and towns. And summer has only just begun. You don't need me to tell you any of this. You only have to step outside and breathe in. Go on. Do it now. Tell me what you see - or don't see - through the haze. Last week, while the country went up in flames, the Australian Parliament was sitting. They could see and smell the evidence from the windows and front steps of Parliament House itself. But the government has done nothing. In response to a few rather desultory questions it assured the Australian public that there is no crisis, that everything is under control, and that bushfires are just a normal part of Australian life. Members of the Australian government can still be seen wandering the corridors of Parliament - not to mention their houses and electorate offices - with a handkerchief covering their nose, and their heads buried in the sand. Australian scientists have been predicting exactly this for years now - a hotter, drier continent, extreme weather conditions, more numerous and severe bushfires, and a much longer season. Now their predictions have come to pass - but apparently we are supposed to think this is just a lucky guess. Bushfires are just a natural disaster meaning, of course, a tragedy meaning, of course, no one's fault. The Liberal and National parties would rather we just put up with the stench, and destruction, and the deaths, than do anything about it. But isn't it time to wake up and smell the ashes? There is a small sculpture on Scott Morrison's desk. It is a figure of a boat, and it says: ""I stopped these"". For a long time, Australia's opposition parties have lagged behind in the highly competitive category of three-word slogans. Well, I have one. Stop the Fires. What would it take to stop the fires? It would mean resourcing our emergency services properly, at both the state and federal levels, and facing up to the new challenges posed by the now overlapping fire seasons in both the northern and southern hemispheres. It would mean addressing our global responsibility to move towards dramatic reductions in carbon emissions, rather than relying on denial, misrepresentation, and accounting tricks. It would mean embracing the huge opportunities that a low-carbon economy offers Australia. It would mean weaning our Prime Minister off his fossil fuel fetish. READ MORE: Jenna Price: The difference between Scott Morrison and Jacinda Ardern 'I feel like I've got to do more': The face of the South Coast fire Dermot O'Gorman: Australia is copping it at COP25 - and rightly so Stopping the fires means trying to save the Murray-Darling rather than turning a blind eye to its destruction by a handful of big agribusinesses. It means providing dramatic long-term assistance to help transition to forms of agriculture sustainable in a drying, warming climate. Australia spends up to $2 billion per year for the vindictive pleasure of making sure that a few refugees are kept in conditions of obscene cruelty. I suspect our struggling farmers would welcome that sort of money. Instead, what is the government's policy? Encouraging them to take out more loans in the vain hope that happy days will soon be here again. Just what this country needs. More debt. The Great Stink of 1858 was a moment when something shifted. British members of parliament could no longer ignore the evidence of their nostrils. In the Great Stink of 2019, we need our Parliament to shift too. We need our politicians to face up to the evidence of their nostrils. Climate change affects everybody. It is an emergency taking place - literally right under our noses. It's time to stop the fires. Will we look back and see this year as a turning point, a moment when reality finally trumped self-interest? Or will our politicians continue to show how much less courage they have than those of 1858? If so, there's another lesson we can learn from the Great Stink. Buy shares in bleach. After all, someone always profits from disaster. #stopthefires #greatstink Professor Desmond Manderson is the director of the Centre for Law, Arts and Humanities at the Australian National University. \"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia92","China slowdown threatens Paris climate goals","November 18, 2019 Monday 04:01 PM GMT","AFR Online","China's economic slowdown may force Beijing to choose between reducing carbon emissions or promoting economic growth, posing a new threat to global efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Dr Xue Lei, a research fellow at the Chinese government-affiliated Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, said this challenge was compounded by the spread of populism led by US President Donald Trump. HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/world/north-america/trump-sets-stage-for-climate-change-election-20191105-p537kx Trump's formal withdrawal from the Paris Agreement was a ""huge blow"" in the fight against global warming. ""On one side, [China's economic slowdown] will reduce production and maybe reduce pollution. But the environmental controls ??? may be too harsh for some enterprises,"" Dr Xue said. ""Because [the government] has set the bar so high many enterprises - particularly small and medium-sized enterprises - cannot afford to comply with them. If they comply with the standards they cannot be viable. So the slowdown may have caused a great challenge."" Any backsliding by China on climate commitments would play into the Australian government's efforts to defend its own record on climate change against critics who say Australia is not doing enough. In the October quarter, China's economy grew at a weaker-than-expected 6 per cent, a 30-year low. Economists predicted the slowdown would continue in the last quarter of 2019, a result of the trade war with the US and weak domestic demand. China is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, accounting for nearly 30 per cent of global emissions, according to the International Energy Agency. As in Australia, around 60 per cent of electricity in China is generated by coal-fired power stations. China's emissions continue to rise, increasing 2.3 per cent in 2018. Under the Paris Agreement, the Chinese government has committed to ensuring emissions growth peaks by 2030. As part of the effort to hit this target, the Chinese government aims to limit coal-fired power to 58 per cent of total electricity generation by 2020. It is also planning to launch an emissions trading scheme and a mandatory renewable energy certificate scheme in 2020. But earlier this year, the government lifted restrictions on the construction of coal-fired power stations, a sign Beijing may be putting more immediate economic concerns ahead of emissions reduction. The government has also declined to enforce quotas on coal imports, which Macquarie analysts speculated in a note last week could be a response to the economic slowdown. ""Perhaps the government is more concerned with bringing down coal/operating costs of the power sector (and therefore, broader industry costs), as an offset for weakening broader economic growth,"" the analysts wrote. ""I'm not sure whether we can achieve the goal if the US does not join the global action. When President Trump first mentioned that the US will withdraw from the Paris agreement, we thought maybe the efforts from the American business community and also at the state government level - because many of the states still want to achieve clean energy goals - [would be enough]. But now we see that this reluctance of the federal government has had a great impact,"" he said. He cited the ongoing battle between the US federal government and the Californian government over car emission standards. He said president Trump's success in persuading carmakers General Motors, Toyota and Fiat Chrysler to back the federal government's standards over California's much stricter rules was evidence of the president's negative influence. He also pointed to Mr Trump's ban on use of the term ""climate change"" by the Department of Agriculture. ""In 2016, I was still a little optimistic about the US role in global efforts. But now we have seen gradually the federal government's attitude has caused negative impacts,"" he said. Dr Xue did not comment specifically on the Australian government's lack of strong emissions reduction policies, but said he believed President Trump's actions were setting a bad example. ""I think another impact of the US attitude change maybe also spreading to other governments. With so-called populism rising in many developed countries, they may follow the example of the Trump government. They don't think this is a serious issue,"" he said. Dr Xue's comments come three weeks ahead of the United Nations COP25 climate change conference in Madrid. Madrid was a last minute choice of venue after social unrest in Santiago forced the Chilean government to pull out of hosting the conference. Santiago itself was the second choice, after Brazil's populist president Jair Bolsonaro pulled out of hosting the event late last year. Mr Bolsonaro has expressed scepticism towards climate science, and has also threatened to withdraw from the Paris agreement. His foreign minister, Ernesto Araujo, has described global warming as a conspiracy by ""cultural Marxists"" to stifle growth in capitalist countries. However, at a meeting of the BRICS nations - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - in Brasilia last week, the five nations formally reiterated their commitment to the goals of the Paris Agreement. \"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia93","Climate winds blowing on Morrison from Liberal Party's left","December 14, 2019 Saturday","Canberra Times (Australia)","Scott Morrison is picking up that Australia's devastating, prolonged fires are producing a soured, anti-government mood among many in the community. It may not be entirely rational for people to turn on politicians in such situations. The actual fighting of the fires, driven primarily at state and local levels, appears to have been efficient. But the government has invited anger in terms of the broad debate by being so inactive and partisan about climate change over the years. Morrison is struggling to navigate his way through these fraught days before Christmas. He's stressing unity - ""the country is working together ... to deal with the firefighting challenge"". He's refusing to yield to calls for a national summit or a COAG meeting on the fire effort, but he's highlighting the federal government's co-ordinating activities. He's placing the most positive spin he can on what Australia is doing on climate change, but all the time emphasising Australian emissions are only a tiny portion of the global total, ""so any suggestion that the actions of any state or any nation with a contribution to global emissions of that order is directly linked to any weather event ... is just simply not true"". The fires are putting pressure on the government by elevating the climate issue and opening a new division among Liberals. Only this time - and importantly - the internal wedge is coming from the left rather than the right of the party. The PM is being pushed to do more, rather than being held back. Morrison is no longer able to gloss over the climate debate. The big question for the next year or two is whether he will reposition the government. As former Treasury secretary Ken Henry has argued, ""today's catastrophic bushfires, and rapidly vanishing water security, again following years of drought, put the present government in a similar position"" to when John Howard moved on climate change in 2006. Morrison is the ultimate pragmatist and so, if he sees it in his interest, he may well be willing to readjust. Not radically, nor quickly. Just enough, as and when he judges it, to satisfy middle-ground voters. This week NSW's Liberal Environment Minister Matt Kean bluntly called out his federal colleagues' dancing around the climate-fires link. ""Let's not beat around the bush ... let's call it for what it is. These bushfires have been caused by extreme weather events, high temperatures, the worst drought in living memory - the exact type of events scientists have been warning us about for decades that would be caused by climate change,"" said Kean, who is the leader at the state level of the party's moderate faction. ""There has been a lot of talk since the federal election about ending the climate wars ... It's not time to end the climate wars. It's time to win the climate wars."" One federal Liberal says: ""for a long time [Kean's line] is where the overwhelming majority of the party has stood [but] nobody was willing to say it. The community is so concerned it has given us the cover to come out and say it."" The issue hits in Melbourne and Sydney Liberal heartland seats. The federal government has repeatedly derided the Victorian and Queensland Labor governments for what it argues is their excessive ambition on renewables and emissions reduction. Kean has flagged NSW plans to strengthen its stand. The federal government is clearly exposed as the odd player out. Yet it's the states' targets for renewables that are helping the national effort on emissions reduction, according to the latest figures from the Environment Department. The projection is now for Australia to have renewables generating 48 per cent of its electricity by 2030 - close to the Labor policy of 50 per cent, of which the government was so critical. Energy Minister Angus Taylor's speech at the United Nations COP25 conference in Spain this week showed how, as the inevitable transition to clean energy progresses, the government is conflicted. Regardless of years of scepticism about renewables from the federal Coalition, Taylor in Madrid lauded Australia's achievements in this area. Reality is gradually proving stronger than ideology as the energy mix changes, but not entirely. The argument around whether there should be a new coal-fired power station in Queensland goes on, and the Nationals continue to push for action. There was a certain irony in Anthony Albanese touring coal country in central Queensland this week, given the climate debate. Visiting Emerald, Rockhampton and Gladstone, among other stops, Albanese was beginning his mission to reconcile the strands in Labor's climate messages, after Bill Shorten failed to do so, costing vital Queensland votes. This week Albanese has been talking up the domestic transition to renewables, while providing reassurance to the coal areas by declaring the world will continue to want Australian coal for the foreseeable future. As to a new coal-fired power station: he believes it would not get private finance. Very aware Shorten was smashed for trying to walk in different shoes on climate and coal when he was in the inner city and in regional Queensland, Albanese is aiming for a story to which he can get a favourable reception all round the country. That won't be easy. But then nothing is, for anyone, on the climate issue. Michelle Grattan is a press gallery journalist and former editor of The Canberra Times.

To make matters worse, global inequalities have left the global south lacking crucial infrastructural and institutional development necessary to build resilience to climate breakdown. Addressing injustice Not nearly enough action has yet been taken. We can, at least, say that it is increasingly accepted that we must sharply reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But this doesn't go far enough. We also owe it to those communities already experiencing climate breakdown - often those who have done the least to contribute to the climate crisis but experience the worst of it - to help them adapt to the new reality. Our failure to do so constitutes an injustice that is currently inadequately recognised. A major issue at the recent COP25 climate conference concerned HYPERLINK https://climateanalytics.org/blog/2019/loss-and-damage-at-cop25-a-hard-fought-step-in-the-right-direction/ who should pay for this adaptation and for the loss and damage compensation in lower income countries. It was agreed that countries that have benefited from industrialisation should take some responsibility for their \~ HYPERLINK https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13698230903326331 historical role in driving climate breakdown. This responsibility, then, falls primarily - if not solely - on the affluent, industrialised nations of the global north. But the adaptation finance that has so far been provided by these countries has been insufficient, and has often failed to reach the most vulnerable communities. In order to address this, countries that have signed the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change (UNFCCC), the main governing body for climate action, must actually uphold the HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement commitments made in the Paris Agreement, which highlights adaptation and loss and damage compensation as equal pillars of climate justice alongside mitigation. Such action might include a closer collaboration with development programmes all over the world to promote development for adaptation, as well as the continued allocation of UNFCCC resources towards adaptation initiatives. Such initiatives should aim to HYPERLINK https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2841 build resilient infrastructures HYPERLINK http://www.fao.org/3/i9705en/i9705en.pdf depending on fishing and farming HYPERLINK http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8187866.stm raised fields among indigenous farmers in the Bolivian Amazon, which are key to resilience. Representing the most vulnerable Another key element of this concerns representation. The https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/global-south-experts-sidelined-climate-conversations-191203132302298.html voices of poor and marginalised communities are too easily lost in a climate debates in the global north. For more well-off countries, significant costs from climate breakdown are still mostly in the future, albeit \~ HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/05/greta-thunberg-developing-world-activists rapidly approaching HYPERLINK Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform (LCIPPP) as an advisory body to the UNFCCC. But such platforms are lacking at most national and local levels. Building on this, it is necessary to create opportunities for climate vulnerable communities to be actively involved in formulating both global and local visions of climate justice. These visions must give equal consideration to their present experiences of living with climate breakdown and the need to facilitate adaptation not only in the future, but in the here and now. In the case of the Batwa Indigenous Peoples of Uganda, HYPERLINK https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/pais/research/researchcentres/ierg/specialisms/internationaldevelopment/remedying_injustices_in_climate_adaptation_public_report_compressed.pdf we have found that national adaptation plans largely ignore the interests of marginalised groups like them. Sometimes, they even make their situation worse, or violate basic human rights. In an attempt to help them adapt to climate breakdown, the Batwa, for example, were forcibly relocated from their native lands in the rainforest to areas that, while having some access to infrastructure, lack proper housing and arable land. In many lower income countries, climate breakdown is already bringing very significant costs. But for many in the global north, the worst is still to come, and much of the focus of climate action is still on mitigation. Somehow, perspectives need to change: the climate crisis is an issue of global and social justice.

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia95","The trio of obstacles on climate change","February 14, 2020 Friday 03:48 PM GMT","AFR Online","Despite the buzz around climate action at this year's World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, the world's current environmental prospects look grim. There are three obstacles: climate-change denial; the economics of reducing greenhouse-gas (GHGs) emissions; and the politics of mitigation policies, which tend to be highly regressive. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, global carbon-dioxide emissions must be cut 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030, and then eliminated entirely by 2050, to have even a reasonable chance of preventing global warming of 1.5??C above pre-industrial levels. ""We need quick wins,"" warns the United Nations Environment Program in its latest \~ Emissions Gap Report, ""or the 1.5??C goal of the Paris Agreement will slip out of reach."" That is an understatement. Even if the current Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the 2015 \~ Paris accord are met, emissions in 2030 will be 38 per cent above where they need to be. Global average temperatures will be on track to rise by a disastrous 2.9-3.4??C by 2100, with continuing increases thereafter. The NDC targets would need to be roughly \~ tripled just to limit warming to 2??C, and would have to increase fivefold to achieve the 1.5??C goal. That is not going to happen. The only time in recent history when CO2 emissions have looked as though they might plateau was in 2014-2016, owing to weak global growth. According to the \~ Global Carbon Project, emissions have since increased again, by 2.7 per cent in 2018 and 0.6 per cent in 2019. Making matters worse, the December 2019 UN Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) was a dismal failure, resulting in no new climate pledges or clear messages of intent for this year's COP26 summit in Glasgow. Why is humanity so reluctant to save itself? First, many people simply do not accept the predictions issued by climate scientists. But denialism is the least serious of the three main obstacles. There will always be a minority for whom facts and logic are unwelcome distractions. Yet even US President Donald Trump must realise by now that climate change will undermine the future viability and profitability of Mar-a-Lago. As the real-world costs of climate-driven disasters mount over time, denialism will become less of an issue. Indeed, a November 2019 Yale University survey finds that 62 per cent of registered voters in the United States already would support a president ""declaring global warming a national emergency if Congress does not act"". The second major challenge is that GHG emissions are the quintessential global economic externality. Climate change doesn't respect borders; GHGs emitted anywhere will affect everyone eventually. That means there is a massive free-rider problem. Under current circumstances, it will always be individually rational to let others cut back on their emissions rather than doing so yourself. The only way to correct this problem is through collective rationality or enlightened self-interest. But given the current state of multilateralism, expecting a truly global effort in pursuit of the common good is a tall order. The third obstacle is that effective policies to reduce GHG emissions disproportionately hurt the poor (both globally and within countries). The International Monetary Fund recently calculated that the current effective global price of CO2 emissions is a mere $2 per ton. To limit global warming to less than 2??C, however, would require an average effective price of $75 per ton by 2030. I agree with Harvard University economist Kenneth Rogoff that a uniform global carbon-emissions tax is likely to be the best solution to the climate challenge, at least from an environmental perspective. But with such a tax in place, average household electricity prices over the next decade would increase cumulatively by 45 per cent, and gasoline prices by 15 per cent. Hence, even within rich countries, the distributional consequences would be difficult to handle, as France's government found out after it tried to introduce a modest fuel tax in 2018. Worse, since the 1980s, effective redistributive fiscal mechanisms in most advanced economies have been emasculated. Moreover, the larger distributional burden of a global carbon tax would fall disproportionately on poor countries that are hoping to pursue rapid development in the coming decades. Around 570 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa alone lack access to basic electricity; globally, the number is closer to \~ 1.2 billion. Needless to say, long-overdue growth in developing and emerging economies will bring massive increases in energy consumption and GHG emissions. In India, China, and many other countries, coal-fired power plants will likely continue to be built for years to come. Clean and renewable energy from solar and wind will complement, but not displace, fossil fuels in these countries. Despite the strides made in battery storage technology, the intermittency problems associated with wind and solar imply a continuing role for fossil fuels and nuclear power. Consider India, which accounts for 7 per cent of annual global GHG emissions, making it the world's fourth-largest emitter, after China (27 per cent), the US (15 per cent), and the European Union (10 per cent). That is despite the fact that India's per capita energy consumption is around \~ one-tenth of America's. And even if that figure doubles by 2030, it will still be only half of what China's was in 2015. Countries like India and those in Sub-Saharan Africa are not going to sacrifice their economic development for the sake of emissions reductions. The only way to square the circle is to extend financial aid to developing and emerging economies undergoing unavoidably energy-intensive development, so that they can afford to internalise the GHG externality through an appropriately steep tax on emissions. Unfortunately, sustained large-scale international aid programs are deeply unpopular. And given that domestic fiscal solidarity is already wanting, cross-border fiscal solidarity seems like a non-starter. Unless and until that changes, an existential crisis of our own making will only worsen. Project Syndicate \"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia96","Trump accused of secretly blocking move to quell internet extremism","August 25, 2019 Sunday 11:41 AM GMT","WA Today","Biarritz: Prime Minister Scott Morrison has arrived in France for the G7 summit hoping to push his case for a global fight against extremism on the internet - but new doubts have emerged over whether US president Donald Trump is on board. On Saturday, shortly before Morrison's plane touched down at the meeting of major democratic leaders in the south-western coastal resort of Biarritz, French media claimed the White House had opposed social networks signing a so-called ""Charter for an open, free and safe internet"" inspired by the so-called Christchurch Call. Google, Facebook, Microsoft, SnapChat and Twitter had been expected to sign the pledge on Friday, but French officials said it had been shifted to Monday when both Trump and Morrison will be present. ""There's no doubt on the fact that the social networks will sign the pledge,"" French junior minister for the digital industry Cedric O insisted on Saturday. But French radio station Europe 1 reported the event had ""disappeared"" from the official agenda and there had been ""long doubt"" over the participation of social media giants. ""Pressure from Donald Trump was mentioned,"" the station said, citing an unnamed source. The charter is due to be discussed at a working lunch on Monday, attended by the G7 national leaders plus Morrison. On Sunday Morrison and Trump will have a short ""pull aside"" conversation. Digital strategy is a new battleground between the US and France. The latter imposed a 3 per cent digital sales tax, on the grounds that internet giants are using international tax loopholes to shift profits out of the countries where they are made. But Trump retaliated by threatening to raise tariffs on French wine, and is reportedly keen to raise the issue again in Biarritz. If Trump decides the fight against internet extremism can be used as a lever to extract concessions from the French on the digital tax initiative, it could be a blow to Morrison's hopes for the summit. The Australian prime minister has adopted New Zealand's ""Christchurch Call"" to eliminate terrorist and violent content online. The government anticipated the G7 would be a chance for Morrison to build on his success at June's G20 summit in Osaka, where he convinced leaders to send a joint message to social media platforms to do more to root out extremist content that can inspire terror and violence. A senior Trump official denied the White House had pressured social media giants not to sign the charter, which builds on the Christchurch call outlining new ways to fight hate speech, cyberbullying and online terrorism - with new rules for taking down or moderating extreme content, ensuring transparency and supporting victims. But the official told Reuters the industry had banded together to try to water down the initiative: ""We heard from a couple of companies that they felt bullied by France to join,"" he said. And he was non-committal on whether Trump would sign, saying the White House was still evaluating it. ""It certainly has merits,"" he said. In the US the constitutional right to free speech is seen as a major block to efforts to crack down on internet hate speech and terrorism. Meanwhile in Biarritz early action at the G7 included one-on-one meetings between leaders including Macron and Trump. Trump reported that ""everyone is getting along"" and ""we'll accomplish a lot this weekend"". A French diplomat was quoted saying Macron outlined in their meeting a new plan to ease tensions with Iran, allowing the nation to export a limited amount of oil if it agrees to continue to implement the 2015 nuclear deal, reduce hostility in the Perisan Gulf and open talks. The bilaterals were followed by a working dinner of all G7 leaders featuring local Basque specialities including red tuna cooked in an earthenware dish with tomatoes, followed by cheese, cakes and a peach dessert. He said he was ""very worried"" about the way global trade was going, ""the growth of protectionism, of tariffs that we're seeing"". And he said the UK was ""at risk of being implicated"" in the US-China trade spat. ""This is not the way to proceed,"" he said. ""Apart from everything else, those who support the tariffs are at risk of incurring the blame for the downturn in the global economy, irrespective of whether or not that is true. ""I want to see an opening up of global trade, I want to see a dialling down of tensions and I want to see tariffs come off."" Saturday also saw a march of thousands of anti-G7 protesters in a town south of Biarritz on the Spanish border. Marchers said they wanted more action against climate change and did not trust the G7 leaders to treat the climate emergency with to urgency it required. On Sunday Morrison is due to meet Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe to discuss the internet extremism strategy, as well as regional security. He will talk to the Secretary-general of the OECD Angel Gurria about internet extremism, and possibly proposals for a global digital tax. He will talk to Rwanda's president Paul Kagame about the Commonwealth, and with Chilean president Pinera Echenique about the digital economy, the role of women in economic growth, and the TPP free trade deal.

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia97","China ramps up coal but don't panic; Mining Boom","November 29, 2019 Friday","Sydney Morning Herald (Australia)","China's Xi Jinping is now adding a large coal plant every two weeks but green energy will win the day, writes Ambrose Evans-Pritchard. No further coal plants should be built anywhere in the world ever again. The great majority of existing plants should be phased out within 15 years. That is the message of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as delegates descend on Madrid for next week's COP25 . There is no chance of keeping CO2 emissions below critical thresholds and preventing runaway climate change if this does not happen. So one might justifiably be aggrieved by news that China is engaged in a massive - if surreptitious - expansion of its coal power fleet in breach of earlier pledges, taking advantage of climate denialism in the White House to raid the global commons. Xi Jinping's industrial machine accounts for half the world's coal use. He is now adding a large coal plant every two weeks. China's emissions rose 4.7 per cent last year. It released more CO2 and methane than the US, the EU and Japan combined. Yet some of its provinces are literally doubling down. Planning documents from small, sleepy Jiangxi reveal a push by that one region to build 22.6 gigawatts (GW) of new coal plants by 2025, raising its capacity twofold. Jiangxi would in theory become the world's fifth-biggest coal power. Data from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis show that the EU's coal use so far this year has fallen 23 per cent, thanks to wind power and a surge in carbon prices to (EURO)25 ($40) as Brussels drains excess contracts. This has driven a switch to gas with half the CO2 footprint. Coal use has dropped 13.9 per cent in the US. China is completely out of line. ""It does not look good, and it isn't good,"" says Adair Turner, president of the Energy Transitions Commission. ""Two or three years ago they began to get a grip on this and told the provinces to stop building coal plants, but the global situation has changed. They face a tariff war that is slowing the economy so they are responding in the way they know with more concrete and more infrastructure."" National security has intruded. ""There are those saying we can't switch over to (LNG) gas because the Americans may cut us off. The tariff war is universally seen by the Chinese as an attempt to keep their country down,"" Lord Turner said.. On the face of it, the facts in China are grim. The Global Energy Monitor says satellite images and analysis of Chinese documents show that frozen expansion plans are being reactivated. Half of the new coal plants approved during a wild permitting spree before 2016 are now being built or in the pipeline. This adds 148GW of new coal capacity, equal to the EU's entire fleet. The signals from Beijing hint at a massive rise beyond the current 1,027GW capacity under the next Five Year Plan. The state-owned Electric Power Planning Institute wants a 1,400GW cap in 2035. The Energy Monitor said this is going catastrophically in the wrong direction. China would have to cut capacity to 600GW over the next decade to give a 2C limit any chance. Meanwhile, Chinese banks are financing a blizzard of new coal plants across south-east Asia as part of the Belt and Road initiative, even in countries where renewables have reached grid parity and the projects may be rendered financially obsolete in a decade. It is a way to export China's technology in ""clean coal"". These practices risk a riposte once the Trump anomaly is over in Washington. Democratic contender Elizabeth Warren is proposing a carbon border tax in the US presidential campaign. This can be dialled up to levels that amount to a trade blockade. It is a veiled threat to shut China - or Jair Bolsonaro's Brazil - out of the US market. Yet there is a big twist to this Chinese saga that may ultimately turn the picture on its head. Utilisation rates of China's coal plants have collapsed to 48.6 per cent. ""China is going to waste a lot of money on stranded assets. Demand for electricity generated from thermal coal is already beginning to fall,"" says Kingsmill Bond from Carbon Tracker. Behind this is disruption from super-cheap solar and wind power hitting the grid. A recent paper by three Chinese economists in Nature Energy concluded solar has trumped coal in all of China's 344 cities. Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) says solar module costs have fallen 89 per cent and onshore wind by 49 per cent since 2010. ""In China, their levellised costs are now below the average regulated coal power price,"" it said. Ergo, a new solar park in Guangdong or an Inner Mongolia wind farm undercuts a new coal plant. BNEF says we are now going further. By 2030 renewables will be so cheap that it makes economic sense to shut even the most modern coal plants and write off the sunk costs. It thinks solar is heading for $US25 per megawatt hour, tantamount to free power. Much has been made of a ""green leap backward"" in China over the last two years. The sudden elimination of wind and solar subsidies has been a market shock. Renewable investment has crashed by 60 per cent. One should not read too much into this policy shift. The same happened in Spain. Renewables later rebounded. ""The Chinese were trying to test whether renewables can fly on their own but overdid it. This is just a pause,"" said Lord Turner. Despite all, China added 44.3GW of solar capacity last year, a big chunk of global installations (104GW). ""There is no sign that the Chinese are turning their backs on renewables,"" said Bob Ward from the Grantham Centre at the London School of Economics. The optimistic view is that China's latest coal mania is the last futile roar of an industry facing annihilation. The coal lobby still has some hold over Communist Party bosses but China itself faces an existential threat from snow melt in Tibet and desertification. ""A political battle is going on in China over two versions of the future: one is dirty; one is clean. My money is that clean will win and that China's CO2 emissions will peak well before 2030,"" said Professor Ward. The Daily Telegraph, London 4.7% How much China increased its emissions last year.

Even the PRI (the organisation that governs the Principles for Responsible Investment) HYPERLINK https://www.unepfi.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Legal-Framework-for-Impact_UNEPFI_PRI_Generation.pdf acknowledges that action lags behind awareness. Companies are often not accounting for risks to sustainability. Nor do they account for how they are addressing environmental, social and governance issues relating to climate change. Civil society organisations, academics and journalists have begun questioning whether responsible investment can bring about the level and pace of change required to enable an inclusive climate change transition. They are also highlighting the high risk of HYPERLINK https://qz.com/1490365/esg-investing-risks-becoming-a-victim-of-its-own-success/ greenwashing - when companies set ambitious climate goals but have no plans for how to get there. To better understand whether the financial industry is really shifting, we looked to South Africa, a country with a leading regulatory framework for responsible investment. Since 2011, all pension funds have been required to take a responsible investment approach as part of their fiduciary duty. A HYPERLINK https://www.iodsa.co.za/page/CRISACode Code for Responsible Investment in South Africa) was released and in 2013 it supplied practice recommendations for institutional investors and their service providers. As a result, most South African institutional investors publicly pledged their support for responsible investment. But HYPERLINK https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0170840619878467 our study , which tracks implementation from 2013 to 2019, found that the changes to investment practices were mostly superficial. More talk than action We looked at what South African institutional investors said they were doing on their websites or in their financial and other reports. The changes focused on publishing annual general meeting voting results and creating policies to increase transparency. Sustainability policies were generally rudimentary, using tailor-made definitions. They did not depart from ""business as usual"". And when we spoke to industry insiders, we found that even among responsible investment leaders, core investment practices and incentive structures remain largely unchanged. Portfolio managers talked about environmental, social and governance factors being an irritation. They said these often came at the wrong time in the investment process. Others explained that environmental or social data were still seen as ""fluffy"" and difficult to factor into investment decisions. Our findings are backed up by a HYPERLINK https://www.unepfi.org/publications/regions-publications/africa-middle-east-publications/fiduciary-duty-in-the-21st-century-south-africa-roadmap/ recent report concluding that South African investors might be aware of these issues in theory, ""but may not understand what it means in practice"". Is ambiguity causing the implementation gap? We believe that part of the problem may lie in the way the concept of responsible investment was introduced. How a concept is initially framed guides how it will be interpreted and implemented. The initial framing defines the core problem and attributes responsibility. It also articulates potential solutions and motivates action. In an effort to bring companies on board, the principles for responsible investment were initially HYPERLINK https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0170840614563742 framed using language that was flexible and compatible with investors' priorities around risk and returns. At the same time, the language sought to accommodate society's environmental and social concerns. For instance, in their \~ HYPERLINK https://www.unpri.org/signatories/become-a-signatory declarations , PRI signatories recognise that ""environmental, social, and corporate governance issues can affect the performance of investment portfolios"". Considering them ""may better align investors with broader objectives of society"". This early framing shifted the problem from the need to address environmental and social issues into a duty to consider how such factors might affect risks and returns. It failed to attribute any responsibility and it overly emphasised disclosure as a solution. As a result, investors' obligation to review their practices was left open to interpretation. While this framing boosted early adoption, it may have done so at the expense of effective change in the long term. The ambiguity of the language attracted investors to sign up to the principles. But it also allowed them to interpret the principles in a manner consistent with how they had always done business. They weren't forced to review and change their practices and priorities. By appearing to acknowledge societal demands for change, the framing of responsible investment seems to have inadvertently conveyed a false impression of progress. When we spoke with civil society organisations, they lamented how seeing their language reflected in the early framing may have delayed their efforts to hold investors to account. The need to reframe responsible investment As emissions and inequality continue to rise, responsible investment needs a reframing. The new frame needs to be clear on the core problem. It must attribute responsibility, motivate action and outline solutions. The focus needs to be squarely on reducing inequality and achieving an inclusive climate transition. If investors want to understand what society demands of them, they need only look to the HYPERLINK https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org Sustainable Development Goals https://www.fsb-tcfd.org Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures are starting to guide the way.

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia99","Cooling the atmosphere may be our only hope","January 11, 2020 Saturday","Canberra Times (Australia)","The release of some 910 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide since the onset of the industrial age is leading human society to an existential impasse. Reports from the Madrid COP-25 climate conference suggest negotiations were almost exclusively focused on reduction of carbon emissions. This avoids the evidence that the high atmospheric concentration of CO2, at 410 parts per million (or 500 ppm when combined with methane and nitrous oxide) has created amplifying feedbacks. These include the release of methane from permafrost, desiccated vegetation, extensive fires, a reduced capacity of warming oceans to absorb CO2, and the melting of ice sheets, which opens ocean and land tracts that absorb infrared radiation, pushing global temperatures further upwards. Due to these amplifying feedbacks and the long-term residence of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, attempts to limit further temperature rises to 1.5 degrees, or a maximum of 2 degrees, by emissions reduction alone may not be possible. Indeed, whereas abrupt reduction in CO2 emissions is absolutely essential, no one knows how to prevent further warming, for the following reasons: An increase in evaporation due to warming of the land and oceans leads to further heating due to the greenhouse effect of water vapour. This factor, significant in the tropics, is less important in the dry subtropical zones and relatively minor in the polar regions. The release of methane from melting permafrost and bubbling of methane hydrates from the oceans has already raised atmospheric methane levels from about 800 to 1863 parts per billion - which, given the radiative effects of methane being 25 times that of CO2, is significant. As the oceans warm they become less capable of taking up carbon dioxide. Encroachment of tropical and subtropical climate zones into temperate Mediterranean-type climate zones leads to extensive fires, constituting a factor in the current bushfires raging across eastern Australia, which have already released 250 million tonnes of CO2 - almost half of country's annual emissions in 2018. READ MORE: Opinion: Localised fire knowledge is vital to our survival on this continent Ebony Bennett: The bushfire crisis is a wake-up call we can't afford to ignore Opinion: The world is paralysed by a fear of going it alone on emissions reduction Stabilisation and cooling of the climate would include two principle approaches: solar shielding and CO2 sequestration. However, solar shielding by injected aerosols is bound to be transient, requiring constant reinjection. According to Professor James Hansen, carbon sequestration in soil using the biochar method (oxygen-free combustion using residues of crops, forestry and animal waste) would sequester large amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere. The biochar method helps soil retain nutrients and fertilisers, reducing the release of greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide. Other methods of carbon sequestration, if applied on a large scale, include the streaming of air through basaltic rocks, where the CO2 is incorporated with calcium and magnesium as carbonates. The big question is how effective these methods are in reducing CO2 levels on a global scale - at the very least in being able to balance emissions, currently at 36.8 billion tonnes of CO2 per year. Whereas each of the methods I've mentioned have advantages and disadvantages, it is hard to see an alternative way of cooling the atmosphere. Budgets on a scale of military spending ($1.7 trillion in 2017) would be required for any attempt to slow down the current trend across climate tipping points to have a chance of working. The choice humanity is facing is whether to spend its dwindling resources on wars or on defence of life from the climate calamity.

The truth is more complicated than a hotter planet inevitably meaning more violence, war and chaos.

Poverty forced Muzaffar to work as a child and he never had a chance to attend school. The day he got a family of his own, his main concern was putting food on the table. At the time, food in the area was scarce due to the lack of rain and, as the local climate became less stable, his village HYPERLINK struggled increasingly with drought Here, he worked as a day labourer in the harbour, carrying sand and stones on his head. Unable to afford a house, he lived in a shared dormitory shed made of tin, and full of mosquitoes and ants. I suffered a lot. We were about 50-60 people stuck in there ... As I was not educated I could not really change my profession or build up a career. I just made sure to care for my family. That was all that kept me going. After deciding to return home, Muzaffar settled down close to a pond on government-owned land. The local government reassured him that he could stay there. However, powerful men, who had already filed a claim to the land in the local court, showed up one day planting trees next to his house - a common land-grabbing strategy in the area. Muzaffar described their encounter: I told the man ... If you win, you will get the land, but for now I will not allow you to plant trees on my land. You can plant [your trees] in the open land instead ... They did not want to listen and kept on planting trees. So after a while I went over there to reason with him and pulled away his hand to stop him. He stood up abruptly, and hit me with his spade. I tried to protect myself with my hand, but it cut straight through my hand into my face, here, right next to my eye. Muzaffar fainted as soon as the spade hit his head. His landless indigenous neighbours tried to help him and put him into a taxi to the hospital but his attackers tried to stop him from getting into the vehicle. They would not allow the taxi to leave until Muzaffar's uncle screamed: ""If you want him dead, you better kill him now!"". The police came to the village to investigate what had happened, but Muzaffar could not afford the payment or bribe commonly required for their service. Unable to pay the police, the case is still running in the regional high court, decades later. In the words of Muzaffar, ""he who is poor cannot afford to pay the price for justice"". Thankfully, Muzaffar's life took a positive change. He did not get justice in court, but a few years ago a local NGO gave him a few goats and a sheep, and Bangladesh's largest NGO gave him a cow. Muzaffar decided to sell his animals, using the money to get a loan, buy a harvester machine, and start a small business. These days he keeps livestock, harvests other people's land, rents out his machine, and does share cropping - a collective form of agriculture in which a landowner allows people to farm their land in return for a share of the crops. He has already started to pay back his loans. His eyes were filled with pride during my last visit as he shared the news that his youngest daughter had just finished her bachelor's degree. Others, of course, are HYPERLINK https://doi.org/10.1080/01436591003701141 not so lucky . Some are unable to pay their loans, some are forced to sell their land and assets to pay them off - and some lose their livelihoods or end up in jail. Complex causes The loss of natural resources in the area due to climatic stress played a role in the conflict Muzaffar faced. However, so did land politics and power dynamics, social stigmatisation, discrimination, and the legacy of colonialism. Muzaffar was poor. He was landless. He was not protected by the law. The justice system made it easy for those with more power to take his land. The men who attacked him had powerful connections in the village. HYPERLINK http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/31346/ Bangladesh and elsewhere, owe their existence to decisions made during colonial rule. For example, while colonial laws governing the division of land no longer apply, they entrenched inequality in access to resources and influence that still persists today, giving rise to conflict that may never had occurred had countries developed autonomously.

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia102","Hayne rebukes directors on climate failure","December 9, 2019 Monday 00:00 GMT","AFR Online","Former High Court judge and royal commissioner Kenneth Hayne has warned directors they have a legal duty to act on climate change risk, include it in corporate strategies and report on it to shareholders, raising the real prospect that boards failing to act HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/politics/climate-litigation-could-become-like-tobacco-actions-martijn-wilder-20180405-h0yctd could end up in court In a private address to business leaders, regulators and government officials hosted by think tank, the Centre for Policy Development, Mr Hayne also took a swipe at the Morrison government, which has come under criticism for its unambitious emissions reduction policies. He said both ""learned helplessness"" and ""short-termism"" yielded ""a result that fits comfortably with those who still see climate change as a matter of belief or ideology"". ""Framing the most recent debates provoked by the bushfire emergencies as part of the 'culture wars' reinforces the notion that climate science is a matter of belief, not scientific observation and extrapolation,"" he said. ""No less importantly, because the debate remains framed as a debate about belief, learned helplessness and short-termism can be translated into the nativist-populist terms that now have such currency in many political systems."" Mr Hayne said in the remarks released exclusively to The Australian Financial Review, that international expert consensus was now clear that climate change risk was a matter of fact and boards could not hide behind excuses for inaction. ""International opinion is now firmly behind the need for all entities with public debt or equity to respond to climate change issues in their governance, their strategy, their risk management and their metrics and targets and, importantly, to record their responses to the issues in their financial reports,"" Mr Hayne said. He said the financial regulators - the HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/asic-names-climate-change-systemic-risk-in-rulebook-20190812-p52gbg Australian Securities and Investments Commission , the \~ HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/apra-warns-climate-uncertainty-no-excuse-for-inaction-20190428-p51hww Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the \~ HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/policy/energy-and-climate/rba-warns-climate-risks-may-become-uninsurable-20191004-p52xt8 Reserve Bank of Australia ""The inevitable consequence [of this consensus] is that, in Australia, a director acting in the best interests of the company must take account of, and the board must report publicly on, climate-related risks and issues relevant to the entity,"" he said. He said more companies would need ""to consider the potential impact of climate change and disclose their material findings than are now doing so"", and dismissed the argument that the magnitude of the problem left directors helpless to act, referring to that position as ""learned helplessness"". Mr Hayne's remarks come three years after barristers Noel Hutley, SC, and Sebastian Hartford Davis published a landmark https://www.afr.com/politics/directors-climate-liability-exposure-increasing-exponentially-20190327-h1cuja opinion , which argued boards that failed to consider climate change risks could be found liable for breaching their duty of care and diligence. Mr Hayne's opinion will add new force to the view that boards have clear legal obligations on climate risk. As commissioner of the 2018 financial services royal commission, his recommendations on the treatment of non-financial risks, particularly cultural risks, have already sparked a radical rethink of directors' responsibility for areas previously considered outside their remit. Alluding to the findings of the royal commission, Mr Hayne told the CPD roundtable: ""As recent events in the financial services industry should have shown, the notion of 'non-financial' risks can be very misleading."" ""A response often seen in Australian political discourse is that 'The issue is large; Australia is comparatively small; nothing we do will affect the outcome if the big emitters do not act.' That is, the response is, 'We can do nothing that will help.' ""By making that response, we are persuading ourselves that we are helpless,"" Mr Hayne said. ""Helplessness is then coupled with short-termism. At the national level, short-termism is expressed as: 'Doing something now will have adverse effects on employment in some part or parts of the country. That would be bad for the national economy. Therefore, we will do nothing.'"" He said directors must not be distracted by the ""framing of the political debates"", urging them instead to look at standards set out by the international business-led Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, which has been endorsed by Australian regulators. Mr Hayne's remarks were made at a closed roundtable discussion hosted by the Centre for Policy Development late last month in Sydney. Also present were RBA deputy governor Guy Debelle, Bank of England executive director Sarah Breeden, APRA executive board member Geoff Summerhayes, and ASIC commissioner John Price. Representatives from big business, including ANZ, Macquarie, QBE, AustralianSuper, Coles and UBS, were also present. Government representatives who attended were from the Department of Environment and Energy, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, and Treasury. Greg Combet, the Labor environment minister who oversaw the Gillard government's short-lived carbon tax, was also present in his capacity as chairman of industry super-owned fund management colossus IFM Investors. The roundtable concluded: ""First, the climate crisis is upon us, and decision-makers across the Australian economy have a clear and increasing obligation to address the risks and opportunities it presents. It is clear climate change is a ratcheting risk, a trend change that is highly interactive, systemic and irreversible, and one which will impact every aspect of Australian society. ""History is no guide to its future impacts, meaning that forward-looking scenario analysis is needed to manage the physical and transition risks it will generate. Australia's economy and financial system is particularly exposed given the significant physical risks the country faces and its profile as a commodity exporter. Australian business is at increasing risk of retaliatory action from other countries because of a perceived view that Australia is not pulling its weight when it comes to reducing emissions."" The conclusions from the roundtable were prepared by the CPD and are not meant to represent individual policy positions of the participants. Madrid meeting The release of Mr Hayne's remarks coincide with the second week of the United Nations COP25 meeting in Madrid, at which government ministers from around the world, including Energy Minister Angus Taylor, will discuss details of the Paris climate agreement HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/policy/energy-and-climate/businesses-call-for-global-carbon-trading-rules-20191201-p53frz including potential carbon trading rules , and \~ HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/policy/energy-and-climate/bhp-backs-government-on-kyoto-carryover-loophole-20190923-p52u1u the use of Kyoto carryover credits The government confirmed on the weekend that it intends to use Kyoto carryover credits - that is, credits from its over-achievement of emissions goals under the Kyoto protocol - to meet its Paris goals. In real terms, that means Australia's emissions by 2030 will be 16 per cent below 2005 levels, not the 26 to 28 per cent below set out in the Paris agreement. The Paris agreement does not mention the use of Kyoto carryover credits, and many nations are pushing for the practice to be formally banned. \"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia103","Double counting of emissions cuts may undermine Paris climate deal","October 15, 2019 Tuesday 1:21 AM EST","The Conversation - Australia","In the four years since the Paris climate agreement was adopted, countries have debated the fine print of how emissions reduction should be tracked and reported. One critical detail is proving particularly hard to work out - and a weak result would threaten the environmental integrity of the entire deal. The sticking point is rules for carbon markets: specifically, how to prevent double counting of emissions reductions by both the country selling and buying carbon credits. These rules are proving a major barrier to reaching consensus. In December, the negotiations move to Chile for this year's major climate talks, HYPERLINK https://www.cop25.cl/en/ known as . The double counting issue needs to be resolved. It will not be an easy job, and the outcome matters to many countries, including Australia. Read more: The good, the bad and the ugly: the nations leading and failing on climate action The Morrison government says HYPERLINK Australia will meet the Paris emissions targets by 2030 without international trading - partly by counting old carbon credits towards its Paris efforts. But in future Australia may adopt a stronger target in line with global climate goals. This may entail government and businesses buying carbon credits from overseas. In an article just published in the journal HYPERLINK https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6462/180 Science , we and our co-authors explain why double counting could undermine the Paris goals, and how a robust outcome could be achieved. What's the problem here? International carbon trading allows two or more countries to achieve their emissions targets more cheaply than if going it alone. Countries where cutting emissions is relatively cheap do more than is required by their targets. They then sell the additional emissions reductions, in the form of credits, to countries that find it harder to achieve their targets. Carbon credits could be produced through activity such as replacing fossil fuels with zero-emissions energy, greater energy efficiency and electrification in transport and buildings, new technologies in industry and better practices in agriculture and forestry. Rules for carbon trading are defined under HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/files/meetings/paris_nov_2015/application/pdf/paris_agreement_english_.pdf Article 6 of the Paris agreement HYPERLINK offset increases in carbon emissions from international flights above 2020 levels. Read more: There are three types of climate change denier, and most of us are at least one But if trading rules are not watertight then the use of carbon markets could lead to greater emissions, undermining the agreement. One fundamental risk is double counting: a country selling a carbon credit might claim the underlying emissions reduction for itself, while at the same time the country buying the credit also claims the same emissions reduction. Obviously any international transfer of emission reductions should not lead to higher total emissions than if participating countries had met their targets individually. This could be ensured through a form of double-entry bookkeeping, wherein the country selling carbon credits adjusts its emissions upwards, and the country acquiring the carbon credits adjusts, by the same amount, downwards. But the devil lies in the detail - and in the self interest of the parties involved. The bones of contention Countries are wrangling over what double counting is, how it should be avoided and whether it should sometimes be allowed. Some countries hoping to sell emissions credits, notably Brazil, propose rules under which emissions reductions sold to another country could effectively also be claimed by the selling country. Such rules existed under the HYPERLINK Kyoto Protocol , which came before the Paris agreement. However under Kyoto developing countries did not have emission targets. All major countries have emissions targets under Paris, making the method unsuitable now. Read more: Feeling flight shame? Try quitting air travel and catch a sail boat Another potential pitfall lies in the potential purchase by international airlines of large amounts of credits to offset increases in their emissions. Aviation emissions are not counted in national emissions inventories. So it would be logical to adjust the selling country's inventory for any emissions reduction sold to airlines. But some countries, notably Saudi Arabia, argue that this should not be done because the airline industry is governed by a separate international treaty. This approach would allow emissions reductions to be included in both agreements and counted twice. In a separate point of debate some countries - including Australia, Canada, Japan, and the United States - oppose the idea of a single international body overseeing carbon trading under the Paris agreement, arguing for more national sovereignty and flexibility between nations buying and selling. Making things even more complex, the Paris agreement allows each country to determine how to frame their emissions target. Some countries frame them as absolute emissions, others as a reduction relative to business-as-usual, or as a ratio of emissions to gross domestic product. Some countries' targets are simply unclear. Letting each country determine its own ambitions and approach was key in making the Paris agreement a reality. But it makes accounting for carbon markets more complex. There are also questions over whether a portion of carbon trading revenue should be allocated to help pay for climate change resilience in developing countries, and whether old credits from a trading scheme under the Kyoto Protocol, the HYPERLINK https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/0809/KyotoProtocolCDM Clean Development Mechanism The way forward in Chile The solutions to all these issues will be nuanced, but will require that governments agree on some fundamentals. The first is that a single set of common international accounting rules should apply, irrespective of which carbon market mechanism is used by countries or groups of countries. The second is to ensure robust emissions accounting, regardless of how mitigation targets are expressed. The third is that over time, all countries should move toward economy-wide emissions targets, as the Paris Agreement foresees. The need to reach a political deal in Chile must not result in loopholes for international carbon markets. The rules must ensure environmental integrity and avoid double counting. If this is achieved, emissions reductions can be made more cheaply and global ambition can be more readily raised. If not, then the accord could be seriously undermined.

Riley Whitelum and Elayna Carausu have crossed many oceans since they began sailing the world in 2014, but never has the couple received a reception like the one that awaited them upon pulling into the port of Lisbon in Portugal on Tuesday morning (local time). ""When we arrived there was, I don't know, thousands of people waiting and then huge amounts of media,"" said Mr Whitelum, owner and skipper of 15-metre catamaran La Vagabonde. The couple themselves are no strangers to the spotlight - their YouTube account documenting their voyages has more than 1.2 million followers - but the crowd was there to see one person: Greta Thunberg. After three weeks at sea the teen climate activist had arrived in Europe for the international climate summit, which began on Monday in the Spanish capital of Madrid. The 16-year-old had travelled from her native Sweden to California by boat, train and electric car and was planning to continue on to the next round of climate negotiations, originally scheduled to be held in Chile's capital, Santiago. When the Santiago summit was cancelled due to political unrest, Ms Thunberg found herself on the wrong continent and in need of an environmentally-friendly way to cross the Atlantic. 'We had to say yes' HYPERLINK answer her call . ""It was one of those things that we couldn't say no to,"" Ms Carausu said. ""It was like the mission was put up to us and ... we had to say yes even though it wasn't maybe the best time of the year to be doing the crossing and there was a little bit more risk than usual. ""But we had a really good boat, really good crew, so we thought well, if anyone's fit and up for the task there's no better people than us right now, so let's just give it a go."" Three Australians, two Swedes and a Brit After a week of preparation, which saw British professional yachtswoman Nikki Henderson fly in to assist the journey, La Vagabonde set sail from Virginia early on November 14. Joining Ms Thunberg was her father, Svante, taking the total number on board to six. The three Australians, the Brit and the two Swedes may have been strangers when they left, but after three weeks at sea the group forged a strong bond. ""Honestly it could not have been better,"" Ms Carausu said. ""Riley and Nikki took turns with shift work during the night [working in two-hour shifts] and during the day occasionally myself or Svante would keep watch so they could catch up on some sleep. ""Greta took care of Lenny, babysat, you know would feed him his breakfast if I asked her to. ""And Svante kept our spirits high, he's just really funny and he knew how to make us all laugh, which was great."" The teen activist with a 'microscopic' ego The Australians, who make a living out of filming their adventures and posting them to YouTube, said they looked forward to showing a different side to the teen. ""So one of the things that I really wanted to do on this trip was to film Greta with Lenny, film her stressed and worried and really show the human side of her,"" Mr Whitelum said. ""It is striking because when you lay eyes on this girl she's very petite. I mean when I'm looking around the boat for someone that I think might be able to help pull down a sail or something it's not going to be Greta. ""But if there's a discussion to be had on climate change or politics then she's the first person you'd turn to."" In little more than a year Ms Thunberg has become a household name, amassed millions of followers on social media and inspired a generation of climate activists. Yet the teen's explosion into the public domain has also seen her used as a verbal punching bag for those who disagree with her message or her methods - with prime ministers and presidents among her most outspoken critics. Ms Carausu said she had been surprised at how the teenager, whose ego she described as ""microscopic"", responded to all the attention. ""Greta being 16 you'd think that she would let those negative comments really get to her and anger her, but honestly it is the opposite,"" she said. ""I think it might be because she has Asperger's, which she also talked about, it's like it doesn't seem to really worry her. ""She really didn't want all of this attention ... she's not in it for herself, she's in it for the cause and she wants people to use their voices - that was the main thing she spoke about."" Much more than an £ngry kid' In a brief media conference upon her arrival in Lisbon, Ms Thunberg was asked how she felt about politicians HYPERLINK blaming climate activists for current environmental problems. ""I mean when people in power are criticising you like that, that is only proof that you are having an impact,"" she told the crowd to loud applause. ""That you among others are bringing change or trying to bring change and many people don't want that, and of course they will do everything they can to try to prevent change from happening."" And when asked about being an ""angry kid"" the teen took her time to formulate her response but did not shy away. ""I think people are underestimating the force of angry kids,"" she said. ""I mean we are angry, we are frustrated and that is because of a good reason. But for those among the five who sailed alongside Ms Thunberg she was much, much more than angry. ""I think they [people] will be shocked at how human and vulnerable she is,"" Mr Whitelum said. ""If they see her the way that I do now, as a very nice, quiet, respectful, brave young lady, I think that it will change a lot of minds."" Strong bonds form in difficult crossing Mr Whitelum, who spoke to the ABC after having slept for 12 hours straight, said while the crossing had not been without its challenges it had been more than worth it. ""So a crossing in November in the north Atlantic is going to always be very difficult,"" he said. ""There's going to be a huge amount of challenges and that's because of the weather systems that are just constantly going through, and they're going through faster than your boat. ""You need to position yourself and be looking at the weather forecast constantly and making the best guess as to the safest place to put your boat. Both Mr Whitelum and Ms Carausu said they could not believe how well Ms Thunberg and her father had managed the trip. ""And she was really relaxed on that trip, you could tell the difference,"" Ms Carausu said. ""Before we left with all the media she was like in her own little world and then as soon as we got on the boat and left she was overwhelmed with what had just happened. ""But within a few days she was at ease and doing her exercises, listening to her audio book, helping me with the cooking and she just seemed really relaxed, you could tell."" 'We went through something huge together' Both said they would miss Ms Thunberg, her father and their many games of competitive Yahtzee, but had hopes they, along with Ms Henderson, would all stay in touch. ""We just went through something huge together ... it's a bit weird to never talk again after what we just experienced,"" Ms Carausu said. ""We'll be talking about this for the rest of their lives I'm sure - it's a story for your grandchildren."" Mr Whitelum said the trip added a new sense of meaning to their voyage. ""Elayna and I have crossed oceans before ... but this particular trip injected a sense of adventure and purpose into our journey that we hadn't really had before,"" he said. Ms Thunberg told the crowd on Tuesday she planned to spend a few days in Lisbon getting used to being on land again before heading to join the climate summit. And when asked what she would be doing after that, the teenager - who plans to go back to school next year after taking a year off - simply said, ""home"". \"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia106","The world is watching us burn; THE NATION","January 4, 2020 Saturday","The Age (Melbourne, Australia)","With our south-east coast aflame, our dead uncounted, our holiday beaches rendered into evacuation zones; with our queues for water, fuel, food and for simple escape, Australia now has the world's attention. In international eyes our leaders have been found wanting not only in planning for such a catastrophe, and not just for the failure of some to match the tenacious heroism of our volunteers, but for their refusal to accept the catastrophic reality of climate change and its link with the burning of coal. A headline in The Washington Post on Friday morning Australian time bluntly captured Morrison's humiliation upon visiting Cobargo hours earlier: ""Australia's Prime Minister visited families devastated by the wildfires. It did not go well."" At the very same time The New York Times was reporting that, ""The fires have fuelled anger at Australia's Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, who has downplayed the role of global warming, opposed measures to combat climate change and rejected additional funding for firefighters. After widespread ridicule, last month he cut short a vacation during the crisis, a trip that critics said showed he did not take the disaster seriously enough."" It quoted the angry Cobargo resident who told him in front of TV cameras on Thursday - in what will surely be some of the best remembered footage of Morrison's prime ministership - ""You won't be getting any votes down here buddy. You're out son."" The German broadcaster DW noted that locals had called Morrison an ""idiot"" and described the criticism he had received for his Christmas holiday to Hawaii. In America CNN carried a report that said, ""Experts say climate change has worsened the scale and impact of the fires, and many have accused the Morrison administration of doing little to address the climate crisis. In December, a woman dumped the remnants of her fire-ravaged home in front of the Australian Parliament, accusing Morrison and lawmakers of failing to act."" When he saw the footage of Morrison's reception in Cobargo the English broadcaster Piers Morgan, normally a reliable friend to populist conservatives, tweeted ""he got what he deserved . . . absolutely unconscionable for a Prime Minister to holiday in Hawaii as his nation burns."" By now the NSW emergency services minister, David Elliott, at the time of writing still declining to take calls as he returns from a European jaunt that began after the deaths of NSW volunteer firefighters, must feel some relief that he has no international profile. In truth, though, the world began to pay attention to the Australian conflagrations and its climate change recalcitrance even before the excruciating footage of Morrison's visits to firegrounds leaked over the wires. On New Year's Eve New York Magazine published a piece about lamenting the global response to the fires that likened Morrison to Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro in embodying climate change denial. Two days later The Economist noted Morrison's ""lethargic approach to climate change"". On December 23 Al Jazeera reported, ""Australia's government is resisting growing calls for a more ambitious response to climate change, even as the country battles devastating bushfires triggered by record temperatures that have sent air pollution to critical levels."" It noted that Australia ""releases 1.3 per cent of the world's greenhouse gases . . . Its population accounts for 0.3 per cent of the world's inhabitants."" In a feature published just after Christmas The Washington Post charted the terrible damage already wrought upon Australia's environment by climate change. ""On land, Australia's rising heat is £pocalyptic'. In the ocean it's worse,"" read the headline. It recounted how flying foxes and possums were falling dead out of trees in heatwaves, how the giant kelp forests of Tasmania had already been obliterated. ""This is happening even though average atmospheric temperatures in Australia have yet to increase by 2 degrees Celsius,"" it reported. Australia also captured global attention during the most recent United Nations climate change talks in Madrid in early December, known as COP25 , which were widely seen as a dismal failure in the face of existential global threat. ""Countries such as Australia, Brazil and the USA have blocked and delayed the UN climate protection process in Madrid. The growing will in many countries to stop global warming with decisive action could not prevail here because of the unanimity principle,"" Michael Schafer, head of Climate and Energy at the environmental organisation WWF Germany, told German broadcaster Welt. Reimund Schwarze, environmental economist at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research, spoke of the talks as a ""long tragedy"". ""Australia played its part in this failure with proposals that would have rendered any agreement practically useless,"" wrote James Dyke of the University of Exeter in The Independent newspaper. ""But its continual production of coal is more destabilising. It's no surprise that coal mining corporations want to continue coal mining. But the fact that certain Australian political parties and sections of the media strongly promote coal should be a source of immense shame. The greatest gift they could give to Australians and the rest of the world would be to radically rethink their ideological attachment to this fossil fuel."" The diplomatic cost of Australia's determination to defend its coal industry in the face of global efforts to cut greenhouse emissions is significant, broad and so far incalculable, says Herve Lemahieu, the director of the Lowy Institute's Asian Power and Diplomacy Program, an ongoing project that measures shifting national power dynamics across our region. Speaking from London he said that as a result of coverage of Australia's performance in Madrid and of the bushfires Australia was now seen in a different, darker light across Europe. Where once it existed in the popular imagination as a place of almost pristine natural beauty it was now viewed as the Western nation most ravaged by climate change. Our reputation as a global citizen had been irrevocably tarnished. ""The global media has made a link between Australia's protection of its coal industry and its climate policy. The cat is out of the bag,"" says Lemahieu. Tim Buckley, the director of Energy Finance Studies at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, says his frustration at the government's intransigent defence of increasingly technologically obsolete thermal coal (coal burnt for energy rather than steel manufacturing) at the cost of effective climate change policy and international reputation is compounded by his view that the industry has started its drawn-out death throes, sustained by political muscle rather than economic reality. Buckley argues that the thermal coal industry's tipping point has already passed, missed by its champions in Morrison's government but already factored in by global money markets. Divestment from fossil fuels is being turbo-charged by the rise of institutional shareholder activism. The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change now has a combined $24 trillion in assets under management, and is developing ""a practical and useable framework for investors to be able to understand what it would mean for a pension fund to align with the goals of the Paris Agreement"". In other words, it is developing a practical guide for its members to use in dumping coal. Later this month Morrison had planned to visit India in order to help sell more coal. That trip might now not go ahead. Buckley reckons he would have received a polite welcome, not least because India is keen on Australian LNG. But it would be delusional, says Buckley, to believe that Australia will get to choose how and when it transitions from coal. The rest of the world will make that decision for us, and it could do so suddenly. Tipping points can be easy to miss in financial markets, says Buckley. In part this is because they are by nature sudden and dramatic. In part it is because it is so tempting to keep basing forecasts on historical trends. ""You can get away with that for years,"" he says, ""until it makes you look like a fool."" This summer Australia has been clobbered by the immediate practical reality of climate change. A similarly violent collision with economic and political realities now faces leaders of both parties and their friends in the coal industry. Peter Hartcher is on leave. \"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia107","LETTERS","January 6, 2020 Monday","The Age (Melbourne, Australia)","Our collective narcissism And Nicole Hemmer wrote that, ""we worried Facebook might make people narcissists. Now it might make them fascists."" (""Democracy under threat,"" Comment, 31/12). We live in a world where prime-time television is dominated by a ""reality"" as false as the Kardashians' lashes and people sit across dinner tables checking Facebook rather than having face-to-face conversations. Socrates wrote ""to do is to be"" and now it seems ""to tweet is to be"". Note Donald Trump. The new narcissists feed a new wave of populist nationalists - witness Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin - and regimented societies such as the one being built by Xi Jinping. Jeffrey Kelson, Prahran Hope for the future Waleed Aly is too despairing in his vision of the 2020s as ushering in ""an egotist's paradise and a public hell"". An international public domain inhabited increasingly by youthful climate change activists is surely a more compelling harbinger of the 2020s than, as Aly envisages, a continuation of the moronic self-focused obsessions characteristic of the past decade. A resurgent collectivism in private and political lives should not be underestimated. Jon McMillan, Mount Eliza The path to prevention Fire prevention clearly is a major issue right across Australia as we go into the future. This needs to be the goal of all state governments and the federal government as well. These governments in cooperation with each other should appoint an independent authority that has responsibility for implementing strategies that are needed. Clearly, appropriate people with expertise need to be chosen, and it can be done in a bipartisan way. Once chosen this group's recommendations, free of political interference need to be accepted and acted on. Governments need to budget properly for this. In this regard special interest groups concerns must not dominate what can and cannot be done. While we must congratulate what the firefighters have done this year, emphasis needs to be put on fire prevention as the first priority followed by fighting fires as they occur. Denis Ryan, Belmont How far we have fallen Nick O'Malley's observations about how the world now regards Australia in relation to climate change is an accurate assessment and demonstrates quite starkly how far this country has fallen on this critical issue (""The world is watching us burn,"" Comment, 4/1). We are not a leader - as we should and could be - in moving away from fossil fuels and towards renewables. Our lack of any energy policy and our performance at COP25 in Madrid shows very clearly we have become a laggard. Our attempts to use a wonky accounting trick to carry forward Kyoto credits in order to meet our very modest Paris targets is shameful. Rowan Russell, Kirribilli, NSW Our exceptional ABC Living in a highly fire-prone area of Victoria, we rely each summer on our local ABC for current fire warnings, information and updates. This year the coverage has been exceptional and has possibly even saved lives. Staff whose throats are affected by the thick smoke have read updates over many hours to keep us informed and safe. It would be wonderful to see the efforts of the ABC acknowledged by the federal government restoring or increasing their funding but sadly, the heartfelt thanks from their listening communities may be the best they can expect. Marg Sneddon, Wangaratta South Distasteful chicanery Right now, when incredibly brave and dedicated volunteer firefighters and thousands of fire victims need huge financial support, Scott Morrison aims to divert some of that support to his political party. Relief that he was finally flat out being ""proactive"", quickly turned to disappointment on finding he has both the inclination and time for this very distasteful chicanery. Marianne Dalton, Balnarring I was just visited by a pleasant young man seeking donations on behalf of the United Nations refugee agency. I was happy to make a donation of up to $200, but only one-off donations of $360 were acceptable. The alternative was to contribute a sum monthly, of at least $40, by direct debit or BSB. None of these options appealed to me. This isn't the first time I have been given similar alternatives to donate money to agencies, most of whom do a good job. I think organisations need to re-think their policy about securing donations as I am sure they are missing out on a lot of one-off donations of various amounts. Claire Hogan, Northcote Start planning now Scott Morrison seems unsure how to go about exercising leadership in the current bushfire catastrophe. Here are some suggestions. Start planning. Planning to rebuild communities - if they can be rebuilt. Planning to restore or replace the businesses and livelihoods of those who have lost everything but their lives. Plan to restore confidence in the domestic and international tourist industries - who will be making bookings for next summer now? Without detracting from focus on the present, start planning for next year - there is no reason to believe it will be any better, but hopefully Australia can be better prepared to supply the needed resources. Helmut Simon, Oak Park Our Prime Minister has come under criticism for his slow response to bushfires and the lack of a coordinated national response. How galling that only hours after making the announcement about additional support that people have been calling for, the Liberal Party posts an ad on Twitter and a video detailing the announcements, authorised by Scott Morrison himself. I cannot recall any other time when a political leader has used a national catastrophe to make political mileage. Marg D'Arcy, Rye Once a showman ... Following his humiliation, locally and globally, at the fire ravaged town of Cobargo last week, our Prime Minister has tweeted a 50-second self-promotional video acclaiming what he is now doing to combat the bushfire crisis. ""Shameless and shameful"", tweeted the UK's Piers Morgan, normally a friend to populist conservatives. I would add, ""hugely embarrassing"". Wasn't it P.T. Barnum who said ""I am a showman by profession ... and all the gilding shall make nothing else of me""? Neil Hudson, East Melbourne A supreme irony It is a supreme irony that the effect of climate change is often visually represented by hungry livestock in dry paddocks, when livestock farming is one of the major drivers of environmental degradation and climate change. Mechanisms for this include the clearing of native vegetation for pasture, cattle water consumption (50,000 to 100,000 litres to produce 1 kilogram of beef), emissions from belching and fecal matter (leading to pollution of water tables and rivers and ocean runoffs), soil degradation (compaction and acidification, spreading of weeds), etc. All this without even going into the negative health effects and ethical concerns. David Gillespie, Warragul Horne's words ring true ""Australia is a lucky country run mainly by second rate people who share its luck."" Isn't it about time for us to accept the bitter ironies in both parts of Donald Horne's observation in 1964? Nick Jans, Marysville In hindsight, a very bad joke What he needs to bring into Parliament now (and he will need to be very brave), is a carbon price policy. How good would that be. Jon Smith, Leongatha Stick to the program Of course the Prime Minister should keep his trip to India and Japan. There are plenty of politicians here who can keep up the support for the emergency measures. We could even see the Governor-General take a higher profile. The long-term relationships in our region are vital to our long term good; we cannot afford to delay these meetings, we all need a bigger vision of what is important and what is hype.

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia108","Green finance needed to tackle climate change","January 16, 2020 Thursday","The Australian","A new year and a new decade should be a time for optimism, but it's hard to shake the sense of frustration around action on climate change. Last month's 25th Conference of Parties ( COP 25 ), the United Nations' annual climate change conference, reaffirmed the importance of reducing global carbon emissions but failed to set out an ambitious new agenda for doing so. In 2015, COP 21 produced the Paris Agreement, which recognised the urgent need to drastically cut emissions by 2030 to keep the global temperature rise below 1.5 degrees. Each COP since then has renewed the commitment to that goal. But so far, we're failing to achieve it, and failing badly. A recent UN report revealed the still-growing gap between carbon reduction targets and actual carbon emissions. Each year that emissions continue to rise makes it harder to meet our 2030 targets. Harder to protect our natural environment. Harder to ease the economic pain of climate change. Injecting new urgency into the actions of governments and businesses should be the priority. In many countries, decisions are being made now that will shape entire economic structures for decades to come. If those decisions are not made on a sustainable, low-carbon basis, we'll be locking in high emissions for the foreseeable future. Sometimes, climate change can feel like an impossibly huge problem to tackle. But the solution can perhaps be summed up in one word - investment. National governments and other state entities have their part to play, but only the private sector can marshal the sum of money required. That means boosting the green finance market. Investor appetite for green products is growing - in an HSBC survey conducted earlier this year, 63 per cent of our investor clients said they would enter or expand their presence in green finance over the next two years. However, the market is still sub-scale, held back by a lack of investible projects. Looking at green bonds alone, issuance in the first three quarters of 2019 was almost $US190bn, a big leap from the roughly $US115bn in the same period last year. But this is only a small dent in the trillions of dollars of green investment required by 2030. Worse still, only 26 per cent of issuance in 2019 was attached to emerging market projects, far below what is required to guarantee long-term sustainable economic growth in those countries. Targeted changes can make a difference, though. The first is encouraging better disclosure of climate risks. When investors have a clear idea of which businesses and sectors are most exposed to the impact of rising temperatures, they can make better decisions with their money. Wide adoption of standardised disclosure principles, such as those published by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, will increase the number of viable projects for investors, and help with the second change - driving more green finance activity in the real economy. So far, green finance issuance has been dominated by national governments and financial entities. That can't continue. Green finance participation is particularly important in high-carbon sectors, such as energy generation and heavy manufacturing. Here, transitioning to lower emissions is fraught with risk, but will provide huge opportunities for those firms that are successful. The right kind of financing at the right time will be crucial. There are some signs that these sectors are starting to get to grips with the transition - recently we've seen the formation of industry organisations, such as Responsible Steel, that push for lower emissions in specific sectors of the economy. The longer businesses take to adjust to a low-carbon mindset, the more likely they are to suffer blowback from climate-aware consumers and investors. The third change is making sustainable infrastructure an asset class in its own right. A number of studies show that there is currently a global infrastructure investment deficit of between $US40 trillion and $US70 trillion. We simply don't spend enough money on big ticket items like roads, railways and power generation. Bridging this gap sustainably is vital. A separate asset class would allow products to become more standardised, more transparent and properly impact-linked. The need for infrastructure and other green investment in cities is particularly acute. Cities generate over 70 per cent of global carbon emissions, but most cities do not have direct capital market access and cannot easily invest money to reduce this figure. That's why the fourth change on the wish list is greater product innovation. This will provide more investment avenues to help turn promising, small-scale climate policies or products into mass-effect solutions. Many cities, for example, have pioneered projects that reduce the carbon emissions of waste disposal, or increase funding for greener buildings. Also encouraging is the developing ""blue bonds"" market, where investor returns are linked to the preservation of specific ecosystems. This is a pivotal year for climate change. COP 26, held in Glasgow next November, will be crucial for the immediate and long-term future of our planet. We hope that it can point to more concrete achievements than those of the last few years.Daniel Klier is HSBC's group head of sustainable finance \"

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia110","The world is paralysed by a fear of going it alone","January 4, 2020 Saturday","Canberra Times (Australia)","Over the last few days senior members of the Australian government have talked about fires, global emissions and what Australia can do and should do. The Prime Minister was categorical that the emissions reductions policies of the government would protect the Australian environment. That is, the policies in place would have a tangible and positive impact on ecological systems that are stressed and shocked to breaking point. Meanwhile, the Minister for Energy, Angus Taylor, recently wrote that because Australia is responsible for only 1.3 per cent of global emissions, ""we can't single-handedly have a meaningful impact without the co-operation of the largest emitters such as China and the US"". Now, both statements cannot simultaneously be true. Either the policies of the government are having a meaningful and positive impact. Or they are not. As it turns out, Mr Taylor was right and the Prime Minister was careless. The scrupulous, verified work of professionals and experts demonstrate that humanity cannot go on this way. We cannot expect a different outcome if policy continues exactly as before. Certainly Australia's emissions are relatively small compared to, say, the United States or India. In 2017, the United States emitted 4800 MtCO2; China, 9300 MtCO2; India, 2200 MtCO2. Australia's emissions totalled 385 MtCO2. In 1977, the United States emitted 4800 MtCO2; China, 1200 MtCO2; India, 237 MtCO2. Australia's emissions were 196 MtCO2. The Coalition government makes the point that we should not sacrifice our economy by cutting emissions unilaterally and in a way that results in no overall reduction in emissions. It's an argument based on the economic problem of the free rider -an individual who consumes resources, public goods or services, but does not pay. A lighthouse, for example, benefits all who sail under its beam, but without an explicit scheme to ensure payment, no sailor pays for its operation and maintenance. In this instance, the sailor is a rider for free on long-suffering taxpayers. And so it follows that Australia should do no more, because to do more would damage our economy and make no difference to the environment. Time, our Energy Minister says, for the free-riders, India and China, to do their bit - or do a lot. Not surprisingly, these two countries take a different view. The life of a Chinese or Indian citizen is on average much tougher than that of an Australian. According to the World Bank, in 2018, the average Australian earned approximately $US57,000. In China, GDP per capita was $US7755; in India, $US2100. Before the Prime Minister was mugged by the reality of fire at home, he was, very properly, about to embark on an official visit to India. And he would have been briefed on the words of the Prime Minister of India, Mr Narendra Modi at the Paris Climate Summit in 2015. For Mr Modi, developed nations brought global warming down on the head of the planet and must now take responsibility. His view perhaps is coloured by the reality that the income of the average Australian is 27 times more than that of the average Indian. We hope advanced nations will assume ambitious targets and pursue them sincerely. It is not just a question of historical responsibility. They also have the most room to make the cuts, and make the strongest impact. And climate justice demands that, with the little carbon space we still have, developing countries should have enough room to grow. From Australia, even in the middle of a firestorm, the scale and intensity of the challenges that Mr Modi has to address are hard to understand. According to the National Institution for Transforming India, about 820 million people face the real problem of water scarcity; 163 million live without ready access to clean water. The Indo-Gangetic Plain of northern India is one the largest catchments in the world. Water flows and availability are largely dependent on seasonal monsoon rains. In the north and west the Indus Basin is fed by the glaciers of the Tibetan plateau. Global warming will change the intensity, duration and timing of monsoon rains and diminish the amount of water stored and released as glacial melt. Global warming will compromise supply at the very same time as the demand for water - for agriculture, for industry, for homes, for the environment - is increasing. READ MORE: Jack Waterford: Morrison is burning up his electoral credit Opinion: The way forward on bushfires isn't through the federal government Opinion: Australia is copping it at COP 25 - and rightly so To manage water better is the test that a developing India faces. But to do so requires resources and economic growth and investment. In the short term, the solution to the problem, if nothing else were to change, is the toxic cause of the problem itself. For Australia, slight or inadequate inaction by India - or China or the United States for that matter - dooms our hopes for change that is immediate, tangible and meaningful. The difficulty in implementing tangible and effective measures as a global community arises because we confuse the nature of the problem, which is static, with the nature of the solution, which is dynamic. The problem is static in that everybody perceives themselves at a moment in time to be worse off by acting unilaterally. If Australia cuts emissions then we are disadvantaged. India thinks it unconscionable that it should forgo the benefits of growth to address a problem not wholly of their making. In a static moment in time, both positions are absolutely right. But meaningful action requires joint action through time. And in this dynamic sense, it requires a focus on outcomes - the goal of limiting warming to 2 degrees - and what must be done to realise this. Justice, of course, requires a sharing of the burden, because only a sharing of the burden will prompt and sustain action. If Australia believes we have done enough then we reduce the chance that others will act. The worm will have fully turned because others, whose agreement is essential, can take as an excuse that Australia is nothing more than a free-rider, motivated by bad faith. And come that moment, the possibility of action is lost. Chas Savage is the chief executive officer of Ethos CRS. \"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia111","Territory government is author of its hospital misfortunes","December 26, 2019 Thursday","Canberra Times (Australia)","In seeking to explain the increasingly bleak performance of the ACT's public hospitals, Minister for Health Rachel Stephen-Smith has overlooked the most obvious issue. That is, without doubt, the decision taken in the 2012-13 ACT budget, and repeated in every budget since, to reduce funding for health care by approximately 1 per cent in real terms. Over the period since 2012-13, the ACT government has not made allowance in the health budget for population growth, the ageing of the community, changes in technology or for increases in wages or the price of medicine. While a cut of 1 per cent in real terms may seem insignificant, in the context of the ACT health budget it equates to at least $100 million, on average, per annum. As a consequence of the cuts the ACT government, in 2013-14 changed the target for bed occupancy in its public hospitals, from 85 per cent, which is the target generally applied across Australia, to 90 per cent. It followed up over the two years from 2015-16 to 2017-18, years of solid population growth in the ACT, by reducing the number of beds in Canberra and Calvary public hospitals by 2.5 per cent or 28 beds in total. The increasing inability of our public hospitals to meet the needs of the Canberra community is due, in the main, to cuts to their funding. Jon Stanhope, Bruce The Prince of Peace Just over a century ago, in the midst of warfare at the Western Front, combative soldiers held a spontaneous and unofficial truce. The metallic chatter of gunfire gave way to the singing of Silent Night, as men emerged from the trenches in order to shake hands, exchange food, express Christmas greetings and compare family photographs. How was this possible? Through the mediation of the Prince of Peace himself. Many of us would no doubt still be feeling emotionally bruised, regarding the abject suffering and sorrow we have witnessed this year both overseas and within our own nation. In particular, the ruthlessness of summer bushfires leave an indelible stain of sorrow on affected communities. Thankfully, the endearing and enduring humble nativity story, I believe, still speaks afresh to the questioning human heart. Quite simply, the incarnation reminds us each year that, far from God remaining distant and mysterious, we who are grieving have not been left stranded. In the words of the great English hymn writer Charles Wesley: ""Peace on earth and mercy mild; God and sinners, reconciled."" And so, may we all not indeed forget to remember the true reason for the season, and embrace that hope, which surpasses the tremulous trials of a world so desperately in need of rejuvenation. Peter Waterhouse, Craigieburn Not anxious, just mad The word anxiety implies psychological distress. Scott Morrison keeps claiming his absence is causing anxiety. I disagree. Disgust, anger, fury and contempt at his absenteeism is closer to the mark. If he wants to take his children on holiday because he promised them a holiday and because he wants a normal life, then he can't be PM and should resign immediately. Being PM comes with great privilege but also great responsibility. Morrison has shown he wants one but not the other. E R Moffat, Weston \'e2\€  Apology hollow Morrison's subtly qualified apology for leaving the country he is supposed to be leading for a family holiday in Hawaii rings hollow when he announces upon his return that there will be no change to his government's climate change policy. Australia's climate change policy settings were heavily criticised at the UN's COP25 climate summit in Madrid. Australia was slated for lagging on emissions reduction, and, despite claims to the contrary by Mr Morrison, is not on track to meet its very modest Paris Agreement commitment without the dubious use of carry-over carbon credits from the Kyoto Protocol. This tactic has been cited as setting a very poor example for developing nations with high per capita emissions. Australia is a ""leaner"", not a ""lifter"" on emissions and climate change action. Douglas Mackenzie, Deakin Time to be free As Australia prepares to enter another year constitutionally tethered to Great Britain, the irony of Brexit is as unmistakable as Boris Johnson's luxurious mop of hair. In the space of less than four years, Britain will almost certainly have extricated itself from the EU because a majority of British people decided that membership of the EU compromised British independence. Meanwhile, Australia clings to the Motherland like an adult in their 30s who desperately wants to remain living at home, even though the parents have cleared out their bedroom years ago. How long will Australia keep haunting the spare room before we decide to get our own place? Mark Slater, Melba Outrage justified It is not just the residents of Coombs and Wright who are feeling outraged and betrayed by the apparent lack of planning process in the ACT (Letters, December 22). What is the point of an expensive Territory Plan administered by expensive public servants if at the first whisper of a developer the response from ACTPLA is ""Yes master"". There must be a critical flaw in the Planning and Development Act 2007. The public has a right to know and have it rectified immediately. The driver here seems to be the Lease Variation Charge. The concept of the LVC is that the profit gained from lease variation is shared between the lease holder and the ACT government. This is clearly inappropriate when the lease is brand new. Worse than that, the government codified LVCs in 2017 into a table of suburbs and localities within those suburbs. Coombs and other recently developed suburbs are not listed, seemingly LVC exempt. Parts of others are not covered by the localities map, including in suburbs developed decades ago. Developments varied to exactly 101 dwellings, and residential leases in commercial localities also seem LVC exempt. No wonder developers are seeking lease variations. It's pure profit. Peter Bradbury, Holt Wrong Scomo, wrong The Prime Minister returned on Sunday night and at his first TV conference he spoke of the anxiety he may have caused by being away while Australia burned. Let's make it clear to the Prime Minister, people were experiencing anger at his decision to take a holiday as this extreme fire event engulfs much of our country. The anxiety was caused by the fires and the unknown capacity of destruction these fires raging across the country will cause. Twice in the past week the highest temperatures recorded in our history have been broken; fact not fiction. Regional towns are close to running out of water. Some regional towns have water tankers transporting drinking water to their communities. And yet, you are still stubborn enough to believe your government is acting and serving the Australian people in their best interest. How sad. Penny Costello, Giralang We all make sacrifices When members of the Australian Defence Force make promises to their children about holidays they do so knowing that service to our country takes precedence over that promise. So, when our government tells them that their duty to their country requires them to serve their country and abandon their promises to their family they do. Members of the ADF, as directed by our government, are currently supporting the firefighting effort around Australia. And yet the leader of that government has just explained that his promises to his children take precedence over his duty as the Prime Minister. Either he thinks his role as Prime Minister is purely symbolic and our country doesn't require his presence or he's a hypocrite. Maybe he should act symbolically and resign since he doesn't seem to believe he has anything to do. Dave McLachlan, Kambah It's a mystery I cannot understand the howls of rage against our PM for daring to arrange a family holiday well before the magnitude of the current bushfires was known. He immediately cut short his break after learning the extent of the tragedy, but had to wait a day to get the last available seat on a flight back to Australia. He was then castigated for not returning earlier. Tired and stressed prime ministers do not make good leaders, but it seems ScoMo is between a rock and a hard place. He's damned if he does and damned if he doesn't. Roslyn Philips, Tea Tree Gully, SA TO THE POINT A BIG CALL NICHOLAS Re: ""Post holiday blues could haunt the Prime Minister"" (December 24, p16). Mr Stuart asserts: ""It's obvious he (ScoMo) won't be able to win the next election"".

With our nation's leader detained in the northern hemisphere by powers beyond his control, we have been in the safe hands of acting Prime Minister Michael McCormack.

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia112","Firefighters are more inspirational than our politicians","December 16, 2019 Monday","Canberra Times (Australia)","The heart warming story about Milton Rural Fire Service volunteer Stacey Wilson (""Captured in the heat of the moment"", December 13, p4) illustrates the commitment of our RFS volunteers and the satisfaction, sense of purpose and camaraderie it can bring. RFS volunteers come from all walks of life. Some, I understand, are in receipt of Newstart. For some inexplicable reason this vital volunteering, so valued by the community particularly at this crucial time, does not count towards the ""mutual obligations"" Newstart recipients must undertake so as to continue being paid this admittedly paltry sum. Perhaps the federal minister who administers this scheme, Stuart Robert, might be able to throw some light on this, given his own ability to be granted paid leave from Parliament to take a self funded family trip to Israel during the 2019 Parliamentary annual sitting timetable; an exhausting total of 35 sitting days. The UK Parliament, by contrast, sits about 150 days per annum. Definitely smacks of ""Do what I say"" not ""Do what I do"". Ann Darbyshire, Hughes McClellan corrected Justice Peter McClellan says the royal commission was told by ""more than one leader"" in the Catholic Church that child sexual abuse was seen as a (mere) moral failure and not a crime (""Commissioner condemns Catholic leaders"", canberratimes.com.au, December 10). His speech gave the impression that this was still the common view amongst Catholic leaders. It is not. Whatever may have been the case for some church leaders in the past, the commission heard from many current Catholic bishops, myself included, that we have always regarded child sexual assault as a crime as well as a grave sin, and treated it as both. I am appalled by the criminal acts of some clergy, religious and lay church workers in the past, ashamed of the failure of some church leaders to respond appropriately, and committed to doing all we can to ensure these terrible crimes are never repeated. Tarring all past, present and emerging church leaders with the same brush in this matter, or implying that nothing has changed in the church since these matters came to light, is plain wrong. It also fails to acknowledge the efforts of many good people who have contributed to this change and continue to do so. Most Rev Anthony Fisher OP, Archbishop of Sydney Off peak power A major limitation of coal power in the energy industry was the lack of flexibility to respond to demand. This resulted in an excess of power at night with the market creating ""off peak"" rates as a response. With increasing energy industry reliance on sunlight, when will we see lower rates coinciding with peak demand during the day? Once upon a time, changes in government did not result in axing successful policies of the previous government. The ""carbon tax"" was a success, and the ""NEG policy"" was an additional positive proposal to address the industry capacity to respond to demand. The energy industry recognises that the future is coming ""ready or not"", but is paralysed by government proclamations from the pulpit . Australia could have been a leader instead of a pariah state at COP25 in Spain. In essence, it's an argument for separate rights based on the men's race. Such arguments have been used to support all manner of monstrous wrongs. The US used such an argument to support the institution of slavery before the civil war. Israel uses such an argument to justify the dispossession of the Palestinians. For that reason, such arguments should always be carefully examined and, in my opinion, should never be accepted. Whether or not the High Court allows the men to stay in Australia, I hope it reaches a decision without regard to their race. Greg Pinder, Charnwood Buy some jumbos International scientists say that dangerous fire conditions are likely to worsen overall if global warming isn't adequately addressed. With mega bush fires appearing early this fire season, Australia is in urgent need of large water bombing aircraft. Only around 500 of the 1500 jumbo jets built remain in service. Many of those taken out of service have been mothballed. Where would we find the money to buy some of these, fit them out as giant water bombers and set up water loading facilities along the coast? Easy. Do a Google search on the enormous amount of federal funding required to purchase our new fleet of submarines, their armaments and necessary infrastructure. Just a short delay in committing to this expenditure would free up tens, if not hundreds, of billions of dollars for other purposes. What could be more important than saving life, limb and property from ""mega"" bush fires? All that remains is to find the will. It apparently lives inside an echo chamber buried under the hill called Parliament. Dennis Nicholls, Curtin A quick response In my letter entitled ""The bushfire threat to Canberra is as real as it ever was"" (December 11) I referred to a potentially catastrophic bushfire hazard in Isaacs where a carpet of pine needles has been accumulating for about 30 years on a nature strip. After a few phone calls to relevant agencies, several Community Service members arrived on Tuesday (December 11) and begun clearing the tinder dry detritus. There are still heaps of pine needles to be removed but it's a start. No doubt Isaacs' residents, particularly those whose properties back onto that nature strip, would have welcomed this activity. With climate change linked to the unprecedented number of bushfires in many regions in Australia, we can no longer follow ""standard operational procedures"". R Baczynski, Isaacs ACT government fail I strongly agree with almost all of the December 19 editorial ""Prepare your bushfire action plan now"". I particularly agree with the statement ""bushfires are an inevitable fact of life in the ACT"", references to community vulnerability and the need to remove flammable materials. However I strongly disagree with the statement ""Canberra's frontline defence against bushfires is not the ACT government"". The greatest source of flammable materials is the forest of gum trees planted in western Canberra. Everything else pales into insignificance. Worse, thousands of those trees line the major roads so that fire will travel quickly. It almost seems as if the people responsible for planting those trees wanted to destroy Canberra. Worse, lining the major arterial roads seems designed to cut off all escape routes and thus kill thousands of Canberrans. I recommend that all gum trees within 50 metres of major roads in western Canberra be immediately removed. 2003 was a clear wake-up call. Not fixing the problem since then is a matter of criminal negligence. Some recent letters to the editor have likened the Commonwealth's lack of global warming awareness to Nero's inaction. That is wrong: I deplore the Commonwealth's failure to act on climate change, but its inaction has had a negligible effect on global climate change and on Canberra's vulnerability to fire. I recommend politics be put aside. These trees, the greatest danger to Canberra's safety, should be removed immediately. R Salmond, Melba Save the earth As a university student in 1970 I attended the first Earth Day, an international effort to raise awareness of the environmental issues facing our planet. Many well-informed, intelligent and hopeful speakers outlined practical ways that we could at least begin planning for ways to cope with an increasingly fragile world. Most suggestions were either ignored or derided as foolishly alarmist by politicians, industry and the mainstream media. Fifty years later, many of the fears of environmentalists have become our reality, but conservative voices continue to be wilfully blind and ignorant. If only we had listened then we might not be in such trouble now. Steve Ellis, Hackett A POOR WINNER I note R Silex's ""raspberry in the face"" letter (Letters, December 13). He complains of sore losers, but it's an education to see a sore winner. I suppose he would also like to tell our fire fighters climate change doesn't exist and we should just ""get used to"" more and worse bushfires? Paul Wayper, Cook BOB FOR THE JOB What a dismal clutch of politicians we are stuck with. Oh that we had a Bob for the job. Either Menzies or Hawke would do. Cynthia Moloney, Yarralumla STOP THE DENIAL NSW Environment Minister Matt Kean says ""no one can deny"" climate change is responsible for the smoke haze choking Sydney. Unfortunately the letters pages of newspapers demonstrate many do continue to deny this reality. Meanwhile the PM has said: ""Our actions on climate change are getting the results they're intended to get"". Never has he spoken truer words. Keith Hill, Isaacs WEASEL WORDS Mere repetitious weasel words Prime Minister. (""PM responds to pressure over NSW bushfires"", canberratimes.com.au, December 12).

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia113","Firestorms follow move away from cool burning","January 4, 2020 Saturday","The Australian","The facts are too conveniently ignored when discussing ways to manage climate changes Christine Finlay has been sounding the alarm on bushfires in Australia for more than a decade after tracking the relationship -between reduced cool burning and the frequency of firestorms. And the Queensland-based fire -researcher, who charted a century of archival bushfire records for her PhD, has long been screaming danger. Finlay's thesis examined problem bushfires between 1881 and 1981. What she found after plotting the historical data on a graph was that there was a marked increase in the size and frequency of fires after 1919. This was when bushfire-reduction operations increasingly moved away from traditional indigenous practices such as low--intensity cool burning. Finlay says this -detailed correlation between the accumulation of catastrophic fuel loads and the frequency of extreme bushfires made it possible to forecast the dramatic increase in firestorms we have seen in the 21st century. ""For years, I energetically sent this predictive model to government agencies, in particular bushfire services, the media, coronial and parliamentary inquiries and so on,"" she says. ""Horribly -ignored, it proved horribly accurate."" Finlay has the support of forester Vic Jurskis, who has written a book on fire stick ecology and how indigenous Australians managed the landscape with fire. In an open letter to the Prime Minister, premiers, chief ministers and opposition leaders in November, Jurskis said this season's -bushfire situation was neither -unprecedented nor unexpected. ""This latest holocaust is a direct consequence of unprecedented accumulation of 3D continuous fuels as a result of green influence on politics,"" Jurskis says. ""It's all about fuel, not climate."" Half a century ago, Athol Hodgson, who later became chief fire officer of Victoria, explained the simple physics: doubling the available fuel usually doubles the rate of spread of the fire and -increases its intensity fourfold. Jurskis says control burning over large areas cheaply and effectively reduces the incidence of high-intensity wildfires and minimises damage. When this year's fire season -finally ends, Finlay's research and Jurskis's theories no doubt will be offered to a federal government review already proposed by Scott Morrison. All sides will have a big stake in any investigation: fire command, volunteer services, state government agencies and anyone who lives near the bush. Green groups are ready to battle demands that national parks be opened up to logging to reduce fuel loads. Politically, the Greens insist their environment policies adopted in November 2017 do not prohibit cool burns. The Greens have called on the Prime Minister to immediately -declare a royal commission into the bushfire crisis. ""While we need a national response to the bushfire crisis, any process that does not have at its heart a commitment to phase out fossil fuels like coal and rapidly transition to a renewable energy economy is doomed to fail from the start,"" Greens leader Richard Di Natale has said. ""We need to anticipate and prepare for these emergencies, but we also need to go to the root cause, which is the burning of fossil fuels that is dangerously heating our planet."" Linking bushfires to climate change scientifically is still contentious given the long history of fires in Australia. But for the Greens and climate groups making the link politically is a no-brainer. It compounds a dilemma for the federal government, which might have hoped that finally it was getting its climate message under control. With the dramatic fires it faces the prospect of a new level of public expectation at a time when the appetite among world leaders for urgency appears to be on the wane. Last month's UN Framework Convention on Climate Change meeting in Madrid underscored the fact that shrill demands from Greta Thunberg and lobby groups like Extinction Rebellion are not being matched by political will. COP25 ."" He said the international community had lost an important -opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis. UN Framework Convention on Climate Change executive secretary Patricia Espinosa said it was ""important to conduct an honest and realistic assessment of what happened"". ""We need to be clear that the conference did not result in agreement on the guidelines for a much-needed carbon market - an essential part of the toolkit to raise ambition that can harness the potential of the private sector and generate finance for adaptation,"" Espinosa said. ""Developed countries have yet to fully address the calls from developing countries for enhanced support in finance, technology and capacity building, without which they cannot green their economies and build adequate resilience to climate change. ""High-emitting countries did not send a clear enough signal that they are ready to improve their -climate strategies and ramp up ambition through the nationally determined contributions they will submit next year."" For Australian Energy Minister Angus Taylor, the Madrid meeting outcome illustrates the disconnect between how climate change is being discussed domestically and what is actually happening on the world stage. Rather than setting tougher targets, political leaders are desperately looking for solutions that can make a difference at manageable cost. Writing in The Australian this week, Taylor said there are serious limits to pressuring countries into aggressive top-down targets without offering clear pathways to deliver. ""Many countries understandably see that as negative globalism and a gross infringement on their national sovereignty,"" he wrote. ""The Paris Agreement is based on bottom-up 'nationally determined contributions' and it should stay true to that \'e2\€ \£6 The best way to deliver on and strengthen these commitments is through new productive technologies and practices that deliver emission abatement while maintaining or strengthening economic growth."" Taylor said in most countries it isn't acceptable to pursue emission-reduction policies that add substantially to the cost of living, destroy jobs, reduce incomes and impede growth. His view is supported by international analysis that says the most daunting headwind facing UN climate talks is -rising nationalism, populism and economic retrenchment - all at the expense of multilateralism. Sebastien Treyer, of the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations in Paris, said: ""The stalemate over carbon markets is a symptom of a more general polarisation and lack of co-operation among countries."" AFP says street protests against the rise in cost of living in France, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Egypt and more than two dozen other countries last year have given governments already reluctant to -invest in a low-carbon future -another reason to baulk. ""These cases highlight how sensitive populations are to change in the price of basic commodities like food, energy and transport,"" Stephane Hallegatte, of the World Bank, noted. The formal withdrawal of the US from the Paris Agreement from November and the reluctance of the world's major emitters, China and India, to bolster action completes a bleak picture. Divisions in Madrid reflect the stand-offs between developed and developing nations that have dogged the UNFCCC process since its inception. Developing nations will not be held to the same rules as the developed world. Nor will they consider further meaningful -action until developed nations make good on a promise made in Copenhagen to deliver $US100bn a year in finance from this year. ""Ambition of Parties is measured first and foremost by the -implementation of its commit-ments,"" said a joint statement from China, India, Brazil and South -Africa. The statement said commitments made by developed countries must be honoured. According to climate scientist Judith Curry, the political divide remains between developed and developing countries, but particularly between the West and China/India, and has not changed since Copenhagen and Paris. Curry argues we have not only oversimplified the problem of climate change but we have also oversimplified its ""solution"". ""Even if you accept the climate model projections and that warming is dangerous, there is disagreement among experts regarding whether a rapid acceleration away from fossil fuels is the appropriate policy response,"" Curry says. ""In any event, rapidly reducing emissions from fossil fuels to ameliorate the adverse impacts of -extreme weather events in the near term increasingly looks like magical thinking."" Australia routinely is held up by lobby groups as an obstacle to progress at international climate talks. But Taylor wrote this week that debate in Madrid was not about Australia's performance. Unlike many other countries, Australia says it is on target to meet its obligations under both the Kyoto second round and 2030 Paris Agreement. The most recent estimates -released by the federal Environment Department last month are that Australia will overachieve on both its 2020 and 2030 targets. Australia will overachieve on its 2020 target (5 per cent below 2000 levels) by 283 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO2-e). After including Australia's overachievement from the first commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol (2008-12) of 128Mt CO2-e, overachievement increases to 411Mt CO2-e. Emissions this year are projected to be 534Mt CO2-e, which is 6Mt CO2-e lower than the previous estimate of 540Mt CO2-e. Australia is also on track to meet its Paris Agreement target for 2030 of 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels. Emissions in 2030 are projected to be 511Mt CO2-e. To achieve this, emissions reductions of 395 to 462Mt CO2-e between 2021 and 2030 are required. When overachievement of 411Mt CO2-e from previous targets is included, Australia will overachieve by 16Mt CO2-e (26 per cent reduction) and will require 51Mt CO2-e of cumulative emissions reduction -between 2021 and 2030 to meet the 28 per cent reduction target. The federal opposition, Greens and climate groups criticise the Morrison government for lacking ambition and counting the excess savings from the Kyoto round in the Paris targets. But Taylor says there is less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere -because of the work Australian households, farmers and busi-nesses have done under Kyoto, and this should be recognised by the world in assessing and setting future obligations. ""Where we take a different -approach to other countries is we only ever ratchet our ambition up as we know we can deliver,"" Taylor says. ""The important point is if we raise our ambition and no one else does anything, you have wasted an opportunity \'e2\€ \£6 The real point with 1.3 per cent of emissions is what is going to happen in the US and China and other developing countries."" The Energy Minister is unmoved by protest groups like -Extinction Rebellion, which he says ultimately may become self-destructive. ""People don't want to think about this stuff every day, they just want to know that things are -happening. They want things taken off the agenda, not put on the agenda, but groups like Extinction -Rebellion just want it on the -agenda every day."" Natural disasters like the bushfires allow lobby groups to keep the issue squarely in the public mind. But the impact is global. An email received by Curry from a young adult in Britain illustrates the level of stress being generated in the community. It read: ""I genuinely have the fear that climate change is going to kill me and all my family, I'm not even kidding it's all I have thought about for the last 9 months every second of the day. It's making me sick to my stomach, I'm not eating or sleeping and I'm getting panic attacks daily. It's currently 1 am and I can't sleep as I'm petrified."" Curry's advice is to consider the positives. During the past century, there has been a 99 per cent decline in the death toll from -natural disasters, during the same period that the global population quadrupled. While global economic losses from weather and climate disasters have been increasing, this is caused by increasing population and property in vulnerable locations. Global losses because of weather events as a proportion of global GDP have declined about 30 per cent since 1990. The proportion of the world population living in extreme poverty declined from 36 per cent in 1990 to 10 per cent in 2015. Activist scientists and the media quickly seize upon each -extreme weather event as having the fingerprints of manmade climate change but they ignore the analyses of more sober scientists showing periods of even more -extreme weather in the first half of the 20th century, when fossil fuel emissions were much smaller. Curry's message to children is ""don't believe the hype"". For activists, her message is that they are triggering a global backlash against doing anything sensible about protecting our environment or reducing our vulnerability to extreme weather.""You are making young people miserable who haven't yet experienced enough of life to place this nonsense in context,"" she says. \"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia114","How the world came around to carbon capture storage","October 18, 2019 Friday 00:00 GMT","AFR Online","Phil Hodgson can see the Netherlands from the top of the 60-metre tower he has built at the Lixhe cement plant in Belgium, and if his small Australian company can continue to extract 95 per cent of the carbon dioxide in the plant's cement, the only way will be up. ""It's not bad for a bit of lab kit,"" says Hodgson of the tower, which houses the pilot plant his company has built in partnership with two of the world's biggest cement manufacturers. Overlooked by Australian cement makers that were not incentivised to reduce their carbon footprint, Hodgson's company Calix headed for Europe, where it found an eager audience from cement manufacturers living under tightening carbon price regimes. On Monday that audience extended to members of the European Parliament, who called through Lixhe to learn more about Calix' direct separation technology. That technology is now the hope of the cement industry and highlights the changing focus of the carbon capture and storage (CCS) industry. No longer fixated on the polarising and so far unsuccessful mission to use CCS to save coal-fired power, the CCS industry is increasingly focused on capturing, storing and in some cases utilising the carbon dioxide that will be emitted by producers of cement, plastics and steel, even if those manufacturers were to source 100 per cent of their power from renewables. Their work is being bolstered by a fragile, but growing consensus across government, corporate and even environmental agencies that CCS must play a role if the world is to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement and limit global warming to below two degrees. It's a debate of particular relevance for major fossil fuel exporters such as Australia, which, HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/policy/energy-and-climate/a-111-carbon-tax-in-australia-would-still-be-too-low-says-imf-20191010-p52zkq according to the International Monetary Fund, would need a carbon price beyond $111 to meet Paris targets. ""I have seen a few cycles, it goes in and out of favour, and the last time it went out of favour was really around 2010 after the global financial crisis, and suddenly people started saying it is too expensive. ''One of the difficulties that occurred was when people said, let's call it 'clean coal' - that really was not the right thing to do.'' Essential to meeting Paris goals But everything changed at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, where nations put forward their own contributions to reducing emissions, agreeing to limit global warming to less than two degrees, and aspire towards 1.5 degrees. ''The targets and the national contributions to achieve those targets caused everybody to do some maths that they had never previously had to do,'' says Brad Page, who runs the Global CCS Institute. US President Donald Trump forced everyone to do the maths again in 2018, when he introduced generous incentives for CCS, sparking calls for similar policy reform here in Australia. The days when petroleum and coal companies were the only proponents of CCS are gone. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the scientific body trusted to provide the world with information and advice about mitigating global warming, found CCS would be required in three of the four ''pathways'' it outlined for how the world can limit temperature rises to 1.5 degrees. Professor Julia King, the vice-chair of the agency that advises the British government on its five-yearly carbon budgets, believes CCS is ""absolutely essential'' if the world is going to meet the Paris goals. ''There are two ways of looking at CCS. You can look at CCS as a means of prolonging the life of fossil fuel industries by investing further in sequestering carbon pollution. Or you can look at CCS as a means of capturing carbon from the atmosphere to help draw down the excessive carbon dioxide that has already been emitted,'' says the foundation's Suzanne Harter. ""For industries that do not have a choice, yes I think we should continue research and where possible trialling forms of sequestration."" Lumped together as ""heavy industry'', the world's steel, cement and chemical plants produce about 30 per cent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. So long as humble limestone (otherwise known as calcium carbonate) remains the basic feedstock for a large chunk of the world's cement, huge amounts of carbon dioxide will be emitted, regardless of what type of energy is used in the manufacturing process. ''When a cement plant heats that up ??? all of that carbon dioxide in the rock comes out,'' says Hodgson, whose tower in Belgium shelters a 34-metre vertical steel tube at the heart of Calix's technology. The tube is heated to 1000 degrees, and when a preliminary form of cement ''meal'' is poured down it, the carbon dioxide escapes and floats to the tube's top. ''You can then separate and take that carbon dioxide as a pure stream,'' Hodgson says. ''For every tonne of carbon dioxide that could be produced out of the rock itself, we have measured about 95 per cent capture.'' Hodgson's tower is now treating 5 per cent of the cement produced at Lixhe by Heidelberg Cement and the plan is to demonstrate consistent operations for another year before building a full-scale model to test commercial viability. European carbon prices rallied from less than ???5 ($8.20) in mid-2017 to more than ???29 in July, and were above ???26 on the day Hodgson spoke to The Australian Financial Review. He reckons Calix is in the game at such prices. ""With carbon prices above ???25 per tonne, I think we have a very attractive technology,"" he says. ''The heat required [for Calix' technology] should not be any higher than the heat already required by the cement plant, so from an operational cost perspective we should be no higher than a current cement plant. ''The only cost is the capital cost of building our facility.'' The coking coal challenge While Calix could deliver a win for corporate Australia on the global stage, much more is at stake for the local economy in the race to reduce the carbon intensity of the Asian steel sector, which is tipped to buy $37.2 billion worth of Australian coking coal this financial year. Like the limestone in cement plants, coking coal is an integral ingredient - not a fuel source - in most Asian steel mills, meaning the emissions created are ""hard to shift"". While there is a steel plant in Abu Dhabi that uses CCS, that plant does not use coking coal. Nowhere in the world is CCS attached to a steel mill that consumes coking coal. The world's biggest exporter of coking coal, BHP, is keen to change that through work with Beijing's Peking University and steel mills in China. At this stage the work is focused on better understanding the barriers to deployment in China, and is not expected to build any hardware at a steel plant any time soon. BHP's practice lead for climate change, Graham Winkelman, is confident CCS for Chinese steel mills is technically feasible, even though it has not been proven. ""The predominant source of carbon dioxide in a steel plant is the blast furnace and that has similarities to a point source of emissions within a power plant, but we have yet to see that demonstrated at full-scale,"" he says. Winkelman's comment highlights the bridge that connects those working in the uncontroversial world of CCS for heavy industry, to those working deep in the culture war that still surrounds CCS for coal-fired power. If CCS is to work in the steel sector, it will probably need to borrow the lessons learned in attempts to retro-fit CCS onto coal-fired power stations. That puts the spotlight squarely on two power stations in North America: Canada's Boundary Dam station and the WA Parish Power Station in Texas. The North American experience Better known as the Petra Nova carbon capture project, the Texas plant is the most realistic attempt at retro-fitting a coal-fired power station with CCS in a financially transparent way. Petra Nova's owner, NRG Energy, does not publish the CCS project's financial results as a line item in its accounts, but it discloses enough to make clear Petra Nova has not been a financial success in the 34 months it has been operating. The Petra Nova business model is built on two revenue streams: selling coal-fired power and selling oil. Unit 8 of the power station has a generation capacity of 610 megawatts, and the capture facility treats 40 per cent of the gas that comes out the flue, or chimney, when Unit 8 is operating at full capacity. NRG says almost 3.2 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide has been captured by Petra Nova between December 2016 and September 2019. After being captured, the carbon dioxide is piped 129 kilometres to the ''West Ranch'' oil field, where it is injected underground to boost oil extraction rates. The oil is then sold by NRG and its joint venture partner JX Nippon. Boundary Dam's business model also relies on using the captured carbon dioxide to boost oil extraction, although it sells its carbon dioxide to Toronto-listed Whitecap Resources. Despite having the twin revenue streams - electricity and oil - the evidence suggests neither Petra Nova nor Boundary Dam have been profitable. Low oil prices over the past five years have been a big part of the problem. Former NRG chief David Crane said in 2015 that carbon capture at Petra Nova for use in oilfields made economic sense when oil prices were higher than $US75 ($110) per barrel. North America's benchmark oil product, West Texas Intermediate crude, has averaged $US55 per barrel since then. NRG took a $US140 million impairment on Petra Nova in 2016 and a further $US69 million impairment in 2017. ''Petra Nova economics are impacted by many things including oil price, oilfield production, operating costs and project debt,'' NRG spokesman David Knox tells the Financial Review. Another sign of Petra Nova's financial challenges came in August, when NRG confirmed it would have to repay up to $US124 million of debt to Petra Nova's lenders, because the project had fallen short of debt covenants. ''Petra Nova has shown that a CCUS plant can be built on time and on budget and that carbon capture technology does work and can capture greater than 90 per cent of the carbon dioxide in the processed flue gas from a coal plant at commercial scale,'' Knox says. The notion that a business model for CCS can be built on the production of another fossil fuel, such as oil, does not sit easily with Britain's Professor King. 'Against the whole purpose' ''In terms of the scale of carbon dioxide that we are going to need to capture, we are not going to find very many ways to use that. There will be some, putting some into greenhouses and using some in chemical reactions, but actually most of it is going to need to be stored, so I think the letter 'U' in 'CCUS' is slightly decorative. ''And I certainly feel that if the 'U' is enhanced oil and gas recovery, that is slightly against the whole purpose of doing this carbon capture and storage in the first place."" The International Energy Agency reported in 2015 that for every tonne of carbon dioxide injected into a producing oilfield, 0.63 tonnes of carbon dioxide abatement was delivered even after the resulting oil production was burned. South Australian oil and gas producer Santos is investigating whether injection of carbon dioxide into its flagship Cooper Basin fields can improve oil extraction rates. While its first three years have been financially challenging, Petra Nova's best days may yet be ahead thanks to beefed-up financial incentives signed into law by US President Donald Trump in February 2018. 'A big splash' Known as the 45Q legislation, the changes will give tax credits of up to $US35 for each tonne of carbon dioxide injected into the earth by new projects that capture carbon dioxide then use it to boost oil recoveries. Those capturing and storing the carbon for no productive use will be eligible for tax credits up to $US50 per tonne. ''That is a big splash,'' said Page. ''It is by far the one [policy initiative] I can observe that has led directly to investment.'' The 45Q legislation is also expected to boost existing CCS projects like Petra Nova. ''While Petra Nova does qualify for 45Q, the rules around 45Q are still being formulated and we cannot predict specifically what they will mean for Petra Nova,'' says Knox. Cheap gas was the main reason the $C1.5 billion ($1.7 billion) retro-fitting of CCS to unit 3 at Saskatchewan's Boundary Dam coal-fired power station was not a financial success. Corwyn Bruce used to work as CCS initiatives manager for the provincial government utility that owns Boundary Dam: Saskpower. Bruce says when CCS was approved for Boundary Dam in 2010, the cost of power from the retro-fit was roughly equivalent to building a new gas-fired power station. ''Since that time in Canada, the price of natural gas has dropped significantly, which challenges the business case of wider deployment of CCS retrofits of coal-generating assets,'' he says. Saskpower has since abandoned plans to retro-fit CCS onto two further units at Boundary Dam, but the utility has not given up on CCS altogether. A joint venture between Saskpower and BHP has published a feasibility study on the cost of retro-fitting CCS onto the Shand power station, one of Saskpower's youngest coal-fired power stations which is double the size of Boundary Dam. The study found that 90 per cent of the plant's carbon emission could be captured at a cost of $US45 per tonne, assuming the retrofitted plant could run for 30 years. The study estimated the capital costs of construction could be 67 per cent lower than the Boundary Dam retrofit. If Shand were to run at 62 per cent of its generation capacity, the study estimated carbon dioxide capture rates could reach 97 per cent. Bruce says the biggest cost reductions would come from Shand's bigger scale, but a range of lessons from Boundary Dam's experience would deliver cost reductions. ''The Boundary Dam CCS facility was a first in the world plant. When pioneering a commercial scale plant, equipment is often designed larger than it needs to be in order to mitigate the risks of the unknown and then, inevitably with operational experience, improvements to the plant design are recognised,'' he says. ''The second generation study takes advantage of these learnings.'' Like Petra Nova, it is possible that Boundary Dam's most lucrative days lie ahead. The Canadian government has legislated to shut down its coal-fired generators by 2030, but exclusions are being negotiated for power stations fitted with CCS, and that could mean Boundary Dam unit 3 is one of the few coal-fired generators operating beyond 2030. The Australian experience The Grattan Institute's energy guru, Tony Wood, doesn't doubt that second- and third-generation CCS for coal-fired power can be cheaper than the pioneering efforts at Boundary Dam and Petra Nova. But he doubts that CCS costs could fall as precipitously as renewable energy infrastructure costs have fallen over the past decade, given there are only 16 coal-fired generators in Australia's National Electricity Market. ''Even if we were to build several of these things, we are not going to build enough of them to drive down the cost. It is not like manufacturing solar panels,"" he says. Wood is no greenhorn on CCS, having studied the technology and its potential deployment in Victoria's La Trobe Valley in partnership with former US president Bill Clinton's eponymous not-for-profit foundation. ''Having spent five years of my life, working 70 per cent of the time on CCS around the world, including speaking to the best technology people I could find, yes, you could bring down the cost if you had to do it, but I have not seen anything that is yet anywhere near compelling,"" he says. The cost of attaching CCS to coal-fired power in Australia will differ for each individual power station depending on its age, efficiency and proximity to geologically appropriate storage sites. A lack of suitable storage sites near Lake Macquarie in NSW has convinced Delta Energy chairman Trevor St Baker that CCS is not realistic for his company's Vales Point coal-fired power station. ''I don't think it has any capacity at Vales Point. Vales Point is nowhere near anything you can sequester it in,'' he says. St Baker says the Bass Strait fields from which BHP and ExxonMobil have been extracting oil and gas for the past 50 years loom as the perfect carbon sink, particularly given their proximity to the La Trobe Valley's coal-fired power stations. The Surat Basin, a large area straddling the border of NSW and Queensland on the western side of the Great Dividing Range, has also been identified as a geologically suitable area for sequestration. Its suitability is bolstered by the fact it hosts significant coal-fired power and coal seam gas extraction businesses. A Glencore subsidiary, CTSCO, is planning to trial storage of carbon dioxide in the Surat Basin near Wandoan, with the project likely to take about 5 per cent of the carbon dioxide produced by the Millmerran power station. The venture is not designed to be profitable in the forseeable future. Supporters say its value will lie in being a local CCS demonstration plant that Australians can see and touch, and the project may also create shared infrastructure (such as wells) that could make future CCS projects more economically viable. Challenged to boil down the cost of CCS for coal-fired power in Australia to a single number, St Baker says he can't. ""It would be very significant. All I know is that alternatives like Snowy Hydro are [also] hugely expensive,'' he says. The coal industry member organisation now known as Coal21 hired consultants in 2017 to crystallise the costs of retrofitting Australian coal plants for CCS. They settled, with a bunch of caveats, on about $99 for each tonne of carbon dioxide abated. For context, futures prices for the supply of electricity to Victoria in November 2019 were fetching $103.38 per megawatt hour on October 15. Analysis conducted by WorleyParsons subsidiary Advisian in 2017 found that it would cost more than $100 per tonne of carbon dioxide avoided to attach CCS to existing coal-fired power stations in Australia. 'Bordering on the implausible' Coal21 is expected to publish a study later this year on building a new 700-megawatt ultra supercritical coal-fired power station with CCS in the Surat Basin at a capital cost of between $2.5 billion and $4 billion. The study is expected to suggest power could be produced from such a plant at a cost of $95 per megawatt hour, with 90 per cent of the carbon dioxide captured. Coal21 is confident such a power station could produce electricity for $70 per megawatt hour - the price nominated as desirable by federal Energy Minister Angus Taylor - if carbon capture rates were lowered to 45 per cent. However, the full assumptions behind the study are not yet available for scrutiny. Tony Wood finds the numbers hard to believe. ''Producing the electricity from the latest high-efficiency coal-fired power station might be in that [price] territory, but to capture and sequester the carbon dioxide as well? It is difficult to see how it would come together financially in Australia. ''The things that would have to happen for it to be realised [in a commercially viable way] are bordering on implausible."" HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/energy-bosses-blast-taylor-for-having-head-in-the-sand-20190612-p51x4h Delta Electricity chief executive Greg Everett said in June that he did not think a high-efficiency, low emissions (HELE) power station would fit with the Morrison government's goal of reducing power prices to about $70 per megawatt by 2021. ""Our assessment of HELE is it is about $90 to $100 per megawatt hour."" BHP's Winkelman says CCS has a role to play in industrial settings, but will need to compete against renewables if it is to penetrate the power sector. ""It appears more likely that CCS in the power industry will be applied where there is growth in energy demand because growing systems typically need ???more of everything'."" That last comment speaks volumes when you appreciate that electricity consumption in Australia fell 7 per cent in the decade to June 30, 2019, according to statistics published by the Australian Energy Regulator. Attaching CCS to Australia's LNG export industry, which is largely responsible for Australia's rising emissions profile, looks far cheaper. The 2017 Advisian study found that attaching CCS to gas processing in Australia would cost $26.90 per tonne of carbon dioxide avoided. The lower cost is due to the fact gas processing already separates the carbon dioxide from the saleable methane before chilling gas into liquid form for export. That means much of the hard work is already done. That cost advantage may explain why more than half of the 18 large-scale CCS facilities in commercial operation around the world in 2018 were attached to natural gas processing. Chevron is in the process of joining that list, after one of the three carbon capture facilities at its Gorgon LNG plant in Western Australia started to inject carbon dioxide deep below Barrow Island in August 2019. CCS at Gorgon is running a long way behind schedule, but assuming the other capture units eventually come into operation, Gorgon will be the world's biggest CCS project. Step change reduction in costs In the peaceful dairy country of south-western Victoria, scientists from universities such as Stanford, Cambridge, Texas, Melbourne and Perth's Curtin University are working on a project to deliver a ""step change"" reduction in the cost of monitoring sequestered carbon dioxide. Partly funded by big companies like Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil, BHP, Woodside and Total, the third phase of the Co2CRC Otway project is hoping to prove that fibre optics can be used to accurately monitor the migration of stored carbon dioxide through porous rock over long periods of time. ''About 40 per cent to 60 per cent of the total cost of the storage is captured in that long-term [seismic] monitoring, so we figure we can save up to 75 per cent off those long-term monitoring costs,'' says David Byers, the chief executive of Co2CRC. ''That is a step change in the way we look at the whole task of long-term monitoring of carbon dioxide."" Byers says there is plenty the federal government could be doing to make CCS more viable in Australia. Policy parity While he would love a local version of Donald Trump's 45Q incentives, Byers says there are less ambitious policies that could boost the sector, such as reforming the Morrison government's $2 billion Climate Solutions Fund to ensure that geological storage of carbon was eligible for Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs). ''Under the current set-up, there are many opportunities to gain ACCUs for biological sequestration through reforestation, or revegetation, but there really isn't any approved methodology which would accommodate carbon capture and storage,"" he says. ''Geological storage is more trustworthy [than biological storage] because you have much greater certainty and scientific veracity attached to monitoring of carbon dioxide, and where it is located in a geological storage structure. ""We need to have policy parity with other low-emissions technologies.'' It is a view enthusiastically supported by Santos, while Winkelman indicates BHP is also sympathetic to the idea. Asked whether he believes geological storage of carbon should be eligible for ACCUs, minister Taylor says: ''The government is committed to ensuring the Climate Solution Fund supports low cost abatement across the economy, including uptake of new technology.'' Harter says the Australian Conservation Foundation will not support ACCUs for CCS. ''Government policy on reducing carbon pollution should not be about throwing a lifeline to coal, oil and gas, it should focus on transitioning to clean zero-pollution options,"" she says. ""There is a finite budget on the table for Australian Carbon Credit Units. Paying Santos or other companies with fossil fuel interests to try to sequester their pollution is not a good use of that public money.'' Byers from Co2CRC and Santos also call for the government's Clean Energy Finance Corporation to be allowed to lend to CCS projects, a suggestion that Harter says the conservation foundation will ""absolutely"" not support. The next big thing No discussion of CCS is complete without mentioning hydrogen, which governments hope can play a big role in decarbonising the world's economy. While many nations see hydrogen as the low-carbon replacement for natural gas in domestic uses such as heating, it is also being spruiked as a transport fuel, and even a potential substitute for coking coal in steel making. There are two primary ways to produce hydrogen. Electricity can be used to separate the hydrogen and oxygen atoms in water, and if that electricity is supplied by renewables, you have what many call ""green hydrogen"". The alternative method is using high-temperature steam to reform methane; a process that creates carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide byproducts. King says Britain will need to do plenty of both, and neither will be cheap. ''There is an awful lot where we can't use electricity where we are probably going to need hydrogen,"" she says. ''Quite a lot of that hydrogen is going to need CCS.'' Page says in Australia it is cheaper to produce hydrogen from fossil fuels and use CCS to store the carbon byproducts, rather than use renewables to make hydrogen via electrolysis. Japanese heavyweights such as Marubeni and Kawasaki Heavy Industries are working with AGL on such a hydrogen plan in the La Trobe Valley, which if expanded would store carbon emissions in Bass Strait's Pelican field. 'A role to play' Having watched CCS drift in and out of fashion with policymakers and big business over recent decades, scientist Peter Cook says it is time for acceptance and collective action. ''People are now coming to a view that CCS has a role to play. People have to be creative and they also have to put aside their prejudices. We are all in this together, and it is pretty foolish to think any one technology has all the answers.'' \"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia115","For the love of travel","February 21, 2020 Friday","Australian Financial Review","As many of us wonder how to reduce our carbon footprint while satisfying our wanderlust, high-profile environmentalists offer their tips for exploring the world more mindfully to Tshering Lama O'gorman. How many trips is one too many this year? If you've always loved travel and are feeling conflicted after the summer that was, rest assured, you're not alone. Intrepid travellers who are passionate about protecting the health of the environment are facing a conundrum: how to balance the desire to cross borders and oceans with the knowledge that doing so will generate a carbon footprint. I'm Nepalese-born and raised, and have lived in several cities across the globe, including Sydney for the past decade. Whether it be for work, adventure or to reconnect with family and friends in Nepal, regular travel has been one of the most rewarding, treasured parts of my life. Travelling for work and leisure has become necessary to my life, and I usually do at least three intercontinental trips in a year. The recent startling weather extremes, drought and bushfire crises have been a stark wake-up call, not least because my husband and I have each worked in the field of not-for-profit environmentalism for about 30 years. And then there is necessary work-related travel. Let's face it, if Sir David Attenborough hadn't travelled regularly in his prime, how could he have made those documentaries that have helped inform and educate generations of people about the wealth of diverse natural habitats that are worth fighting for? As we cast around for solutions as to how we can ease our conscience, and travel more mindfully, let's start with some facts. Tourism's global carbon footprint is calculated to account for 8 per cent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, according to credible sources, including a 2018 study published in the respected journal Nature. Within the trillion-dollar tourism industry, the biggest emissions contributors were listed as transport, shopping and food. ""From 2009 to 2013, global tourism-related emissions increased from 3.9 to 4.5 billion tons of CO2 annually,"" the study says. The United States topped the list for travel emissions, mostly due to domestic flights, followed by China, Germany and India. Cutting the data another way, commercial aviation accounts for about 2 per cent of global emissions - and about 12 per cent of all CO2 emissions from the transportation sector. It's not insignificant, but relatively small when compared with emissions from other industries. Relatively small for now, that is. Carbon dioxide emissions from commercial aircraft are on course to triple by 2050 if left unchecked, as passenger numbers and air freight increase. ""In many parts of the world, tourism is built around wilderness and nature-based activities,"" says Judith Mair, an associate professor in the Tourism Discipline Group at the UQ Business School in Queensland. ""At the same time, tourism - through flights, accommodation, meals, car hire etc - is a significant contributor to carbon emissions. So tourism is both badly hit by climate change and it's a contributor."" It's certainly a curly one. When I put the question of ""to travel or not to travel"" to Professor Tim Flannery, chief councillor at Climate Council Australia, it's met with a good-natured sigh. How often does he travel by air and where? ""Very frequently,"" he says. ""Obviously, I do commute on public transport as well, but yes, a lot of air travel and also by sea. Over the past 12 months, I've been so many places I couldn't even begin to tell you; for work - to Europe, to the Caribbean, to Melanesia."" Yes, he only takes necessary work trips and pays to carbon offset every time he flies, but Flannery still travels. ""There is a limit to whatever else we can do, as we actually have to travel to earn a living,"" he says. ""If you are in Europe, you can take plenty of land travel. It's very difficult for Australians to do that. ""I am doing my best. As part of my work, I talk to airlines about how they might do this sustainably. But there's a limit to whatever else one can do until the airlines decide they are going to use biofuel.""More on biofuel later. In the line of duty he takes an average of at least one international trip every three weeks. In 2019, he travelled to Peru, Chile, Botswana, Kenya, the United States, Europe, Timor-Leste and Antarctica for work, and to Japan for annual leave. ""I don't think air travel is great, but if you want to move around the world in the sort of job I do, which is basically to save the world, it's necessary,"" he says, adding that all the flights he takes are 100 per cent carbon offset. The other two experts I approached, Kelly O'Shanassy, chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, and Cameron Kerr, CEO of Taronga Conservation Society Australia, also observe the golden rule of carbon offsetting. ""I've just come back from the United States,"" says O'Shanassy. ""I decided to have a holiday in the US as well as a work trip - this is one of the tricks I do to reduce my air travel."" Kerr went to the US and South America for work last year, and took two more trips for holidays, to Nepal and to Norfolk Island. ""I think it's important for people to travel,"" Kerr says. ""We have a huge, disproportionate amount of wealth in the West and one way of better distributing that is to travel and visit communities that aren't rich. ""One of the many powerful things about travel is it connects people to different environments. The Great Barrier Reef, Fraser Island and many of the forests in Tasmania are protected because people travelled to them, became inspired by their beauty and fought for them."" These environmental leaders provide some reassurance for mere mortals in the light of Swedish activist Greta Thunberg's very public yacht and rail journeys, including a nearly three-week trip on a catamaran in December across the Atlantic to attend the COP 25 Climate Change Conference in Madrid. It was a grand gesture, but not many of us can take an extended carbon-neutral sailing trip to present at a business conference. Which brings us to flight shaming. Many would argue it's not a useful development, even when it's mainly targeted at wealthy individuals such as Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle, along with private-jet-owning celebrities - notably Leonardo DiCaprio. The fiercest criticism, perhaps understandably, is when such high-profile people regularly spruik environmental causes, then fly around on a near-empty private jet. Prince Harry defended his actions, saying an exclusive private jet was sometimes necessary to ensure his family's safety; he pointed out that he always carbon offsets. O'Shanassy sees it as an unhelpful development: ""I don't like the idea of flight shaming anyone. We can all live more sustainable lives and have a lower impact. Rather than forcing consumers going on a flight to buy offsets, it is more practical that the airline company should incorporate it as part of the air ticket."" One constructive outcome from flight shaming is how it has forced the aviation industry and passengers to reflect on greener options. When respected actor and environmental activist Dame Emma Thompson was criticised last April for flying from the US to London to attend a climate change protest organised by the hardcore Extinction Rebellion group (which is calling for flights to be used only in emergencies), she gave critics short shrift. ""The fact of the matter is, everyone has been asking for clean energy for decades and it has been ignored for decades,"" she said. ""So where is the hypocrisy? If I could fly cleanly, I would."" As we head into the 2020s, we appear to be at least inching towards solutions in terms of cleaning our skies. In July 2019, Sir David Attenborough made an impassioned, articulate plea to the British Parliament, arguing that taking action over climate change was so urgent that governments should make air travel more expensive to discourage people. At about the same time, the French government announced it would introduce an airport eco tax in 2020, resulting in an increase of between (EURO)1.5 and (EURO)18 ($1.60 to $29) for any flight departing France. It is expected to generate (EURO)180 million a year, to be invested in more environmentally friendly means of transportation. The move has caused controversy, and not much detail has been released since the announcement in by French Transport Minister &#xC9;lisabeth Borne. ""One of the biggest problems with the current economic model is that we externalise the costs to the environment,"" says Kerr. ""If we really understand the impact of our travel and whatever else we do - and we build those costs into our products - then it will better shape the way forward."" Pristine areas that are managed with strict quotas and accreditation systems, ensuring tourist revenue is returned to the community and environment, work best, he says. Naturally, carbon offsets are also a big part of the solution, especially in the short term. Until the past five years, the aviation industry has dragged its feet on costing out aircraft emissions. ""I do think at the moment, we are seeing a major shift with airlines and airports and how they manage the problem,"" says Wilder. Under the Paris Agreement, countries have an obligation to reduce their emissions in line with the targets that they have set. Traditionally, airlines have been excluded from that. ""There has been a big process to get airlines covered through what's called the CORSIA mechanism, through which airlines will reduce emissions,"" says Wilder. ""This will be done through a combination of buying offsets and sourcing biofuels and, I guess in the future, by building electric aircraft."" When you stop to consider that from 2016 to 2030, international and domestic arrivals are expected to increase from 20 billion to 37 billion, according to the UN World Tourism Organisation, it's a sizeable increase. UNWTO is calling for more co-operation between the transport and tourism sectors to fast-track achieving low-carbon travel. Flannery says that will only come when the industry moves to embrace biofuel and a clean fuel base. It's been experimenting for years, but little real change has occurred, albeit some big international carriers such as JetBlue, Cathay Pacific and United Continental Holdings have said they plan to increase biofuels used. In 2017, Qantas announced its Los Angeles-based aircraft would be powered by biofuel from this year. It consists of 50 per cent renewable jet fuel produced from non-food plant oils, blended with 50 per cent traditional fuel - the biofuel emits half the amount of carbon emissions per gallon over its life cycle. ""It's clean energy and is only about 25 per cent more expensive than conventional jet fuel, so why are we not using it?"" says Flannery. In a nice twist, Flannery points out even aircraft have some environmentally sound features: the contrails, or vapour trails, actually cool the Earth. ""I'd love to be able to fly with a clean conscience, thinking my contrails are cooling the planet, but that is not an option for any of us yet, and it's crazy!"" he says. Flannery adds that he can fly from Melbourne to Sydney for about $200. Biofuel would add only $25 to the trip. ""We just need enough people to be saying to the industry: 'You must use biofuels in jets.'"" Like many others, Wilder is concerned we will act too late. ""My biggest fear is that we will just leave it too late and we will lock in a certain element of climate change that is irreversible and that means our younger generations will have to live in a very different, unpredictable world. We have to act fast, we have to act now."" But there is an important qualifier: ""You have to feel positive, otherwise we will never get there,"" he says. \"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia116","Climate grief 1 - Marine scientist Ove Hoegh-Guldberg","May 8, 2020 Friday","ABC Transcripts (Australia) Science Show 2:00 PM AEST","Robyn Williams: The Science Show on RN, where today we start a series of conversations about climate and emotions. Yes, scientists are not unfeeling dweebs, not the ones I know. They are passionate about their research and nature, not least when it's in jeopardy. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg is a marine scientist at the University of Queensland. He's with Dr Jonica Newby, formerly of Catalyst . Jonica Newby: Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: Jonica Newby: A level of grief rather than anger, denial, depression, acceptance, any of those. I'm not really comfortable with becoming angry because I've been part of the problem, along with you and everyone else. If I was a child I'd be angry. What the parents have done to the planet that they have to inherit is pretty awful. That's a standard thing to say nowadays but it really does come home to you. Given the dramatic demonstrations of what the planet might be headed towards and the fact that we don't take this next decade extremely seriously, I would imagine I'd start to feel angry. Jonica Newby: How old are your kids now? Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: 21 and 24. Jonica Newby: What emotions do they express about climate? Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: They're very practical, they want to do something to help avert disaster. Fiona, for example, is looking around to do a Masters in sustainability. She curiously was studying the glossy black cockatoo from Kangaroo Island where there are only 21 nesting pairs left, and of course a third of that island has burnt now, and there is grave fears for that. Again, she is very practical and very optimistic. I think she's got a personality a bit like mine where it's almost you transition beyond grief because that's not useful. You have to keep pushing on this. Christopher loves nature, he loves diving, and I think he too gets anxious, thinking that what Dad has been talking about now turns out to be pretty worrying. And I think that's where everyone is. I think the entire nation is shocked, the world is shocked that we are spiralling potentially out of control here. Jonica Newby: Well, if you look at traditional stages of grief, and I know that that's not universally accepted of course but it's useful, I think of you and people like you who've been on the climate frontline for so long, you've almost, as you say, had to go through those really deep grief feelings and hit acceptance. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: Yes, you're right about that. There was a real hope I think 30 years ago when we were starting to realise what was happening, that we could turn things around, that it wasn't as serious as we thought. And of course 30 years later now we find out that it's extremely serious, and we've done nothing about it. The performance indicator of course is the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. It's been going up at ever faster rates, so whatever we are doing, it ain't working. Jonica Newby: Well, your last three months have been pretty tumultuous. You had a paper published in Science which looked at actual tipping points I suppose and why we need to stop and stabilise the climate at 1.5 degrees, which is another 0.5, that's all. And then you went to the COP25 round of talks in Madrid which was supposed to see our way forward to reducing that carbon dioxide that you mentioned. And then you came home to Australia on fire. So how has that been? Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: Yes, it's been a whirlwind of trouble. We had Christmas out near Oberon on the western slopes, and like many Australians we were watching the skies, seeing the sun go down to this little golden orb, this dense smog that was coming off everything. Three of the four siblings and our families. And then realising that this house we are in backs up against the bush, it's not so far from the Jenolan Caves fires, and you've got things like my grandfather's slide collection which goes back to the 1920s, he was a photographer for most of his life, and my father's slide collection there, vulnerable in this beautiful wooded house. And so we decided that we would, at the end of the Christmas break, take them to Sydney and to Parkes and to bigger cities because it is very likely that that area will burn. I don't want to be a scaremonger here but that's the sort of reality I think we are all facing, people who thought they were well away from any harm now find themselves with a fair risk of being harmed. And so this I think is coming home...as a scientist I worry about the feedback loops, the idea that as you burn more forests you take up less CO2, you've got drier forests that then are more likely to build up dry tinder that then in heatwave conditions will then catch fire and so on. All of this is very visceral and real now. It once used to be in the IPCC reports that I've been involved in over time where the science consensus on climate change is found, often mentioned there will be an earlier start to the bushfire season, fires will burn for longer and hotter because of drought out of this dry scientific process is actually now something we are starting to live. And this I think is why there is a bit of a shock and grief here because it's like we have forgone the opportunity to turn this around. If during the '80s when lots of scientists were coming in with very worrying news, if we had acted then, the scale of the problem would have been four times less, less to deal with in terms of emissions than what we are dealing with today. And so we are really pushing ourselves. And of course you mentioned tipping points. Again, this is stuff you read, it's in these scientific documents, the idea that you get to a point where sudden change occurs, a little push, it's the straw that broke the camel's back, the melting of the tundra and the feedback loop of methane, loss of the Arctic sea ice, the melting of Iceland's and Greenland's ice sheets, you name it, they are all part of not just linear change, these things are starting to escalate because they are feeding back on themselves, and that to me is a worry. Now, if you'd said that 10 years ago, even the scientists would have said, look, it's a distinct possibility but it's a high impact, low probability event. Well, it turns out that those high impact events may not be as low probability as we thought. Jonica Newby: Well, this brings us to what you were addressing in the Science article. Can you just tell me what that was about and what prompted it? Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: Well, the paper is about the human imperative to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and it came from a group of us coming out of the IPCC special report on 1.5 degrees Celsius, this is the more ambitious Paris Agreement goal. The messages from this are that we are approaching tipping points, major changes in the Earth system which have direct threats to humans, communities, ecosystems, the whole box and dice. And so, again, I'm going back to my own community, saying we almost got used to writing about this stuff to the point where we are no longer taking in the significance that once things start to go, they go. The 1.5 degrees Celsius paper was really interesting... Jonica Newby: Because that was thought to be a relatively 'safe'... Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: That's right, and coming out of the Paris Agreement that came in December 2015, I think up until that point most of us felt that that was a significant level of warming, it had many risks attached to it. But if you'd said that five years before, that small amount of warming was something we were going to try and aim for, people would have dismissed you as being alarmist, that no, we could do two to three degrees. We have barely come out the other side of the half a degree from the 1950s to today, we are barely coming out of that from half a degree to a full degree above the preindustrial period without real threats. You think of what's happens to the Great Barrier Reef, what's happened to the Amazon, what's happened to Australia's forests, what's happening with large storm systems, inundation. We already have a world that is rapidly becoming unmanageable, and now we're going to do another half a degree. The other part of this paper also pointed out the fact that adding another half a degree wasn't just simply adding what we saw from 1950 to present, it was most likely to be a greater change per half a degree, because what we are doing is we're pushing systems-be they economic, natural, human-we are pushing systems further away from their comfort point, and that means that when you have that extra half a degree from one degree to 1.5 degrees above the preindustrial period, you're getting more than you got in the previous 0.5 of a degree. And I think that's something that we are waking up to with this current crisis here in Australia. We are seeing non-linear change. We've been coasting along, the fire seasons have been getting stronger and stronger and now suddenly they are way beyond any linearist extrapolation, that's scores of time larger in impact per warming than we've had in the past. And I saw a graph the other day that had been put together which showed the sort of area burned and so on as a measure of the impact of a fire season going back to the '60s. If you can imagine it's bumbling around here and then you have something like the ones in 2010 I think it was, and there's ones that go back in time to the '60s. Would but when you get to what has happened over this fire season it dwarfs everything, it's scores times higher. What happens next year? Not to scare people, but we still don't have politicians who actually understand what has to happen here. Jonica Newby: But just to COP25 , which was the round of talks in Madrid that was supposed to cement international commitments to Paris, what was it like being there Ove? I spoke to you just before you left and you were a little bit despondent. What was it like being there? Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: Well, I was right to be despondent. Fortunately or unfortunately I had gone through the Copenhagen COP which had great billing and everyone was going to make a difference, and it was largely unsuccessful. And it was the Paris Agreement that reignited hope because the targets were in a process that looked like it could actually get the ratification of countries and get them acting together to solve this problem. And then of course the beginnings of trouble, if you like, was the fact that it had to move suddenly from Santiago to Madrid. Jonica Newby: And why was that? Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: Civil unrest got to a point where they couldn't hold a meeting safely. So with all the presidents and prime ministers and diplomats and so on turning up...oh, and of course the scientists... Jonica Newby: Oh, who cares if they're safe! Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: You can always go and get another bunch. Anyway, so that move was disruptive and they still went on with the same schedule. And going into that conference it felt very much like Copenhagen, there wasn't the optimism that you saw in Paris, there wasn't commitment, there wasn't rush forward to make this happen as it should in terms of this being a global emergency. And I ended up being involved in five or six events. I lost the wind in my sails, it was all very depressing. I don't know, I don't cry... Jonica Newby: Did you when our Science Minister...sorry, Energy Minister, put his two cents worth in? Angus Taylor. I just don't know what motivates these people. At the moment, carryover credits from Kyoto, this is sort of business as usual. One would think if they were sincere about solving this problem that they'd be doing everything they can to get real emission cuts to 45% at least by 2030, or more. This also is something I don't quite understand and that is, okay, there's lots of risk here and lots of reward if we minimise the amount of warming that we are having. But it also makes good economic sense, if you can turn your industries around and start producing the sort of technologies that people are going to buy. I mean, Coal is already on the nose. Jonica Newby: I was going to say, I had a lot of cognitive dissonance, to use that technical term, during the COP talks because while you are over there in Madrid watching the politics unfold, we here in Sydney were gasping for breath, for starters, and certainly myself and a lot of people ended up, and I still do actually, feel like I've got flu symptoms, a lot of people hospitalised. And then on the very worst smoke-filled today I attended a summit where in fact not only did Matt Kean, the New South Wales Liberal minister, come out and say, 'This is climate change and we need to do something about it and here is my plan for the future economy,' which is setting up renewable hubs and moving forward that way, but that whole day was full of inspirational talks from various business leaders who were taking things well beyond just the idea that, yes, this can be a new economy, they were laying it out, how it's going to be, how we can transform to 500% renewables and export that energy, that renewable energy via hydrogen aluminium, which is a turning energy into product. And of course Mike\'c2 Cannon-Brookes' amazing cable to Asia which would connect our grids directly. So you had this juxtaposition of this apocalyptic grey scape outside, people wearing masks, inside were all these business leaders painting an economic future, and over in Madrid the national leadership was saying, nah, let's not do that. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: It's insane, isn't it. I mean, there were four standout countries; USA, Australia, Brazil and Saudi who had a huge impact on getting consensus. Jonica Newby: Do you think it would have made a difference if the Australians hadn't taken that stance? Well, I think if Australia and America had taken that stance, then I think it would have been a different flavour. There were many good Australians there doing their best but the leadership was playing a game and it's really interesting to ask why special interests that have such a grip on these parties, the information that's coming from science which is now impossible that it's not true. Jonica Newby: Do you struggle with this emotionally sometimes? Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: I do, I get frustrated. So I'm reading Jeremy Rifkin's book The Green New Deal , and it's very uplifting because you go, yes, this just needs a gentle nudge and to take a lot of the subsidies out of gas and oil and it's trillions of dollars each year that go to supporting these industries. And to redirect that into electrifying our cities and expanding our production and energy and so on, it just boggles the mind why you don't have this. But then you've just got to go back and look and see, yes, there was the Prime Minister, there was Minister Frydenberg with their lumps of coal, yes, they are trying to tell us that it's all about jobs. But we know from experience that in the very rapid growing renewable energy industry in Australia, that these new industries employ far more people than we have in coal, oil and gas. And I'm hoping that when you look at the polls and so on that we are seeing a big shift in the way Australians are seeing the issue. More than 50% are seeing the opportunity and wondering why we are not racing down that road, especially with Southeast Asia right next door, we're not setting ourselves up to have a roaring economy as this sort of international hub of embedded energy and new technologies. I mean, the chief scientist and his paper on hydrogen, truly inspirational. There are not too many things that need to be known, there's some storage issues and so on, but we could be the Middle East in terms of hydrogen, driving electrolysis of water, and splitting water and hydrogen using solar and wind in the large parts of Australia that actually don't have much else going on. Of course there is some very important desert ecology, but the opportunity here is huge. Robyn Williams: A huge opportunity indeed. The Science Show , Ove Hoegh-Guldberg with Jonica Newby. Jonica Newby: One of the things that prompted me, as you know, to be having conversations like this with people like you about climate grief or climate emotions was the experience of two years ago for me as a science reporter suddenly this abstract thing that I'd known about for decades called climate change became real and personal when I spent a lot of time researching what was going to happen to snow. And that was when it went from; yeah, yeah, yeah, I understand it's going to happen, it's terrible and we should be all up and fixing it and all the rest, and that it's like [gasp] now I know it in my bones what it really means. When did climate change get personal for you? Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: I think with the first major bleaching event in 1998. Jonica Newby: Oh, way back then. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: Yeah. So I did my PhD in California at UCLA, and I got a scholarship to come back to Australia to study the reefs around Lizard Island. This is in the mid-1980s. So I was coming out, I'd been studying the little plants that live inside corals and how their population dynamics are controlled, and it's interesting because it's one organism living inside another without actually taking it over and killing it. But then my professor had been, since probably about '84, receiving samples from the Caribbean of these weird white corals that are normally meant to be brown, but in places like Florida were turning a sudden brilliant white literally overnight. And it usually happened when the doldrums were on, so it's very still and it's very warm and it's very sunlit, and he was scratching his head trying to work out what was causing it. Was it a disease? Was it too much light? Was it temperature? Was it salty? Was it not salty enough? I sort of picked it up and when I was on Lizard Island for six months, which is great for anyone, in this beautiful paradise, I began trying to work out why they were going white. And it turned out that the only thing that would make corals go white consistently was literally one to two degrees of temperature increase above the summer maxima. A tiny increase in temperature and suddenly you had metres upon metres of coral reef turning white. So you only need one to two degrees and corals will go white. And then of course when you start to look at satellite records of sea temperature and so on, this was mapping almost perfectly where these places were that were bleaching. Jonica Newby: You say that realising that and researching it is the point where you felt it in your bones. I mean, that was an intellectual discovery. Did it hit emotionally then or did that come much later? Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: I'm a bit of a strange guy, as I said, I don't cry very easily. I do cry but it takes a lot. That was discovered at Lizard Island, and then we had this huge bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef and 50% of the corals in the shallows turned white. About 10% died across a really large area, that was quite a number of corals. And I did a very simple thing, I looked at when did these triggers go off, how hot did they have to become before they bleached. And then I added the expectant temperatures from climate models, in this case it was from CSIRO and the European Union, and so you've got the temperatures increasing, when do they get too hot for corals? And I was thinking it would be maybe 100, 200 years from now that would start to get to the point where every year would be too warm. And in 1999 I wrote this paper which put the sensitivity of corals into the climate trajectories and found out that with a doubling of CO2, we would have corals bleaching very severely by mid-century such that coral reefs would cease to exist as coral dominated reef systems. And I remember getting the first...so it was a really big spreadsheet and it had lots of numbers in it, and I calculated it, and I had a toddler and a daughter who was a young child, and I just remember leaning back and going, no, no, no, that's not possible, reefs disappearing by...no, let me do it again. I did it again, did it again, and sure enough, every time the temperature, all of these trajectories every time were going above what the corals were known to be able to survive by mid-century. So it was about that time when I published that paper and there were lots and lots of people saying it wasn't possible, but we tried and we tried and there was no other way to look at it. If the temperatures go up to this warm, then corals that we have today would bleach and probably die. And that's when it became real. And I think that's it, at that point it was really near. It's only 40 or 50 years from now, when I was thinking it would be more like 100 to 200 years. That I think woke me up. And yes, I'd been talking about it in previous stuff going right back to my PhD, but this was the moment of truth for me. And of course, it was funny, I published it, and just the number of people who thought I was an alarmist and all of that, this back-and-forth of people saying no, corals are much tougher, they'll adapt, they'll do this, you're a scaremonger. And unfortunately when you saw the event and 2016 and 2017 when not only did two-thirds of the reef bleach, but half of the shallow water corals died. This is a much larger number than the 1998 event, which was shocking in its own self. And then of course why are we waiting, almost...every year now we are rolling the dice to see whether the rest of the Great Barrier Reef will bleach and die. Some of it is coming back but a lot is not coming back fast enough. Jonica Newby: If we think of emotions around climate, you and I and you particularly are in the worst space emotionally because when you chose to study science, and in particular corals, decades ago, then you would have been caught up, I imagine, as we all were, in the whole beauty and marvel of everything that was being discovered about the natural world, but also you get to be part of it, you get to go and do your research in these incredible areas. And we entered these careers with a sense of wonder and constantly opening opportunities. And then within such a short amount of time you've had to deal with quite the opposite, the death of what I presume you fell in love with when you were younger. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: I was besotted. I went to the reef first in 1969 with my Danish grandparents. He was an entomologist after having been a doctor all his life, and was collecting Australian butterflies. So I went to Happy Bay, just off Mackay... Jonica Newby: I like the name, it's sounding good already, Happy Bay. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: It was. It was destroyed by cyclone the next year, so wasn't happy for very long, but it was beautiful. I've got almost a photographic memory for fish. So you know how people like Hugh Possingham go around spotting birds, I actually spend a lot of my time when I'm diving spotting fish. This beautiful copper banded butterfly fish which has a long elegant nose, it drifts across the reef picking little creatures out from between the coral branches and eating it, I still remember that fish, its every move. Jonica Newby: Was that the moment when you fell in love then? Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: I think it might have been, an early childhood romance. And then of course I'd been collecting butterflies because of my grandfather, and then I switched to actually saltwater fish. So I would capture all of these little fish that came down in the east Australian current, just like in Nemo , and you'd catch them in Manly or somewhere like that and you take them home to a fish tank and you'd grow them up, knowing that you'd saved their life because they were tropicals coming down the coast in the summer, when it got too cold in the winter they die. So I had 10, 15 tanks in my house, sea snakes, I had a penguin for a while. I used to work at Manly Marineland as a collector and aquarist and shark feeder. Jonica Newby: How old were you? Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: I was about 16 to about 22. When I was in university, it was in first year, and I went to the door of a famous fish ecologist called Peter Sale and banged on the door and literally said, 'Look, I know all my fish, I can do surveys, I can do whatever,' and he hired me. And so we went up to One Tree Island, which is off Gladstone, near Heron Island which people have heard about, and it's a complete scientific reserve where you have to have a permit to go into it as a scientist, and no one else...it hasn't been fished for decades, if at all. It's this tiny...it's about the size of two football ovals, the island, and you stay on this island and you are immersed in this ecology of seabirds and real sharks and turtles and all this sort of thing. And so it was deeply ingrained in me. And then I found out, yes, you can get a job doing this, and then at that point it was all over, all I wanted to do was to get into a PhD program studying fish or something similar and I'd be happy. And I have been happy, until now when of course that magic is being stubbed out by what seems to be a wilful disregard of science. Jonica Newby: Almost a disregard of love, isn't it. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: Yep, killed my girlfriend. Jonica Newby: Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: You're right about that. In fact when you think back it's even the subsets, so the island is nice, it's got great places to stay and it's wonderful. But I think having your feet bare, picking your way across the coral reef in the shallows, not treading on anything and looking at all the organisms and so on, I think that's the happiest day. Then there are other things that go on, that time I was standing with my son and we saw this huge tiger shark come into the Heron Island harbour, and it swam up the jetty looking at all the people, almost as if, 'Hmm, that one's good, that one is a bit fatty for me.' It got to the end and then swam off into the sea. And Christopher looked at me and he said, 'Dad, this is the happiest day of my life.' Jonica Newby: Oh, bless! Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: I know, isn't it, it makes you want to cry. But anyway, it was so sweet, he was probably six at the time. And my children of course...Sophie and I used to go up the reef every year when they were babies and toddlers because you didn't have to come back for school. And so we would go up there and they would disappear into the foliage and the beaches and everything and be gone up until sunset. And meanwhile we'd have time to do our science. These were lovely moments as well. Jonica Newby: I think corals are stunning, but my personal...the one I absolutely fell in love with was Australia's snow country. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: Yes! Jonica Newby: Not everyone will fall in love with that but everyone I speak to who is down there who lives there who has chosen that life have stories similar to the one you just told about falling in love with coral. It's a lifelong love affair. And it hurts. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: It really hurts also that you're not spending enough time with her or him, do you know what I mean? Jonica Newby: Oh, we're going to personify it completely now? It's hard not to, isn't it. Well, yeah. But I've been feeling most recently because the pace of things at the moment is so large, these reports are really trying to get people to think. So last year there was three or four major projects and I spent a lot of time downstairs in my office working, working, working. And in addition to feeling that I haven't really been fair to my children, I also think I haven't been fair to myself in that I haven't been diving for a while. And so I was talking to Christopher just the other day and saying, look, we've got to do it because I will get too old one day but because it is still there and it is still wonderful and you need to confirm and, in your words, you have to confirm your love, you've got to visit your love. Jonica Newby: I've reorganised my life a little so that I can spend more time in the snow. I'm hoping the snow will last longer than I'm afraid coral will, but I'm not confident. Robyn Williams: Dr Jonica Newby is with Professor Ove Hoegh-Guldberg in The Science Show on RN. Jonica Newby: This brings us to acceptance. I have certainly hit peak grief a couple of years ago but it is a rollercoaster, it comes and goes. Is this where you are, do you think, acceptance? Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: It's almost acceptance with a little bit of pushback, and that's a little bit of denial in the emotional sense, to say that no, no, no, we must have got this wrong, surely, surely, surely we haven't arrived now in this novel, which was written 30 years ago and it talked about runaway climate change and we ignored it and here we are and once upon a time we used to look at the movie The Day After Tomorrow But I do believe that...what if we discovered fusion at room temperature or some of these things that sound outlandish and suddenly could come to be. Suddenly you then have limitless energy, would we be smart enough to use that energy to replant, revegetate, repair the Earth? And some part of me says, yes, we would have been really frightened by that stage so we will take that opportunity and do those wonderful things. But 80% of the time I think I'm having myself on. Jonica Newby: Well, tell me, what is going to happen to coral, in what time frame, and how certain are you? Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: Around 2040 we will have reached half a degree above today, and at that point we will have 10% to 30% of the coral dominated reef left. If we then go a little bit further along that line, and this is not taking action, not coming up with solutions to rapidly reduce our emissions, we'll get to two degrees. And at that point we are unlikely to have much coral anywhere. Yes, there may be a few branches that survive in somewhat cooler spots than others, but you won't have the magnificence of the Great Barrier Reef, just like when you think about terrestrial forests and the risk there. But most of the old growth will have gone by then, the burning of the rainforests that became dry, which we've seen last year and this year. And again, I'm not very hopeful, I don't want to be dishonest, I mean, there are lots of people who will talk about techno optimism and so on, but that is probably not going to happen. So we are going to see things rise to about two degrees and we are going to see the Great Barrier Reef with a lot less coral and it will be arguably not the Great Barrier Reef. Jonica Newby: And just to clarify, when you said 2040, 0.5 degrees above today, that's the 1.5. Because we always have to remember we've already had one degree and then at two degrees that's another simply just one more degree over and above what we've got now. Coming back to this idea of acceptance, you have actually in some way emotionally accepted the reality that we are going to lose most, if not all the coral. But you leap out of bed and you've started going, right, let's save what we can. In other words, triage. Tell me about that. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: Sitting in Paris, the news was good. 1.5 was one of the targets, albeit the most ambitious. And then there was the idea that, okay, we're going to lose a lot of coral as we get to 1.5 degrees Celsius. I'm not sure how much. So what do we do? Do we just sit back and let the game play out and we end up with reefs with very little on it, or do we say, look, we can help these corals repopulate reefs in the future. This is where we've created this program called the 50 Reefs Project which we took 20 leading coral reef specialists and we asked them; what are the sort of conditions that determine whether coral reefs are in a place or not? Cool versus hot water, light, all of those sort of factors. And are there places in the ocean which are less exposed to climate change than others? So together with this really brilliant postdoc, actually there were two of them, Hawthorne Beyer and Emma Kennedy, we were able to identify 50 places on the planet that were least exposed to climate change through natural pooling processes, upwelling, currents. And we then have been essentially going through the logic of, okay, these are the places where coral will probably last the longest. They will also be the places from which coral will regenerate. So can we do something at a global scale to protect these areas so that we have the re-ignition points? It's really interesting. Once conditions stabilise, probably over 50, 100 years, corals will recirculate and re-sort themselves to a different temperature landscape. Corals that are used to hot water will be able to migrate to areas that are now warmer and so on and so forth. If that happens, then coral reefs actually do bounce back rather quickly. It takes about 15 to 20 years, but you've got to have some coral left to start with, that's what this 50 Reefs Project is about, identifying those sites that have a really good chance of surviving climate change and then protecting these places from pollution, overfishing and the normal non-climate stresses that coral reefs go through. And that was extremely uplifting. There was something we could do. And so we've now got a group of five NGOs, we've got people that are interested in supporting the project, and we're starting discussions with seven nations that have many of the BCUs, Indonesia, the Philippines, Solomon Islands, Fiji, Cuba, Tanzania, Madagascar. And these areas become focal points. And that's where you can leap out of bed because there is a logic behind it and there is a real long-term view that we have to have. Yes, we will lose a lot of corals along the way but they won't be wiped off the face of the Earth forever. Jonica Newby: And there has been some quite moonshot-ish types of technological fixes that Australians in particular, scientists, they've formed a sort of an emergency for coral and trialling heroic measures. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: This means that things like seeking heat tolerant corals, improving our ability to culture and release coral, all of these things have a lot of excitement around them. We have to realise though that they are only part of the solution. We must stabilise ocean conditions, and if we can do that, one could use these types of technologies to repopulate reef systems. Now, of course one problem that many of these projects are trying to tackle is how do you get these technologies to operate at scale. So at the moment it's very expensive to grow corals. Jonica Newby: They are reseeding some reef areas. I've heard people say, oh, it'll be fine, they'll reseed it. And I say it's the size of a football field, as opposed to the Great Barrier Reef which is the size of Italy. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: That's right, and it has the biodiversity of a radiata pine forest. You can only at this point do four or five corals at any one time and at any scale. Even that, given that there is 500 other species of corals, that there is almost a million species that live in and around coral reefs that you now have to somehow encourage to grow back into it. But as I said, this is a moment where we need all minds to try and find a solution. So one of the wonderful things about these attempts to grow corals at scale, and maybe they'll crack it, is that there is a huge industry of aquarium owners, places like Australia and the United States, grow corals in aquaria in their home. And a lot of these people have then gone out and started nurseries in Florida and other places. There's an opportunity there for bringing everyone around the table to solve the problem. And so that issue of scale is important, and of course the issue of time. Jonica Newby: How have they been trying to scale up? Because there have been attempts already. Yes, all sorts of things, there's new types of nurseries, so that when you put your corals out onto a reef it can be quite expensive to maintain them and so on, and they also get eaten by grazing fishes and other things. There was one group, I believe it was an Israeli and Filipino collaboration, who created something called the Rope Nursery where you take long pieces of rope and you untwist the major bits and you poke a little piece of coral in every couple of centimetres, close the strands back up...so it takes a few seconds to plant a coral. Then you take that rope and you anchor it offshore in deep water and you come back two years later or a year later and it's covered in corals. And then you take the rope and you then peg it down on a reef where the rope disappears, it's degradable, and the corals take over and there you have it. That took the cost of planting a coral from probably a couple of dollars to a couple of cents. Peter Harrison at Southern Cross University has been working on not only growing corals but then using robots, underwater drones, to go and deliver them to the reef. And he was up there in October, I had a chat with him and things are going very well. Again, it's not at the scale of tens of thousands of kilometres of coral reef, it's perhaps one or two hectares, but it's a start. Then the other side of this is how do we protect biodiversity on reefs and how do we regenerate it? So getting on with a project that has hope but not necessarily a sure bet really is important for me, and that is that you crash through. At the moment setting up a big program across seven nations and then aspiring to create the circumstances to regenerate the entire planet's coral reefs sounds like a big... Jonica Newby: It's a big vision. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: It is, it's a big vision, you've been drinking the cordial, you know. But I know that, I'm very comfortable with that. I tell a lot of my students that we live in a really exciting time. Yes, it's got some really big risks that are looming dark on us like Mordor. But on the other hand, we are at a time in human history like no other. We have six billion people in communication via smart phones and computers, we've got the ability to troubleshoot between any number of people. So this is a time of great challenge, it's a time of great opportunity to solve those problems. And this generation will see the most fundamental, wonderful things happen. And equally the real part of that is to say, yes, and you might also see the worst part of humanity... Jonica Newby: But that is the call to adventure, isn't it, the adventure is not... Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: That is the call to adventure, it's like come with me on this mission because we are going to solve this problem or die smiling and laughing while we try. And I'm really deliberately trying to back off and...I work like a Trojan at times doing these things, I have to keep on working, working, working, and I've got to get to that point where I can pull back and say we've done our best, we've had a lot of fun trying. And yeah, okay, it all got fucked up. Jonica Newby: Your vision is to get how many countries on board, corals worldwide? Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: 50 ultimately. Jonica Newby: That's a vision we can join and get behind. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: And with eight billion people you should be able to cover most things. Jonica Newby: Yeah, if we all catch one vision each and... Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: That's right, someone will look after the matchbox collection... Jonica Newby: Yes, in between laughs and drinks and good time with people we help bring about that vision. We have to be careful not to get exhausted as well. Do you think Australia might be somewhere near an emotional tipping point on climate change? Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: I do, and I don't put it past the darker forces to gain the upper hand again. You know, they say populations are split up into three segments. There's the top, rational, understand the problem, make decisions based on evidence, and then there's the bottom one which is where Craig Kelly and Andrew Bolt and all these ideologues who believe in an alternative universe, and then there's 60% in the middle of undecided Aussies who are worried about school fees and petrol. Those are the ones that are showing up in the polls now, those are the ones that are experiencing bushfires, the rural Australians outer big city dwellers and so on. So I actually do believe that we are at a tipping point. Perhaps if we see the rest of the Great Barrier Reef die or anything, we are firmly in the pocket where I think we now can act. There are many species of fish that are going to go extinct, and one of them is likely to be this little fish called the orange spotted filefish. It marries for life, lives in only one type of coral, and when the coral goes, the fish goes. So there's this beautiful little jewel. It's like an impressionist painting, it's worth a lot. So when we talk about losing this species, it's really like saying that all of van Gogh's paintings were put on a pyre and set fire to, that we just got rid of them. And we can't...a species is so valuable, that we can't talk about it as if it were a commodity that we could just get rid of with no consequence. That's where I think we're at. We've forgotten about what is beautiful and what is worth dying for I think. Robyn Williams: Professor of Marine Science Ove Hoegh-Guldberg who was with Dr Jonica Newby, formerly of Catalyst .

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia117","Climate grief","May 8, 2020 Friday","ABC Transcripts (Australia) Science Show 2:00 PM AEST","Robyn Williams: Climate's back. Never went away. Does it make you grieve? Most of today's Science Show is about corals and the Great Barrier Reef, a conversation with Professor Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, who loves it, and grieves for it. But we begin with Nick Rowley who is also saddened by the death of a great public servant and friend who died in April, Sir John Houghton who pioneered the understanding of climate science and led the IPCC. Nick Rowley was former adviser to the British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Nick Rowley: He may not be as well-known as David Attenborough, Greta Thunberg or Tim Flannery but his contribution both to our understanding of the climate system and helping establish the institutions and decisions required to reduce the risks of human induced climate change, is beyond compare. An unassuming, deeply religious and humble man, John's was a truly glittering career. Winning a scholarship to Oxford at the tender age of 16, John went on to become Professor of Atmospheric Physics there. Through the 1960s and '70s he built up a powerful research group at the university, developing new techniques for remote sensing of the atmosphere's temperature, structure and composition. This ground-breaking work gained the attention of NASA, with his team developing the instruments to establish space-based weather monitoring flown on the Nimbus satellites in the 1970s. This work enabled detailed studies of the structure and dynamics of the ozone layer, an ability to measure and model the radiative transfer of the Earth, and an understanding of the dynamics of the stratosphere. It was in 1983 that John really came into his element. As head of the UK Meteorological Office he developed his strong interest in climate science. During this time, John was part of a small group including the diplomat Sir Crispin Tickell and the scientist and environmental writer James Lovelock who held a series of briefings with then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on the risk posed by what was then called the greenhouse effect. In September 1988, Thatcher gave the first speech by any head of state on climate change. Informed by her meetings involving John, her Royal Society Speech at Fishmongers Hall in London first set out the importance of basic science informing policy and then turned to the threat posed by climate change and what she called an unwittingly 'massive experiment with the system of this planet itself'. In April 1989 the Prime Minister then held a day-long seminar on the subject with her full Cabinet at Downing Street. Unlike so many of today's political class, having studied chemistry at university, Margaret Thatcher was a leader at ease with science who thrived on understanding the arguments and the facts. On December 8th 1989 came her seminal speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Years before vicious climate events such as the European heatwave of 2003 or Hurricane Katrina hitting New Orleans in 2005, this was a fantastic speech. There is no better example of the political foresight and leadership required to respond to what scientific expertise revealed. And her placing the issue squarely on the international agenda was ably supported by John. Thatcher was convinced that the global warming hypothesis was clear, and Britain had a responsibility to lead. Opened by Thatcher in May 1990, John became the first director of the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research, soon regarded as the world centre of scientific excellence in the collation and interpretation of global atmospheric data. By this time he was also a key member of the newly established Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. John was chair or co-chair of the IPCC's scientific assessment working group until 2002 and the lead editor of the first three IPCC reports. There is always another major report to read on climate change, but I would encourage anyone with an interest to go back and read the executive summary of that first assessment report released in 1990. Thirty years have now passed. Sadly, measurements reveal that over those 30 years the atmosphere has been warming at a rate between the higher and middle predictions. And if the world doesn't re-double efforts to reduce emissions at scale, we are on a trajectory to around four degrees of warming by the end of the century: a truly dystopian prospect. In 2007, on behalf of the panel, Sir John accepted the Nobel Peace Prize that was shared by the IPCC and former US Vice President Al Gore. Just prior to this, for two years I was fortunate to work at Downing Street advising Tony Blair on sustainability and climate change. This was before Hurricane Katrina, before Al Gore's documentary An Inconvenient Truth . With the UK having the G8 Presidency in 2005, Blair was also convinced that climate change was both real and required an urgent response. Like his conservative predecessor, Tony Blair too was eager to present the case and achieve progress on the international response. For him it was only heads of state with their responsibility for environment, transport, energy and economic policy that could take the truly consequential national and international decisions required to reduce emissions at scale. Although John had then retired, he and I spoke, and I drew on his advice frequently. More than one of the world's most highly regarded climate scientists, John truly understood the 'hidden wiring' of Whitehall. And him no longer being in any prescribed job, he could speak candidly and be direct. In this informal role, John worked tirelessly to assist the UK diplomatic case with the United States. With President George W Bush close to leading US evangelicals, John Houghton gave evidence in the Senate and made the ethical case that stewardship of the environment and taking decisions in the interests of future generations was the moral responsibility of all Christians. And he was more than the scientist in government. Originally published in 1994, his Global Warming remains the best introduction for anyone wanting to understand climate science. With his leadership, Sir John Houghton did more than inspire a generation of scientists. No one has more successfully and effectively traversed the world of cutting-edge science, domestic and international climate politics, and the institutions and policies required to reduce climate risk. His combination of scientific rigour, humanism and political nous made him truly formidable. Years after I returned to Australia, John and I continued to correspond. After hearing of his passing last month following complications resulting from COVID-19, I looked back through his e-mails to me and came to the last one. The final words stand as an epitaph to a man who was truly a scientific and policy giant: Nick, I agree with you completely about hope.There are the deniers who are beyond hope.There are the doomsters who see no hope.In between there is lots to hope for!And there is ever so much we can do, if only we got on with it! Best regards - John Robyn Williams: That tribute to Sir John Houghton, who died in April, was from Nick Rowley, former adviser to Prime Minister Tony Blair and former Premier of New South Wales Bob Carr. The Science Show on RN, where today we start a series of conversations about climate and emotions. Yes, scientists are not unfeeling dweebs, not the ones I know. They are passionate about their research and nature, not least when it's in jeopardy. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg is a marine scientist at the University of Queensland. He's with Dr Jonica Newby, formerly of Catalyst . Jonica Newby: Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: Jonica Newby: A level of grief rather than anger, denial, depression, acceptance, any of those. I'm not really comfortable with becoming angry because I've been part of the problem, along with you and everyone else. If I was a child I'd be angry. What the parents have done to the planet that they have to inherit is pretty awful. That's a standard thing to say nowadays but it really does come home to you. Given the dramatic demonstrations of what the planet might be headed towards and the fact that we don't take this next decade extremely seriously, I would imagine I'd start to feel angry. Jonica Newby: How old are your kids now? Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: 21 and 24. Jonica Newby: What emotions do they express about climate? Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: They're very practical, they want to do something to help avert disaster. Fiona, for example, is looking around to do a Masters in sustainability. She curiously was studying the glossy black cockatoo from Kangaroo Island where there are only 21 nesting pairs left, and of course a third of that island has burnt now, and there is grave fears for that. Again, she is very practical and very optimistic. I think she's got a personality a bit like mine where it's almost you transition beyond grief because that's not useful. You have to keep pushing on this. Christopher loves nature, he loves diving, and I think he too gets anxious, thinking that what Dad has been talking about now turns out to be pretty worrying. And I think that's where everyone is. I think the entire nation is shocked, the world is shocked that we are spiralling potentially out of control here. Jonica Newby: Well, if you look at traditional stages of grief, and I know that that's not universally accepted of course but it's useful, I think of you and people like you who've been on the climate frontline for so long, you've almost, as you say, had to go through those really deep grief feelings and hit acceptance. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: Yes, you're right about that. There was a real hope I think 30 years ago when we were starting to realise what was happening, that we could turn things around, that it wasn't as serious as we thought. And of course 30 years later now we find out that it's extremely serious, and we've done nothing about it. The performance indicator of course is the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. It's been going up at ever faster rates, so whatever we are doing, it ain't working. Jonica Newby: Well, your last three months have been pretty tumultuous. You had a paper published in Science which looked at actual tipping points I suppose and why we need to stop and stabilise the climate at 1.5 degrees, which is another 0.5, that's all. And then you went to the COP25 round of talks in Madrid which was supposed to see our way forward to reducing that carbon dioxide that you mentioned. And then you came home to Australia on fire. So how has that been? Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: Yes, it's been a whirlwind of trouble. We had Christmas out near Oberon on the western slopes, and like many Australians we were watching the skies, seeing the sun go down to this little golden orb, this dense smog that was coming off everything. Three of the four siblings and our families. And then realising that this house we are in backs up against the bush, it's not so far from the Jenolan Caves fires, and you've got things like my grandfather's slide collection which goes back to the 1920s, he was a photographer for most of his life, and my father's slide collection there, vulnerable in this beautiful wooded house. And so we decided that we would, at the end of the Christmas break, take them to Sydney and to Parkes and to bigger cities because it is very likely that that area will burn. I don't want to be a scaremonger here but that's the sort of reality I think we are all facing, people who thought they were well away from any harm now find themselves with a fair risk of being harmed. And so this I think is coming home...as a scientist I worry about the feedback loops, the idea that as you burn more forests you take up less CO2, you've got drier forests that then are more likely to build up dry tinder that then in heatwave conditions will then catch fire and so on. All of this is very visceral and real now. It once used to be in the IPCC reports that I've been involved in over time where the science consensus on climate change is found, often mentioned there will be an earlier start to the bushfire season, fires will burn for longer and hotter because of drought out of this dry scientific process is actually now something we are starting to live. And this I think is why there is a bit of a shock and grief here because it's like we have forgone the opportunity to turn this around. If during the '80s when lots of scientists were coming in with very worrying news, if we had acted then, the scale of the problem would have been four times less, less to deal with in terms of emissions than what we are dealing with today. And so we are really pushing ourselves. And of course you mentioned tipping points. Again, this is stuff you read, it's in these scientific documents, the idea that you get to a point where sudden change occurs, a little push, it's the straw that broke the camel's back, the melting of the tundra and the feedback loop of methane, loss of the Arctic sea ice, the melting of Iceland's and Greenland's ice sheets, you name it, they are all part of not just linear change, these things are starting to escalate because they are feeding back on themselves, and that to me is a worry. Now, if you'd said that 10 years ago, even the scientists would have said, look, it's a distinct possibility but it's a high impact, low probability event. Well, it turns out that those high impact events may not be as low probability as we thought. Jonica Newby: Well, this brings us to what you were addressing in the Science article. Can you just tell me what that was about and what prompted it? Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: Well, the paper is about the human imperative to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and it came from a group of us coming out of the IPCC special report on 1.5 degrees Celsius, this is the more ambitious Paris Agreement goal. The messages from this are that we are approaching tipping points, major changes in the Earth system which have direct threats to humans, communities, ecosystems, the whole box and dice. And so, again, I'm going back to my own community, saying we almost got used to writing about this stuff to the point where we are no longer taking in the significance that once things start to go, they go. The 1.5 degrees Celsius paper was really interesting... Jonica Newby: Because that was thought to be a relatively 'safe'... Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: That's right, and coming out of the Paris Agreement that came in December 2015, I think up until that point most of us felt that that was a significant level of warming, it had many risks attached to it. But if you'd said that five years before, that small amount of warming was something we were going to try and aim for, people would have dismissed you as being alarmist, that no, we could do two to three degrees. We have barely come out the other side of the half a degree from the 1950s to today, we are barely coming out of that from half a degree to a full degree above the preindustrial period without real threats. You think of what's happens to the Great Barrier Reef, what's happened to the Amazon, what's happened to Australia's forests, what's happening with large storm systems, inundation. We already have a world that is rapidly becoming unmanageable, and now we're going to do another half a degree. The other part of this paper also pointed out the fact that adding another half a degree wasn't just simply adding what we saw from 1950 to present, it was most likely to be a greater change per half a degree, because what we are doing is we're pushing systems-be they economic, natural, human-we are pushing systems further away from their comfort point, and that means that when you have that extra half a degree from one degree to 1.5 degrees above the preindustrial period, you're getting more than you got in the previous 0.5 of a degree. And I think that's something that we are waking up to with this current crisis here in Australia. We are seeing non-linear change. We've been coasting along, the fire seasons have been getting stronger and stronger and now suddenly they are way beyond any linearist extrapolation, that's scores of time larger in impact per warming than we've had in the past. And I saw a graph the other day that had been put together which showed the sort of area burned and so on as a measure of the impact of a fire season going back to the '60s. If you can imagine it's bumbling around here and then you have something like the ones in 2010 I think it was, and there's ones that go back in time to the '60s. Would but when you get to what has happened over this fire season it dwarfs everything, it's scores times higher. What happens next year? Not to scare people, but we still don't have politicians who actually understand what has to happen here. Jonica Newby: But just to COP25 , which was the round of talks in Madrid that was supposed to cement international commitments to Paris, what was it like being there Ove? I spoke to you just before you left and you were a little bit despondent. What was it like being there? Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: Well, I was right to be despondent. Fortunately or unfortunately I had gone through the Copenhagen COP which had great billing and everyone was going to make a difference, and it was largely unsuccessful. And it was the Paris Agreement that reignited hope because the targets were in a process that looked like it could actually get the ratification of countries and get them acting together to solve this problem. And then of course the beginnings of trouble, if you like, was the fact that it had to move suddenly from Santiago to Madrid. Jonica Newby: And why was that? Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: Civil unrest got to a point where they couldn't hold a meeting safely. So with all the presidents and prime ministers and diplomats and so on turning up...oh, and of course the scientists... Jonica Newby: Oh, who cares if they're safe! Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: You can always go and get another bunch. Anyway, so that move was disruptive and they still went on with the same schedule. And going into that conference it felt very much like Copenhagen, there wasn't the optimism that you saw in Paris, there wasn't commitment, there wasn't rush forward to make this happen as it should in terms of this being a global emergency. And I ended up being involved in five or six events. I lost the wind in my sails, it was all very depressing. I don't know, I don't cry... Jonica Newby: Did you when our Science Minister...sorry, Energy Minister, put his two cents worth in? Angus Taylor. I just don't know what motivates these people. At the moment, carryover credits from Kyoto, this is sort of business as usual. One would think if they were sincere about solving this problem that they'd be doing everything they can to get real emission cuts to 45% at least by 2030, or more. This also is something I don't quite understand and that is, okay, there's lots of risk here and lots of reward if we minimise the amount of warming that we are having. But it also makes good economic sense, if you can turn your industries around and start producing the sort of technologies that people are going to buy. I mean, Coal is already on the nose. Jonica Newby: I was going to say, I had a lot of cognitive dissonance, to use that technical term, during the COP talks because while you are over there in Madrid watching the politics unfold, we here in Sydney were gasping for breath, for starters, and certainly myself and a lot of people ended up, and I still do actually, feel like I've got flu symptoms, a lot of people hospitalised. And then on the very worst smoke-filled today I attended a summit where in fact not only did Matt Kean, the New South Wales Liberal minister, come out and say, 'This is climate change and we need to do something about it and here is my plan for the future economy,' which is setting up renewable hubs and moving forward that way, but that whole day was full of inspirational talks from various business leaders who were taking things well beyond just the idea that, yes, this can be a new economy, they were laying it out, how it's going to be, how we can transform to 500% renewables and export that energy, that renewable energy via hydrogen aluminium, which is a turning energy into product. And of course Mike\'c2 Cannon-Brookes' amazing cable to Asia which would connect our grids directly. So you had this juxtaposition of this apocalyptic grey scape outside, people wearing masks, inside were all these business leaders painting an economic future, and over in Madrid the national leadership was saying, nah, let's not do that. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: It's insane, isn't it. I mean, there were four standout countries; USA, Australia, Brazil and Saudi who had a huge impact on getting consensus. Jonica Newby: Do you think it would have made a difference if the Australians hadn't taken that stance? Well, I think if Australia and America had taken that stance, then I think it would have been a different flavour. There were many good Australians there doing their best but the leadership was playing a game and it's really interesting to ask why special interests that have such a grip on these parties, the information that's coming from science which is now impossible that it's not true. Jonica Newby: Do you struggle with this emotionally sometimes? Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: I do, I get frustrated. So I'm reading Jeremy Rifkin's book The Green New Deal , and it's very uplifting because you go, yes, this just needs a gentle nudge and to take a lot of the subsidies out of gas and oil and it's trillions of dollars each year that go to supporting these industries. And to redirect that into electrifying our cities and expanding our production and energy and so on, it just boggles the mind why you don't have this. But then you've just got to go back and look and see, yes, there was the Prime Minister, there was Minister Frydenberg with their lumps of coal, yes, they are trying to tell us that it's all about jobs. But we know from experience that in the very rapid growing renewable energy industry in Australia, that these new industries employ far more people than we have in coal, oil and gas. And I'm hoping that when you look at the polls and so on that we are seeing a big shift in the way Australians are seeing the issue. More than 50% are seeing the opportunity and wondering why we are not racing down that road, especially with Southeast Asia right next door, we're not setting ourselves up to have a roaring economy as this sort of international hub of embedded energy and new technologies. I mean, the chief scientist and his paper on hydrogen, truly inspirational. There are not too many things that need to be known, there's some storage issues and so on, but we could be the Middle East in terms of hydrogen, driving electrolysis of water, and splitting water and hydrogen using solar and wind in the large parts of Australia that actually don't have much else going on. Of course there is some very important desert ecology, but the opportunity here is huge. Robyn Williams: A huge opportunity indeed. The Science Show , Ove Hoegh-Guldberg with Jonica Newby. Jonica Newby: One of the things that prompted me, as you know, to be having conversations like this with people like you about climate grief or climate emotions was the experience of two years ago for me as a science reporter suddenly this abstract thing that I'd known about for decades called climate change became real and personal when I spent a lot of time researching what was going to happen to snow. And that was when it went from; yeah, yeah, yeah, I understand it's going to happen, it's terrible and we should be all up and fixing it and all the rest, and that it's like [gasp] now I know it in my bones what it really means. When did climate change get personal for you? Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: I think with the first major bleaching event in 1998. Jonica Newby: Oh, way back then. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: Yeah. So I did my PhD in California at UCLA, and I got a scholarship to come back to Australia to study the reefs around Lizard Island. This is in the mid-1980s. So I was coming out, I'd been studying the little plants that live inside corals and how their population dynamics are controlled, and it's interesting because it's one organism living inside another without actually taking it over and killing it. But then my professor had been, since probably about '84, receiving samples from the Caribbean of these weird white corals that are normally meant to be brown, but in places like Florida were turning a sudden brilliant white literally overnight. And it usually happened when the doldrums were on, so it's very still and it's very warm and it's very sunlit, and he was scratching his head trying to work out what was causing it. Was it a disease? Was it too much light? Was it temperature? Was it salty? Was it not salty enough? I sort of picked it up and when I was on Lizard Island for six months, which is great for anyone, in this beautiful paradise, I began trying to work out why they were going white. And it turned out that the only thing that would make corals go white consistently was literally one to two degrees of temperature increase above the summer maxima. A tiny increase in temperature and suddenly you had metres upon metres of coral reef turning white. So you only need one to two degrees and corals will go white. And then of course when you start to look at satellite records of sea temperature and so on, this was mapping almost perfectly where these places were that were bleaching. Jonica Newby: You say that realising that and researching it is the point where you felt it in your bones. I mean, that was an intellectual discovery. Did it hit emotionally then or did that come much later? Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: I'm a bit of a strange guy, as I said, I don't cry very easily. I do cry but it takes a lot. That was discovered at Lizard Island, and then we had this huge bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef and 50% of the corals in the shallows turned white. About 10% died across a really large area, that was quite a number of corals. And I did a very simple thing, I looked at when did these triggers go off, how hot did they have to become before they bleached. And then I added the expectant temperatures from climate models, in this case it was from CSIRO and the European Union, and so you've got the temperatures increasing, when do they get too hot for corals? And I was thinking it would be maybe 100, 200 years from now that would start to get to the point where every year would be too warm. And in 1999 I wrote this paper which put the sensitivity of corals into the climate trajectories and found out that with a doubling of CO2, we would have corals bleaching very severely by mid-century such that coral reefs would cease to exist as coral dominated reef systems. And I remember getting the first...so it was a really big spreadsheet and it had lots of numbers in it, and I calculated it, and I had a toddler and a daughter who was a young child, and I just remember leaning back and going, no, no, no, that's not possible, reefs disappearing by...no, let me do it again. I did it again, did it again, and sure enough, every time the temperature, all of these trajectories every time were going above what the corals were known to be able to survive by mid-century. So it was about that time when I published that paper and there were lots and lots of people saying it wasn't possible, but we tried and we tried and there was no other way to look at it. If the temperatures go up to this warm, then corals that we have today would bleach and probably die. And that's when it became real. And I think that's it, at that point it was really near. It's only 40 or 50 years from now, when I was thinking it would be more like 100 to 200 years. That I think woke me up. And yes, I'd been talking about it in previous stuff going right back to my PhD, but this was the moment of truth for me. And of course, it was funny, I published it, and just the number of people who thought I was an alarmist and all of that, this back-and-forth of people saying no, corals are much tougher, they'll adapt, they'll do this, you're a scaremonger. And unfortunately when you saw the event and 2016 and 2017 when not only did two-thirds of the reef bleach, but half of the shallow water corals died. This is a much larger number than the 1998 event, which was shocking in its own self. And then of course why are we waiting, almost...every year now we are rolling the dice to see whether the rest of the Great Barrier Reef will bleach and die. Some of it is coming back but a lot is not coming back fast enough. Jonica Newby: If we think of emotions around climate, you and I and you particularly are in the worst space emotionally because when you chose to study science, and in particular corals, decades ago, then you would have been caught up, I imagine, as we all were, in the whole beauty and marvel of everything that was being discovered about the natural world, but also you get to be part of it, you get to go and do your research in these incredible areas. And we entered these careers with a sense of wonder and constantly opening opportunities. And then within such a short amount of time you've had to deal with quite the opposite, the death of what I presume you fell in love with when you were younger. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: I was besotted. I went to the reef first in 1969 with my Danish grandparents. He was an entomologist after having been a doctor all his life, and was collecting Australian butterflies. So I went to Happy Bay, just off Mackay... Jonica Newby: I like the name, it's sounding good already, Happy Bay. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: It was. It was destroyed by cyclone the next year, so wasn't happy for very long, but it was beautiful. I've got almost a photographic memory for fish. So you know how people like Hugh Possingham go around spotting birds, I actually spend a lot of my time when I'm diving spotting fish. This beautiful copper banded butterfly fish which has a long elegant nose, it drifts across the reef picking little creatures out from between the coral branches and eating it, I still remember that fish, its every move. Jonica Newby: Was that the moment when you fell in love then? Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: I think it might have been, an early childhood romance. And then of course I'd been collecting butterflies because of my grandfather, and then I switched to actually saltwater fish. So I would capture all of these little fish that came down in the east Australian current, just like in Nemo , and you'd catch them in Manly or somewhere like that and you take them home to a fish tank and you'd grow them up, knowing that you'd saved their life because they were tropicals coming down the coast in the summer, when it got too cold in the winter they die. So I had 10, 15 tanks in my house, sea snakes, I had a penguin for a while. I used to work at Manly Marineland as a collector and aquarist and shark feeder. Jonica Newby: How old were you? Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: I was about 16 to about 22. When I was in university, it was in first year, and I went to the door of a famous fish ecologist called Peter Sale and banged on the door and literally said, 'Look, I know all my fish, I can do surveys, I can do whatever,' and he hired me. And so we went up to One Tree Island, which is off Gladstone, near Heron Island which people have heard about, and it's a complete scientific reserve where you have to have a permit to go into it as a scientist, and no one else...it hasn't been fished for decades, if at all. It's this tiny...it's about the size of two football ovals, the island, and you stay on this island and you are immersed in this ecology of seabirds and real sharks and turtles and all this sort of thing. And so it was deeply ingrained in me. And then I found out, yes, you can get a job doing this, and then at that point it was all over, all I wanted to do was to get into a PhD program studying fish or something similar and I'd be happy. And I have been happy, until now when of course that magic is being stubbed out by what seems to be a wilful disregard of science. Jonica Newby: Almost a disregard of love, isn't it. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: Yep, killed my girlfriend. Jonica Newby: Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: You're right about that. In fact when you think back it's even the subsets, so the island is nice, it's got great places to stay and it's wonderful. But I think having your feet bare, picking your way across the coral reef in the shallows, not treading on anything and looking at all the organisms and so on, I think that's the happiest day. Then there are other things that go on, that time I was standing with my son and we saw this huge tiger shark come into the Heron Island harbour, and it swam up the jetty looking at all the people, almost as if, 'Hmm, that one's good, that one is a bit fatty for me.' It got to the end and then swam off into the sea. And Christopher looked at me and he said, 'Dad, this is the happiest day of my life.' Jonica Newby: Oh, bless! Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: I know, isn't it, it makes you want to cry. But anyway, it was so sweet, he was probably six at the time. And my children of course...Sophie and I used to go up the reef every year when they were babies and toddlers because you didn't have to come back for school. And so we would go up there and they would disappear into the foliage and the beaches and everything and be gone up until sunset. And meanwhile we'd have time to do our science. These were lovely moments as well. Jonica Newby: I think corals are stunning, but my personal...the one I absolutely fell in love with was Australia's snow country. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: Yes! Jonica Newby: Not everyone will fall in love with that but everyone I speak to who is down there who lives there who has chosen that life have stories similar to the one you just told about falling in love with coral. It's a lifelong love affair. And it hurts. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: It really hurts also that you're not spending enough time with her or him, do you know what I mean? Jonica Newby: Oh, we're going to personify it completely now? It's hard not to, isn't it. Well, yeah. But I've been feeling most recently because the pace of things at the moment is so large, these reports are really trying to get people to think. So last year there was three or four major projects and I spent a lot of time downstairs in my office working, working, working. And in addition to feeling that I haven't really been fair to my children, I also think I haven't been fair to myself in that I haven't been diving for a while. And so I was talking to Christopher just the other day and saying, look, we've got to do it because I will get too old one day but because it is still there and it is still wonderful and you need to confirm and, in your words, you have to confirm your love, you've got to visit your love. Jonica Newby: I've reorganised my life a little so that I can spend more time in the snow. I'm hoping the snow will last longer than I'm afraid coral will, but I'm not confident. Robyn Williams: Dr Jonica Newby is with Professor Ove Hoegh-Guldberg in The Science Show on RN. Jonica Newby: This brings us to acceptance. I have certainly hit peak grief a couple of years ago but it is a rollercoaster, it comes and goes. Is this where you are, do you think, acceptance? Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: It's almost acceptance with a little bit of pushback, and that's a little bit of denial in the emotional sense, to say that no, no, no, we must have got this wrong, surely, surely, surely we haven't arrived now in this novel, which was written 30 years ago and it talked about runaway climate change and we ignored it and here we are and once upon a time we used to look at the movie The Day After Tomorrow But I do believe that...what if we discovered fusion at room temperature or some of these things that sound outlandish and suddenly could come to be. Suddenly you then have limitless energy, would we be smart enough to use that energy to replant, revegetate, repair the Earth? And some part of me says, yes, we would have been really frightened by that stage so we will take that opportunity and do those wonderful things. But 80% of the time I think I'm having myself on. Jonica Newby: Well, tell me, what is going to happen to coral, in what time frame, and how certain are you? Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: Around 2040 we will have reached half a degree above today, and at that point we will have 10% to 30% of the coral dominated reef left. If we then go a little bit further along that line, and this is not taking action, not coming up with solutions to rapidly reduce our emissions, we'll get to two degrees. And at that point we are unlikely to have much coral anywhere. Yes, there may be a few branches that survive in somewhat cooler spots than others, but you won't have the magnificence of the Great Barrier Reef, just like when you think about terrestrial forests and the risk there. But most of the old growth will have gone by then, the burning of the rainforests that became dry, which we've seen last year and this year. And again, I'm not very hopeful, I don't want to be dishonest, I mean, there are lots of people who will talk about techno optimism and so on, but that is probably not going to happen. So we are going to see things rise to about two degrees and we are going to see the Great Barrier Reef with a lot less coral and it will be arguably not the Great Barrier Reef. Jonica Newby: And just to clarify, when you said 2040, 0.5 degrees above today, that's the 1.5. Because we always have to remember we've already had one degree and then at two degrees that's another simply just one more degree over and above what we've got now. Coming back to this idea of acceptance, you have actually in some way emotionally accepted the reality that we are going to lose most, if not all the coral. But you leap out of bed and you've started going, right, let's save what we can. In other words, triage. Tell me about that. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: Sitting in Paris, the news was good. 1.5 was one of the targets, albeit the most ambitious. And then there was the idea that, okay, we're going to lose a lot of coral as we get to 1.5 degrees Celsius. I'm not sure how much. So what do we do? Do we just sit back and let the game play out and we end up with reefs with very little on it, or do we say, look, we can help these corals repopulate reefs in the future. This is where we've created this program called the 50 Reefs Project which we took 20 leading coral reef specialists and we asked them; what are the sort of conditions that determine whether coral reefs are in a place or not? Cool versus hot water, light, all of those sort of factors. And are there places in the ocean which are less exposed to climate change than others? So together with this really brilliant postdoc, actually there were two of them, Hawthorne Beyer and Emma Kennedy, we were able to identify 50 places on the planet that were least exposed to climate change through natural pooling processes, upwelling, currents. And we then have been essentially going through the logic of, okay, these are the places where coral will probably last the longest. They will also be the places from which coral will regenerate. So can we do something at a global scale to protect these areas so that we have the re-ignition points? It's really interesting. Once conditions stabilise, probably over 50, 100 years, corals will recirculate and re-sort themselves to a different temperature landscape. Corals that are used to hot water will be able to migrate to areas that are now warmer and so on and so forth. If that happens, then coral reefs actually do bounce back rather quickly. It takes about 15 to 20 years, but you've got to have some coral left to start with, that's what this 50 Reefs Project is about, identifying those sites that have a really good chance of surviving climate change and then protecting these places from pollution, overfishing and the normal non-climate stresses that coral reefs go through. And that was extremely uplifting. There was something we could do. And so we've now got a group of five NGOs, we've got people that are interested in supporting the project, and we're starting discussions with seven nations that have many of the BCUs, Indonesia, the Philippines, Solomon Islands, Fiji, Cuba, Tanzania, Madagascar. And these areas become focal points. And that's where you can leap out of bed because there is a logic behind it and there is a real long-term view that we have to have. Yes, we will lose a lot of corals along the way but they won't be wiped off the face of the Earth forever. Jonica Newby: And there has been some quite moonshot-ish types of technological fixes that Australians in particular, scientists, they've formed a sort of an emergency for coral and trialling heroic measures. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: This means that things like seeking heat tolerant corals, improving our ability to culture and release coral, all of these things have a lot of excitement around them. We have to realise though that they are only part of the solution. We must stabilise ocean conditions, and if we can do that, one could use these types of technologies to repopulate reef systems. Now, of course one problem that many of these projects are trying to tackle is how do you get these technologies to operate at scale. So at the moment it's very expensive to grow corals. Jonica Newby: They are reseeding some reef areas. I've heard people say, oh, it'll be fine, they'll reseed it. And I say it's the size of a football field, as opposed to the Great Barrier Reef which is the size of Italy. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: That's right, and it has the biodiversity of a radiata pine forest. You can only at this point do four or five corals at any one time and at any scale. Even that, given that there is 500 other species of corals, that there is almost a million species that live in and around coral reefs that you now have to somehow encourage to grow back into it. But as I said, this is a moment where we need all minds to try and find a solution. So one of the wonderful things about these attempts to grow corals at scale, and maybe they'll crack it, is that there is a huge industry of aquarium owners, places like Australia and the United States, grow corals in aquaria in their home. And a lot of these people have then gone out and started nurseries in Florida and other places. There's an opportunity there for bringing everyone around the table to solve the problem. And so that issue of scale is important, and of course the issue of time. Jonica Newby: How have they been trying to scale up? Because there have been attempts already. Yes, all sorts of things, there's new types of nurseries, so that when you put your corals out onto a reef it can be quite expensive to maintain them and so on, and they also get eaten by grazing fishes and other things. There was one group, I believe it was an Israeli and Filipino collaboration, who created something called the Rope Nursery where you take long pieces of rope and you untwist the major bits and you poke a little piece of coral in every couple of centimetres, close the strands back up...so it takes a few seconds to plant a coral. Then you take that rope and you anchor it offshore in deep water and you come back two years later or a year later and it's covered in corals. And then you take the rope and you then peg it down on a reef where the rope disappears, it's degradable, and the corals take over and there you have it. That took the cost of planting a coral from probably a couple of dollars to a couple of cents. Peter Harrison at Southern Cross University has been working on not only growing corals but then using robots, underwater drones, to go and deliver them to the reef. And he was up there in October, I had a chat with him and things are going very well. Again, it's not at the scale of tens of thousands of kilometres of coral reef, it's perhaps one or two hectares, but it's a start. Then the other side of this is how do we protect biodiversity on reefs and how do we regenerate it? So getting on with a project that has hope but not necessarily a sure bet really is important for me, and that is that you crash through. At the moment setting up a big program across seven nations and then aspiring to create the circumstances to regenerate the entire planet's coral reefs sounds like a big... Jonica Newby: It's a big vision. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: It is, it's a big vision, you've been drinking the cordial, you know. But I know that, I'm very comfortable with that. I tell a lot of my students that we live in a really exciting time. Yes, it's got some really big risks that are looming dark on us like Mordor. But on the other hand, we are at a time in human history like no other. We have six billion people in communication via smart phones and computers, we've got the ability to troubleshoot between any number of people. So this is a time of great challenge, it's a time of great opportunity to solve those problems. And this generation will see the most fundamental, wonderful things happen. And equally the real part of that is to say, yes, and you might also see the worst part of humanity... Jonica Newby: But that is the call to adventure, isn't it, the adventure is not... Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: That is the call to adventure, it's like come with me on this mission because we are going to solve this problem or die smiling and laughing while we try. And I'm really deliberately trying to back off and...I work like a Trojan at times doing these things, I have to keep on working, working, working, and I've got to get to that point where I can pull back and say we've done our best, we've had a lot of fun trying. And yeah, okay, it all got fucked up. Jonica Newby: Your vision is to get how many countries on board, corals worldwide? Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: 50 ultimately. Jonica Newby: That's a vision we can join and get behind. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: And with eight billion people you should be able to cover most things. Jonica Newby: Yeah, if we all catch one vision each and... Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: That's right, someone will look after the matchbox collection... Jonica Newby: Yes, in between laughs and drinks and good time with people we help bring about that vision. We have to be careful not to get exhausted as well. Do you think Australia might be somewhere near an emotional tipping point on climate change? Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: I do, and I don't put it past the darker forces to gain the upper hand again. You know, they say populations are split up into three segments. There's the top, rational, understand the problem, make decisions based on evidence, and then there's the bottom one which is where Craig Kelly and Andrew Bolt and all these ideologues who believe in an alternative universe, and then there's 60% in the middle of undecided Aussies who are worried about school fees and petrol. Those are the ones that are showing up in the polls now, those are the ones that are experiencing bushfires, the rural Australians outer big city dwellers and so on. So I actually do believe that we are at a tipping point. Perhaps if we see the rest of the Great Barrier Reef die or anything, we are firmly in the pocket where I think we now can act. There are many species of fish that are going to go extinct, and one of them is likely to be this little fish called the orange spotted filefish. It marries for life, lives in only one type of coral, and when the coral goes, the fish goes. So there's this beautiful little jewel. It's like an impressionist painting, it's worth a lot. So when we talk about losing this species, it's really like saying that all of van Gogh's paintings were put on a pyre and set fire to, that we just got rid of them. And we can't...a species is so valuable, that we can't talk about it as if it were a commodity that we could just get rid of with no consequence. That's where I think we're at. We've forgotten about what is beautiful and what is worth dying for I think. Robyn Williams: Professor of Marine Science Ove Hoegh-Guldberg who was with Dr Jonica Newby, formerly of Catalyst .

A key dimension is the social construction of socio-spatial relationships, and particularly, the attribution of core and periphery features. In this article, we investigate environmental and development discourses in the peripheral spatial context of the Ays\'e9n region of Chile. Three research questions guide the investigation: (a) What are the dominant environmental and development discourses? (b) what are the main synergies and tensions among discourses? and (c) what are the (discursive) implications for (de-)peripheralization? Based on semistructured interviews and secondary sources, we identify six regional discourses on environment and development. Imaginaries of nature, regional development, and economic growth are the common denominators that create synergies and tensions. We conclude that environmental and development discourses play a key role in the transformation of geographic peripheral areas. Discursive synergies can not only reinforce but also counteract tendencies of peripheralization. FULL TEXT Remote peripheral regions are often associated with high levels of naturalness, conservation values, high distance costs, and territorial inequalities (Copus, 2001; Hall & Boyd, 2005). In such areas, discourses on environmental protection enmesh and often compete with discourses on socioeconomic development. In this article, we investigate these discourses and their interplay in the peripheral spatial context of the Ays\'e9n region, a remote region in southern Chile. In scientific literature, peripheral areas have traditionally been defined in structural and static terms, in relation to their geographic distance to urban centers, remoteness, sparse population, elevated travel and service costs, and lack of infrastructure and innovation (Copus, 2001). In addition, peripheries have been characterized in rather negative terms, as being backward in terms of development, and powerless (K\'fchn & Bernt, 2013; K\'fchn et\~al., 2017). More recent spatial research, however, has thematized the so-called peripheralization process as a way to understand social dynamics with spatial implications, specifically related to mechanisms of out-migration, dependence, disconnection, and stigmatization (K\'fchn, 2015). Thus, peripheralization can be understood as a multidimensional and dynamic process whereby peripheral areas emerge and change while reinforcing and reproducing the spatial disparities in relation to the core (Harders, 2015; Naumann & Reichert-Schick, 2013). Peripheralization may occur in urban as well as in rural areas and is not fixed to a specific geographic location (Beetz et\~al., 2008). By overcoming certain peripheral conditions, geographic areas may engage in deperipheralization processes (K\'f6hler, 2012). The conceptualization of when and how an area is being peripheralized or deperipheralized remains an open debate (Fischer-Tahir & Naumann, 2013). Meyer and Miggelbrink (2013) emphasize that if research on peripheralization aims  to go beyond a taken-for-granted structuration of the social world, (it) has to conceptualize the production and effects of meaning  (p. 208). They consider discursive processes as a key component in the formation of socio-spatial patterns. By consequence, meanings ascribed through discursive (re)productions are pertinent to the social construction of socio-spatial relationships and therefore influencing (de-)peripheralization processes (cf. Pl\'fcschke-Altof, 2016). In the case of Chile, there are noticeable territorial inequalities between the northern most regions, including the Atacama desert, the southern region of Patagonia, and the central area where the capital (Santiago) is located (Aroca, 2013; Atienza & Aroca, 2012). According to Aroca (2013) territorial inequalities in Chile have increased in the last two decades due to state policies and market mechanisms, leading to an uneven distribution of economic opportunities (Amor\'f3s et\~al., 2013). The allocation of the National Fund for Regional Development, the centralization of public investment, the geographic distribution of advanced human capital, and the Central Bank\' s monetary policy are examples of state actions that had direct and indirect impacts on the distribution of economic growth and development. In addition, market mechanisms such as labor mobility, interregional and international commerce, and concentration of private sector decision-making have contributed to the concentration of goods and wealth around Santiago, Metropolitan region (Aroca, 2013). Moreover, interregional disparities are aggravated by large differences in infrastructure and access to telecommunications. Along with the particular geographical configuration of the Chilean territory, these factors pose challenges for the local and regional administrations, which at the same time have limited opportunities for locally differentiated, place-based policies due to the highly centralized administrative system (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD], 2009). Despite these influential processes, research on core\- periphery spatial relationships in Chile has developed only modestly, and most of it has focused on two main aspects: transformations around metropolitan areas and their consequences for urban segregation (Inzulza & Galleguillos, 2014; Jir\'f3n & Mansilla, 2013; Rodr\'edguez & Winchester, 2001) and the conceptualization of Chile as a resource periphery in the global context (Barton, 2006; Barton et\~al., 2007). In further expanding this range, this article focuses on core\- periphery discursive relations in the region of Ays\'e9n. This research aims to contribute to the discursive conceptualization of peripheralization in a remote spatial context by bringing together environmental and development meanings from the core as well as from the periphery. In doing so, environmental and development discourses are reconstructed. Three research questions guide the investigation: (a) What are the dominant environmental and development discourses? (b) what are the main synergies and tensions among discourses? and (c) what are the (discursive) implications for (de-)peripheralization? The remainder of this article introduces the study area, the conceptualization of discourses, the methodological approach, and the results. Subsequently, by looking at the synergies and tensions among discourses, we analyze the effects of meanings in the socio-spatial transformation of the Ays\'e9n region. Finally, we draw the conclusions of this article. The Ays\'e9n Region, a Remote Peripheral Area Figure 1. Geographic Location of the Ays\'e9n Region (Northern Patagonia, Chile). Note. The Southern Highway is the only longitudinal and partially unpaved road that connects the region for over 800 km of intricate geography. The capital city, Santiago (Metropolitan region), is located 1,600 km north from the Ays\'e9n region. The Ays\'e9n region is part of one of the largest fjord regions in the world. Its terrestrial ecosystems are characterized by a large cover of native forest with a high degree of disturbance due to forest fires during the colonization period (figure own elaboration based on data set publicly available at National Catalogue of Geospatial Information-IDE Chile, WGS 84/UTM zone 18S). Historically, the region of Ays\'e9n has been conceptualized as a frontier territory, a remote peripheral area within the national territory (N\'fa\'f1ez et\~al., 2017). Explorer chronicles, colonization, and development policies, and, lately, green development ideas have imposed different sociogeographic frontiers, idealizing the spatial imaginary of the Ays\'e9n region and Patagonia (Mendoza et\~al., 2016; N\'fa\'f1ez et\~al., 2017). Based upon the logic of spatial integration of the national territory, development policies have defined the Ays\'e9n region as an (GORE Ays\'e9n, 2014). This classification allows to prioritize public and private resources that may contribute to overcome the disadvantages and inequalities, in relation to the rest of the country (GORE Ays\'e9n, 2014; N\'fa\'f1ez et\~al., 2010). Nevertheless, the Ays\'e9n region still faces a lack of economic opportunities, infrastructure, and connectivity (i.e., terrestrial, maritime, and digital). Two main cities, Puerto Ays\'e9n and Coyhaique concentrate around 80% of the regional population. The regional economy and rural livelihood are primarily based on natural resources (Delgado et\~al., 2013). Salmon aquaculture and nature-based tourism are the main economic activities (Blanco et\~al., 2015; Gale et\~al., 2019). From a socioeconomic stance, the regional government is trying to address the challenge of improving the quality of life through economic growth and creation of jobs while trying to maintain the region\' s cultural and ecological heritage. By 2030, the regional goal is to become an international sustainable tourism destination, to consolidate aquaculture development and align it with other coastal usage, and to become a scientific research platform with a focus on the region\' s natural capital (ILPES-CEPAL/DIPLADE Ays\'e9n, 2009). Conceptualizing Discourses Discourses may be interpreted from several perspectives. In simple terms, discourses can be understood as a particular set of ideas. Those who subscribe to these ideas may have a shared vision of the same phenomena, constructing common meanings and legitimating their knowledge, agreements, and disagreements (Dryzek, 2013). Hajer and Versteeg (2005, p. 175) define discourse as  an ensemble of ideas, concepts and categories through which meaning is given to social and physical phenomena, and which is produced and reproduced through an identifiable set of practices . Furthermore, discourses are connected with different levels of power in shaping the social and physical world (Sharp & Richardson, 2001). In the political domain, discourses represent an input for policy making and policy change. In this regard, discourse analysis reveals how policy processes and practices are being influenced (Sharp & Richardson, 2001). Discourses reveal how different actors construct their own reality, defining problems and solutions in a specific way (Hajer & Versteeg, 2005). M\'fchlh\'e4usler and Peace (2006, p. 458) define environmental discourses as  the linguistic devices articulating arguments about the relationship between humans and their environment . In their approach, which we follow in this research, the environment is understood as the intersection between the sociocultural construction of nature and the natural components and ecological processes that characterize the study area. In line with this understanding, environmental discourses can take many forms and may comprise many interwoven narratives. A key component of environmental discourses is their interpretation of nature. Traditionally, nature protectionists have given a central position to cultural, aesthetic, and ethical aspects in their interpretation of nature (Gustafsson, 2013; Van Koppen, 2000). However, the interpretation of nature as a resource has been important as well. In the last few decades, the resource approach has gained more prominence due in the ecosystem services approach; in this approach, nature is valued as a means for the sustainable provision of goods and services (Van Koppen, 2000). In this regard, the definition of nature as a resource may be considered as a developmental idea rather an environmental one. Views of development are related to different conceptualizations of well-being and often associated with economic growth (Fischer-Tahir & Naumann, 2013). According to Cornwall (2007), development ideas are constructed around that gain power due to their vague definitions and normative character. Poverty, the poor and marginalized, globalization, sustainability Methods Discourses were reconstructed based on semistructured interviews with key informants and secondary sources review. Scientific publications, official documents, online sources, and technical reports enriched the analysis. National themes about environment and development were described based on secondary information. Interviewees were considered as key informants (Marshall, 1996) due to their role or position within selected regional organizations related to development and environmental issues. However, the ideas expressed during the interviews do not necessarily represent the organization\' s stance. Twenty-eight interviews were conducted between October 2016 and January 2017. This sample represents 4 of 10 municipalities that constitute the Ays\'e9n region and 11 of 18 regional secretaries located in the region (Table 1). Depending on the respondent\' s role, interviews were conducted in several localities. Interviews aimed to gather a variety of ideas around development and environmental issues in the Ays\'e9n region. Interviews were in most cases individual, face-to-face, audio recorded, and subsequently transcribed. Semistructured interviews seemed to be the most appropriate method to get an in-depth understanding of different dimensions related to development and environment and to gather a broad range of perceptions in a guided conversation, within a limited amount of time.

Interview transcripts were indexed anonymously, by adding an identification code and a consecutive number (i.e., ID_1 ). Primary information was analyzed following an inductive approach (Thomas, 2006), whereby the main themes and narratives emerging from the raw data were identified, with the aid of Atlas.ti software (Kumar, 2014, p. 318). Thus, discourses were selected among the most recurrent topics that interviewees referred to, resonating with a set of ideas and practices applicable throughout the Ays\'e9n region. Subsequently, secondary information was used to complement the argumentation of each discourse. In analyzing discourses, we draw upon Dryzek\' s (2013) seminal work on environmental discourses, along with the search for synergies and tensions. Dryzek (2013) proposes four key analytical elements, namely, (a) basic entities whose existence is recognized or constructed, (b) assumptions about natural relationships, (c) agents and their motives, and (d) key metaphors and other rhetorical devices. Discursive Themes From the Core National discourses about environment and development are certainly intertwined, encompassing the main public guidelines that shape the national and regional performances. Natural resources extraction and export-led development have molded the destiny of Chile\' s administrative regions. From the mining regions in the north, to the salmon production in the south, the neoliberal nature of environmental policies has fostered market-enabling conditions instead of a stronger market regulation (Tecklin et\~al., 2011). As a result, Chilean macroeconomic indicators have shown promising trends in economic growth and social development. Despite this, income inequality in Chile is still one of the highest among OECD countries accompanied by the appearance of substantial environmental conflicts (Latta & Aguayo, 2012; OECD, 2011). In this scenario, a full account of the environmental and development discourses at the national level is beyond the scope of this article. We concisely characterize the key current themes in both types of national discourses, based on national documents containing guidelines for environmental protection and development. In the last presidential period (2014\- 2018), the public administration oriented its efforts toward a more integrated view when addressing environmental problems and their interaction with climate change, national development, and poverty (Pizarro & Serrano, 2017). Climate change, plastic pollution in the oceans, and protected areas have been some of the main topics that have characterized the national environmental discourse in the recent years. Regarding climate change and plastic pollution, Chile has taken a frontrunner position in Latin America, in developing a Climate Change Bill, presiding the United Nations Climate Change (2019) Conference, COP25 , and being the first country in banning plastic bags (Ministerio del Medio Ambiente, 2018). In addition, the execution of the National Biodiversity Strategy through regional policies has prioritized local actions concerning biodiversity conservation. In this regard, the creation of the Route of Parks of Chilean Patagonia (Tompkins Conservation, 2017) has become part of the national environmental discourse. While increasing the areas of sensitive ecosystems under protection, this development also imposes a rather conservationist vocation on Patagonia as a peripheral area. Meanwhile, national development themes are mainly oriented toward the enhancement of economic competitiveness and productive diversification of the country. Fostering investment, innovation, and entrepreneurship, as well as strengthening human capital and technological capacities, are considered the main mechanisms to achieve an equitable territorial and sustainable development (Chilean Economic Development Agency [CORFO], n.d.). Nevertheless, national economic growth is still highly dependent on natural resource extraction. Lately, the national plan called Plan Regi\'f3n, Chile lo hacemos Todos (Plan Regi\'f3n, we all make Chile) , was launched by the government aiming to target some specific regional needs such as infrastructure and economic growth in peripheral regions, in order to advance towards an integral development (Gobierno de Chile, 2018). Yet, social inequality is still one of the main stumbling blocks of Chilean development, as it was manifested by the recent social uprising occurred in October 2019. Discourses From the Periphery Based on an inductive analysis of interviews and documents, we identified six regional discourses pertinent to the scope of our research. All these discourses have implications for environmental protection and socioeconomic development but based on their relative priorities and the values of nature that are highlighted, we can classify two as environmental discourses and four as development discourses. Environmental Discourses Over the past 30 years, Patagonia and the Ays\'e9n region have been framed and reframed as life reserve, as a pristine and untouched place and as one of the last wild places in the world. The rewilding of the Ays\'e9n region owes its conceptualization to a series of consecutive events, highly influenced by the American environmental philanthropist Douglas Tompkins (1943\- 2015). Tompkins promoted a strict ecological approach to preserve Patagonian landscapes, setting a precedent for public and private biodiversity conservation, on a national and on a local scale (Bourlon, 2017; Holmes, 2014). However, Tompkins\' s efforts encountered a great opposition, sparking the debate about private conservation versus traditional farming, as well as rising all kind of suspicions about the real aim of acquiring large extensions of land in both sides of the Andes (Louder & Bosak, 2019). In addition, by the end of the 1980s, regional environmental movements emerged, mobilized against the building plans of two large projects in Patagonia: a nuclear dump site and later on against an aluminum refinery (Segura, 2008). As a consequence, the regional green sector coined the motto Ays\'e9n life reserve which aimed to represent the ideals toward an inclusive sustainable development, with and for the people of the region (Hartmann, 2014, para. 2). Later on, Ays\'e9n life reserve was adopted by regional authorities and the private sector, transforming the regional ideology into a sort of green regional brand. To date, Ays\'e9n life reserve and Tompkins\' s legacy are still influencing the regional and the national environmental policy making. The latest and greatest development has been the creation of the Route of Parks of Chilean Patagonia. This route covers 2,800 km and 17 national parks located in southern Chile. Endorsed by the government and environmental organizations, this route symbolizes a step forward to save the wild beauty of Patagonia Patagonian wilderness discourse. In a parallel and sometimes in contrasting position with the Patagonian wilderness discourse, ideas about cultural and natural heritage cultural and natural heritage discourse emphasizes the role of cultural components in the regional development as well as in economic activities such as tourism (Aumen, 2017). As one of the interviewees pointed out,  Patagonia is not only about natural attractions, is about people, culture and traditions (ID_26). Together with the landscapes\' aesthetics and natural resources, cultural heritage is being portrayed as a regional asset for local and regional development. Ays\'e9n\' s cultural heritage, molded by Chilean and foreign migration after the decline of the sparse indigenous populations, is acknowledged for the courage and the strength that the colonists the pioneers  had during the colonization period, surviving, and cultivating a very hostile natural environment. The pioneer\' s heritage is still shaping mostly the rural life, where the handling of nature reaffirms the peasant ( Gaucho ) and Patagonian identity. The sociopolitical revalorization of culture and nature, in parallel so to speak, has contributed to empower local communities, recognizing their traditional knowledge and enhancing their identity. The recent opening of the first regional museum in the city of Coyhaique represents a major achievement for cultural heritage conservation, strengthening the efforts for a better understanding of culture and nature in Northern Patagonia. Development Discourses The development of the Ays\'e9n region has been historically constrained by its remote peripheral condition and by the highly centralized policy-making processes that have partially dictated the destiny of the region of Ays\'e9n. The perceived marginalization and asymmetric relation with the central government has led the Ays\'e9n region to a permanent discussion and dissatisfaction about decentralization efforts (Durston et\~al., 2016), providing a fertile ground for the emergence of the regional demands discourse. As one of the interviewees manifests,  we (the regions) want development, based upon our own interests and natural resources (ID_20). Despite the dependence on public investment, in 2012 a social uprising under the movement Ays\'e9n, your problem, is my problem arose as a social and political reaction against the historical state failure toward the region (P\'e9rez, 2016). High living costs spurred the discussion. The movement was initially led by artisanal fishermen followed by numerous social organizations. Regional actors demanded, among other requests, legally binding citizen participation related to hydropower projects, the creation of the regional public university, and regionalization of natural resources. As a result, in 2014, the regional public university was created, Universidad de Ays\'e9n. However, according to P\'e9rez (2016), 76% of the demands that emerged from the movement were not considered into the government plan (2010\- 2014), indicating a low impact in public policies and a rigid policy-making process. In this respect, narratives about regional development still recall the turmoil caused by the hydropower projects. In 2005, the plan to build five dams in the Ays\'e9n region triggered one of the largest environmental movements against dams in Chile: Chilean Patagonia without Dams (Consejo de Defensa de la Patagonia Chilena, 2017). The project promised the creation of jobs, roads and port infrastructure, lower electricity costs for the region, and therefore better chances for regional and national development (Romero, 2014). Ays\'e9n\' s rivers were seen by the public and private sector as promising rivers, with exceptional conditions (Salazar, 2009), where dams could be built in order to supply the increasing national energy demand. In 2014, and after several years of environmental reports and protests, the project was unanimously rejected by the Council of Ministers, leaving behind a general discontent, a social division, and a feeling of victory for those who supported the environmental movement (Reyes & Rodr\'edguez, 2015). At the same time, social demands activated the debate about the national energy mix and renewable energies. In addition, the Ays\'e9n region initiated its own discussion about the regional energy policy. As a result, the local antidam discourse shifted toward the sustainable energy mix discourse, although with less discursive power compared with its predecessor. Recently, the shared ideas about the regional energy mix have been expressed in the document Citizen Proposal, Energy Policy for Ays\'e9n Life Reserve (Coalici\'f3n Ciudadana por Ays\'e9n Reserva de Vida, 2018). The proposal emphasizes the localized character of energy production, the need for small-scale projects, and the energy transition toward cleaner production. The common vision is clear: The Ays\'e9n region needs clean, equitable and affordable energy to support regional small-scale economic activities, such as tourism and agriculture, as well as to tackle the air pollution of the regional capital, Coyhaique (Ministerio del Medio Ambiente, 2016). Besides, it has been pointed out that  the Ays\'e9n region has a different destiny, it will not become the platform for extra-regional interests (Coalici\'f3n Ciudadana por Ays\'e9n Reserva de Vida, 2018, p. 52). In recent years, nature-based tourism has gained prominence as a development discourse. Nature-based tourism has become one of the main economic sectors in the Ays\'e9n region, fostering a number of tourist destinations, and resulting in a rapidly growing job market of more than 7,000 related jobs (Sernatur Ays\'e9n, 2017). In 2009, the Regional Development Strategy (ILPES-CEPAL/DIPLADE Ays\'e9n, 2009) pointed out that regional nature and pristine landscapes should be taken as an asset into the regional economy but at the same time should be protected in order to preserve the natural and cultural heritage. In this scenario, fostering the tourist sector seemed to be the best way to achieve this balance. In 2015, the regional tourist sector was boosted by a large public investment. As a result, in the last 3 years, several initiatives have been implemented by the Chilean Economic Development Agency, the National Tourism Service (SERNATUR), and the Regional Government. For instance, tourism spatial planning instruments (Zonas de Inter\'e9s Tur\'edstico [Zones of Tourist Interest, ZOIT]) have defined three geographic areas along the Ays\'e9n region to invest resources and to further develop tourism initiatives. In addition, economic instruments have been created to support local entrepreneurs. As one of the respondents mentioned, tourism development  has become an inclusive and democratic activity for the local people (ID_25). Another initiative is the Regional Tourism Strategic Plan (PER Turismo). In this plan, protected areas and the Southern Highway have been taken as the main elements to be prioritized in order to advance in nature-based tourism development in the Ays\'e9n region (DNAExpertus, 2015). In this context, the Tourism Strategic Plan has framed the Ays\'e9n region, as a destination of nature and adventure . To date, the nature-based tourism discourse has certainly changed the living conditions of the local communities throughout the region. Tourism and economic development plans have fostered a sort of entrepreneurship culture, encouraging small and family business to provide new facilities to cope with the inflow of tourists. Meanwhile in the coastal areas of the Ays\'e9n region, the salmon aquaculture industry has had a sustained growth, despite the effects of economic and sanitary crises (Iizuka & Zanlungo, 2016). Salmon aquaculture , composed of industrial salmonid production (i.e., Atlantic salmon, Pacific salmon, and trout), represents nowadays one of the main economic activities in the Ays\'e9n region, and an important development discourse, accounting for 49% of the national production (Sernapesca, 2016). However, regional production is mostly shipped to the Los Lagos region, where the main processing facilities are located. A weak value chain and a lack of infrastructure have characterized the Ays\'e9n\' s salmon industry. By 2006, the industry was flourishing and salmon farming activity was being described as the regional driving force (Vial, 2006). Nevertheless, after a severe sanitary crisis between 2007 and 2010 (Bustos, 2015), development plans were canceled. Several processing plants and salmon farms were shut down, and the number of employees was reduced. The salmon farms\' maritime concessions were relocated, and new environmental regulations have been implemented ever since. Notwithstanding the sanitary and environmental crises, the industry continues benefiting from the access to clean and cold water. Recognized as Chile\' s unique advantages, geomorphological and environmental characteristics provide optimal conditions for salmon farming (Niklitschek et\~al., 2013). Such conditions represent key elements to promote the salmon market, which is exemplified in the following quote:  Chile has unique conditions for salmon farming. The crystal clear cold waters of Chilean Patagonia, surrounded by glaciers and fjords, produce a fresh, versatile and healthy product (Salmon Chile, n.d., para. 2). In opposition to this development, Indigenous communities located in the northern coast of the Ays\'e9n region, amid litigation over the maritime space and together with environmental nongovernmental organizations, have manifested their discontent toward the increasing southward expansion of the salmon farming activity, accompanied by the insufficient enforcement of environmental regulations. Analysis Table 2 summarizes the analysis of the environmental and development discourses. When comparing the discourses, it becomes clear that elements of different discourses may fit together and thus create potential synergies where these discourses influence policies and practices, or may not fit, and thus create conflicts and contradictions. Depending on the content of the discourses, synergies between them may reinforce peripheralization or stimulate deperipheralization. In this section, we first explore the synergies and tensions between the discourses; then, we discuss their implications for (de-)peripheralization. Table 2.

Synergies and Tensions Strong synergies are found between the nature-based tourism discourse and several other discourses, such as the regional demands, the cultural and natural heritage discourse, and the Patagonian wilderness discourse. This discourse finds support in the social legitimization as a regional economic activity compatible with the environment and employs metaphors and rhetorical devices based upon regional and sustainable development. The reproduction of the nature-based tourism discourse is being promoted by several actors and contributes to a shared vision on how the region should be developed. These synergic interactions reinforce the discursive power through which nature-based tourism is being validated and implemented. Arguably, this has contributed to the fact that the nature-based tourism discourse has become the predominant development discourse throughout the Ays\'e9n region. Another synergic articulation can be found in the narratives of the aquaculture discourse and the national level development themes, whereby aquaculture development is being directly supported by national development guidelines. Assumptions of economic growth and development and the use of rhetorical devices related to employment creation, quality product from Patagonia, and being a world salmon producer have enriched the discursive reproduction. As a result, this synergy has imposed a new spatial imaginary of Northern Patagonia in which its remote coastal areas have been transformed into productive nodes within global supply chain networks. The aquaculture development discourse, however, also causes tensions with the regional demands discourse. These tensions emerge, among others, from the contrasting effects of the industrial activity. Whereas the national economy benefits from the regional salmon production, the national revenues poorly reflect on the regional well-being. Although municipalities where aquaculture takes place benefit from the annual revenue from salmon activities (Orellana, 2018), the weaknesses of the regional value chain have hampered the creation of economic opportunities, resulting in a general dissatisfaction about the distribution of costs and benefits of salmon aquaculture in the Ays\'e9n region. Recently, the public and private sectors signed a cooperation agreement that aims to strengthen the salmon value chain and to change the way regional development is being perceived (AQUA, 2019). Yet, results remain to be seen. Remarkably, we found far less tensions between the aquaculture discourse, on one hand, and the cultural and natural heritage, and Patagonian wilderness discourses, on the other hand, even when salmon aquaculture clearly has negative environmental effects, which may threaten coastal nature and artisanal fishery (Qui\'f1ones et\~al., 2019). A plausible reason for this is that the discourse on nature and natural heritage is mostly oriented, as yet, to the inland and mountain areas. Another tension worth mentioning stems from dissimilar ways of nature representation between the Patagonian wilderness discourse and the cultural and natural heritage discourse. While the former aims for biodiversity conservation and for saving the wild nature at the end of the world, the latter aims for value creation based on the natural and cultural regional heritage. Patagonian wilderness discourse as it has been termed in this research has created a new environmental imaginary of the Ays\'e9n region, influencing land-tenure changes and contrasting with the traditional cultural landscape, in which sheep farming used to be the predominant activity. Discussion: Implications for (De)peripheralization In this research, we emphasized environmental and development discourses constructed by the periphery, rather than focusing on how the periphery is being framed by the core or by the media (e.g. Pl\'fcschke-Altof, 2016). In this attempt, we identified local narratives that are commonly conveyed throughout the Ays\'e9n region, thus shedding light on the local agency and on the active role of local agents in reshaping socio-spatial relations (Willett & Lang, 2018). Our findings indicate that the construction and coexistence of spatially dependent environmental and development discourses influence the way remote peripheral areas are being acted upon. The synergies observed between the nature-based tourism discourse and other regional discourses can be seen as drivers of innovative periphery\- periphery relations with policy implications, through which regional actors strive for a better integration of environmental and development dimensions. This may help counteracting peripheralization through materialization of discursive content, that is, through regional empowerment, regional identity, and sociopolitical agreements, altering core\- periphery connections and changing the way peripheral areas are being (self-)perceived. In this respect, the creation of periphery\- periphery relations might be considered as endogenous strategy of coping with peripheralization. Taking Tensions Seriously By contrast, unless the tensions between aquaculture and regional demands are being addressed, the uneven relation between the core and the periphery due to aquaculture expansion and economic growth interests will be accentuated. This implies that peripheralization is further promoted through the socio-spatial transformation of coastal areas and the declining of environmental conditions (cf. Niklitschek et\~al., 2013). Another finding worth discussing is the Patagonian wilderness discourse. According to Aliste et\~al. (2018), renewed environmental-capitalist values have transformed the perception of Patagonian landscapes into representations of purified nature . Despite promoting nature conservation, the idealization of pristine nature has redefined the access to natural areas, generating new forms of inequalities. The Patagonian wilderness discourse has played a key role in the reframing of the Ays\'e9n region, but as we have argued earlier, it both shows synergies and tensions with other regional discourses. Depending on the future development of this discourse and its materialization in policies and practices, it may counteract or stimulate the peripheralization of the region. In this regard, our research foregrounds other local narratives that are equally important to understand socio-spatial patterns in the Ays\'e9n region. As policy implication, regional policy makers need to be aware of such tensions and evaluate them within a broader view of regional development so that impacts on peripheralization can be properly assessed. Developments that taken in isolation may seem favorable to counteract peripheralization when considered in a broader regional context may have the opposite effect. This clearly applies not only to salmon aquaculture but, to some extent, also for the Patagonian wilderness imaginary. Shifting Discursive Relationships With the Core Patagonia without dams and Ays\'e9n, your problem is my problem Theory Implications According to K\'fchn and Bernt (2013), spatial factors influencing processes of peripheralization still remain underdeveloped in theory. In response to this, our research shows how environmental and development ascriptions may serve as proxies for spatial dimensions, wherein the geographic location and the natural attributes are implicitly, and explicitly, immersed in the narratives from the periphery. Drawing upon Meyer and Miggelbrink (2013), and the need to conceptualize the production and effects of meanings within peripheralization analysis, we suggest that (de-)peripheralization processes may emerge from the (self-)construction of spatial imaginaries ascribed to peripheral areas and not only from social stigmas, often attributed to peripheries (Leibert & Golinski, 2016). While stigmatization implies negative representations, spatial imaginaries of places, idealized spaces, and spatial transformations are able to create identity and drive change (Watkins, 2015), and ultimately may counteract peripheralization processes. Generally speaking, the challenge of analyzing spatially informed discourses is to identify and differentiate these processes of imagination and transformation. Conclusion This research has identified six regional discourses on environmental protection and socioeconomic development, which we labeled Patagonian wilderness, cultural and natural heritage, regional demands, sustainable energy mix, nature-based tourism, and salmon aquaculture. The first two are mainly environmental discourses, and the others put an emphasis on development aspects. On a national level, we identified key ideational components of the prevailing environmental and the development discourses. Environmental and development discourses, from the core as well as from the periphery, intersect either by building synergies or facing tensions. Our analysis has shown that discursive synergies around the reproduction of the nature-based tourism discourse can potentially counteract peripheralization, through the creation of new periphery\- periphery relations. On the other hand, synergies between salmon aquaculture and national development discourses may reinforce peripheralization by accentuating the uneven relation between the core and the periphery. More generally, we conclude that environmental and development discourses play a key role in the transformation and creation of new socio-spatial patterns of geographic peripheral areas, and discursive tensions shed light on how contested meanings are being articulated and materialized. We suggest that the analysis of discursive reproductions of geographic peripheral areas should look at the potential synergies that might be stimulated in order to counteract peripheralization processes. In this particular case, potential synergies between the regional demands and sustainable energy mix discourses and national environmental and development ideas represent a crucial aspect for the environment and for the development of the Ays\'e9n region, which should be further addressed. Finally, our analysis confirms that environmental and development dimensions are specially entangled in places such as the Ays\'e9n region and Patagonia, where economic and cultural activities directly depend on the provisioning of natural resources and on the landscape aesthetics. In this context, environmental and development discourses are redefining the peripheral condition, and at the same time, the alleged geographic isolation remains as a unique feature that identifies the region and its people.

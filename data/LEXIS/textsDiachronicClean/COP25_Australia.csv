These exports are lowering global emissions by up to 159 Mt CO2-e a year by displacing more emissions-intensive fuels overseas.The Government's Climate Solutions Package also maps out, to the last tonne, how we will achieve our 2030 Paris target more than a decade ahead of time.By working with our international partners and taking strong domestic action, the Australian Government will continue to deliver reliable, affordable energy and address the challenges of climate change while ensuring a strong economy.

Mr Turnbull told Smart Energy Summit in Sydney yesterday that using carryover credits to hit the 2030 goal left Australia needing a ""superhuman effort"" to meet the ultimate Paris target to reach net zero emissions by 2050.""My concern about using them for nearly half the lifting is that leaves you then in 2030 with an even bigger mountain to climb, going into 2035 and 2040,"" Mr Turnbull said.Professor Ross Garnaut has said the use of carry-over credits would cost the economy more than taking immediate and decisive action.Lowy Institute's Herve Lemahieu, who visited the UN headquarters in Brussels last week, said Australia's ""friendly and benign image"" in Europe was changing.""Australia has residual good faith in Europe, but that is being undermined by the headl"

They have caused mass riots and looting and have so far resulted in 19 deaths and more than 7000 arrests.In a sign the troubles threaten to persist, Chilean president Sebastian Pinera this week announced the country would pull out of hosting two upcoming major international summits, including a United Nations climate change conference and an APEC trade forum, due to the continuing unrest.""I think the president's decision not to have COP25 and APEC in Chile was a good one ... to take a risk with his international reputation in the interests of keeping the country calm,"" Mr Mackenzie said.The Escondida mine in Chile's Atacama desert produces 1.2 million tonnes of copper a year. The mine, which is managed by BHP, is also 30 per cent owned by rival miner Rio Tinto.\l"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia4","Australia is copping it at COP25","December 10, 2019 Tuesday","Canberra Times (Australia)","This week the world's climate ministers, including Australia's embattled Minister for Emissions Reduction Angus Taylor, are meeting in Madrid for international climate talks.It should be a wake-up call that our position on thermal coal exports is undermining Australia's world standing.It has already been an inauspicious start to the COP25 UN Climate Change Conference, where Australia is receiving a well-deserved kicking from the international community for its inaction on the issue.Australia bagged the infamous Fossil of the Day award from environment groups on the opening day.The satirical award, presented each day of the conference, was in recognition of the Australian government's downplay of the link between climate change and the bushfires that continue to devastate communities across the country.As the talks continue, we shouldn't be surprised to see members of the European Union, who are leading the way in tackling climate change, taking aim at Australia for our weak climate commitments. Trade Minister Simon Birmingham recently got a taste of this when France pushed Australia to adopt enforceable climate change targets as part of a planned trade deal with the EU.COP25 should be a wake-up call that our domestic climate policies and position on thermal coal exports are undermining Australia's standing in the world.With climate concerns at record highs at home and growing international pressure, could this be a turning point for Australian climate politics?As the bushfires have shown, inaction on climate change has huge social and economic costs.What many Australian policymakers don't yet understand is the economic opportunity of acting on climate is equally big - in fact, it's enormous.Australia's sunshine, wind and large land area are the envy of our neighbours.Australia has some of the best solar and wind resources in the world.This puts us in an excellent position to become a major exporter of renewable energy to the Asia-Pacific region, creating new industries and new jobs.And it turns out this economic transformation and positive vision for Australia is a story that Australians want to hear.WWF-Australia recently conducted national research to better understand what climate change stories resonate with middle Australia - the people who've been called ""the quiet Australians"".Australians want to hear messages that are positive, that are solutions-focused and that tap into their love and optimism about Australia.By far the most popular message was this: we are a nation of quiet achievers, at the individual, community, and business level.We invented WiFi and EFTPOS - technology that is used all over the world today.The modern solar cell was invented by an Aussie, and Australia has one of the highest rates of household solar in the world - with one in seven households having solar panels on their roofs.This message appealed to people across the board, regardless of their stance on climate change.It should come as no surprise that Australians want to feel pride in Australia. And there are many things to be proud of.Australian companies - big and small - are spearheading clean energy solutions like grids, batteries and electric vehicles.We are also seeing an increasing number of Australian companies power their operations with clean, renewable electricity; more than 240 organisations joined the Business Renewables Centre Australia in its first year.But what our research also tells us is that Australians are good at thinking big and trading globally.Not only can we power our own economy with 100 per cent renewables, we can produce so much more, and sell this surplus energy to the world in the form of liquid sunshine, expertise and solar-powered products and metals.Now we have heavyweights sharing this vision.The good news is we are starting to get on with making this vision a reality.Already South Australia and Queensland are funding renewable hydrogen pilot projects.Andrew ""Twiggy"" Forrest and Mike Cannon-Brookes have invested in a bold plan to export 10GWs of solar from the NT to Singapore.But we must do more - the global criticism at COP25 should bring that point home. Australia has the capacity to be the world's leading exporter of renewable energy inside the next 10 years.At WWF we're embarking on an ambitious campaign to help Australia make this happen.If communities, governments and industry work together, we can unlock the investment needed to build new renewable export infrastructure, create a renewable knowledge economy and decarbonise some of our most intensive industries.In so doing, Australia could then show the international community that we can transform from climate laggard to climate leader, by not only decarbonising our own economy but helping our neighbours to do so too.Seven hundred percent renewable energy is a big, audacious goal - but Australians have always been up for a challenge. Better we act now to be a future global winner than a fossil of yesteryear.Dermot O'Gorman is chief executive of WWF-Australia.\l"

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia7","Climate talks at COP25 a 'disappointment' as Australia gets special mention","December 16, 2019 Monday","Analysis and Opinion","Disappointment. That is the word many are using at the close of the latest United Nations climate talks in Madrid. And many of those people are pointing to Australia  among a handful of countries  as part of the problem. While the world agreed in Paris four years ago to stop global warming at well below 2 degrees Celsius, and to try to stop it at 1.5C, the details of how countries will be held to account are still being worked out. Enter COP25, the second meeting of the parties to the Paris Agreement (and the 25th UN Climate Change Conference). Up for discussion this time were a host of technical matters related to carbon markets, as well as details on how poorer countries would be compensated for climate-related damage, and wording for how countries would ratchet up their ambition next year. Despite the conference being extended for two days past its planned ending, HYPERLINK http://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-16/un-climate-summit-ends-with-no-deal-on-carbon-markets/11801772the conclusion was beset by watered-down compromise on some issues, while others were kicked down the road with no decision being made. Climate activist Greta Thunberg, who spoke earlier at the conference about ""loopholes"" in climate negotiations, tweeted that the event appeared to be ""falling apart"". ""The science is clear, but the science is being ignored,"" she said. Australia received special attention at the event for its HYPERLINK position demanding it be allowed to use so-called ""carryover credits"" to meet its emissions reduction targets; getting it off the hook for having to reduce actual emissions. Carry-over credits kicked on Australia has promised to reduce its emissions to 26 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, and it plans to get 90 per cent of the way there by using ""carry-over credits"" from a different climate treaty: the Kyoto Protocol. Australia claims it gained those credits by beating targets set in the Kyoto Protocol  targets in which Australia was, for some time, allowed to actually increase emissions. It says only about 10 per cent of its Paris target needs to be achieved using actual emissions reductions between 2020 and 2030. At the conference, Australia appeared to be isolated in its demand, with no other countries pushing for a measure widely described as a ""loophole"". Costa Rica's Environment Minister, Carlos Manuel Rodr\'edguez, fingered Australia, along with Brazil and the US, for blocking progress. ""Some of the positions are totally unacceptable because they are inconsistent with the commitment and the spirit that we were able to agree upon [in Paris in 2015],"" he said. What happened? According to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, the talks were a lost opportunity. The decision on carry-over credits was part of what's been called the ""rulebook for Paris"". As a result of disagreement on key clauses, its finalisation has been kicked down the road for next year's COP26 in the UK. The push by developing countries for stronger wording on increasing finance for compensation over damage caused by climate change was rebuffed, as were calls for updated targets at next year's conference to be ""ambitious"". While Australia contributed to the stalemate by pushing for carry-over credits to be allowed, Brazil and the US also played a significant role in things coming to a halt. Brazil was pushing for a way of accounting for emissions reductions that many countries saw as double-counting, and the US took a hardl"

The coalition should also consider carbon pricing as a way of curbing emissions.The Australian Labor Party last week adopted a net-zero target, without saying what mechanisms would be used to curb carbon emissions. This prompted a scathing attack from Morrison, who said in Parliament this week: ""I'm not going to put a tax on them to get emissions down.""Speaking exclusively to the Herald at Australia House in London as president of the Britain-Australia Society, Lord Hague rejected the idea that Australia's reliance on fossil fuels meant it could not achieve the same 2050 net-zero target adopted by the Tories in Britain.""Absolutely it's more difficult but [Australia] is a technologically advanced society and it's really in the fulcrum of the consequences of climate change,"" he said.""Climate change consequences are increased drought, higher temperatures, rising sea levels. Well, all of that hits Australia.""He said the summer's bushfires had ""affected the British people deeply"" due to the ""common sense of pain"" shared between the two countries. Hague said preserving the environment was the natural position of the centre-right to take and warned Australia's coalition MPs against leaving climate change mitigation up to the left.""If you believe in conserving the best in life that has to include the natural world, which is endangered,"" he said.""If you leave this argument to the left, their solutions will be very socialistic about high taxation, about regulation.""\l"

It was overwhelmed by its own success. That would be the first, last and only time the word ""success"" would be associated with that shambolic affair. Copenhagen was a catastrophe.The light bulb moment for me came at the end of the third day when I was sitting in a conference hall, drifting in and out of consciousness after a succession of sleepless nights, listening on my headphones to the English translation of the latest in an endless stream of speakers.""This guy is making sense,"" I thought in my dreamy delirium. What I believed was a moment of clarity, turned out to be a moment of sleep-deprived madness.The guy was Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez. I'm still not entirely sure what he was making, but it certainly wasn't sense.Internecine rivalries and domestic political jealousies coalesced to deprive that conference of any hope, even before it began.The result was an impotent communique, brokered by then-US president Barack Obama and Chinese premier Wen Jiabao, ""recognising"" the case to limit global temperature increases to 2C without the barest commitment to doing anything about it.It proved, once and for all, that the United Nations was indeed an oxymoron. These nations were many things, but they were rarely, if ever, united.Fast forward a decade and the 25th Conference of the Parties, or COP 25, is producing a similar lack of inspiration in Madrid.Just as in Copenhagen, the bulk of those countries making significant commitments to increase their Paris emissions reduction targets are smaller, developing nations.Some mid-level powers have announced ambitious cuts in response to growing pressure from their voters, but the world's biggest emitters are again largely silent. Donald Trump has even made a virtue of pulling out of the Paris Agreement altogether.COP that world.It is becoming increasingly apparent that politics won't lead us to a solution on climate change. But it will be led there. Whether it likes it or not. The market is showing the way. Just follow the money.The stream of investment into solar, wind and other renewables is becoming a tidal wave. The Australian Energy Market Operator predicts the use of rooftop solar will almost triple by 2040, providing between 13 and 22 per cent of our total energy needs.That will produce a faster than expected phase-out of coal as technology and capital races towards newer, cheaper and cleaner energy sources. Politics will follow. It'll have no other option. We saw signs of that this week.Having claimed during the election that Labor's 50 per cent renewable energy target would send a wrecking ball through the economy, the Government has now effectively adopted it as its own unofficial target.Scott Morrison warned darkly on the campaign trail that independent modelling proved Labor's targets would strip $472 billion from the economy, slash more than 336,000 jobs, cut the average wage by more than $9000 a year and force wholesale electricity prices up by more than 58 per cent.The Government has obviously now binned that dodgy modelling. This week, it began distributing a meme on social media boasting that under its direction Australia would produce 50 per cent of its energy from renewable sources by 2030 (Labor's target) - but, almost magically, with positive impacts on growth, jobs, wages and electricity costs.Meanwhile, Anthony Albanese is touring coal country in central Queensland talking about how Labor will support the continued export of coal in the transition to renewables.If it wasn't politics, a world of consistent inconsistencies, it would be gobsmacking. The political landscape has entirely flipped in the space of just seven months.But while our politicians flip and flop and duck and weave and talk in puffs of smoke, the real world is moving inexorably towards more sustainable energy sources. And if our political leaders don't catch up before the next election, they can expect voters to turn as chilly as a Copenhagen blizzard. -----QUOTE---- If our political leaders don't catch up before the next election, they can expect voters to turn as chilly as a Copenhagen blizzard.

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia13","Beware herbicide apps","December 6, 2019 Friday","Mudgee Guardian","Catchment Corner The ongoing dry conditions experienced over much of the state are cause for concern amongst land managers and gardeners for several reasons.The primary, and most obvious, concern is for the provision of adequate water and forage for the health and productivity of livestock.Another cause for concern may be the disruption in the annual spray programmes to reduce weed species.When plants are moisture stressed translocation and respiration slow dramatically, restricting the movement of herbicides to their sites of action.Plants experiencing high temperature, low humidity and low soil moisture conditions tend to have a thicker cuticle (the protective cover of the leaf) with more waxy deposits on the surface.This reduces the absorption of foliar herbicides.Soil moisture influences soil microbial activity which assists in the breakdown of herbicides in the soil.Dry soil conditions prevent the biological and chemical processes that degrade herbicides, making them more likely to persist and injure subsequent germinations of perennial pasture plants.When weeds are growing under extreme moisture stress it may be best to wait to apply herbicide until conditions improve.Maintaining adequate groundcover is very important at all times of the year. Good groundcover protects the soil from extreme climatic conditions, supports biological activity within the soil, and reduces weed seed germination and growth through competition.When prolonged dry conditions break it is often with heavy a downpour, especially if this occurs within the summer months.These 'gully rakers' can cause much damage to farm infrastructure if there is no groundcover to absorb the moisture or to slow the flow of water across the landscape.There would be many in the district who can remember when drought breaking rains have reduced farm dams to a stinking crust of animal manure and other organic matter.Alternative methods of weed control might be looked for in prolonged dry periods.Annual plants can be slashed or mown before their flowers mature and perennials can be chipped, pulled up if numbers are small, or slashed several times.These methods are labour intensive and therefore more costly, however perennial pastures will be protected and persistent herbicide residue in the soil will not be an issue.An added benefit will be the mulch of slashed, chipped or mown weeds covering the soil, protecting it from extreme climatic conditions and providing soil organisms with a food source.Watershed Landcare Earth First Australia COPS outOn Monday the 25th Conference of Parties (COP 25) commenced in Madrid. The purpose of COP 25 is to finalise groundwork to support the Paris Agreement to curb the rise in global temperatures to below two degrees by 2050.The backdrop to the conference is one of extreme weather events and concerning UN Climate reports.The need for action is clearly stated in remarks made by UN Secretary General Antonio Gutterres who said ""We have two choices.One is the path to surrender, where we sleepwalk past the path of no return, jeopardising the health and safety of the planet. The other option is the path of hope.The path of resolved sustainable resolution- a path where fossil fuels remain where they should be- in the ground, and where we are on the way to carbon neutrality by 2050.""The urgency is reflected in the slogan, which is ""Time to Act.""Australia's response to the urgent message of COP 25 will not be well received by the conference. We must expect international criticism for our lack of policies and weak emissions targets..At home the Morrison government is being faced with increasing pressure form the Australian electorate as more and more citizens are becoming angry and frustrated about the inaction of leadership in the face of intensifying extreme weather events which have been linked to climate change.Kate Allen is the Founder of Extinction Rebellion Central West.She expresses her frustration, and that of many others when she says "" Watching the evening news I see item after item about the climate disasters around the world.I don't understand why our leaders aren't doing anything. This is a climate crisis, and if they won't act, then we must.""Like Kate Allen, Kate Hook, from Futuring Orange is also determined to take action.

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia19","CLIMATE GABFEST A COP-OUT FOR EMITTERS of all sizes","December 21, 2019 Saturday","The Australian","The international gathering must stop wasting time and focus on technology Another year, another COP. Or to give it its full title, Conference of the Parties, UN Climate Change Conference. The one just gone was held in an industrial part of Madrid. The plan was for it to be held in Chile, but that country cancelled. It was COP25.Individuals representing all sorts of environmental groups and other assorted activists from around the world somehow find the funds to attend the conference, which goes for two weeks. An extra two days were added to COP25 in the hope that the 200 countries represented could reach various agreements. They could not.It follows on from a series of unsatisfactory COPs, including most famously the one held in Copenhagen, but also the last four. The one exception to this long list of COP flops was COP21, which was held in Paris and established the framework for the latest international climate change agreement.Many of the details of that agreement were not settled at the time. Ever since, it has been one argument after another on those details with nary any resolution in sight. Indeed, we are now at a stage where it is worth posing this question: what is the point of COP?In this context, it's interesting to observe how the COP process has developed across time; it began in 1995. Initially, the conferences were narrowly focused and country representatives and a small group of scientists attended. An ongoing source of tension was the role that developing countries should play in terms of reducing the growth of greenhouse gases.For many years the consensus position was that developing countries should be completely exempt because they had not caused the problems in the first place and were not well-placed to bear any costs that emissions mitigation might entail. This was the deal under the Kyoto Protocol.Note that in the 1990s and early 2000s, the contribution of developing countries to emissions was relatively small, even including China. Fast forward to the present and China is now the largest single emitter of greenhouse gases and India is also a substantial emitter.Last year's increase in China's emissions of carbon dioxide exceeded Australia's emissions in total and were close to the total emissions of the EU.The way the Paris Agreement handled the issue of developing countries was to defer any commitments they might make to reducing emissions until after 2030 and to seek some voluntary reductions to the emissions-intensity of their economies in the meantime.In exchange for these promises, developing countries would be compensated via a fund that would pay for climate change mitigation and adaptation. The targeted figure to be donated by developed countries was $100bn a year by 2020.Unsurprisingly, the contributions received by the fund have not been remotely close to the target. While the US initially provided $1bn of funding, the withdrawal of the US from the Paris Agreement means there have been no further contributions.Australia, likewise, has ceased to contribute, having made a small initial donation. The Prime Minister has declared that overseas aid directed to climate change will be spent closer to home.Back at COP25, there were some trivial commitments of additional donations - less than $100m spread across several years. At this stage, it looks as though the fund mechanism will fail, an outcome that disappoints a very large number of countries that eagerly signed up to the Paris Agreement in the expectation of an additional flow of funds.The main agenda of COP25 related to article six of the Paris Agreement: voluntary co-operation/market and non-market based approaches. The core of what needed to be worked out was the definitions and principles that should govern international trading in carbon credits.The argument is that countries or companies should be able to buy carbon credits from overseas countries to meet their obligations rather than undertake more costly domestic abatement.Brazil, which remains a signatory to the Paris Agreement, sees real advantages in carbon trading in relation to past and future forest management activity. The sticking point came when Brazil sought to count this activity as a contribution to its own carbon abatement while also trading the associated carbon credits. This double-counting was a bridge too far for the other participants.In the end, there was no agreement in relation to article six. And notwithstanding the coverage by the local press, the issue of Australia's use of the Kyoto carry-over credits was not even on the agenda.Given that the vast majority of countries have no carry-over credits to use - Canada, for instance, failed miserably to abide by its Kyoto commitments - it's not surprising that there is little support for their application.Having said that, it's a complete sideshow when it comes to the main issues. And that's not even acknowledging the fact Australia may make its 2030 Paris commitments without recourse to the use of the carryovers.COP25 really demonstrates is that the vast majority of countries will not put moral purpose before their economic interests.It's all very well for activists such as Jamie Henn of 350.org to moan that ""the level of disconnect between what this COP should have delivered and what it's on track to deliver is appalling and is a sign that the very foundations of the Paris Agreement are being shaken up"". But the reality is that it's impossible to see the COP process delivering anything more than vague and unenforceable commitments while the costs of mitigation remain so high.That's why the focus of the COP26, to be held in Glasgow at the end of next year, should be on technology. It's only with technological breakthroughs that there is a chance that most countries will act to reduce emissions because it makes economic sense as well.Claiming that renewable energy is now cheaper than fossil fuel-generated energy is simply misleading in the context of the absence of effective and economical storage. It's why China is powering ahead with the construction of coal-fired electricity plants.Carbon capture and storage has real potential but needs further R&D funding. A more systematic discussion of adaptation to changing climate patterns could also be useful.The alternative is for the UN to abandon the COP process altogether, although that seems unlikely. To paraphrase Ronald Reagan, COP looks distinctly like a form of eternal life. After all, Greta Thunberg will need somewhere to hang out next year.\l"

It was also not on the formal discussions, which focused on Article 6 and the trading of carbon credits.Mr Taylor told The Australian Financial Review yesterday that Australia had been ""over-achieving"" in its emissions reduction, and would continue to every year until 2030.The latest projections from the Department of the Environment and Energy said Australia needed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 395 million tonnes to reach its commitment of 26 to 28 per cent (based on 2005 levels) by 2030.If 411 million tonnes from previous Kyoto agreements is included, Australia will overachieve by 16 million tonnes, according to the figures. If the ""Kyoto carry-over"" was removed, Australia would have to achieve emission reductions of about 40 million tonnes a year to reach 2030 targets.Some experts, such as Frontier Economics climate change head Matt Harris, said the 2030 targets were achievable without Kyoto credits, even if the ""low-hanging fruit"", such as gains in the electricity sector, had already been made.Australian Industry Group senior policy advisor Tennant Reed said that closing the gap between the current projections required current policy measures to include other sectors of the economy such as heavy industry.\l"

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia25","There's nothing 'natural' about natural disasters","January 6, 2020 Monday","Canberra Times (Australia)","In a press conference on Friday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison repeatedly referred to the raging bush fires across Australia as ""natural disasters"". As someone who lectures on disasters, I can confidently state that there is no such thing as a ""natural disaster"", particularly not in this age of climate change.Politicians like the language of ""natural disasters"" as it allows them to claim that the fires are something akin to an ""act of God"", rather than take any responsibility for the failures of planning and preparation. I imagine Mr Morrison hopes the term ""natural disaster"" allows him to avoid the real link between climate change and drought, rising temperatures and the subsequent bush fire season that we are now facing.He hopes that the term ""natural disasters"" will fool us into thinking that his climate-denying government is in no way responsible for the devastating fires across Australia. It is this ongoing climate change denial that has cost Australians so dearly in recent weeks.In the last month I have participated in two vastly different but closely related events at where I watched Australia's climate-denial policy play out. In the week before Christmas I flew back from the United Nations climate change conference in Madrid, where I was a negotiator for the Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu. Last Thursday I drove with my family back from the Narooma evacuation centre where we had been holed up escaping the fires that have devastated Australia's South Coast.These events are related. The same political choices that have made Australia an international pariah in climate change negotiations, are now evident in the lack of political support for adequate preparation and planning ahead of the devastating bushfires.The Morrison government's political decision to undermine effective climate action impacts Australia's reputation internationally, and especially in the Pacific.Vanuatu, like all Pacific Island nations, emits almost no carbon and yet people are severely impacted by climate change. In Vanuatu the impacts of climate change include more cyclones, like Tropical Cyclone Pam in 2015, and more droughts, which will have severe impacts given that most people are subsistence farmers. In the future people in Vanuatu, as elsewhere in the Pacific, may need to resettle, leading to loss of attachment to place, where ancestral connections have been maintained for thousands of years, as well as languages and culture.These are the issues people refer to when they speak of climate justice. Is Australia prepared to provide access to finance to compensate countries who are facing the impacts of climate change from carbon emitting countries?The answer from Australia, the United States, Brazil and other developed countries has historically been no. But Australia went further in recent climate change negotiations. It argued for an exception that no other country was asking for - questionable counting of credits in a way that undermines any credible commitments to reducing carbon emissions.Just as our leadership has failed to provide adequate climate change action at an international and regional level, the fires also show that they have failed to adequately plan and prepare. Hosted by generous locals and aware of the Herculean efforts of rural firefighters, I think Australians are also becoming increasingly aware of the lack of co-ordinated planning around emergency management - and of the failure of our leadership to meet with our expert fire chiefs when they warned of the impacts of climate change on the bushfire season. We are also critically aware of a leadership that is largely missing in action, in part because of climate-denial paralysis.The bushfires demonstrate not only the profound lack of Australian political leadership on issues related to climate change, they also demonstrate the huge costs associated with climate change inaction.There is nothing natural about the disasters we are facing. I refuse to accept that this is the new normal. Future generations deserve better. They deserve beach summers like we remember as children.We must all require more of our leadership. The costs of climate inaction at home, and across the globe, are too high.Siobhan McDonnell is a lecturer on natural disasters and climate change at ANU and a climate-change negotiator for the Vanuatu government.\l"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia26","Many harbingers of the climate change problem","December 14, 2019 Saturday","Wagga Daily Advertiser","RAY'S REASONiNGThe past weeks have really put climate change centre stage on the world's agenda. First came the news that we may have already crossed several ""tipping points"", which I will explore in some detail below.Then came news that the European Union had declared a ""climate emergency"", which was followed by last week's opening of the next UN Climate Summit COP 25, in Madrid.And as the summit opened, the former Tuvalu prime minister told ABC TV's Q&A that Scott Morrison denies climate change is happening in Pacific. Then we learnt of the government's plan to produce hydrogen from ""dirty"" brown coal. Let's look first at the tipping points. The world may already have crossed a series of climate tipping points, according to a stark warning from scientists. This risk is ""an existential threat to civilisation"", they say, meaning ""we are in a state of planetary emergency"". Tipping points are reached when particular impacts of global heating become unstoppable, such as the runaway loss of ice sheets or forests. In the past, extreme heating of 5c was thought necessary to pass tipping points, but the latest evidence suggests this could happen between 1 and 2c.Also ahead of the UN COP25 Climate Change Conference in Madrid, the European Parliament approved a resolution declaring a climate and environmental emergency. Like the EU, a number of countries and local administrations have declared that our planet is facing a climate emergency. But, closer to home, not the Australian parliament and Wagga Wagga City Council.At the opening of the UN climate summit, UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres introductory remarks showed that he is well aware of looming tipping points when he warned that governments risked sleepwalking ""past a point of no return"" if they remained idle. Mr Guterres warned that existing pledges made under the Paris accord fall far short of the kind of transformational action needed to avert the most disastrous consequences of global warming in terms of sea-level rise, drought, storms and other impacts, according to scientists.He also contrasted the leadership and mobilisation shown by the world's youth on the climate emergency with the lack of action by governments, which were failing to keep up with the urgency of the problem despite increasing signs that the climate was reaching breakdown. Australia is one of the countries banned from speaking at the conference. The criteria for being banned include building new coal fired power stations, granting fossil fuel subsidies, and failing to increase national targets for emission reductions.Countries like Australia, Japan and South Africa who support the coal industry were removed from the summit's speaking list, along with countries that have been critical of the Paris climate accord, such as the US, Brazil and Saudi Arabia. What a rogues' gallery for us to be a member! Which leads me to note that the former prime minister of Tuvalu, Enele Sopoaga, who, in reference to the Pacific Islands Forum last August, told Q&A he was ""taken aback"" by Morrison's behaviour at the meeting. ""Unfortunately, prime minister Scott Morison of Australia [was] expressing views that completely denies there is climate change happening already in the Pacific"" he said.Virisila Buadromo, an advocate for women's and human rights in Fiji, also urged Australia to take more action. ""I think Australia, as the largest emitter of carbon in the region, you need to stand with our family ... to fight against climate change,"" she said.These comments paint Australia in general, and our PM in particular, in a bad light. But as I watched Q&A, I had just read an equally depressing story in The Saturday Paper, which explained that the PM and Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor plan a great future for our country as an exporter on a grand scale of hydrogen - reputedly the energy source of the future. However, not by cleanly producing it from water, which can easily be done by using electricity generated from renewables. Instead, it seems the government is planning to produce hydrogen by burning brown coal. This would completely negate hydrogen's one great advantage, which is that its only byproduct is water.Are the Liberals and Nationals so desperate for funds from big coal that they will so willfully contribute to more global warming, and so bring on the tipping points?\l"

A spokesman for the Foreign Minister said ""any announcement about ministerial attendance will be made in due course"".Prime Minister Scott Morrison was criticised for failing to attend the UN Climate Action Summit in New York in September, despite already travelling in the United States.Climate and energy program director at the Australia Institute Richie Merzian said Australia was already seen as a laggard on climate action.""As the only country to dismantle a working carbon price, and the Prime Minister's absence at the New York Climate Summit - that even [US President Donald] Trump attended - was noted and cost Australia.""One of the major issues to be discussed at the conference will be whether carryover credits from the Kyoto protocol can be used by countries in order to meet their carbon emission reduction targets.Referred to by critics as an ""accounting trick,"" carryover credits allow countries to use credits from surpassing their targets under the Kyoto protocol towards their Paris commitments.Australia's policies rely on using these credits and at a Senate estimates hearing in October officials conceded they knew of no other countries doing so to meet their targets.""It is important for a minister to represent at these climate conferences where the deals are secured in small rooms at a high level,"" Mr Merzian said.""Australia has a particular interest in advocating for the use of carryover credits and it is alone in prosecuting this interest.""A decision to prevent countries using carryover credits to reach their 2030 goals would have an impact on Australia, with 367 million tonnes of the 695 million tonne reduction in carbon emissions required to reach Australia's target to come from the credits.Mr Merzian said Australia needed to use its diplomatic power to back smaller countries from the Pacific calling for climate action.""I'd like to see Australia pledge additional financial support for developing countries to undertake climate action, including through the Green Climate Fund. I'd like to see Australia commit to increasing its 2030 targets, which many other countries are doing and I'd like to see Australia be an advocate for its Pacific family in pushing all parties to do more.""\l"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia29","Nats threat to derail 2050 carbon plan","February 17, 2020 Monday","Australian Financial Review","Prime Minster Scott Morrison faces another damaging split over climate policy, with the Nationals preparing to oppose any effort for Australia to join countries cutting carbon emissions to net zero status by 2050.Under pressure to differentiate from the Liberals, Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack declared the proposed target unworkable for the Australian economy, while former resources minister Matt Canavan warned he was prepared to cross the floor should the Coalition consider adopting the ""fantastical"" target.The idea of a target for net zero emissions by 2050 is being considered by about 80 countries ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP26, in Glasgow in November.The Australian business community last week threw its support behind a push for net zero emissions by 2050.Asked about the proposed target yesterday, Mr McCormack said: ""I think if you go down that path, what you're going to do is send factories and industries offshore, send manufacturing jobs offshore. That's not the Australian way.""""What I don't want to see happen is our industries and our farmers being forced offshore, having to import food like there was no tomorrow.""The Coalition is preparing to take a new long-term emissions reduction target to the Glasgow summit, with a review into the potential economic impacts of adopting the 2050 goal due to be finalised later this year.Countries including the UK, and all of the states and territories in Australia, back the goal.Business groups and investors strongly support a net zero plan put forward by independent MP Zali Steggall but unhappy Nationals MPs have attacked Liberal colleagues pushing for Australia to do more to deal with climate change.The debate over whether taxpayers should support a new coal-fired power station proposed for the Queensland town of Collinsville has underscored disagreement within the Morrison government.Senator Canavan, who quit cabinet after supporting Barnaby Joyce's challenge for leadership of the Nationals earlier this month, said Australia should not take further action to cut emissions unless other countries did the same.Warning he might cross the floor to vote in the upper house, the Queenslander questioned how a target of net zero emissions by 2050 would work.""How, as a country, can we commit to net zero emissions in 30 years' time, when we'll receive our last diesel submarine in 35 years' time? It doesn't seem to make a lot of sense,"" he told Sky News Australia.""I haven't looked at the modelling or the cost and benefits of net zero emissions closely because it just seems so fantastical to me. It seems like the kind of things governments say because they're not doing much today but they'd like to try hoodwink people that they might do something in 30 years' time.Senator Canavan said the government-funded Collinsville feasibility study was an appropriate first step, because more electricity capacity was needed in Queensland.He did not see ""any prospect"" of another leadership spill against Mr McCormack, but did not rule out supporting a new bid to oust him.Climate politics remains a touchstone for Nationals MPs, some of whom expect a further move against Mr McCormack's leadership.Mr Morrison and Energy and Emissions Minister Angus Taylor would have to convince the Coalition party room of the benefits of any change.Ms Steggall said if Senator Canavan was able to cross the floor, MPs who supported the target should be allowed to as well.""This is a matter of principle that requires a conscience vote, so everyone can represent their electorates,"" she said.North Sydney Liberal MP Trent Zimmerman said yesterday a net zero by 2050 target was ""something that we should be looking very seriously at"".Business Council chief Jennifer Westacott said last week the Steggall plan could provide a ""massive advance"". Support was quickly matched by Atlassian co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes, the Australian Industry Group and the Australian Energy Council.Labor leader Anthony Albanese said the opposition continued to examine its policy and 2050 ambitions.""Business doesn't know what the government's policy is, because frankly, they simply don't have one,"" he said.Key pointsMichael McCormack says the proposed net zero emissions target is unworkable.Ex-minister Matt Canavan threatens to cross the floor over 'fantastical' idea.\l"

Australia is committed to the Paris Agreement,"" he said.Australia has joined the Leadership Group for Industry Transition, a public-private partnership led by India and Sweden, aimed at reducing emissions in ""economically important industrial sectors"", including steel, aluminium, cement, aviation and shipping.The government will use the group, which also includes Britain, Germany and Korea, to encourage Australian businesses to participate and assist in working to lower emissions. Mr Taylor said global economies would transition to lower emissions ""only as fast as the deployment of commercially -viable technologies allow"". He also flagged the government would -release a long-term strategy to -reduce emissions next year, focusing on the deployment of ""cost--effective technologies"".""This means we need to get the right technology to the marketplace when and where it is needed. In Australia, we are developing a Technology Investment Roadmap. The roadmap will establish an enduring, strategic approach to Australia's clean technology -investment,"" he said. Citing the government's national hydrogen strategy and boost to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, Mr Taylor said renewables supplied more than 25 per cent of the nation's electricity supply and that Australia had the world's highest uptake of household solar panels.""This increase has not been without issues and one of Australia's challenges is to ensure energy remains affordable and reliable as these changes occur. We cannot move faster than the technology allows,"" he said.On Tuesday, the Prime Minister said the government's climate change policies were being developed from the ""sensible centre"".""Our actions on climate change are getting the results they're -intended to get - reducing emissions and meeting our targets,"" he said.

After two weeks of protracted talks meant to address the planetary warming emergency, world leaders spectacularly failed to reach any real outcomes.The degree to which wealthy nations, including Australia, blocked progress on critical points of debate incensed both observers and country delegates.These points included robust rules for the global trading of carbon credits, increased commitments for finance to help developing nations tackle climate change, and most importantly, raising ambition to a level consistent with averting catastrophic climate impacts.

The world has let another chance slip by to tackle the climate crisis, and time is fast running out.The implications of this were perhaps summed up best by the low-lying Pacific island state of Tuvalu, whose representative Ian Fry said of the outcome:There are millions of people all around the world who are already suffering from the impacts of climate change.

In those three decades, this will be the HYPERLINK first time a COP summit has been held in the UK. From a policy perspective, COP26 will be important for at least four reasons:1. It will take place in the year when all countries are asked to submit their new long-term goals - so ambition to address the global climate emergency will be high on the agenda.2. It will have to finish the work that COP25 was unable able to conclude - setting out the rules for a carbon market between countries. From Glasgow onwards, the implementation of the HYPERLINK 2015 Paris Agreement4. COP26 will come just weeks after the US presidential election with the potential implications this will have for US climate policy and US participation in COP26.Come November 2020, the eyes of the world will be firmly on Glasgow.Glasgow on showScotland has a long and rich history of discovery and innovation, including Glasgow's past as a world-class centre of shipbuilding, trade and industrial production - a legacy that has contributed to greenhouse gas emissions but has also added much to the quality of human life.

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia36","Businesses want global rules on carbon trading","December 2, 2019 Monday","Australian Financial Review","Australian businesses are calling on governments around the world to develop international accounting rules for carbon trading, saying such a framework could lead to a carbon credit export boom.In a joint statement released to coincide with the first day of the United Nations COP25 climate conference talks in Madrid, business groups argued clear international trading rules would open up new business opportunities while radically reducing carbon emissions.""Carbon would potentially trade at the scale of the commodities that underpin it, such as oil, coal and iron ore,"" read the statement, which was led by the International Emissions Trade Association and signed by Australian Industry Group, oil and gas lobbyist APPEA, and the Carbon Market Institute.""COP25Natural carbon ""sinks"" refer predominantly to tree planting, while industrial sinks include carbon capture and storage.The business groups claimed such a rule book could reduce CO2 emissions by 9 billion tonnes a year by 2030 - almost a third of last year's total global CO2 emissions, which the International Energy Agency put at 33.4 billion tonnes.They claimed a well-designed carbon trading scheme could also knock up to $320 billion off the global cost of meeting the emissions reductions targets of the Paris Agreement.John Connors, chief executive of the Carbon Market Institute, one of the signatories to the statement, said a clear set of carbon trading rules was ""the last piece in the puzzle"" of the Paris Agreement, and was likely to be a major focus of this month's talks.""The science is clear that the global economy needs to get to net zero, and likely significant negative emissions, as we undertake the task of climate repair,"" said Mr Connors, who will travel to Madrid later in the week.He said the Australian government's emissions reduction fund, which pays the private sector to mitigate carbon emissions mainly through planting trees, had already stimulated a carbon farming industry in Australia.He said Australia's large landmass meant there was plenty of room to grow the carbon farming industry if there was a spike in global demand for carbon credits. But that would require an internationally agreed framework. Such a framework could also stimulate more carbon capture and storage, he said.The Madrid conference is the last COP meeting before the Paris Agreement comes into force in 2020. As yet countries have failed to agree on the concrete details of an international carbon market, which is only loosely defined in the agreement.That means at the moment the only international carbon trading framework is the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism, which allows developed nations to invest in carbon mitigation projects in developing countries, and count the resulting emissions reductions towards their own targets. The business groups said this scheme was a good start, but a much larger, up-to-date framework was now needed.Article 6 of the Paris Agreement calls for the establishment of a ""mechanism"" that would allow nations struggling to meet their targets on their own to buy carbon credits off nations who are beating their targets. The scheme would be voluntary, but would have carefully designed accounting rules to protect against ""double counting"" of the same emissions reduction in two countries.Nations came close to agreeing on the rules of this mechanism in last year's COP24 meeting in Katowice, Poland, but in the end Brazil derailed the talks when it refused to accept rules banning double counting of carbon credits.\l"

Our government's climate policy is all smoke and mirrors, highlighted with untruths and spin.The truth is Australia's emissions are going up, not down.

What are the implications?In our study of the gap reports, we found that the required emissions cuts from 2020 to 2030 are now more than 7% per year on average for the 1.5\'b0C temperature limit set in Paris and 3% for 2\'b0C. Had serious climate action begun in 2010, the cuts required to meet the emissions levels for 2\'b0C would have been 2% per year, on average. Instead, among the top seven emitting countries or regions, one has lower emissions (the EU), another slightly lower (India), three show no change (the US, Russia and China) and two are higher (Brazil and Indonesia). Together with other countries, the overall trend of rising emissions has not been reversed over the past 10 years - so now there is less time to reach the goal. The time window for halving global emissions has narrowed: in the words of the Nature report, in 2010, the world thought it had 30 years to halve global emissions of greenhouse gases. Today, we know that this must happen in ten years. In plain language, a decade of insufficient political action on climate change means that nations must now do four times the work - or do the same work in one-third of the time - to comply with the climate pact they made in Paris. The less action countries take collectively to cut carbon, the higher the temperature increase and the more severe the impacts. The poor, who are least responsible for greenhouse gas emissions, suffer the most from its impacts.3. What are the urgent steps that need to be taken to reverse the trend?The gap is so huge that governments, the private sector and communities need to switch into crisis mode, and to make their climate pledges more ambitious. Immediate action is needed in a climate emergency - while ensuring equity. Given the delay in action, much more rapid emission reductions will be needed to keep the temperature goals in reach. Instead of developing in a way that involves high consumption and high emissions, countries need to provide people with basic needs through low emissions and sustainable development, tackling socio-economic inequality at the same time. Action is now required from all countries, including those that are still developing to meet basic needs.4. What good work is being done to control emissions that others can follow?

International climate finance is a critical ingredient to support a just transition. The comment in Nature also includes examples of what other emerging economies that depend on coal, such as China and India, are doing. They are adjusting the fuel price, capping its consumption, reducing plans for new coal-fired power plants and supporting renewable energy production. Much more must be done, and quickly - while addressing poverty, energy access and urbanisation - to address both development and climate change. The same is true for South Africa, which still depends on coal for 83% of its electricity and 59% of all http://www.energy.gov.za/files/media/explained/2018-South-African-Energy-Sector-Report.pdfenergy. The country needs to adopt a vision for a just transition that includes net-zero emissions by 2050 or earlier, and put in place the laws, institutions and practical actions to achieve that goal.

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia53","Is Morrison up to the challenge of net zero emissions?","February 22, 2020 Saturday","The Australian","The climate change argument has moved from the science - whether it's happening or not - to whether, and how, the world can achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The implications of this change for Australia are impossible to overstate.This year's United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP 26, in Glasgow in November will be as significant a watershed as COP 21 in Paris in 2015, except this time it won't be about measuring and limiting degrees of warming, but about targeting emissions directly instead: the world is now being pressed to sign up to net zero emissions by 2050.Britain's Conservative government kicked off its chairmanship of the conference last month by calling for other countries to join it in pledging net zero. At the same time, the Business Council of Australia put its own stake in the ground with a ""scoping study"" also calling for net zero by 2050.The ALP on Friday formally adopted it as policy, which will ensure the government does not. But Scott Morrison has started working on his Glasgow speech, which looks like being a reworking of Energy Minister Angus Taylor's effort in Madrid last December - that is, it will be about technology.Apparently the government will put out a ""technology road map"" next month that will presumably be a series of kites to see which ones fly. Morrison's task will be to keep up with the new global conversation about climate change without uttering the words ""net zero"" and definitely without reheating the National Energy Guarantee and thereby alienating the Queensland section of the Coalition.""We favour technology over taxation,"" Morrison declared this week. ""You want to get global emissions down? That's what you need. Meetings won't achieve that. Technology does and I can tell you taxes won't achieve it either."" The BCA has placed itself squarely at odds with this rhetoric with this month's scoping study, which says: ""The simplest, most efficient method of achieving this transition is a price signal that places a value on lower-emissions."" As the host of the bushfires that played a big part in shifting world opinion towards more radical action on climate change, the Australian speech in Glasgow will get quite a lot of attention, but whoever gets the job of delivering it (and it should be the Prime Minister, not the hapless Taylor) will have a tough job of sounding vaguely convincing while talking only about technology.Nowhere as tough, though, as the job of actually achieving zero net emissions by 2050 or of preparing Australia for a post-fossil fuel world. Australia's prosperity has been built to a large extent on selling fossil fuels, but we are now a tobacco company.The government has been deceiving coal miners and their communities that there is a future for their product, trying to play both sides of the Blue Mountains, and insisting that Australia can stand aside from the global push to decarbonise. But this has been a political rather than economic or scientific posture that was always going to be exposed as a lie.As Paul Kelly wrote in his article on this subject in these pages last Saturday: ""The coming epic clash over net-zero carbon emissions reduction targets by 2050 is not just about the economy and climate change; it is about Australian democracy in an age of globalisation and universal climate threat."" What the UK, the UN and now the BCA are calling for is nothing short of an economic and political revolution for Australia, but it is also what the world has been edging towards since Kyoto in 1997. It seems 2020 may be the year when the implications of this 23-year-long slow walk will be laid bare.In the Financial Times this week, economist Martin Wolf wrote that to achieve net zero ""we must move beyond (burning fossil fuels) almost completely"".A zero-carbon economy, he wrote, would require four to five times as much electricity to be generated as there is now, and all from non-fossil fuel sources. Hydrogen consumption would have to increase enormously.Hydrogen is one of the technologies that the Morrison government hopes will get it off the hook in November, but the transformation required is pretty much impossible on its own.In its scoping study, the BCA put a number on the investment needed: $22bn each year until 2050, in order for Australia to be part of the global investment requirement of $440bn per year that will be needed to deliver net-zero emissions. And that's on top of a price on carbon, not instead of.The task is not just about funding that, it will require a fundamental shift in how the Australian economy works, rethinking the viability of large parts of the country, and the role of government in supporting regional areas and intervening in the market.And don't forget livestock: there is a real and rapidly developing threat to the meat industry, partly from the need to limit greenhouse gas emissions from livestock to achieve net zero by 2050, but also from the global groundswell towards veganism and away from industrial-scale killing and processing of animals. And if you think that's not a big deal, you're not paying attention.In addition to that, we are currently getting a lesson in the vulnerability of exports to China - especially services like education and tourism - through the coronavirus epidemic.So Australia has been suddenly confronted with a series of external economic policy challenges, on top of the homegrown one of chronic low wages growth, that will require the kind of sophisticated national planning and consensus building that has been entirely absent for well over a decade - ever since the attempt to fashion a bipartisan energy policy in 2009 was torpedoed by the right-wing of the Liberal Party, led by Nick Minchin and Tony Abbott.Is the Morrison government even remotely capable of the leadership required to turn that around and come up with a plan based on national consensus?It doesn't seem like it.Alan Kohler is the editor in chief of eurekareport.com.au\l"

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia58","Lack of leaders on the changes","January 3, 2020 Friday","Mudgee Guardian","2019 concludes, shrouded in smoke from unprecedented bushfires, continuing drought and the promise of record summer temperatures. Science tells us that a major factor in these extreme weather events is human induced climate change, a hypothesis increasingly accepted by the Australian public. Growing acceptance has provoked a demand for leadership on climate change. Sadly, this is not forthcoming.The recently concluded Conference of the Parties 25 in Madrid was to provide a plan of action to limit climate change to below two degrees.COP 25 was not as successful as it should have been, due in part to the obstruction by wealthy nations, including Australia, to critical discussion points, such as trading of carbon credits, finance to assist developing nations to combat climate change and raising targets to a level consistent with averting catastrophic climate change.Because of lack of policies, advocacy for carry over carbon credits and obvious ongoing commitment to the use and export of fossil fuels, Australia's performance at COP 25 did little to inspire faith in its leadership either at home or abroad. Australia currently shows little inclination to improve performance, which is currently ranked 53rd out of the 58 countries assessed on the Climate Change Performance Index. Our leaders appear to be more interested in saving our fossil fuel industries than the fate of the planet.The lack of leadership and action reflected by our Federal Government has permeated to all levels of government. At both Federal and State level, our leaders are extremely reluctant to discuss climate change, while continuing to support coal mines and fossil fuelled energy.The responses of many of our local political leaders range from challenging the science, avoiding the issue entirely, wilful ignorance, denigrating the experts and complaining that the subject has been brought up at all.There are those who would like to constructively confront the issue, but they have been howled down by the majority.Meanwhile, an increasing number of citizens are becoming fed up with the lack of leadership and the ""business as usual at all costs ""attitudes of our leaders, and are demanding action.

He would have intended that as a distraction from the ridicule over Australia's use of carry-over Kyoto credits to meet Paris commitments, but it also happens to be true.So let's not end the year glumly surveying the charred wasteland of the government's climate change policies.In his fine, mostly optimistic book Super Power - Australia's Low Carbon Opportunity, Ross Garnaut describes how the nation can become ""the superpower of the post-carbon world economy"".Today's column, my last for the year, is devoted to two examples of how Garnaut's optimism and Taylor's distraction may be starting to come true: the Sun Cable project backed by Andrew Forrest and Michael Cannon-Brookes, and a startling invention by a small private company based in Sydney called Star Scientific.Sun Cable is a plan to build a $21bn, 10 gigawatt solar farm in the Northern Territory and export the power by cable to Singapore. It is being led by David Griffin, the Singapore-based -finance director of Dyson; Cannon-Brookes and Forrest have agreed to provide money for the initial feasibility studies.The project would involve 15,000ha of solar panels with large-scale battery storage (either in NT, Singapore or both) plus a cable running under the sea past Indonesia. There might also be a cable connecting it to the National Grid in Australia for trading any power not covered by the offtake agreement with Singapore.Does it stack up?

Within and beyond that, the G20 has contributed 78 per cent.In 2018, total global emissions of carbon dioxide reached a record high of 55.3 giga-tonnes. The bulk of these - 68 per cent - came from burning fossil fuels to generate energy.""We need quick wins to reduce emissions as much as possible in 2020,"" said Inger Andersen, the UN program's executive director.Australia is hoping to secure a carve-out in Madrid by meeting its obligations through ""over-achievement"" credits accumulated since countries began pledging emission reductions. Australia would be the only country seeking this carve-out.""If this carry-forward approach is not taken, Australia will not achieve its 2020 pledge,"" the report notes.Unless global emissions fall by 7.6 per cent each year over the next decade, the world would miss the chance to get on-track to limit global warming by 1.5 degrees, the report said. This is the preferred agreed temperature rise under the 2015 Paris accord, from which President Donald Trump withdrew the US in 2017.The gap between what countries should be doing and what they are doing has never been greater, the report says.Patricia Espinosa of the UN Framework on Climate Change said last week nations should reconsider the way they calculate total country-based emissions at the next round of negotiations.\l"

Greenhouse gas emissions have risen 1.5 per cent in the last decade, with China, the European Union, India and the United States contributing more than 55 per cent of the total. Within and beyond that, the G20 has contributed 78 per cent.In 2018, total global emissions of carbon dioxide reached a record high of 55.3 giga-tonnes. The bulk of these - 68 per cent - came from burning fossil fuels to generate energy.The UNEP's executive director Inger Andersen said: ""We need quick wins to reduce emissions as much as possible in 2020.""Australia, for its part, is hoping to secure a carve-out in Madrid, by meeting its obligations through ""over-achievement"" credits accumulated since countries began pledging emission reductions.

As more adults and institutions HYPERLINK https://www.campaigncc.org/climate_strike_20_septemberjoin the protests, it seems the agency of these young people is finally being recognised. But conversations about climate change still appeal to authorities for answers - whether calling for politicians to act, or for people to listen to scientists. Of course, listening to experts and holding politicians to account is an important part of what climate activists need to achieve. But it's not the only part. As the schools strikes continue to gain momentum, it's time to think about how young people can be meaningfully involved in shaping the future of our planet.

Fugitive emissions saw the biggest rise, going up 4.4 per cent to 56.4 Mt CO2-e, as a result of escaped methane during the natural gas extraction process. Gas production is booming, growing 10.1 per cent in the June quarter.Emissions from ""stationery energy"" - that is, fossil fuels burned directly by industry, rather than to generate electricity - increased 3.6 per cent to 100 Mt CO2-e.The result, which will be a welcome change in direction for the Morrison government after presiding over a period of rising emissions, comes ahead of next month's United Nations COP25 climate conference in Madrid.Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor focused on the reduction in emissions intensity and emissions per capita, both of which he said had fallen to their lowest levels in nearly three decades.""For the first time, the Department of the Environment and Energy has prepared a consumption-based inventory. Emissions released in Australia and in other countries due to Australian domestic consumption have decreased by 4 per cent or 20 Mt CO2-e, to 450 Mt CO2-e in 2018-19,"" he said.""Consumption-based emissions are 18 per cent or 102 Mt CO2-e lower in 2018-19 than in 2004-05.""Australia's Paris target of 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 is based on absolute emissions reductions, not per capita or in relation to GDP. Currently, Australia's emissions are 12.5 per cent below 2005 levels.Green group doubtsEnvironmental groups doubted the reduction was the beginning of a downward trend.Climate Council Head of Research Dr Martin Rice said: ""Sadly, this drop is a blip. Renewables investment is set to dry up in the coming months. Our LNG exports are set to continue increasing.""We need urgent and long-term cuts to our emissions in order to address the climate crisis. This requires our federal government to adopt a credible climate policy.""Mark Butler, Labor's climate change spokesman, seized on the 0.3 per cent trend rise in emissions in the June quarter.""It's no surprise given Angus Taylor is too focused on picking political fights with local councils to deliver a credible national climate change policy,"" he said.""This government's only plan is to waste an additional $2 billion, on top of the $2.5 billion already spent on Tony Abbott's failed climate policy which has only ever seen emissions rise.""\l"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia73","Business steps up when government clearly is lacking","September 26, 2019 Thursday","The Australian","Scott Morrison was conspicuous by his absence at this week's UN , but Fortescue chairman Andrew Forrest was there to launch a global initiative to help cut the $US2.2 trillion ($3.2 trillion) in damage caused by plastic waste.In July BHP chief Andrew Mackenzie told a London audience of the miner's concerns about climate, which he later stressed was a board-backed pitch to extend BHP's minerals sales.After the tragedy of last year's collapse of the industry, consumer and state government-backed national energy guarantee scheme due to then-PM Malcolm Turnbull's lack of courage, the message is clear: if there is to be action on the environment, it will be led by business.Perhaps this explains why ministers are keen to lecture business on speaking about ""non-business"" issues.The government attacks on business miss the point, given climate change directly affects shareholder returns in multiple ways, so it is on any front a legitimate business interest.The lack of leadership from Canberra on many economic issues leaves a gaping hole for business to fill on this and other issues.Josh Frydenberg, who gallantly led the failed NEG initiative, is convening a meeting of state and federal treasurers on October 11 to talk up productivity, infrastructure, population and other -issues.Perhaps this might be a turning point where Canberra adopts a leadership role rather than its -recently preferred stance of telling others how they are failing in an attempt to shift the blame. The Treasurer has rightly reminded business it needs to invest more to lift productivity, and now we might see what he has planned when he talks up the now two-year-old Productivity Commission Shifting the Dial report.Next week's Reserve Bank meeting, which is widely tipped to cut short-term interest rates to 75 basis points, will again highlight the need for fundamental reform.As noted earlier, the full rate cut will not be passed on because bank deposit rates are already at 25 basis points, and at best any cut in rates risks fuelling a housing market that has already climbed off the floor.Punters have nowhere else for their money when stocks are -already fully priced, which -explains the -attraction of the likes of the imminent listing of a $750m Morgan Stanley-led KKR Global Credit fund, which will offer a yield of 4-6 per cent.This may well be the first of many listed credit equity raisings by global private equity funds.Private equity in Australia has plenty of money but listed targets are regarded as too expensive.Forrest's Minderoo Foundation has committed $US300m ($440m) to a new -industry--focused effort to reduce worldwide plastic waste. Forrest's Sea for the Future program aims to raise $US20bn a year through a voluntary levy on plastics resin based on its carbon footprint.Forrest said in a statement: ""The initiative will attach a greater value to fossil fuel plastics through the contribution."" It is not payable on recycled plastics, making it a cheaper alternative feedstock.""This drives demand that dominoes through the value chain and turns plastic waste into a cashable commodity, driving collection efforts, poverty alleviation through dignified work and -recycling, particularly in Southeast Asia,"" Forrest said.He launched the initiative at the UN climate change conference, saying: ""Current efforts to stem the increase in global plastic waste are disjointed and inadequate, with most of the 350 million-plus tonnes of plastic produced every year entering the world's terrestrial and marine -environment.""Industry, fully supported by governments and regulators, is the only sector that can drive the urgent global shift needed to save our oceans from plastic waste."" Forrest is working with plastic producers on the project. ""The global plastics supply chain, including major producers such as Coca-Cola, Walmart, Tesco and Unilever, have responded positively to the initiative."" The aim is to make a material contribution to reducing plastic-induced climate change by about 70 per cent by 2050.Forrest's Mindaroo has committed to underwrite up to five years in audit fees, or a total cost of $US260m, plus $US40m in establishment costs.The results will be posted on a central data base.The money raised will support the initiative while also imposing a global industry market-based scheme.Dairy do Mike Hurrell, boss of Kiwi dairy giant Fonterra, will take centre stage on Thursday morning when he unveils a plan to lift the co-op out of its financial doldrums.Fonterra sold its 50 per cent stake in DFE Pharma on Wednesday for $NZ63m ($58m) as part of its aim to reduce debt.The co-op is tipped to report a loss of more than $NZ600m caused by overexpansion and high farmgate milk prices.The move comes as the ACCC is due on Thursday to decide whether to let Canadian dairy giant Saputo proceed with its -proposed $280m purchase of the Lion specialty cheese business.Some in the trade suggest the purchase will be subject to the -divestment of -Saputo's Smithton plant in Tasmania.The market is already highly concentrated, with Fonterra controlling 55 per cent of the state's dairy production, Saputo, through its Murray Goulburn -acquisition, holding another 15 per cent, and Lion having 10 per cent, with the rest shared by smaller players -including food giant Mondelez.The acquisition would give -Saputo control of Lion's King -Island dairy and plant and its Burnie plant.The ACCC allowed Saputo last year to buy Murray Goulburn subject to the sale of the Koroit plant near Warrnambool in Victoria.Saputo is the world's biggest cheese producer with a strong market share in North America.Tasmania accounts for about 10 per cent of Australia's dairy -output. Fonterra's market share in Australia has fallen this year, -making Saputo the clear No 1 -producer.Hurrell is due to lay down his plans for the co-op, and there is some speculation he will change its operating structure, which is presently split between bulk power or commodities and consumer and food service items.Credit Suisse's half ton Credit Suisse celebrated its 50th anniversary in the Australian market on Wednesday night.The occasion also marked John Knox's final official function as the firm's chief executive, handing the reins to former Deutsche banker Richard Gibbs.First Boston became the first Wall Street firm to open in Australia two years later, in 1971, under Ross Bradfield, and in 1998 Credit Suisse acquired a stake in First Boston. In the same year First -Boston acquired a stake in Mac-cabi Clarke, a research-driven equities house.Knox took over from David Livingstone as CEO in 2015.\l"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia74","The conversion our Prime Minister needs","December 19, 2019 Thursday","Sydney Morning Herald (Australia)","A Pentecostal Christian such as Scott Morrison would be aware of the conversion to Christianity of Saul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus. Saul, a Pharisee in Jerusalem after the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ, had been a hate-filled persecutor of Christians, assisting in murder and the imprisonment of innocent people, committed to wiping out the new Christian Church, clearly one of Jesus' cruelest enemies. He was en route to Damascus, with the written authority of the high priest to arrest any followers of Jesus.Saul and his colleagues were struck with a blinding light and he was taken to the city where he met an envoy from Jesus, Ananias, who convinced him that Christ had chosen him to deliver the gospel, not only to the people of Israel but to the Gentiles and their kings. Saul's sight was restored, he was filled with the holy spirit and baptised into the faith. He changed his name to Paul and became one of the most successful of the apostles, suffering persecution and finally martyrdom.While the climate challenge is not a matter of religion but of science and morality, Morrison needs to follow Saul's example - to accept the need for a climate conversion. Climate is not a political issue - not right v left nor conservative v progressive - but it can have significant political consequences. Right now, Morrison's arrogance, stubbornness and intransigence are damaging him politically.Morrison's sins of the past constitute significant ignorance and negligence: the lump of coal in Parliament, his consistent failure to admit the significance of the link between climate and droughts and bushfires, his support for fracking at a private dinner, and his gross misrepresentation of our capacity to meet our very modest Paris target, relying on fudging its delivery with carry-over Kyoto credits.A schoolchild might liken this to wanting to carry over the six gold stars received in year 6 to the HSC and university admission, but I recognise that Morrison doesn't like children pointing out his failings in terms of their future.It is pure arrogance to ignore the experts: the 97 per cent of peer-assessed climate papers, the National Farmers Federation on the need for a national program of regenerative agriculture to make our soils more resilient and drought-resistant, and the firefighters who now intend to move ahead with a summit - without the Prime Minister - to develop a national bushfire action plan.The result has been for our nation to be identified as ""the"" laggard. Australia is ranked last in terms of genuine progress towards our Paris commitment for 2030, which is only about half what was recommended by the independent Climate Change Authority. After COP25, the UN climate meeting in Madrid, we are now tagged as a ""blocker"" as well.Ironically, climate probably offers Morrison his best chance to show leadership, and to earn the genuine support of the ""quiet Australians"". It will take honesty and courage.It is a cop-out, as it was for Malcolm Turnbull, to blame a small recalcitrant group of deniers in the government, especially when exhaustive voter polls, and a very significant list of business and civil society, have been begging for a decisive government-led response, in the midst of record bushfires and drought. Morrison just needs to out this rump in his government and discipl"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia75","The public recognises the climate crisis - when will the politicians?","January 7, 2020 Tuesday","The Weekend Advertiser","RAY'S REASONINGIn 2019, opinion poll after opinion poll showed that the public had become very aware that human-caused climate change was real. We are now living through a climate emergency, as record temperatures and unprecedented bushfires clearly demonstrate, despite Scott Morrison saying ""we have faced these disasters before"". We haven't. This is new, and the way the world is going unless politicians act immediately and decisively.But at the local, state, federal and international level progress has been deliberately stymied. I'll use my column this week to examine why no real progress was made in 2019. Thankfully there are exceptions. Unlike Wagga, several local governments have declared climate emergencies. Many Pacific Island states are all too very aware of the results of global warming, and even the UK government declared a climate emergency.In late 2019, Time magazine selected Greta Thunberg as its person of the year. That wouldn't have been possible even this time last year. The biggest story in climate in 2019 is the way in which, after years of languishing outside the mainstream, climate activism finally broke through.Young people were the key. Self-organised, serious, and frank about their anger at seeing their futures denied by politicians who won't even live to see the consequences, they have lent a powerful moral drive to the entire movement. So now the link between the climate emergency and our own lives has never seemed clearer. Finally - after decades of activists struggling to push the crisis into the larger consciousness - poll after poll shows that public concern, and desire for action, is at an all-time high.The question that became clearer as 2019 moved on, was it possible to effect any actual political change? The spectacle of Thunberg and the larger youth climate movement arriving at international meetings and parliaments and accusing heads of state of hypocrisy to their faces made for good TV news, but climate politics itself still seems far from any genuine watershed moment. Indeed, there has been little concrete progress. What the protests have sparked, instead, is that some governments declared a ""climate emergency"". A few even reset future emissions targets. In previous years this alone would have seemed radical enough, but now, however, the gap between words and actions has widened too far, and credulity is in short supply.Climate researcher Rebecca Willis put it very succinctly when she said: ""Targets don't reduce carbon. Policies do."" True, there has been some glimmers of hope on that front. Parties in the recent UK election and candidates in the US Democratic primaries took on comprehensive climate platforms for the first time. These directly or indirectly reference the concept of a Green New Deal, pairing increased spending on climate with a larger social transformation, and breaking down the wall that separates climate policy from the rest of politics. Unfortunately, nothing similar has been brought forward by a government actually in power.Many had high hopes for the UN's 2019 climate change conference, COP, held in Madrid, which fell at the end of the year. It is the forum where countries affirm their climate commitments under the UN framework convention on climate change.This year's COP may not have been the worst, but a loose coalition of right-wing governments, including Australia, effectively sabotaged the conference's goal of strengthening the Paris agreement. As The Saturday Paper wrote, in Copenhagen in 2009, Australia took a leadership role in the fight against climate change. Ten years on, at COP25, the winds had changed, and our government tried to use carryover credits from the Kyoto agreement to 'prove' we are meeting our Paris commitments. Countries opposed to Australia's cheating attempted to insert a ban into the Madrid conference's final statement, barring Australia from carrying over carbon credits.Unfortunately, in the end, the ban didn't succeed. It got even worse. Following the positions taken by Australia, Brazil, China, India and others on key issues up for negotiation, the international effort to secure the next stage of global action on climate change didn't succeed either. The Madrid meeting failed to set any new, binding targets.It's a sad end to a year that showed while the people have got the message many of the politicians haven't. Let's hope they start not only to listen, but in 2020 develop policies that will mitigate climate change before it is too late. Despite some last minute and very limited federal assistance, Messrs Morrison and McCormack have shown a distinct lack of leadership and should make way for those who can provide it.\l"

We should be counting down to the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics and getting ready for our moment in the sun: that moment when Tokyo will shine and show off a bit.Thanks to the Brave Blossoms and their amazing effort in the Rugby World Cup last year, we got a sense of the national pride we might enjoy in 2020. That now feels a million miles away.Joy and jubilation has been replaced with coronavirus-fuelled confusion, fear and anger. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has called for Japanese to demonstrate ""restraint"" and stay home, where possible. All schools are to close until April, entire company workforces sent home to ""telework"", events cancelled, meetings moved, the much-loved cherry blossom parties panned. Sporting events are being played to empty stadiums.Fear of the unknown and the hard-to-detect coronavirus have combined to make people worried. How will they stay well and protect their children and older relatives? (Don't forget, Japan's population is a super ageing society, so many more are at risk).To me, and many of my Japanese friends, it feels very much like the immediate aftermath of the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown. Then, like now, we were left wondering who to believe, who to turn to for guidance and what information sources we should believe.Disasters have a habit of testing people and their leadership skills.Life in Tokyo is different now and things are flat as the proverbial pancake. The consumption tax hike last October only served to kick the dog while it was down, and the economy has whimpered along for a couple of quarters, technically popping us back into a recession. Ho hum.Sometimes people remind me that the two-plus decades of poor economic performance for Japan coincides with my time here, suggesting I might have something to do with it. Ha!The Olympics was meant to super-charge the economy and give business a well-deserved boost - not to mention a wage hike for long-suffering Japanese workers. We had already enjoyed a surge in the number of foreign tourists, from less than 10 million to more than 30 million in 2019, a robust stockmarket and unprecedented pricing highs in Tokyo real estate.All of this had us feeling flash and hopeful: then, boom! - COVID-19 strikes and brings with it further economic woes.The Japanese deal with a lot of disasters: earthquakes, floods, typhoons, landslides, volcanoes ... you name it, we have it. Just late last year, the COP25 climate conference ranked Japan worst among 181 nations for climate disaster damage in 2018.Compared with the average Australian, people here are a little better prepared and seem ready for something. We have a national day of disaster prevention, evacuation drills, and regular disaster-management awareness and training for kids at school. Most homes have a quake disaster kit replete with torch, a few days' supply of food, water and a phone charger with batteries.Mine also contains a wee bottle of Japanese whisky, as I am quite sure I won't be able to live alcohol-free in an evacuation centre.In the immediate aftermath of a disaster, the Japanese government moves to establish a task force. All communications, updates and disaster management are handled by the PM and relevant ministries through this vehicle. For a while the measures implemented to handle coronavirus and the public health risks it posed seemed to be going well. Japanese nationals in Wuhan were swiftly collected and brought home; the Japanese government established the taskforce and public health warnings were issued.Then things started to get wonky and panic set in. This was real panic - a lot more than what friend and frequent visitor to Tokyo Tyler Brule describes as ""Japanic"".Typical panic buying takes me back to those dark days in March 2011. A visit to the local supermarket yesterday found no rice, bread, eggs or frozen food; toilet paper has become a luxury.Masks are fetching premium prices onl"

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia82","The sinking islands at the coalface of climate change","July 13, 2019 Saturday","Sydney Morning Herald (Australia)","While Australia fails to act meaningfully on humanity's greatest ecological threat, the people of Kiribati feel its effects daily, writes Katerina Teaiwa.The office of Nei Tabera Ni Kai (NTK), a film unit based in the town of Taborio, in the small island nation of Kiribati, is a small concrete building situated two metres above sea level, 30 metres from the lagoon on one side and 45 metres from the ocean on the other. Stacked under the louvred glass windows of one of its small rooms are 200 internal hard drives taken from computers over a period of 20 years. The office has no air conditioning, and the air is salty; there are regular electricity blackouts; and higher than normal wave surges, or ""king tides"", threaten the town - and the whole southern end of the atoll, South Tarawa, on which it is located - more frequently than they used to.Once a Kiribati household name, NTK has not worked on major projects for a couple of years. One of the co-founders, John Anderson, cameraman and editor, passed away in 2016. His long-time partner, producer, manager and scriptwriter Linda Uan, has been dealing with the loss and reflecting on the best way to preserve their shared legacy.The independent film unit documented more than two decades of culture, history, creative arts practice, development, and social, heritage and environmental issues across the islands. In the absence of a national film agency or television media, NTK pieced together various sources of funding to work with government and communities to produce educational documentaries, feature films and ""edutainment"". Their output had a significant impact on the scattered Kiribati population - people from other islands travelled to South Tarawa by boat or canoe just to pick up the latest VHS, later DVD, of their productions.In March 2019, Uan attended the Maoriland Film Festival in Otaki, New Zealand. During a discussion panel, she spoke passionately about NTK's work over the years. She ended with a humble request for assistance with archiving, taking one of those rectangular hard drives containing raw footage from her handbag and unwrapping it from a lavalava (sarong), then holding it up for the audience to see. The group of New Zealand and international filmmakers gasped at the condition of the drive, and the prospective loss of decades of visual chronicles, exposed to the elements in Kiribati.All but one of the 33 islands in Kiribati are less than two metres above sea level. Large parts of the country are expected to be underwater by 2050. From 2003 to 2016 Kiribati was led by President Anote Tong, who successfully raised global awareness of the climate change threats faced by his country. At the United Nations in Bonn in 2017, Kiribati was described as one of the world's most vulnerable countries. Annual temperatures in South Tarawa have increased by roughly 0.18 degrees Celsius per decade since 1950, according to the conference's briefing paper. This warming, coupled with increasingly ferocious tidal storms and coastal flooding, is destroying the island's ecosystems. Saltwater that floods the islands from storm surges devastates land and property, polluting reservoirs that capture and filter groundwater for consumption. Salt water also jeopardises resources such as coconuts, pandanus and breadfruit, which residents rely on for food and many other household needs.In the Kiribati population, there has been a rise in waterborne diseases, among other climate-change-induced illnesses, including cholera and dengue fever. Warming oceans, combined with increased ocean acidification, disrupts sea life, the cornerstone of Kiribati identity and the country's economy. Kiribati depends almost entirely on its fishing sector for food and revenue, but the catch potential is expected to decrease by 70 per cent by the 2050s.Kiribati is one of 48 nations in the Climate Vulnerable Forum, a partnership of countries most under threat from global warming. These include Tuvalu, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Vanuatu, Samoa and the Marshall Islands. Kiribati once chaired the forum, and under Tong was a vocal proponent for limiting the temperature rise from global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Beyond this temperature, sea levels are expected to increase to a point that would make Kiribati uninhabitable. Despite global campaigns calling for ""1.5 to stay alive"", the Paris Agreement on Climate Change seeks to limit the temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius. This is devastating for most Pacific island countries.Anote Tong was vocal about the need for Kiribati to face climate-induced migration ""with dignity"". However, the current government, led by Taneti Mamau, rejects this vision of mass migration, instead emphasising local development. The government aims to develop and increase the land area on South Tarawa by about 100 acres, and on Kiritimati (also known as Christmas Island) by 767 acres. It also owns 22 square kilometres of land on Vanua Levu in Fiji, with potential for forestry, livestock farming and other activities to shore up its food and economic security as Kiribati farmland comes under threat.Reality too much for many to fathomThe level of carbon now in the atmosphere is more than 415 parts per million. The last time the Earth experienced these levels was during the Pliocene Epoch, between 5.3 and 2.5 million years ago. Then, global temperatures were 2 to 3 degrees Celsius higher, and the sea levels 25 metres higher. Pollution from climate change today is on track to push the Earth towards similar conditions. To many Australian voters, this reality is too much to fathom, presumed to be a hoax, or utterly unknown.Prime Minister Scott Morrison might support climate adaptation and mitigation programs in the Pacific through his ""Pacific step-up"", but he does not support similar domestic policies, such as increased climate change research or the introduction of a carbon price, and Australia has no renewable energy targets beyond 2030. It is the world's second-largest exporter of coal but faces falling demand as its biggest customers - Japan, South Korea, China, Taiwan and India - all shift towards cleaner energy. Burning coal is in Australia a bit like the right to bear arms in the United States: a freedom that causes major planetary harm, but the issue is severely politicised and many are not willing to imagine a future without it.This protection of the mining industry is not new. For more than a century Australia has had a relationship with the South Pacific region that furthered its economic interests. Australian mining companies have been present in the Pacific since the beginning of the 20th century, wreaking havoc on ancient cultures and sustainable environmental practices while extracting phosphate as quickly as possible from places such as Nauru and Kiribati. The value of phosphate, the superphosphate fertiliser it produced, and the growth effects it had on Australian farming production and exports were massive. In 1983, a monograph produced by the Centre for Resource and Environmental Studies described phosphate as ""the magic dust of Australian agriculture"". In the case of Banaba, an island of Kiribati, the mining infrastructure was left to rust and decay. People there live among the asbestos-riddled rubble, in a place that looks more like a post-apocalyptic lunarscape than a Pacific paradise.When Peter Dutton made his flippant aside in 2015 in response to a quip by Tony Abbott about how islanders are not good at keeping to time (Dutton said, ""Time doesn't mean anything when you're about to have water lapping at your door"") Tony deBrum, the former foreign minister for the Marshall Islands, posted on Twitter, ""Next time waves are battering my home and my grandkids are scared, I'll ask Peter Dutton to come over, and we'll see if he is still laughing.""Former minister for the environment Melissa Price's words to Tong were also offensive. When she was introduced to him in a Canberra restaurant, it was widely reported - and verified by others present - that she said, ""I know why you're here. It is for the cash. For the Pacific it's always about the cash. I have my chequebook here. How much do you want?""That kind of attitude towards Pacific island leaders needs to change. Such leaders have been criticising the production and consumption of fossil fuels and their impacts on the environment for almost 30 years. The former Nauru ambassador to the United Nations, Marlene Moses, wrote in 2016, ""For the people of small islands, understanding the importance of the ocean to human survival is as natural as breathing. If the ocean is healthy, we are healthy; if the future of the ocean is uncertain, so is ours.""Pacific islands may be smaller states demographically and geographically, but the sea in which they sit covers one-third of the planet's surface area. Pacific leadership on climate change is necessary and inevitable.Since 1997, Nei Tabera Ni Kai has produced more than 400 films in both English and the Kiribati language focused on Kiribati knowledge, lives, issues and communities. They have documented what residents call ""te katei ni Kiribati"" - the Kiribati way. Their work should be stored in a well-funded archive. The name of the unit comes from a female ancestral spirit belonging to Linda Uan's clan, responsible for women's health and success. Climate change threatens not only the lands of families and clans such as hers, but the spiritual and cultural spheres associated with these landscapes.The knowledge inherent in these spheres has been the source of resilience for more than 2000 years in an oceanic environment with limited land, flora and fauna, allowing islanders not only to survive but to produce complex, creative societies.Australia is now saturated with messages about the existential threat of climate change, but the impacts will cut across all aspects of human existence - social, political, cultural, economic, environmental, and everything else that shapes our identities and relationships. Climate change is here today, not just in some distant future, and Pacific Islanders who cannot always crawl into climate-controlled bubbles experience its effects daily. While the people of the Pacific are resilient and have survived centuries of upheaval, climate change is already at emergency levels in the region - representing some of the first and starkest signs of the greatest ecological threat to ever face humanity.Katerina Teaiwa is an associate professor in the School of Culture, History and Language at the Australian National University. This is an edited extract of her essay ""No Distant Future: Climate Change as an Existential Threat"" published in Australian Foreign Affairs 6 on Monday.\l"

Within seconds a group of people, including two nurses, had come to her rescue, calling the ambulance, making her more comfortable where she had fallen and generally seeing that she was okay.Someone from the nearby caf&#xE9; arranged for bottles of water and an umbrella as she was lying in the sun.We would like to thank those people most sincerely for their help and also for the many others who were walking past and asking if there was anything they could do.In the era the ""me"" society it is marvellous to see how quickly people will come to help someone in distress. Merry Christmas!Peter Tavender, Holder Watch and learn There has been a lot of discussion lately about Prime Ministerial leadership in times of natural disasters.I have just returned from a cruise on the Ovation of the Seas, during which the Mt White eruption occurred and so many were killed or horrifically injured by molten lava, superheated steam and toxic gases.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern took immediate control, appearing constantly with her Police Commissioner, Head of Disaster Recovery, Forensics Chief and others.The flow of information was constant, empathetic and professional. The well-being and care of the injured and their families as well as the families of the deceased being uppermost at all times. She took great care to ensure that no names were released before all necessary forensic work for identification was completed in order to avoid unnecessary distress.This was a Prime Minister who understood her role. At times like this there is a real need to take the initiative in order to enter a climate of empathy, compassion and professionalism.John Gelling, Merimbula Things get better As I was driving home the other night something reminded me to look at our street lights. Over the last year or so we've had our street lights changed from the old mercury vapour lamps to new efficient LEDs.I personally find the light more natural, and because it's mostly directed down, I find distant lights don't dazzle me as much at night.I'm sure the Territory is going to be saving money both in the power usage and reduced break downs compared to the old lights.Another sign we live in a progressive, modern city.My brain now censors his letters when I see his name and don't read them.Thank you brain, I don't think I'm missing anything.Brian Hale, Wanniassa ACT Learn from Tony, Scomo Our Prime Minister is entitled to have a holiday but he's acting like an arrogant celebrity when he thinks he has a right to privacy.Not true. He is paid by the Australian taxpayer. Respect has to be earned.Is he afraid he's scared of people seeing him in some ugly board shorts ?Tony Abbott has been out there volunteering, holidays or no holidays.He was also one of the first to offer his condolences to the families of the firefighters who died.Melina Smith, Brighton, Vic Be afraid, very afraid Thank you for publishing ""You make the decision: Jim Molan's war"" (December 23, p8). It's an example of why we need freedom of the press.Kirsten Lawson's interview is literally frightening. When John Howard and Scott Morrison (and perhaps even Arthur Sinodinos) can collude to parachute self-aggrandising Molan into the Senate despite his party members and his electorate failing to vote for him, we know that our democracy is in dire straits.Be very scared of such a demagogue, defined in the Macquarie Dictionary as ""a leader who uses the passions or prejudices of the populace for his own interests"".Frank McKone, Holt Tommy rot and nonsense When native tribes performed rain dances, our ancestors, uninhibited by cultural sensitivity, either laughed quietly of openly mocked them.But the thinking behind the dancing is not dead. The Gods must be appeased. Today large numbers seem to think this can be done by closing coal plants and making other symbolic but very damaging gestures to return Australia to ""normal"", whatever that means.The rain dances didn't work. Nor will this nonsense. Climate is too complex and multi-dimensional to be fully understood, let alone controlled by anything we can do.Doug Hurst, Chapman Selective blindness Each day at the climate conference in Madrid (COP25), reports came in about the devastation caused by the current Australian fire storm.Returning Australian delegates reported that the Minister representing Australia, Angus Taylor extraordinarily and seemingly without embarrassment, neglected to mention the droughts and fires that were sweeping the nation. Incredibly, Australia apparently joined with a group of nations including Saudi Arabia, the US and Brazil to undermine various elements of the Paris Agreement.If Australia, the nation that led the global phase out of CFCs to protect the ozone layer, cannot see just how bad things are now in a climate emergency then we are in serious trouble.We missed a golden opportunity to say to the world, ""we are burning, help us by cutting emissions well beyond the Paris targets"".Digby Habel, Cook Words do matter Mike Morris's call to change the language (Letters, December 20, is timely but does not go far enough. The deliberately ambiguous term ""climate change"" was coined by bullied reporters to appease the climate deniers' rage at even mentioning what should be called the ""climate crisis"" which will soon be an emergency, and later a catastrophe.Another term that should be changed is the reassuringly gentle phrase ""global warming"". This conjures up images of cosy doonas and hot-water bottles on winter nights. It should be ""global heating"", of course.A Moore, Melba Change the policy The PM's absence from the country was bad enough. But what's really unconscionable is every bit of policy the government clings to that feeds the underlying problem of escalating carbon emissions.This can be seen in its self-interested pandering to the coal and oil lobby, its mind-blowingly shameful undermining at the recent meeting of global action to curb emissions, its refusal to meet with the nation's top fire chiefs, and its attempts to silence and punish the many Australians who actually care about our future.Meanwhile, ironically, our PM plans talks overseas with India and Japan about ""security"". He likes to talk about the sort of security where other nations are seen as a threat, and for which the government committed $200,000 million in 2016 for new military hardware. However, much of our country is feeling pretty insecure right now from a different sort of threat.Would Morrison refuse to meet with the generals if another country were invading Australia, and would he find more to help the war effort than the microscopic $11 million he announced recently for more aerial firefighting capacity?At what point does a government become a danger to its own people? If humanity survives into the future, our descendants will ask why more of us did not rise up and demand action against our real ""security"" threats. They will laud as heroes those community members who are doing exactly that right now, and, of course, the super-heroes who are out battling the fires.Dr Sue Wareham, President, Medical Association for Prevention of War, Canberra Not anxious, just angry We weren't ""anxious,"" just very cross that our head prefect, Mr Morrison, had snuck off on a little family holiday without telling us (except for his besties).And this at a time when we were having fire drills.Mike Lynch, Isaacs TO THE POINT WIZARD OF OZ? The Great and Terrible Scomo, deliverer of political miracles, was exposed as nothing more than a humbug. How good is that?Nigel Thompson, Queanbeyan East, NSW FREE THE REFUGEES Scott Morrison says it is now time to be kind (""PM apologises for holidaying but says now is the time to be kind"", canberratimes.com.au, December 22). Perhaps his first act of kindness could be to bring the Sri Lankan family back from Christmas Island and let them return to Biloela.Robyn Lewis, Raglan TRUE LEADERSHIP Leadership defines a situation. Without it, people are rudderless. Leaders interpret and make sense of a situation and then guide their community to a better future.E Wensing, Nicholls THE REAL ISSUE Many will not begrudge our Prime Minister a family holiday. But his intransigence on climate change must be condemned.David Grantham, Melba WHAT'S THE POINT? Until the Prime Minister hastens Australia's emissions reductions and encourages other polluters to do likewise, he might as well have stayed in Hawaii. Surely his marketing background tells him ignoring climate scientists and fire experts makes him look like a smug fool or a tool of vested interests?David Hawking, Turner A SMIRK WON'T WORK He should have stayed away. A smirk won't work. Even the nodding National from Wagga Wagga realises a policy change is required.Murray Upton, Belconnen A VOTE CHANGER? Shame on you Scott Morrison for deserting our country while it burns. Two volunteer firemen are dead leaving their young families fatherless, others are in hospital with severe burns and hundreds of homes have been completely destroyed. I want a leader who is willing to support our country in a crisis, not one who was overseas on holidays. You have lost my vote.Aileen Hancock, Yarralumla PLEASANT SURPRISE It's so nice to see our ever shrill, hectoring, know it all Prime Minister has returned.Graeme Rankin, Holder SHOCKED AND APPALLED I thought I could not be shocked by anything that Scott Morrison said any more.

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia84","Kyoto credits may not be needed; Exclusive","December 18, 2019 Wednesday","Australian Financial Review","The Morrison government is increasingly confident it will be able to reach its 2030 international climate targets without needing to use its controversial ""carry-over"" credits from previous agreements.While some countries continue to complain about Australia's proposed use of carry-over credits to count towards the 2030 target, federal Energy Minister Angus Taylor said the latest emission projections showed the nation was already heading in the right direction and ""over-delivering"" in reducing carbon pollution.""We are already on track to beat our 2030 targets and every year we look to improve our position,"" Mr Taylor said in an interview with The Australian Financial Review.""That's our approach, which is to over-deliver and we will look to over-deliver to 2030 as well.""This raises the scenario where the carry-over credits may not be needed and they could be just a safety net or insurance policy.Mr Taylor has previously insisted that Australia was well within its rights to use the ""Kyoto carry-over"" to reach the Paris targets, despite it being opposed by other countries.By signing up to the Paris Climate Agreement, Australia has promised to reduce its carbon emissions by 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. This equates to 395 million tonnes of carbon, according to the latest projections published early this month - down from the cumulative 695 million tonnes predicted in 2018.The so-called ""Kyoto carry-over"" would allow 411 million tonnes of excess emissions from the 2020 target to be rolled over towards, and exceed, the 395 million tonnes abatement task.The latest emissions projections from the Department of Environment and Energy show Australia has exceeded its emissions reduction task by about 43 million tonnes a year leading into the 2020 target - a figure the government is hoping will be replicated in the next decade.Mr Taylor said Australia was making good progress on achieving the 2020 target and was on the right track to 2030.""Our track record for finding additional abatement year-on-year has been extraordinary,"" he said.""There is a broad recognition that Australia has over-delivered. There are few countries with our track records.""Frontier Economics climate change head Matt Harris said he believed Australia would not need to use carry-over credits to reach its Paris commitments.""I find it hard to believe we won't reach the 2030 target without the carry-over. It was only four years ago we had the same debate about the 2020 target,"" Mr Harris said.""We've come down 3000 mega-tonnes in 10 years and there's another 10 years to go. If you look at that track record, it's always fallen, every update. It's now [falling] at least 120 mega-tonnes per update [year] for the 2030 target. That's the lowest it's fallen.""The 2019 projections of emissions up to the 2030 target now include the Victorian and Queensland 50 per cent renewable energy targets, which are being driven by the proliferation of rooftop solar as well as the Morrison government's $3 billion Climate Solutions Fund programs.Mr Harris said he believed the constant discussion of carry-over credits was a negotiating tactic ahead of Australia possibly increasing its carbon reduction targets at future climate talks.""They are using it as a negotiating tool or a safety net. But if you think you are going to meet the targets 'in a canter' and you are so confident of meeting targets, why would you need to keep them?"" he said.Mr Harris said projections in about three years, or near the next federal election, will confirm carry-over credits won't be needed for the 2030 target.Grattan Institute energy program director Tony Wood said it was possible for Australia to reach its 2030 targets without carry-over credits, but it might require some more policies to deliver carbon reductions.""The numbers say we are currently on track with carry-over credits but I wouldn't rule it out being without them,"" he said. ""Every year the numbers are coming down dramatically and the departments are shaking the tree pretty hard to get them.""Although not part of formal discussions at the recent COP25 climate talks in Madrid, Australia was chastised by some countries for using the so-called accounting short-cut to reach their 2030 climate targets.Mr Taylor said the carry-over credits was not the focus of the Madrid talks, which focused on Article 6 and an attempt to make international carbon markets work. An agreement on Article 6 could not be reached, with the decision being laid over until the next COP meeting, in Glasgow next year.""It would have been better for it [Article 6] to be resolved this year. It means it's a priority to be solved next year,"" he said. ""Australia doesn't plan to use international credits, however Australian companies may want to use them in their international operations and we think it's important to have a market that has integrity.""\l"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia85","Why we must talk about climate change","December 21, 2019 Saturday","The Courier","With catastrophic bushfires continuing to rage across NSW, Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia, recent statements by politicians implying it's offensive to talk about climate change in the face of bushfire victims' suffering, have prompted considerable backlash - from the nation's former fire chiefs, from the general public, and from bushfire victims themselves.Opinion: Mary DebrettFor politicians who have failed to develop policies to effectively mitigate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions driving anthropogenic climate change, the current drought and wild fires are obviously embarrassing, since they reflect what climate scientists have been warning for over three decades.In Australia the climate has now warmed by 1.4C. It is predicted that globally, unless more radical action is taken, we are on a path to reach 4-5C warming by the end of the century - leading to a hostile, severely diminished environment. With the COP25 meeting in Madrid concluding, we know those talks have failed to secure commitment to cut emissions to the requisite level.As Greta Thunberg noted, nations have used 'clever accounting and creative PR' to escape doing what is needed to keep global warming within 1.5C. Australia's attempt to carryover carbon credits from the Kyoto Agreement signed in 2007, to prove it has met commitments made at the Paris COP21 in 2015-even as our own official figures revealed the lie-offer good reason for all Australians to talk about climate change.The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , which was released in September this year, found global mean sea level is rising faster, with increasing rates of ice loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets and glaciers, which combined with a warming ocean is also increasing the likelihood of tropical cyclones and extreme waves, exacerbating coastal hazards. The Report also later noted that increased absorption of CO2 is increasing ocean acidification.With IPCC and UN initiatives failing to secure national commitments to the needed emissions targets at the International level, and with elected politicians failing to develop adequate mitigation policies at the national level, it falls to our local councils and to us, as ordinary members of the public, to push back for climate action. Think global, act local was never as relevant as now.Certainly the Ballarat region has been performing quite well on that score. With the City of Ballarat having endorsed the declaration of climate emergency in 2018 and unanimously passed its own Carbon Neutrality and Zero Emissions Action Plan in 2019, and recently appointing an Environment Officer. This year also saw the launch of GNET-The Grampians Regional Roadmap to Zero-a collaboration between environmental group, Beyond Zero Emissions and the Committee of Ballarat. Funded by DELWP, GNET will identify pathways towards a 100% renewable energy and a zero emissions economy for the Grampians region by 2050.Talking about climate change helps to raise public consciousness about the impact of our consumer and lifestyle choices, as well as contributing to better understanding of the scale of the problem we are all facing. You don't have to be an expert.Firstly, this is not a political issue-it's an existential one, as many have noted. The science of anthropogenic climate change has been clear for decades, and is clearly evidenced in the devastating extreme weather events that have wreaked havoc around the globe in recent years-heat waves, floods, droughts and wildfires - even in the Arctic. We humans are the cause-through GHG emissions from burning fossil fuels, methane landfill emissions, and other unsustainable industrial and agricultural practices.Secondly, the new bushfire reality is about to hit us. As former fire chiefs who have spoken up have confirmed, hotter temperatures arising from climate change have spawned fire storms that create pyrocumulonimbus clouds, changing the weather, producing dry lightning and violent winds that can carry embers up to 30-40 kilometres. With temperatures continuing to rise former fire chief, Greg Mullins, and 22 colleagues have appealed to government for action on climate change.Thirdly, talk about your lifestyle choices. No matter how small they may seem, explain how these help to reduce GHG emissions, while also possibly saving you money and making you healthier-growing your own food, sewing your own clothes, riding a bike, catching public transport, planting trees, using produce bags, keep cups and re-usable water bottles, eating less meat and dairy, trying to buy less, monitoring your use of the air conditioner, putting solar panels on the roof.Fourthly, acting to reduce emissions-whatever path you take-is a great way to address the depression that increasing numbers of us are now experiencing in thinking about the climate crisis. Taking action and talking about it has therapeutic value too.Many among us, like the frog in the simmering pot, are still barely aware of the scale of changes now on the horizon. So don't be a quiet Australian. As Climate Councillor and former Australian of the year, Tim Flannery, once said, 'it is the army of mice' that will in the end be left to do most of the heavy lifting in transitioning to the changes we need. Community is where real climate action is happening.Mary Debrett, President BREAZE\l"

Their output had a significant impact on the scattered Kiribati population - people from other islands travelled to South Tarawa by boat or canoe just to pick up the latest VHS, and later DVD, of their productions.In March 2019, Uan attended the Maoriland Film Festival in Otaki, New Zealand. During a discussion panel, she spoke passionately about NTK's work over the years. She ended with a humble request for assistance with archiving, taking one of those rectangular hard drives containing raw footage from her handbag and unwrapping it from a lavalava (sarong), then holding it up for the audience to see. The group of New Zealand and international filmmakers gasped at the condition of the drive, and the prospective loss of decades of visual chronicles, exposed to the elements in Kiribati.All but one of the 33 islands in Kiribati are less than two metres above sea level. Large parts of the country are expected to be under water by 2050. From 2003 to 2016 Kiribati was led by President Anote Tong, who successfully raised global awareness of the climate change threats faced by his country. At the United Nations in Bonn in 2017, Kiribati was described as one of the world's most vulnerable countries.Annual temperatures in South Tarawa have increased by roughly 0.18 degrees Celsius per decade since 1950, according to the conference's briefing paper. This warming, coupled with increasingly ferocious tidal storms and coastal flooding, is destroying the island's ecosystems.Saltwater that floods the islands from storm surges devastates land and property, polluting reservoirs that capture and filter groundwater for consumption. Salt water also jeopardises resources such as coconuts, pandanus and breadfruit, which residents rely on for food and many other household needs.In the Kiribati population, there has been a rise in waterborne diseases, among other climate-change-induced illnesses, including cholera and dengue fever. Warming oceans, combined with increased ocean acidification, disrupts sea life, which is the cornerstone of Kiribati identity and the country's economy. Kiribati depends almost entirely on its fishing sector for food and revenue, but the catch potential is expected to decrease by 70 per cent by the 2050s.Kiribati is one of 48 nations in the Climate Vulnerable Forum, a partnership of countries most under threat from global warming. These include Tuvalu, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Vanuatu, Samoa and the Marshall Islands.Kiribati once chaired the forum, and under Tong was a vocal proponent for limiting the temperature rise from global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Beyond this temperature, sea levels are expected to increase to a point that would make Kiribati uninhabitable. Despite global campaigns calling for ""1.5 to stay alive"", the Paris Agreement on Climate Change seeks to limit the temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius. This is devastating for most Pacific island countries.Anote Tong was vocal about the need for Kiribati to face climate-induced migration ""with dignity"". However, the current government, led by Taneti Mamau, rejects this vision of mass migration, instead emphasising local development. The government aims to develop and increase the land area on South Tarawa by about 100 acres, and on Kiritimati (also known as Christmas Island) by 767 acres. It also owns 22 square kilometres of land on Vanua Levu in Fiji, with potential for forestry, livestock farming and other activities to shore up its food and economic security as Kiribati farmland comes under threat.Reality too much for many to fathomThe level of carbon now in the atmosphere is more than 415 parts per million. The last time the Earth experienced these levels was during the Pliocene Epoch, between 5.3 and 2.5 million years ago. Then, global temperatures were 2 to 3 degrees Celsius higher, and the sea levels 25 metres higher. Pollution from climate change today is on track to push the Earth towards similar conditions. To many Australian voters, this reality is too much to fathom, presumed to be a hoax, or utterly unknown.Prime Minister Scott Morrison might support climate adaptation and mitigation programs in the Pacific through his ""Pacific step-up"", but he does not support similar domestic policies, such as increased research on climate change or the introduction of a carbon price, and Australia has no renewable energy targets beyond 2030. It is the world's second-largest exporter of coal but faces falling demand as its biggest customers - Japan, South Korea, China, Taiwan and India - all shift towards cleaner energy. Burning coal is in Australia a bit like the right to bear arms in the United States: a freedom that causes major planetary harm, but the issue is severely politicised and many are not willing to imagine a future without it.This protection of the mining industry is not new. For more than a century Australia has had a relationship with the South Pacific region that furthered its economic interests. Australian mining companies have been present in the Pacific since the beginning of the 20th century, wreaking havoc on ancient cultures and sustainable environmental practices while extracting phosphate as quickly as possible from places such as Nauru and Kiribati.The value of phosphate, the superphosphate fertiliser it produced, and the growth effects it had on Australian farming production and exports were massive. In 1983 a monograph produced by the Centre for Resource and Environmental Studies described phosphate as ""the magic dust of Australian agriculture"". In the case of Banaba, an island that forms part of Kiribati, the mining infrastructure was left to rust and decay. People there live among the asbestos-riddled rubble, in a place that looks more like a post-apocalyptic lunarscape than a Pacific paradise.When Peter Dutton made his flippant aside in 2015 in response to a quip by Tony Abbott about how islanders are not good at keeping to time (Dutton said, ""Time doesn't mean anything when you're about to have water lapping at your door"") Tony deBrum, the former foreign minister for the Marshall Islands, posted on Twitter, ""Next time waves are battering my home & my grandkids are scared, I'll ask Peter Dutton to come over, and we'll see if he is still laughing.""Former minister for the environment Melissa Price's words to Tong were also offensive. When she was introduced to him in a Canberra restaurant, it was widely reported - and verified by others in the restaurant - that she said, ""I know why you're here. It is for the cash. For the Pacific it's always about the cash. I have my chequebook here. How much do you want?""That kind of attitude towards Pacific island leaders needs to change. Such leaders have been criticising the production and consumption of fossil fuels and their impacts on the environment for almost 30 years. The former Nauru ambassador to the United Nations, Marlene Moses, wrote in 2016, ""For the people of small islands, understanding the importance of the ocean to human survival is as natural as breathing. If the ocean is healthy, we are healthy; if the future of the ocean is uncertain, so is ours.""The Pacific islands may be smaller states demographically and geographically, but the sea in which they sit covers one-third of the planet's surface area. Pacific leadership on climate change is necessary and inevitable.Knowledge a source of resilience for 2000 yearsThe knowledge inherent in these spheres has been the source of resilience for more than 2000 years in an oceanic environment with limited land, flora and fauna, allowing islanders not only to survive but to produce complex, creative societies.Australia is now saturated with messages about the existential threat of climate change, but the impacts will cut across all dimensions of human existence - the social, the political, the cultural, the economic, the environmental, and everything else that shapes our identities and relationships.Climate change is here today, not just in some distant future, and Pacific Islanders who cannot always crawl into air-conditioned, climate-controlled bubbles experience its effects on a daily basis. While the people of the Pacific are resilient and have survived centuries of upheaval, climate change is already at emergency levels in the region - representing some of the first and starkest signs of the greatest ecological threat to ever face humanity.Katerina Teaiwa is an associate professor in the School of Culture, History and Language at the Australian National University. This is an edited extract of her essay ""No Distant Future: Climate Change as an Existential Threat"" published in Australian Foreign Affairs 6 on July 15.\l"

It just doesn't make any sense,"" Ms Figueres told The Australian Financial Review.""It is not legal, it is not correct, it is not moral. It is cheating, period. When you finish one tournament - and the Kyoto Protocol has finished - then you start the next. But you do not pull something from the previous efforts and the previous regulatory framework to the next one.Backed by professors""There are few things that are black and white in life, but this is one. It's simply not allowed, period.""Her comments were backed up by nine law professors from Australian universities, who last week sent a letter to Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Energy Minister Angus Taylor, arguing it was legally invalid to apply the rules of one agreement to another.""Our considered view is that the proposed use of these 'Kyoto credits' is legally baseless at international law,"" the letter stated.""The Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement are entirely separate treaties. There is no provision in the Paris Agreement that refers to the Kyoto Protocol, nor to the units established under it.""The use of overachievement credits was permitted in the two-part Kyoto Protocol, which was signed in 1997 and expires this year. But the Paris Agreement, a separate agreement that comes into action this year and runs until 2030, makes no mention of Kyoto carryover credits.Nevertheless, the federal government plans to use its overachievement under Kyoto, worth a projected 411 million tonnes of carbon dioxide and equivalent greenhouse gases, to compensate for what could otherwise be a significant underachievement on its Paris target of 26-28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/policy/energy-and-climate/the-countries-with-the-biggest-hoard-of-kyoto-credits-20191216-p53kayIt is the only country in the world to explicitly say it will do this.In real terms, by 2030 Australia's greenhouse gas emissions are projected to be approximately 16 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, rather than 26-28 per cent, according to the government's own projections. The government's claim it is on track to ""meet and beat"" its Paris targets assumes the use of Kyoto carryover credits.Ms Figueres, who will be in Australia this week to publicise her new book, The Future We Choose, was generally scathing of the Morrison government's position on climate change.""I think it's very sad that Australia has gone back to the climate wars that it has had for over a decade.

In vulnerable hotspots, such as the arid lands of Kenya and Ethiopia, farming communities are already struggling with droughts and water scarcity that kill their cattle and threaten their very survival. The glacial-fed river basins of the Himalayan mountains, or the deltas of Bangladesh, India and Ghana, are increasingly prone to floods, landslides and powerful cyclones.As a result, men are often migrating further to keep their families going, looking for casual work in neighbouring towns or villages for a few days or weeks at a time, or to cities further away. Many try to return home when they can, with whatever they have earned. But during their absence, the entire burden of maintaining the family is on women. Read more: COP24 climate talks had a 'people's voice', but did anyone listen?Researchers are in a race against time to predict how climate change will affect these communities and help them adapt, with drought and flood resistant crops and cattle breeds for example. But it's often overlooked that climate change will affect one half of humanity significantly more than the other. Longstanding gender inequality means that within regions of the world that are particularly vulnerable to climate change, women are likely to suffer more than men.Isolated and overburdened HYPERLINK https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-019-0638-y.epdfshared_access_token=4mfTKRJS7Ul19oxvelJkt9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0M3vmHTwDEh-1oY0paTPagKQdnGNjWGwIVB8tSs27stsyJZ2ds4ieKlgqtw7u0bZ1aqc1ObZIFi-ZwH3qO1BBUKoHtU5JFuj4lcElA0EG9TlQ%3D%3DIn a recent study, we found that extreme weather and unpredictable seasons disproportionately weaken the agency of women to find well paid work and rise above rigid gender roles, even when these appear to be bending after decades of reform and activism. Without support in the form of assured drinking water, energy, childcare or credit, women end up working harder and in poorer conditions for lower wages.Women already in poverty are increasingly finding themselves in a vicious cycle of low productivity, indebtedness and food insecurity as crops and livestock fail, as we found particularly in semi-arid parts of Africa and India. Women in northern Kenya complained that they could no longer afford meat, so ate rice and potatoes instead, even when this wasn't enough to satisfy their hunger.Read more: Climate change and migration in Bangladesh - one woman's perspectiveAs environmental stresses accumulate, community support networks break down. When people are displaced and have to settle elsewhere, men search for work and women are left behind at home, often in unfamiliar surroundings and lacking support from friends and relatives. But even if they do know people, with all the challenges of running the household in a strange environment, there is little time to help others. With full responsibility for household chores, farming and caring for the children and elderly, women have less time to socialise or take part in community events, including meetings of the elected village government. If the state or charities can help, there's often competition for securing those benefits. In Namibia, people tend to stick with their ethnic groups to guarantee access through collective effort, but this means that ethnic minorities in the region are often excluded.In Mali, heavier burdens are placed on women who are young and less educated. In India or Pakistan, women belonging to a lower social class or marginal caste suffer the most. Gender relations differ in each place and according to each situation - they're often too variable to emerge in broad national and global assessments. We tried to find a way to generalise our findings across 25 very diverse locations, in Asia and Africa, without losing the nuance of each woman's experiences.The bare necessitiesIf much of the problem is structural, then short-term solutions like cyclone shelters or drought relief won't address the underlying causes of poverty and precariousness. Social safety nets that can ensure the basic necessities of food and shelter are needed, like the public distribution system for cereals in India, or the pensions and social grants available in Namibia.

The River Thames was six-foot-deep in a sludge of untreated human waste and industrial pollution, a breeding ground for cholera, diphtheria, and typhoid. But that summer the smell was so bad it invaded the Houses of Parliament. Committee rooms and cabinet meetings were abandoned. The government contemplated moving to Oxford. In a vain attempt to mask the stench, the curtains were soaked in a solution of concentrated bleach. But Parliament was forced to act. By August, new legislation had been passed that set the scene for a radical new sewage treatment plan for all of London. It saved many thousands of lives.Dramatic improvements in life expectancy during the second half of the 19th century reflected a genuine public health revolution. The Great Stink was a turning point in that history. Politicians could no longer ignore the evidence of their senses. It finally dawned on them that public health did not just affect the poor: it affected everybody.We are in the middle of another Great Stink. For millions of Australians all up and down the eastern seaboard (and elsewhere), you only have to open a window to know the reality of climate change. A smoke haze is blanketing the country - a firefront 6000 kilometres long, millions of hectares of land blackened, rainforests up in smoke, lives lost, hundreds of houses destroyed. Hazardous air quality. Asthma attacks. Respiratory complications affecting children, old people, the sick and the vulnerable, in our cities and towns. And summer has only just begun.You don't need me to tell you any of this. You only have to step outside and breathe in. Go on. Do it now. Tell me what you see - or don't see - through the haze.Last week, while the country went up in flames, the Australian Parliament was sitting. They could see and smell the evidence from the windows and front steps of Parliament House itself. But the government has done nothing. In response to a few rather desultory questions it assured the Australian public that there is no crisis, that everything is under control, and that bushfires are just a normal part of Australian life. Members of the Australian government can still be seen wandering the corridors of Parliament - not to mention their houses and electorate offices - with a handkerchief covering their nose, and their heads buried in the sand.Australian scientists have been predicting exactly this for years now - a hotter, drier continent, extreme weather conditions, more numerous and severe bushfires, and a much longer season. Now their predictions have come to pass - but apparently we are supposed to think this is just a lucky guess. Bushfires are just a natural disaster meaning, of course, a tragedy meaning, of course, no one's fault. The Liberal and National parties would rather we just put up with the stench, and destruction, and the deaths, than do anything about it. But isn't it time to wake up and smell the ashes?There is a small sculpture on Scott Morrison's desk. It is a figure of a boat, and it says: ""I stopped these"". For a long time, Australia's opposition parties have lagged behind in the highly competitive category of three-word slogans. Well, I have one. Stop the Fires.What would it take to stop the fires? It would mean resourcing our emergency services properly, at both the state and federal levels, and facing up to the new challenges posed by the now overlapping fire seasons in both the northern and southern hemispheres. It would mean addressing our global responsibility to move towards dramatic reductions in carbon emissions, rather than relying on denial, misrepresentation, and accounting tricks. It would mean embracing the huge opportunities that a low-carbon economy offers Australia. It would mean weaning our Prime Minister off his fossil fuel fetish.READ MORE:Jenna Price: The difference between Scott Morrison and Jacinda Ardern 'I feel like I've got to do more': The face of the South Coast fire Dermot O'Gorman: Australia is copping it at COP25 - and rightly so Stopping the fires means trying to save the Murray-Darling rather than turning a blind eye to its destruction by a handful of big agribusinesses. It means providing dramatic long-term assistance to help transition to forms of agriculture sustainable in a drying, warming climate. Australia spends up to $2 billion per year for the vindictive pleasure of making sure that a few refugees are kept in conditions of obscene cruelty. I suspect our struggling farmers would welcome that sort of money. Instead, what is the government's policy? Encouraging them to take out more loans in the vain hope that happy days will soon be here again. Just what this country needs. More debt.The Great Stink of 1858 was a moment when something shifted. British members of parliament could no longer ignore the evidence of their nostrils. In the Great Stink of 2019, we need our Parliament to shift too. We need our politicians to face up to the evidence of their nostrils. Climate change affects everybody. It is an emergency taking place - literally right under our noses.It's time to stop the fires. Will we look back and see this year as a turning point, a moment when reality finally trumped self-interest? Or will our politicians continue to show how much less courage they have than those of 1858? If so, there's another lesson we can learn from the Great Stink. Buy shares in bleach.

HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/world/north-america/trump-sets-stage-for-climate-change-election-20191105-p537kxTrump's formal withdrawal from the Paris Agreement was a ""huge blow"" in the fight against global warming.""On one side, [China's economic slowdown] will reduce production and maybe reduce pollution. But the environmental controls ??? may be too harsh for some enterprises,"" Dr Xue said.""Because [the government] has set the bar so high many enterprises - particularly small and medium-sized enterprises - cannot afford to comply with them. If they comply with the standards they cannot be viable. So the slowdown may have caused a great challenge.""Any backsliding by China on climate commitments would play into the Australian government's efforts to defend its own record on climate change against critics who say Australia is not doing enough. In the October quarter, China's economy grew at a weaker-than-expected 6 per cent, a 30-year low. Economists predicted the slowdown would continue in the last quarter of 2019, a result of the trade war with the US and weak domestic demand.China is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, accounting for nearly 30 per cent of global emissions, according to the International Energy Agency. As in Australia, around 60 per cent of electricity in China is generated by coal-fired power stations.China's emissions continue to rise, increasing 2.3 per cent in 2018. Under the Paris Agreement, the Chinese government has committed to ensuring emissions growth peaks by 2030.As part of the effort to hit this target, the Chinese government aims to limit coal-fired power to 58 per cent of total electricity generation by 2020.

But the government has invited anger in terms of the broad debate by being so inactive and partisan about climate change over the years.Morrison is struggling to navigate his way through these fraught days before Christmas. He's stressing unity - ""the country is working together ... to deal with the firefighting challenge"". He's refusing to yield to calls for a national summit or a COAG meeting on the fire effort, but he's highlighting the federal government's co-ordinating activities.He's placing the most positive spin he can on what Australia is doing on climate change, but all the time emphasising Australian emissions are only a tiny portion of the global total, ""so any suggestion that the actions of any state or any nation with a contribution to global emissions of that order is directly linked to any weather event ... is just simply not true"".The fires are putting pressure on the government by elevating the climate issue and opening a new division among Liberals. Only this time - and importantly - the internal wedge is coming from the left rather than the right of the party. The PM is being pushed to do more, rather than being held back.Morrison is no longer able to gloss over the climate debate. The big question for the next year or two is whether he will reposition the government.As former Treasury secretary Ken Henry has argued, ""today's catastrophic bushfires, and rapidly vanishing water security, again following years of drought, put the present government in a similar position"" to when John Howard moved on climate change in 2006.Morrison is the ultimate pragmatist and so, if he sees it in his interest, he may well be willing to readjust. Not radically, nor quickly. Just enough, as and when he judges it, to satisfy middle-ground voters.This week NSW's Liberal Environment Minister Matt Kean bluntly called out his federal colleagues' dancing around the climate-fires link.""Let's not beat around the bush ... let's call it for what it is. These bushfires have been caused by extreme weather events, high temperatures, the worst drought in living memory - the exact type of events scientists have been warning us about for decades that would be caused by climate change,"" said Kean, who is the leader at the state level of the party's moderate faction.""There has been a lot of talk since the federal election about ending the climate wars ... It's not time to end the climate wars. It's time to win the climate wars.""One federal Liberal says: ""for a long time [Kean's l"

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia95","The trio of obstacles on climate change","February 14, 2020 Friday 03:48 PM GMT","AFR Online","Despite the buzz around climate action at this year's World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, the world's current environmental prospects look grim. There are three obstacles: climate-change denial; the economics of reducing greenhouse-gas (GHGs) emissions; and the politics of mitigation policies, which tend to be highly regressive.According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, global carbon-dioxide emissions must be cut 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030, and then eliminated entirely by 2050, to have even a reasonable chance of preventing global warming of 1.5??C above pre-industrial levels. ""We need quick wins,"" warns the United Nations Environment Program in its latest \~ Emissions Gap Report, ""or the 1.5??C goal of the Paris Agreement will slip out of reach.""That is an understatement. Even if the current Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the 2015 \~ Paris accord are met, emissions in 2030 will be 38 per cent above where they need to be. Global average temperatures will be on track to rise by a disastrous 2.9-3.4??C by 2100, with continuing increases thereafter. The NDC targets would need to be roughly \~ tripled just to limit warming to 2??C, and would have to increase fivefold to achieve the 1.5??C goal.That is not going to happen. The only time in recent history when CO2 emissions have looked as though they might plateau was in 2014-2016, owing to weak global growth. According to the \~ Global Carbon Project, emissions have since increased again, by 2.7 per cent in 2018 and 0.6 per cent in 2019. Making matters worse, the December 2019 UN Climate Change Conference (COP25) was a dismal failure, resulting in no new climate pledges or clear messages of intent for this year's COP26 summit in Glasgow.Why is humanity so reluctant to save itself? First, many people simply do not accept the predictions issued by climate scientists. But denialism is the least serious of the three main obstacles. There will always be a minority for whom facts and logic are unwelcome distractions. Yet even US President Donald Trump must realise by now that climate change will undermine the future viability and profitability of Mar-a-Lago.As the real-world costs of climate-driven disasters mount over time, denialism will become less of an issue. Indeed, a November 2019 Yale University survey finds that 62 per cent of registered voters in the United States already would support a president ""declaring global warming a national emergency if Congress does not act"".The second major challenge is that GHG emissions are the quintessential global economic externality. Climate change doesn't respect borders; GHGs emitted anywhere will affect everyone eventually. That means there is a massive free-rider problem. Under current circumstances, it will always be individually rational to let others cut back on their emissions rather than doing so yourself. The only way to correct this problem is through collective rationality or enlightened self-interest. But given the current state of multilateralism, expecting a truly global effort in pursuit of the common good is a tall order.The third obstacle is that effective policies to reduce GHG emissions disproportionately hurt the poor (both globally and within countries). The International Monetary Fund recently calculated that the current effective global price of CO2 emissions is a mere $2 per ton. To limit global warming to less than 2??C, however, would require an average effective price of $75 per ton by 2030.I agree with Harvard University economist Kenneth Rogoff that a uniform global carbon-emissions tax is likely to be the best solution to the climate challenge, at least from an environmental perspective.But with such a tax in place, average household electricity prices over the next decade would increase cumulatively by 45 per cent, and gasol"

The great majority of existing plants should be phased out within 15 years.That is the message of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as delegates descend on Madrid for next week's COP25. There is no chance of keeping CO2 emissions below critical thresholds and preventing runaway climate change if this does not happen.So one might justifiably be aggrieved by news that China is engaged in a massive - if surreptitious - expansion of its coal power fleet in breach of earlier pledges, taking advantage of climate denialism in the White House to raid the global commons. Xi Jinping's industrial machine accounts for half the world's coal use. He is now adding a large coal plant every two weeks.China's emissions rose 4.7 per cent last year. It released more CO2 and methane than the US, the EU and Japan combined.Yet some of its provinces are literally doubling down.

Jiangxi would in theory become the world's fifth-biggest coal power.Data from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis show that the EU's coal use so far this year has fallen 23 per cent, thanks to wind power and a surge in carbon prices to (EURO)25 ($40) as Brussels drains excess contracts.

Companies are often not accounting for risks to sustainability. Nor do they account for how they are addressing environmental, social and governance issues relating to climate change.Civil society organisations, academics and journalists have begun questioning whether responsible investment can bring about the level and pace of change required to enable an inclusive climate change transition. They are also highlighting the high risk of HYPERLINK https://qz.com/1490365/esg-investing-risks-becoming-a-victim-of-its-own-success/greenwashing - when companies set ambitious climate goals but have no plans for how to get there.To better understand whether the financial industry is really shifting, we looked to South Africa, a country with a leading regulatory framework for responsible investment. Since 2011, all pension funds have been required to take a responsible investment approach as part of their fiduciary duty. A HYPERLINK https://www.iodsa.co.za/page/CRISACodeCode for Responsible Investment in South Africa) was released and in 2013 it supplied practice recommendations for institutional investors and their service providers. As a result, most South African institutional investors publicly pledged their support for responsible investment. But HYPERLINK https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0170840619878467our study, which tracks implementation from 2013 to 2019, found that the changes to investment practices were mostly superficial. More talk than actionWe looked at what South African institutional investors said they were doing on their websites or in their financial and other reports. The changes focused on publishing annual general meeting voting results and creating policies to increase transparency. Sustainability policies were generally rudimentary, using tailor-made definitions. They did not depart from ""business as usual"".And when we spoke to industry insiders, we found that even among responsible investment leaders, core investment practices and incentive structures remain largely unchanged.Portfolio managers talked about environmental, social and governance factors being an irritation. They said these often came at the wrong time in the investment process. Others explained that environmental or social data were still seen as ""fluffy"" and difficult to factor into investment decisions.Our findings are backed up by a HYPERLINK https://www.unepfi.org/publications/regions-publications/africa-middle-east-publications/fiduciary-duty-in-the-21st-century-south-africa-roadmap/recent report concluding that South African investors might be aware of these issues in theory, ""but may not understand what it means in practice"".Is ambiguity causing the implementation gap?We believe that part of the problem may lie in the way the concept of responsible investment was introduced. How a concept is initially framed guides how it will be interpreted and implemented. The initial framing defines the core problem and attributes responsibility. It also articulates potential solutions and motivates action.In an effort to bring companies on board, the principles for responsible investment were initially HYPERLINK https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0170840614563742framed using language that was flexible and compatible with investors' priorities around risk and returns. At the same time, the language sought to accommodate society's environmental and social concerns. For instance, in their \~ HYPERLINK https://www.unpri.org/signatories/become-a-signatorydeclarations, PRI signatories recognise that ""environmental, social, and corporate governance issues can affect the performance of investment portfolios"". Considering them ""may better align investors with broader objectives of society"". This early framing shifted the problem from the need to address environmental and social issues into a duty to consider how such factors might affect risks and returns. It failed to attribute any responsibility and it overly emphasised disclosure as a solution. As a result, investors' obligation to review their practices was left open to interpretation.While this framing boosted early adoption, it may have done so at the expense of effective change in the long term. The ambiguity of the language attracted investors to sign up to the principles. But it also allowed them to interpret the principles in a manner consistent with how they had always done business. They weren't forced to review and change their practices and priorities. By appearing to acknowledge societal demands for change, the framing of responsible investment seems to have inadvertently conveyed a false impression of progress. When we spoke with civil society organisations, they lamented how seeing their language reflected in the early framing may have delayed their efforts to hold investors to account.The need to reframe responsible investmentAs emissions and inequality continue to rise, responsible investment needs a reframing. The new frame needs to be clear on the core problem. It must attribute responsibility, motivate action and outl"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia99","Cooling the atmosphere may be our only hope","January 11, 2020 Saturday","Canberra Times (Australia)","The release of some 910 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide since the onset of the industrial age is leading human society to an existential impasse. Reports from the Madrid COP-25 climate conference suggest negotiations were almost exclusively focused on reduction of carbon emissions. This avoids the evidence that the high atmospheric concentration of CO2, at 410 parts per million (or 500 ppm when combined with methane and nitrous oxide) has created amplifying feedbacks. These include the release of methane from permafrost, desiccated vegetation, extensive fires, a reduced capacity of warming oceans to absorb CO2, and the melting of ice sheets, which opens ocean and land tracts that absorb infrared radiation, pushing global temperatures further upwards.Due to these amplifying feedbacks and the long-term residence of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, attempts to limit further temperature rises to 1.5 degrees, or a maximum of 2 degrees, by emissions reduction alone may not be possible. Indeed, whereas abrupt reduction in CO2 emissions is absolutely essential, no one knows how to prevent further warming, for the following reasons:An increase in evaporation due to warming of the land and oceans leads to further heating due to the greenhouse effect of water vapour. This factor, significant in the tropics, is less important in the dry subtropical zones and relatively minor in the polar regions. The release of methane from melting permafrost and bubbling of methane hydrates from the oceans has already raised atmospheric methane levels from about 800 to 1863 parts per billion - which, given the radiative effects of methane being 25 times that of CO2, is significant. As the oceans warm they become less capable of taking up carbon dioxide. Encroachment of tropical and subtropical climate zones into temperate Mediterranean-type climate zones leads to extensive fires, constituting a factor in the current bushfires raging across eastern Australia, which have already released 250 million tonnes of CO2 - almost half of country's annual emissions in 2018.READ MORE:Opinion: Localised fire knowledge is vital to our survival on this continent Ebony Bennett: The bushfire crisis is a wake-up call we can't afford to ignore Opinion: The world is paralysed by a fear of going it alone on emissions reduction Stabilisation and cooling of the climate would include two principle approaches: solar shielding and CO2 sequestration. However, solar shielding by injected aerosols is bound to be transient, requiring constant reinjection. According to Professor James Hansen, carbon sequestration in soil using the biochar method (oxygen-free combustion using residues of crops, forestry and animal waste) would sequester large amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere. The biochar method helps soil retain nutrients and fertilisers, reducing the release of greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide.Other methods of carbon sequestration, if applied on a large scale, include the streaming of air through basaltic rocks, where the CO2 is incorporated with calcium and magnesium as carbonates.The big question is how effective these methods are in reducing CO2 levels on a global scale - at the very least in being able to balance emissions, currently at 36.8 billion tonnes of CO2 per year. Whereas each of the methods I've mentioned have advantages and disadvantages, it is hard to see an alternative way of cooling the atmosphere. Budgets on a scale of military spending ($1.7 trillion in 2017) would be required for any attempt to slow down the current trend across climate tipping points to have a chance of working. The choice humanity is facing is whether to spend its dwindling resources on wars or on defence of life from the climate calamity.Dr Andrew Glikson is a paleo-climate scientist and a visiting fellow at the ANU's Research School of Earth Sciences.\l"

That is, the response is, 'We can do nothing that will help.'""By making that response, we are persuading ourselves that we are helpless,"" Mr Hayne said.""Helplessness is then coupled with short-termism. At the national level, short-termism is expressed as: 'Doing something now will have adverse effects on employment in some part or parts of the country. That would be bad for the national economy. Therefore, we will do nothing.'""He said directors must not be distracted by the ""framing of the political debates"", urging them instead to look at standards set out by the international business-led Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, which has been endorsed by Australian regulators.Mr Hayne's remarks were made at a closed roundtable discussion hosted by the Centre for Policy Development late last month in Sydney. Also present were RBA deputy governor Guy Debelle, Bank of England executive director Sarah Breeden, APRA executive board member Geoff Summerhayes, and ASIC commissioner John Price.Representatives from big business, including ANZ, Macquarie, QBE, AustralianSuper, Coles and UBS, were also present.Government representatives who attended were from the Department of Environment and Energy, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, and Treasury. Greg Combet, the Labor environment minister who oversaw the Gillard government's short-lived carbon tax, was also present in his capacity as chairman of industry super-owned fund management colossus IFM Investors.The roundtable concluded: ""First, the climate crisis is upon us, and decision-makers across the Australian economy have a clear and increasing obligation to address the risks and opportunities it presents. It is clear climate change is a ratcheting risk, a trend change that is highly interactive, systemic and irreversible, and one which will impact every aspect of Australian society.""History is no guide to its future impacts, meaning that forward-looking scenario analysis is needed to manage the physical and transition risks it will generate.

""Greta took care of Lenny, babysat, you know would feed him his breakfast if I asked her to.""And Svante kept our spirits high, he's just really funny and he knew how to make us all laugh, which was great.""The teen activist with a 'microscopic' egoThe Australians, who make a living out of filming their adventures and posting them to YouTube, said they looked forward to showing a different side to the teen.""So one of the things that I really wanted to do on this trip was to film Greta with Lenny, film her stressed and worried and really show the human side of her,"" Mr Whitelum said.""It is striking because when you lay eyes on this girl she's very petite. I mean when I'm looking around the boat for someone that I think might be able to help pull down a sail or something it's not going to be Greta.""But if there's a discussion to be had on climate change or politics then she's the first person you'd turn to.""In little more than a year Ms Thunberg has become a household name, amassed millions of followers on social media and inspired a generation of climate activists.Yet the teen's explosion into the public domain has also seen her used as a verbal punching bag for those who disagree with her message or her methods - with prime ministers and presidents among her most outspoken critics.Ms Carausu said she had been surprised at how the teenager, whose ego she described as ""microscopic"", responded to all the attention.""Greta being 16 you'd think that she would let those negative comments really get to her and anger her, but honestly it is the opposite,"" she said.""I think it might be because she has Asperger's, which she also talked about, it's like it doesn't seem to really worry her.""She really didn't want all of this attention ... she's not in it for herself, she's in it for the cause and she wants people to use their voices - that was the main thing she spoke about.""Much more than an £ngry kid'In a brief media conference upon her arrival in Lisbon, Ms Thunberg was asked how she felt about politicians HYPERLINK blaming climate activists for current environmental problems.""I mean when people in power are criticising you like that, that is only proof that you are having an impact,"" she told the crowd to loud applause.""That you among others are bringing change or trying to bring change and many people don't want that, and of course they will do everything they can to try to prevent change from happening.""And when asked about being an ""angry kid"" the teen took her time to formulate her response but did not shy away.""I think people are underestimating the force of angry kids,"" she said.""I mean we are angry, we are frustrated and that is because of a good reason.But for those among the five who sailed alongside Ms Thunberg she was much, much more than angry.""I think they [people] will be shocked at how human and vulnerable she is,"" Mr Whitelum said.""If they see her the way that I do now, as a very nice, quiet, respectful, brave young lady, I think that it will change a lot of minds.""Strong bonds form in difficult crossingMr Whitelum, who spoke to the ABC after having slept for 12 hours straight, said while the crossing had not been without its challenges it had been more than worth it.""So a crossing in November in the north Atlantic is going to always be very difficult,"" he said.""There's going to be a huge amount of challenges and that's because of the weather systems that are just constantly going through, and they're going through faster than your boat.""You need to position yourself and be looking at the weather forecast constantly and making the best guess as to the safest place to put your boat.Both Mr Whitelum and Ms Carausu said they could not believe how well Ms Thunberg and her father had managed the trip.""And she was really relaxed on that trip, you could tell the difference,"" Ms Carausu said.""Before we left with all the media she was like in her own little world and then as soon as we got on the boat and left she was overwhelmed with what had just happened.""But within a few days she was at ease and doing her exercises, listening to her audio book, helping me with the cooking and she just seemed really relaxed, you could tell.""'We went through something huge together'Both said they would miss Ms Thunberg, her father and their many games of competitive Yahtzee, but had hopes they, along with Ms Henderson, would all stay in touch.""We just went through something huge together ... it's a bit weird to never talk again after what we just experienced,"" Ms Carausu said.""We'll be talking about this for the rest of their lives I'm sure - it's a story for your grandchildren.""Mr Whitelum said the trip added a new sense of meaning to their voyage.""Elayna and I have crossed oceans before ... but this particular trip injected a sense of adventure and purpose into our journey that we hadn't really had before,"" he said.Ms Thunberg told the crowd on Tuesday she planned to spend a few days in Lisbon getting used to being on land again before heading to join the climate summit.And when asked what she would be doing after that, the teenager - who plans to go back to school next year after taking a year off - simply said, ""home"".\l"

This needs to be the goal of all state governments and the federal government as well.These governments in cooperation with each other should appoint an independent authority that has responsibility for implementing strategies that are needed. Clearly, appropriate people with expertise need to be chosen, and it can be done in a bipartisan way. Once chosen this group's recommendations, free of political interference need to be accepted and acted on.Governments need to budget properly for this. In this regard special interest groups concerns must not dominate what can and cannot be done.While we must congratulate what the firefighters have done this year, emphasis needs to be put on fire prevention as the first priority followed by fighting fires as they occur.Denis Ryan, BelmontHow far we have fallenNick O'Malley's observations about how the world now regards Australia in relation to climate change is an accurate assessment and demonstrates quite starkly how far this country has fallen on this critical issue (""The world is watching us burn,"" Comment, 4/1).We are not a leader - as we should and could be - in moving away from fossil fuels and towards renewables. Our lack of any energy policy and our performance at COP25 in Madrid shows very clearly we have become a laggard.Our attempts to use a wonky accounting trick to carry forward Kyoto credits in order to meet our very modest Paris targets is shameful.Rowan Russell, Kirribilli, NSWOur exceptional ABCLiving in a highly fire-prone area of Victoria, we rely each summer on our local ABC for current fire warnings, information and updates. This year the coverage has been exceptional and has possibly even saved lives. Staff whose throats are affected by the thick smoke have read updates over many hours to keep us informed and safe.It would be wonderful to see the efforts of the ABC acknowledged by the federal government restoring or increasing their funding but sadly, the heartfelt thanks from their listening communities may be the best they can expect.Marg Sneddon, Wangaratta SouthDistasteful chicaneryRight now, when incredibly brave and dedicated volunteer firefighters and thousands of fire victims need huge financial support, Scott Morrison aims to divert some of that support to his political party.Relief that he was finally flat out being ""proactive"", quickly turned to disappointment on finding he has both the inclination and time for this very distasteful chicanery.Marianne Dalton, BalnarringI was just visited by a pleasant young man seeking donations on behalf of the United Nations refugee agency.I was happy to make a donation of up to $200, but only one-off donations of $360 were acceptable. The alternative was to contribute a sum monthly, of at least $40, by direct debit or BSB. None of these options appealed to me.This isn't the first time I have been given similar alternatives to donate money to agencies, most of whom do a good job. I think organisations need to re-think their policy about securing donations as I am sure they are missing out on a lot of one-off donations of various amounts.Claire Hogan, NorthcoteStart planning nowScott Morrison seems unsure how to go about exercising leadership in the current bushfire catastrophe.Here are some suggestions. Start planning. Planning to rebuild communities - if they can be rebuilt. Planning to restore or replace the businesses and livelihoods of those who have lost everything but their lives. Plan to restore confidence in the domestic and international tourist industries - who will be making bookings for next summer now?Without detracting from focus on the present, start planning for next year - there is no reason to believe it will be any better, but hopefully Australia can be better prepared to supply the needed resources.Helmut Simon, Oak ParkOur Prime Minister has come under criticism for his slow response to bushfires and the lack of a coordinated national response.How galling that only hours after making the announcement about additional support that people have been calling for, the Liberal Party posts an ad on Twitter and a video detailing the announcements, authorised by Scott Morrison himself.I cannot recall any other time when a political leader has used a national catastrophe to make political mileage.Marg D'Arcy, RyeOnce a showman ...Following his humiliation, locally and globally, at the fire ravaged town of Cobargo last week, our Prime Minister has tweeted a 50-second self-promotional video acclaiming what he is now doing to combat the bushfire crisis. ""Shameless and shameful"", tweeted the UK's Piers Morgan, normally a friend to populist conservatives. I would add, ""hugely embarrassing"".Wasn't it P.T. Barnum who said ""I am a showman by profession ... and all the gilding shall make nothing else of me""?Neil Hudson, East MelbourneA supreme ironyIt is a supreme irony that the effect of climate change is often visually represented by hungry livestock in dry paddocks, when livestock farming is one of the major drivers of environmental degradation and climate change.Mechanisms for this include the clearing of native vegetation for pasture, cattle water consumption (50,000 to 100,000 litres to produce 1 kilogram of beef), emissions from belching and fecal matter (leading to pollution of water tables and rivers and ocean runoffs), soil degradation (compaction and acidification, spreading of weeds), etc.All this without even going into the negative health effects and ethical concerns.David Gillespie, WarragulHorne's words ring true""Australia is a lucky country run mainly by second rate people who share its luck.""Isn't it about time for us to accept the bitter ironies in both parts of Donald Horne's observation in 1964?Nick Jans, MarysvilleIn hindsight, a very bad jokeWhat he needs to bring into Parliament now (and he will need to be very brave), is a carbon price policy.How good would that be.Jon Smith, LeongathaStick to the programOf course the Prime Minister should keep his trip to India and Japan.There are plenty of politicians here who can keep up the support for the emergency measures.

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia108","Green finance needed to tackle climate change","January 16, 2020 Thursday","The Australian","A new year and a new decade should be a time for optimism, but it's hard to shake the sense of frustration around action on climate change.Last month's 25th Conference of Parties (COP 25), the United Nations' annual climate change conference, reaffirmed the importance of reducing global carbon emissions but failed to set out an ambitious new agenda for doing so.In 2015, COP 21 produced the Paris Agreement, which recognised the urgent need to drastically cut emissions by 2030 to keep the global temperature rise below 1.5 degrees. Each COP since then has renewed the commitment to that goal. But so far, we're failing to achieve it, and failing badly.A recent UN report revealed the still-growing gap between carbon reduction targets and actual carbon emissions. Each year that emissions continue to rise makes it harder to meet our 2030 targets. Harder to protect our natural environment. Harder to ease the economic pain of climate change.Injecting new urgency into the actions of governments and businesses should be the priority. In many countries, decisions are being made now that will shape entire economic structures for decades to come. If those decisions are not made on a sustainable, low-carbon basis, we'll be locking in high emissions for the foreseeable future.Sometimes, climate change can feel like an impossibly huge problem to tackle. But the solution can perhaps be summed up in one word - investment. National governments and other state entities have their part to play, but only the private sector can marshal the sum of money required.That means boosting the green finance market. Investor appetite for green products is growing - in an HSBC survey conducted earlier this year, 63 per cent of our investor clients said they would enter or expand their presence in green finance over the next two years.However, the market is still sub-scale, held back by a lack of investible projects. Looking at green bonds alone, issuance in the first three quarters of 2019 was almost $US190bn, a big leap from the roughly $US115bn in the same period last year. But this is only a small dent in the trillions of dollars of green investment required by 2030.Worse still, only 26 per cent of issuance in 2019 was attached to emerging market projects, far below what is required to guarantee long-term sustainable economic growth in those countries.Targeted changes can make a difference, though. The first is encouraging better disclosure of climate risks. When investors have a clear idea of which businesses and sectors are most exposed to the impact of rising temperatures, they can make better decisions with their money.Wide adoption of standardised disclosure principles, such as those published by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, will increase the number of viable projects for investors, and help with the second change - driving more green finance activity in the real economy.So far, green finance issuance has been dominated by national governments and financial entities. That can't continue. Green finance participation is particularly important in high-carbon sectors, such as energy generation and heavy manufacturing.Here, transitioning to lower emissions is fraught with risk, but will provide huge opportunities for those firms that are successful. The right kind of financing at the right time will be crucial. There are some signs that these sectors are starting to get to grips with the transition - recently we've seen the formation of industry organisations, such as Responsible Steel, that push for lower emissions in specific sectors of the economy. The longer businesses take to adjust to a low-carbon mindset, the more likely they are to suffer blowback from climate-aware consumers and investors.The third change is making sustainable infrastructure an asset class in its own right. A number of studies show that there is currently a global infrastructure investment deficit of between $US40 trillion and $US70 trillion. We simply don't spend enough money on big ticket items like roads, railways and power generation.Bridging this gap sustainably is vital. A separate asset class would allow products to become more standardised, more transparent and properly impact-linked.The need for infrastructure and other green investment in cities is particularly acute. Cities generate over 70 per cent of global carbon emissions, but most cities do not have direct capital market access and cannot easily invest money to reduce this figure.That's why the fourth change on the wish list is greater product innovation. This will provide more investment avenues to help turn promising, small-scale climate policies or products into mass-effect solutions. Many cities, for example, have pioneered projects that reduce the carbon emissions of waste disposal, or increase funding for greener buildings. Also encouraging is the developing ""blue bonds"" market, where investor returns are linked to the preservation of specific ecosystems.This is a pivotal year for climate change. COP 26, held in Glasgow next November, will be crucial for the immediate and long-term future of our planet. We hope that it can point to more concrete achievements than those of the last few years.Daniel Klier is HSBC's group head of sustainable finance\l"

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia110","The world is paralysed by a fear of going it alone","January 4, 2020 Saturday","Canberra Times (Australia)","Over the last few days senior members of the Australian government have talked about fires, global emissions and what Australia can do and should do.The Prime Minister was categorical that the emissions reductions policies of the government would protect the Australian environment. That is, the policies in place would have a tangible and positive impact on ecological systems that are stressed and shocked to breaking point.Meanwhile, the Minister for Energy, Angus Taylor, recently wrote that because Australia is responsible for only 1.3 per cent of global emissions, ""we can't single-handedly have a meaningful impact without the co-operation of the largest emitters such as China and the US"".Now, both statements cannot simultaneously be true. Either the policies of the government are having a meaningful and positive impact. Or they are not.As it turns out, Mr Taylor was right and the Prime Minister was careless.The scrupulous, verified work of professionals and experts demonstrate that humanity cannot go on this way. We cannot expect a different outcome if policy continues exactly as before.Certainly Australia's emissions are relatively small compared to, say, the United States or India. In 2017, the United States emitted 4800 MtCO2; China, 9300 MtCO2; India, 2200 MtCO2. Australia's emissions totalled 385 MtCO2.In 1977, the United States emitted 4800 MtCO2; China, 1200 MtCO2; India, 237 MtCO2. Australia's emissions were 196 MtCO2.The Coalition government makes the point that we should not sacrifice our economy by cutting emissions unilaterally and in a way that results in no overall reduction in emissions.It's an argument based on the economic problem of the free rider -an individual who consumes resources, public goods or services, but does not pay. A lighthouse, for example, benefits all who sail under its beam, but without an explicit scheme to ensure payment, no sailor pays for its operation and maintenance. In this instance, the sailor is a rider for free on long-suffering taxpayers.And so it follows that Australia should do no more, because to do more would damage our economy and make no difference to the environment. Time, our Energy Minister says, for the free-riders, India and China, to do their bit - or do a lot.Not surprisingly, these two countries take a different view. The life of a Chinese or Indian citizen is on average much tougher than that of an Australian. According to the World Bank, in 2018, the average Australian earned approximately $US57,000. In China, GDP per capita was $US7755; in India, $US2100.Before the Prime Minister was mugged by the reality of fire at home, he was, very properly, about to embark on an official visit to India. And he would have been briefed on the words of the Prime Minister of India, Mr Narendra Modi at the Paris Climate Summit in 2015.For Mr Modi, developed nations brought global warming down on the head of the planet and must now take responsibility. His view perhaps is coloured by the reality that the income of the average Australian is 27 times more than that of the average Indian.We hope advanced nations will assume ambitious targets and pursue them sincerely. It is not just a question of historical responsibility. They also have the most room to make the cuts, and make the strongest impact. And climate justice demands that, with the little carbon space we still have, developing countries should have enough room to grow.From Australia, even in the middle of a firestorm, the scale and intensity of the challenges that Mr Modi has to address are hard to understand. According to the National Institution for Transforming India, about 820 million people face the real problem of water scarcity; 163 million live without ready access to clean water.The Indo-Gangetic Plain of northern India is one the largest catchments in the world. Water flows and availability are largely dependent on seasonal monsoon rains. In the north and west the Indus Basin is fed by the glaciers of the Tibetan plateau.Global warming will change the intensity, duration and timing of monsoon rains and diminish the amount of water stored and released as glacial melt. Global warming will compromise supply at the very same time as the demand for water - for agriculture, for industry, for homes, for the environment - is increasing.READ MORE:Jack Waterford: Morrison is burning up his electoral credit Opinion: The way forward on bushfires isn't through the federal government Opinion: Australia is copping it at COP 25 - and rightly so To manage water better is the test that a developing India faces. But to do so requires resources and economic growth and investment. In the short term, the solution to the problem, if nothing else were to change, is the toxic cause of the problem itself.For Australia, slight or inadequate inaction by India - or China or the United States for that matter - dooms our hopes for change that is immediate, tangible and meaningful.The difficulty in implementing tangible and effective measures as a global community arises because we confuse the nature of the problem, which is static, with the nature of the solution, which is dynamic.The problem is static in that everybody perceives themselves at a moment in time to be worse off by acting unilaterally. If Australia cuts emissions then we are disadvantaged. India thinks it unconscionable that it should forgo the benefits of growth to address a problem not wholly of their making. In a static moment in time, both positions are absolutely right.But meaningful action requires joint action through time. And in this dynamic sense, it requires a focus on outcomes - the goal of limiting warming to 2 degrees - and what must be done to realise this. Justice, of course, requires a sharing of the burden, because only a sharing of the burden will prompt and sustain action.If Australia believes we have done enough then we reduce the chance that others will act. The worm will have fully turned because others, whose agreement is essential, can take as an excuse that Australia is nothing more than a free-rider, motivated by bad faith.And come that moment, the possibility of action is lost.Chas Savage is the chief executive officer of Ethos CRS.\l"
"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia111","Territory government is author of its hospital misfortunes","December 26, 2019 Thursday","Canberra Times (Australia)","In seeking to explain the increasingly bleak performance of the ACT's public hospitals, Minister for Health Rachel Stephen-Smith has overlooked the most obvious issue.That is, without doubt, the decision taken in the 2012-13 ACT budget, and repeated in every budget since, to reduce funding for health care by approximately 1 per cent in real terms.Over the period since 2012-13, the ACT government has not made allowance in the health budget for population growth, the ageing of the community, changes in technology or for increases in wages or the price of medicine.While a cut of 1 per cent in real terms may seem insignificant, in the context of the ACT health budget it equates to at least $100 million, on average, per annum.As a consequence of the cuts the ACT government, in 2013-14 changed the target for bed occupancy in its public hospitals, from 85 per cent, which is the target generally applied across Australia, to 90 per cent. It followed up over the two years from 2015-16 to 2017-18, years of solid population growth in the ACT, by reducing the number of beds in Canberra and Calvary public hospitals by 2.5 per cent or 28 beds in total.The increasing inability of our public hospitals to meet the needs of the Canberra community is due, in the main, to cuts to their funding.Jon Stanhope, Bruce The Prince of Peace Just over a century ago, in the midst of warfare at the Western Front, combative soldiers held a spontaneous and unofficial truce.The metallic chatter of gunfire gave way to the singing of Silent Night, as men emerged from the trenches in order to shake hands, exchange food, express Christmas greetings and compare family photographs.How was this possible? Through the mediation of the Prince of Peace himself.Many of us would no doubt still be feeling emotionally bruised, regarding the abject suffering and sorrow we have witnessed this year both overseas and within our own nation. In particular, the ruthlessness of summer bushfires leave an indelible stain of sorrow on affected communities.Thankfully, the endearing and enduring humble nativity story, I believe, still speaks afresh to the questioning human heart. Quite simply, the incarnation reminds us each year that, far from God remaining distant and mysterious, we who are grieving have not been left stranded.In the words of the great English hymn writer Charles Wesley: ""Peace on earth and mercy mild; God and sinners, reconciled.""And so, may we all not indeed forget to remember the true reason for the season, and embrace that hope, which surpasses the tremulous trials of a world so desperately in need of rejuvenation.Peter Waterhouse, Craigieburn Not anxious, just mad The word anxiety implies psychological distress. Scott Morrison keeps claiming his absence is causing anxiety.I disagree. Disgust, anger, fury and contempt at his absenteeism is closer to the mark.If he wants to take his children on holiday because he promised them a holiday and because he wants a normal life, then he can't be PM and should resign immediately.Being PM comes with great privilege but also great responsibility.Morrison has shown he wants one but not the other.E R Moffat, Weston \'e2\€  Apology hollow Morrison's subtly qualified apology for leaving the country he is supposed to be leading for a family holiday in Hawaii rings hollow when he announces upon his return that there will be no change to his government's climate change policy.Australia's climate change policy settings were heavily criticised at the UN's COP25 climate summit in Madrid.Australia was slated for lagging on emissions reduction, and, despite claims to the contrary by Mr Morrison, is not on track to meet its very modest Paris Agreement commitment without the dubious use of carry-over carbon credits from the Kyoto Protocol.This tactic has been cited as setting a very poor example for developing nations with high per capita emissions. Australia is a ""leaner"", not a ""lifter"" on emissions and climate change action.Douglas Mackenzie, Deakin Time to be free As Australia prepares to enter another year constitutionally tethered to Great Britain, the irony of Brexit is as unmistakable as Boris Johnson's luxurious mop of hair.In the space of less than four years, Britain will almost certainly have extricated itself from the EU because a majority of British people decided that membership of the EU compromised British independence.Meanwhile, Australia clings to the Motherland like an adult in their 30s who desperately wants to remain living at home, even though the parents have cleared out their bedroom years ago.How long will Australia keep haunting the spare room before we decide to get our own place?Mark Slater, Melba Outrage justified It is not just the residents of Coombs and Wright who are feeling outraged and betrayed by the apparent lack of planning process in the ACT (Letters, December 22). What is the point of an expensive Territory Plan administered by expensive public servants if at the first whisper of a developer the response from ACTPLA is ""Yes master"".There must be a critical flaw in the Planning and Development Act 2007. The public has a right to know and have it rectified immediately.The driver here seems to be the Lease Variation Charge. The concept of the LVC is that the profit gained from lease variation is shared between the lease holder and the ACT government. This is clearly inappropriate when the lease is brand new. Worse than that, the government codified LVCs in 2017 into a table of suburbs and localities within those suburbs.Coombs and other recently developed suburbs are not listed, seemingly LVC exempt. Parts of others are not covered by the localities map, including in suburbs developed decades ago. Developments varied to exactly 101 dwellings, and residential leases in commercial localities also seem LVC exempt. No wonder developers are seeking lease variations. It's pure profit.Peter Bradbury, Holt Wrong Scomo, wrong The Prime Minister returned on Sunday night and at his first TV conference he spoke of the anxiety he may have caused by being away while Australia burned. Let's make it clear to the Prime Minister, people were experiencing anger at his decision to take a holiday as this extreme fire event engulfs much of our country. The anxiety was caused by the fires and the unknown capacity of destruction these fires raging across the country will cause.Twice in the past week the highest temperatures recorded in our history have been broken; fact not fiction. Regional towns are close to running out of water. Some regional towns have water tankers transporting drinking water to their communities.And yet, you are still stubborn enough to believe your government is acting and serving the Australian people in their best interest. How sad.Penny Costello, Giralang We all make sacrifices When members of the Australian Defence Force make promises to their children about holidays they do so knowing that service to our country takes precedence over that promise.So, when our government tells them that their duty to their country requires them to serve their country and abandon their promises to their family they do. Members of the ADF, as directed by our government, are currently supporting the firefighting effort around Australia. And yet the leader of that government has just explained that his promises to his children take precedence over his duty as the Prime Minister.Either he thinks his role as Prime Minister is purely symbolic and our country doesn't require his presence or he's a hypocrite.Maybe he should act symbolically and resign since he doesn't seem to believe he has anything to do.Dave McLachlan, Kambah It's a mystery I cannot understand the howls of rage against our PM for daring to arrange a family holiday well before the magnitude of the current bushfires was known.He immediately cut short his break after learning the extent of the tragedy, but had to wait a day to get the last available seat on a flight back to Australia. He was then castigated for not returning earlier.Tired and stressed prime ministers do not make good leaders, but it seems ScoMo is between a rock and a hard place. He's damned if he does and damned if he doesn't.Roslyn Philips, Tea Tree Gully, SA TO THE POINT A BIG CALL NICHOLAS Re: ""Post holiday blues could haunt the Prime Minister"" (December 24, p16).

Some, I understand, are in receipt of Newstart.For some inexplicable reason this vital volunteering, so valued by the community particularly at this crucial time, does not count towards the ""mutual obligations"" Newstart recipients must undertake so as to continue being paid this admittedly paltry sum.Perhaps the federal minister who administers this scheme, Stuart Robert, might be able to throw some light on this, given his own ability to be granted paid leave from Parliament to take a self funded family trip to Israel during the 2019 Parliamentary annual sitting timetable; an exhausting total of 35 sitting days.The UK Parliament, by contrast, sits about 150 days per annum.Definitely smacks of ""Do what I say"" not ""Do what I do"".Ann Darbyshire, Hughes McClellan corrected Justice Peter McClellan says the royal commission was told by ""more than one leader"" in the Catholic Church that child sexual abuse was seen as a (mere) moral failure and not a crime (""Commissioner condemns Catholic leaders"", canberratimes.com.au, December 10).His speech gave the impression that this was still the common view amongst Catholic leaders. It is not.Whatever may have been the case for some church leaders in the past, the commission heard from many current Catholic bishops, myself included, that we have always regarded child sexual assault as a crime as well as a grave sin, and treated it as both.I am appalled by the criminal acts of some clergy, religious and lay church workers in the past, ashamed of the failure of some church leaders to respond appropriately, and committed to doing all we can to ensure these terrible crimes are never repeated.Tarring all past, present and emerging church leaders with the same brush in this matter, or implying that nothing has changed in the church since these matters came to light, is plain wrong.It also fails to acknowledge the efforts of many good people who have contributed to this change and continue to do so.Most Rev Anthony Fisher OP, Archbishop of Sydney Off peak power A major limitation of coal power in the energy industry was the lack of flexibility to respond to demand.This resulted in an excess of power at night with the market creating ""off peak"" rates as a response. With increasing energy industry reliance on sunlight, when will we see lower rates coinciding with peak demand during the day?Once upon a time, changes in government did not result in axing successful policies of the previous government. The ""carbon tax"" was a success, and the ""NEG policy"" was an additional positive proposal to address the industry capacity to respond to demand.The energy industry recognises that the future is coming ""ready or not"", but is paralysed by government proclamations from the pulpit .Australia could have been a leader instead of a pariah state at in Spain.In essence, it's an argument for separate rights based on the men's race. Such arguments have been used to support all manner of monstrous wrongs. The US used such an argument to support the institution of slavery before the civil war. Israel uses such an argument to justify the dispossession of the Palestinians.For that reason, such arguments should always be carefully examined and, in my opinion, should never be accepted.Whether or not the High Court allows the men to stay in Australia, I hope it reaches a decision without regard to their race.Greg Pinder, Charnwood Buy some jumbos International scientists say that dangerous fire conditions are likely to worsen overall if global warming isn't adequately addressed.With mega bush fires appearing early this fire season, Australia is in urgent need of large water bombing aircraft.Only around 500 of the 1500 jumbo jets built remain in service. Many of those taken out of service have been mothballed. Where would we find the money to buy some of these, fit them out as giant water bombers and set up water loading facilities along the coast?Easy. Do a Google search on the enormous amount of federal funding required to purchase our new fleet of submarines, their armaments and necessary infrastructure.Just a short delay in committing to this expenditure would free up tens, if not hundreds, of billions of dollars for other purposes.What could be more important than saving life, limb and property from ""mega"" bush fires?All that remains is to find the will.

And the Queensland-based fire -researcher, who charted a century of archival bushfire records for her PhD, has long been screaming danger.Finlay's thesis examined problem bushfires between 1881 and 1981. What she found after plotting the historical data on a graph was that there was a marked increase in the size and frequency of fires after 1919. This was when bushfire-reduction operations increasingly moved away from traditional indigenous practices such as low--intensity cool burning.Finlay says this -detailed correlation between the accumulation of catastrophic fuel loads and the frequency of extreme bushfires made it possible to forecast the dramatic increase in firestorms we have seen in the 21st century.""For years, I energetically sent this predictive model to government agencies, in particular bushfire services, the media, coronial and parliamentary inquiries and so on,"" she says. ""Horribly -ignored, it proved horribly accurate."" Finlay has the support of forester Vic Jurskis, who has written a book on fire stick ecology and how indigenous Australians managed the landscape with fire.In an open letter to the Prime Minister, premiers, chief ministers and opposition leaders in November, Jurskis said this season's -bushfire situation was neither -unprecedented nor unexpected.""This latest holocaust is a direct consequence of unprecedented accumulation of 3D continuous fuels as a result of green influence on politics,"" Jurskis says. ""It's all about fuel, not climate."" Half a century ago, Athol Hodgson, who later became chief fire officer of Victoria, explained the simple physics: doubling the available fuel usually doubles the rate of spread of the fire and -increases its intensity fourfold.Jurskis says control burning over large areas cheaply and effectively reduces the incidence of high-intensity wildfires and minimises damage.When this year's fire season -finally ends, Finlay's research and Jurskis's theories no doubt will be offered to a federal government review already proposed by Scott Morrison. All sides will have a big stake in any investigation: fire command, volunteer services, state government agencies and anyone who lives near the bush.Green groups are ready to battle demands that national parks be opened up to logging to reduce fuel loads. Politically, the Greens insist their environment policies adopted in November 2017 do not prohibit cool burns.The Greens have called on the Prime Minister to immediately -declare a royal commission into the bushfire crisis. ""While we need a national response to the bushfire crisis, any process that does not have at its heart a commitment to phase out fossil fuels like coal and rapidly transition to a renewable energy economy is doomed to fail from the start,"" Greens leader Richard Di Natale has said.""We need to anticipate and prepare for these emergencies, but we also need to go to the root cause, which is the burning of fossil fuels that is dangerously heating our planet."" Linking bushfires to climate change scientifically is still contentious given the long history of fires in Australia. But for the Greens and climate groups making the link politically is a no-brainer.It compounds a dilemma for the federal government, which might have hoped that finally it was getting its climate message under control. With the dramatic fires it faces the prospect of a new level of public expectation at a time when the appetite among world leaders for urgency appears to be on the wane.Last month's UN Framework Convention on Climate Change meeting in Madrid underscored the fact that shrill demands from Greta Thunberg and lobby groups like Extinction Rebellion are not being matched by political will.COP25.""

That technology is now the hope of the cement industry and highlights the changing focus of the carbon capture and storage (CCS) industry.No longer fixated on the polarising and so far unsuccessful mission to use CCS to save coal-fired power, the CCS industry is increasingly focused on capturing, storing and in some cases utilising the carbon dioxide that will be emitted by producers of cement, plastics and steel, even if those manufacturers were to source 100 per cent of their power from renewables.Their work is being bolstered by a fragile, but growing consensus across government, corporate and even environmental agencies that CCS must play a role if the world is to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement and limit global warming to below two degrees.It's a debate of particular relevance for major fossil fuel exporters such as Australia, which, HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/policy/energy-and-climate/a-111-carbon-tax-in-australia-would-still-be-too-low-says-imf-20191010-p52zkqaccording to the International Monetary Fund, would need a carbon price beyond $111 to meet Paris targets. ""I have seen a few cycles, it goes in and out of favour, and the last time it went out of favour was really around 2010 after the global financial crisis, and suddenly people started saying it is too expensive.''One of the difficulties that occurred was when people said, let's call it 'clean coal' - that really was not the right thing to do.''Essential to meeting Paris goalsBut everything changed at the 2015 United Nations in Paris, where nations put forward their own contributions to reducing emissions, agreeing to limit global warming to less than two degrees, and aspire towards 1.5 degrees.''The targets and the national contributions to achieve those targets caused everybody to do some maths that they had never previously had to do,'' says Brad Page, who runs the Global CCS Institute. US President Donald Trump forced everyone to do the maths again in 2018, when he introduced generous incentives for CCS, sparking calls for similar policy reform here in Australia.The days when petroleum and coal companies were the only proponents of CCS are gone.

If you've always loved travel and are feeling conflicted after the summer that was, rest assured, you're not alone.Intrepid travellers who are passionate about protecting the health of the environment are facing a conundrum: how to balance the desire to cross borders and oceans with the knowledge that doing so will generate a carbon footprint.I'm Nepalese-born and raised, and have lived in several cities across the globe, including Sydney for the past decade. Whether it be for work, adventure or to reconnect with family and friends in Nepal, regular travel has been one of the most rewarding, treasured parts of my life. Travelling for work and leisure has become necessary to my life, and I usually do at least three intercontinental trips in a year.The recent startling weather extremes, drought and bushfire crises have been a stark wake-up call, not least because my husband and I have each worked in the field of not-for-profit environmentalism for about 30 years.And then there is necessary work-related travel.Let's face it, if Sir David Attenborough hadn't travelled regularly in his prime, how could he have made those documentaries that have helped inform and educate generations of people about the wealth of diverse natural habitats that are worth fighting for?As we cast around for solutions as to how we can ease our conscience, and travel more mindfully, let's start with some facts. Tourism's global carbon footprint is calculated to account for 8 per cent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, according to credible sources, including a 2018 study published in the respected journal Nature.Within the trillion-dollar tourism industry, the biggest emissions contributors were listed as transport, shopping and food. ""From 2009 to 2013, global tourism-related emissions increased from 3.9 to 4.5 billion tons of CO2 annually,"" the study says. The United States topped the list for travel emissions, mostly due to domestic flights, followed by China, Germany and India.Cutting the data another way, commercial aviation accounts for about 2 per cent of global emissions - and about 12 per cent of all CO2 emissions from the transportation sector. It's not insignificant, but relatively small when compared with emissions from other industries. Relatively small for now, that is.Carbon dioxide emissions from commercial aircraft are on course to triple by 2050 if left unchecked, as passenger numbers and air freight increase.

Does it make you grieve?Most of today's Science Show is about corals and the Great Barrier Reef, a conversation with Professor Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, who loves it, and grieves for it.But we begin with Nick Rowley who is also saddened by the death of a great public servant and friend who died in April, Sir John Houghton who pioneered the understanding of climate science and led the IPCC. Nick Rowley was former adviser to the British Prime Minister Tony Blair.Nick Rowley: He may not be as well-known as David Attenborough, Greta Thunberg or Tim Flannery but his contribution both to our understanding of the climate system and helping establish the institutions and decisions required to reduce the risks of human induced climate change, is beyond compare.An unassuming, deeply religious and humble man, John's was a truly glittering career. Winning a scholarship to Oxford at the tender age of 16, John went on to become Professor of Atmospheric Physics there. Through the 1960s and '70s he built up a powerful research group at the university, developing new techniques for remote sensing of the atmosphere's temperature, structure and composition. This ground-breaking work gained the attention of NASA, with his team developing the instruments to establish space-based weather monitoring flown on the Nimbus satellites in the 1970s. This work enabled detailed studies of the structure and dynamics of the ozone layer, an ability to measure and model the radiative transfer of the Earth, and an understanding of the dynamics of the stratosphere.It was in 1983 that John really came into his element. As head of the UK Meteorological Office he developed his strong interest in climate science. During this time, John was part of a small group including the diplomat Sir Crispin Tickell and the scientist and environmental writer James Lovelock who held a series of briefings with then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on the risk posed by what was then called the greenhouse effect.In September 1988, Thatcher gave the first speech by any head of state on climate change. Informed by her meetings involving John, her Royal Society Speech at Fishmongers Hall in London first set out the importance of basic science informing policy and then turned to the threat posed by climate change and what she called an unwittingly 'massive experiment with the system of this planet itself'.In April 1989 the Prime Minister then held a day-long seminar on the subject with her full Cabinet at Downing Street. Unlike so many of today's political class, having studied chemistry at university, Margaret Thatcher was a leader at ease with science who thrived on understanding the arguments and the facts.On December 8th 1989 came her seminal speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Years before vicious climate events such as the European heatwave of 2003 or Hurricane Katrina hitting New Orleans in 2005, this was a fantastic speech. There is no better example of the political foresight and leadership required to respond to what scientific expertise revealed. And her placing the issue squarely on the international agenda was ably supported by John. Thatcher was convinced that the global warming hypothesis was clear, and Britain had a responsibility to lead.Opened by Thatcher in May 1990, John became the first director of the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research, soon regarded as the world centre of scientific excellence in the collation and interpretation of global atmospheric data. By this time he was also a key member of the newly established Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. John was chair or co-chair of the IPCC's scientific assessment working group until 2002 and the lead editor of the first three IPCC reports.There is always another major report to read on climate change, but I would encourage anyone with an interest to go back and read the executive summary of that first assessment report released in 1990. Thirty years have now passed. Sadly, measurements reveal that over those 30 years the atmosphere has been warming at a rate between the higher and middle predictions. And if the world doesn't re-double efforts to reduce emissions at scale, we are on a trajectory to around four degrees of warming by the end of the century: a truly dystopian prospect.In 2007, on behalf of the panel, Sir John accepted the Nobel Peace Prize that was shared by the IPCC and former US Vice President Al Gore. Just prior to this, for two years I was fortunate to work at Downing Street advising Tony Blair on sustainability and climate change. This was before Hurricane Katrina, before Al Gore's documentary An Inconvenient Truth.With the UK having the G8 Presidency in 2005, Blair was also convinced that climate change was both real and required an urgent response. Like his conservative predecessor, Tony Blair too was eager to present the case and achieve progress on the international response. For him it was only heads of state with their responsibility for environment, transport, energy and economic policy that could take the truly consequential national and international decisions required to reduce emissions at scale.Although John had then retired, he and I spoke, and I drew on his advice frequently. More than one of the world's most highly regarded climate scientists, John truly understood the 'hidden wiring' of Whitehall. And him no longer being in any prescribed job, he could speak candidly and be direct.In this informal role, John worked tirelessly to assist the UK diplomatic case with the United States. With President George W Bush close to leading US evangelicals, John Houghton gave evidence in the Senate and made the ethical case that stewardship of the environment and taking decisions in the interests of future generations was the moral responsibility of all Christians. And he was more than the scientist in government. Originally published in 1994, his Global Warming remains the best introduction for anyone wanting to understand climate science.With his leadership, Sir John Houghton did more than inspire a generation of scientists. No one has more successfully and effectively traversed the world of cutting-edge science, domestic and international climate politics, and the institutions and policies required to reduce climate risk. His combination of scientific rigour, humanism and political nous made him truly formidable.Years after I returned to Australia, John and I continued to correspond. After hearing of his passing last month following complications resulting from COVID-19, I looked back through his e-mails to me and came to the last one. The final words stand as an epitaph to a man who was truly a scientific and policy giant:Nick, I agree with you completely about hope.There are the deniers who are beyond hope.There are the doomsters who see no hope.In between there is lots to hope for!And there is ever so much we can do, if only we got on with it!Best regards - JohnRobyn Williams: That tribute to Sir John Houghton, who died in April, was from Nick Rowley, former adviser to Prime Minister Tony Blair and former Premier of New South Wales Bob Carr.The Science Show on RN, where today we start a series of conversations about climate and emotions. Yes, scientists are not unfeeling dweebs, not the ones I know. They are passionate about their research and nature, not least when it's in jeopardy.Ove Hoegh-Guldberg is a marine scientist at the University of Queensland. He's with Dr Jonica Newby, formerly of Catalyst.Jonica Newby:Ove Hoegh-Guldberg:Jonica Newby: A level of grief rather than anger, denial, depression, acceptance, any of those. I'm not really comfortable with becoming angry because I've been part of the problem, along with you and everyone else. If I was a child I'd be angry. What the parents have done to the planet that they have to inherit is pretty awful. That's a standard thing to say nowadays but it really does come home to you. Given the dramatic demonstrations of what the planet might be headed towards and the fact that we don't take this next decade extremely seriously, I would imagine I'd start to feel angry.Jonica Newby: How old are your kids now?Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: 21 and 24.Jonica Newby: What emotions do they express about climate?Ove Hoegh-Guldberg: They're very practical, they want to do something to help avert disaster. Fiona, for example, is looking around to do a Masters in sustainability. She curiously was studying the glossy black cockatoo from Kangaroo Island where there are only 21 nesting pairs left, and of course a third of that island has burnt now, and there is grave fears for that. Again, she is very practical and very optimistic. I think she's got a personality a bit like mine where it's almost you transition beyond grief because that's not useful. You have to keep pushing on this.Christopher loves nature, he loves diving, and I think he too gets anxious, thinking that what Dad has been talking about now turns out to be pretty worrying. And I think that's where everyone is. I think the entire nation is shocked, the world is shocked that we are spiralling potentially out of control here.Jonica Newby: Well, if you look at traditional stages of grief, and I know that that's not universally accepted of course but it's useful, I think of you and people like you who've been on the climate frontl"

"COP25","Australia","COP25_Australia119","Disentangling Environmental and Development Discourses in a Peripheral Spatial Context: The Case of the Ays\'e9n Region, Patagonia, Chile","January 2020","The Journal of Environment & Development","ABSTRACTIn places with a predominantly natural heritage, environmental and development discourses are intertwined and often competing. A key dimension is the social construction of socio-spatial relationships, and particularly, the attribution of core and periphery features. In this article, we investigate environmental and development discourses in the peripheral spatial context of the Ays\'e9n region of Chile. Three research questions guide the investigation: (a) What are the dominant environmental and development discourses? (b) what are the main synergies and tensions among discourses? and (c) what are the (discursive) implications for (de-)peripheralization? Based on semistructured interviews and secondary sources, we identify six regional discourses on environment and development. Imaginaries of nature, regional development, and economic growth are the common denominators that create synergies and tensions. We conclude that environmental and development discourses play a key role in the transformation of geographic peripheral areas. Discursive synergies can not only reinforce but also counteract tendencies of peripheralization.FULL TEXTRemote peripheral regions are often associated with high levels of naturalness, conservation values, high distance costs, and territorial inequalities (Copus, 2001; Hall & Boyd, 2005). In such areas, discourses on environmental protection enmesh and often compete with discourses on socioeconomic development. In this article, we investigate these discourses and their interplay in the peripheral spatial context of the Ays\'e9n region, a remote region in southern Chile.In scientific literature, peripheral areas have traditionally been defined in structural and static terms, in relation to their geographic distance to urban centers, remoteness, sparse population, elevated travel and service costs, and lack of infrastructure and innovation (Copus, 2001). In addition, peripheries have been characterized in rather negative terms, as being backward in terms of development, and powerless (K\'fchn & Bernt, 2013; K\'fchn et\~al., 2017).More recent spatial research, however, has thematized the so-called peripheralization process as a way to understand social dynamics with spatial implications, specifically related to mechanisms of out-migration, dependence, disconnection, and stigmatization (K\'fchn, 2015). Thus, peripheralization can be understood as a multidimensional and dynamic process whereby peripheral areas emerge and change while reinforcing and reproducing the spatial disparities in relation to the core (Harders, 2015; Naumann & Reichert-Schick, 2013). Peripheralization may occur in urban as well as in rural areas and is not fixed to a specific geographic location (Beetz et\~al., 2008). By overcoming certain peripheral conditions, geographic areas may engage in deperipheralization processes (K\'f6hler, 2012). The conceptualization of when and how an area is being peripheralized or deperipheralized remains an open debate (Fischer-Tahir & Naumann, 2013). Meyer and Miggelbrink (2013) emphasize that if research on peripheralization aims  to go beyond a taken-for-granted structuration of the social world, (it) has to conceptualize the production and effects of meaning (p. 208). They consider discursive processes as a key component in the formation of socio-spatial patterns. By consequence, meanings ascribed through discursive (re)productions are pertinent to the social construction of socio-spatial relationships and therefore influencing (de-)peripheralization processes (cf. Pl\'fcschke-Altof, 2016).In the case of Chile, there are noticeable territorial inequalities between the northern most regions, including the Atacama desert, the southern region of Patagonia, and the central area where the capital (Santiago) is located (Aroca, 2013; Atienza & Aroca, 2012).According to Aroca (2013) territorial inequalities in Chile have increased in the last two decades due to state policies and market mechanisms, leading to an uneven distribution of economic opportunities (Amor\'f3s et\~al., 2013). The allocation of the National Fund for Regional Development, the centralization of public investment, the geographic distribution of advanced human capital, and the Central Bank\' s monetary policy are examples of state actions that had direct and indirect impacts on the distribution of economic growth and development. In addition, market mechanisms such as labor mobility, interregional and international commerce, and concentration of private sector decision-making have contributed to the concentration of goods and wealth around Santiago, Metropolitan region (Aroca, 2013). Moreover, interregional disparities are aggravated by large differences in infrastructure and access to telecommunications. Along with the particular geographical configuration of the Chilean territory, these factors pose challenges for the local and regional administrations, which at the same time have limited opportunities for locally differentiated, place-based policies due to the highly centralized administrative system (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD], 2009).Despite these influential processes, research on core\- periphery spatial relationships in Chile has developed only modestly, and most of it has focused on two main aspects: transformations around metropolitan areas and their consequences for urban segregation (Inzulza & Galleguillos, 2014; Jir\'f3n & Mansilla, 2013; Rodr\'edguez & Winchester, 2001) and the conceptualization of Chile as a resource periphery in the global context (Barton, 2006; Barton et\~al., 2007). In further expanding this range, this article focuses on core\- periphery discursive relations in the region of Ays\'e9n.This research aims to contribute to the discursive conceptualization of peripheralization in a remote spatial context by bringing together environmental and development meanings from the core as well as from the periphery. In doing so, environmental and development discourses are reconstructed. Three research questions guide the investigation: (a) What are the dominant environmental and development discourses? (b) what are the main synergies and tensions among discourses? and (c) what are the (discursive) implications for (de-)peripheralization? The remainder of this article introduces the study area, the conceptualization of discourses, the methodological approach, and the results. Subsequently, by looking at the synergies and tensions among discourses, we analyze the effects of meanings in the socio-spatial transformation of the Ays\'e9n region. Finally, we draw the conclusions of this article.The Ays\'e9n Region, a Remote Peripheral AreaFigure 1.Geographic Location of the Ays\'e9n Region (Northern Patagonia, Chile).Note. The Southern Highway is the only longitudinal and partially unpaved road that connects the region for over 800 km of intricate geography. The capital city, Santiago (Metropolitan region), is located 1,600 km north from the Ays\'e9n region. The Ays\'e9n region is part of one of the largest fjord regions in the world. Its terrestrial ecosystems are characterized by a large cover of native forest with a high degree of disturbance due to forest fires during the colonization period (figure own elaboration based on data set publicly available at National Catalogue of Geospatial Information-IDE Chile, WGS 84/UTM zone 18S).Historically, the region of Ays\'e9n has been conceptualized as a frontier territory, a remote peripheral area within the national territory (N\'fa\'f1ez et\~al., 2017). Explorer chronicles, colonization, and development policies, and, lately, green development ideas have imposed different sociogeographic frontiers, idealizing the spatial imaginary of the Ays\'e9n region and Patagonia (Mendoza et\~al., 2016; N\'fa\'f1ez et\~al., 2017).Based upon the logic of spatial integration of the national territory, development policies have defined the Ays\'e9n region as an (GORE Ays\'e9n, 2014). This classification allows to prioritize public and private resources that may contribute to overcome the disadvantages and inequalities, in relation to the rest of the country (GORE Ays\'e9n, 2014; N\'fa\'f1ez et\~al., 2010). Nevertheless, the Ays\'e9n region still faces a lack of economic opportunities, infrastructure, and connectivity (i.e., terrestrial, maritime, and digital).Two main cities, Puerto Ays\'e9n and Coyhaique concentrate around 80% of the regional population. The regional economy and rural livelihood are primarily based on natural resources (Delgado et\~al., 2013). Salmon aquaculture and nature-based tourism are the main economic activities (Blanco et\~al., 2015; Gale et\~al., 2019). From a socioeconomic stance, the regional government is trying to address the challenge of improving the quality of life through economic growth and creation of jobs while trying to maintain the region\' s cultural and ecological heritage. By 2030, the regional goal is to become an international sustainable tourism destination, to consolidate aquaculture development and align it with other coastal usage, and to become a scientific research platform with a focus on the region\' s natural capital (ILPES-CEPAL/DIPLADE Ays\'e9n, 2009).Conceptualizing DiscoursesDiscourses may be interpreted from several perspectives. In simple terms, discourses can be understood as a particular set of ideas. Those who subscribe to these ideas may have a shared vision of the same phenomena, constructing common meanings and legitimating their knowledge, agreements, and disagreements (Dryzek, 2013). Hajer and Versteeg (2005, p. 175) define discourse as  an ensemble of ideas, concepts and categories through which meaning is given to social and physical phenomena, and which is produced and reproduced through an identifiable set of practices . Furthermore, discourses are connected with different levels of power in shaping the social and physical world (Sharp & Richardson, 2001). In the political domain, discourses represent an input for policy making and policy change. In this regard, discourse analysis reveals how policy processes and practices are being influenced (Sharp & Richardson, 2001). Discourses reveal how different actors construct their own reality, defining problems and solutions in a specific way (Hajer & Versteeg, 2005).M\'fchlh\'e4usler and Peace (2006, p. 458) define environmental discourses as  the linguistic devices articulating arguments about the relationship between humans and their environment . In their approach, which we follow in this research, the environment is understood as the intersection between the sociocultural construction of nature and the natural components and ecological processes that characterize the study area.

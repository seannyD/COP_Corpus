"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada2","King Charles to host COP27 reception at Buckingham Palace","October 31, 2022 Monday","Toronto Sun","King Charles is to host a special pre-conference reception ahead of the COP27 summit in Egypt. It was previously confirmed the monarch will not be attending the United Nations Climate Change Conference in in Sharm el-Sheikh but it's now been revealed he will bring together around 200 international business leaders, campaigners and politicians at Buckingham Palace in London for an event to mark the end of the UK's presidency of COP26. It will take place on November 4 - two days before COP27 kicks off on November 6. Guests at the reception will include UK Prime Minister Prime Minister Rishi Sunak - who has also confirmed he does not plan to attend COP27 - as well as COP26 President Alok Sharma and John Kerry who is America's special envoy on climate change. There had been speculation King Charles would head to the event in Egypt in his first official overseas trip since becoming monarch as he has previously attended in his role as Prince of Wales and even gave one of the key note speeches at COP26 in Glasgow last year. RECOMMENDED VIDEO However, Buckingham Palace later confirmed the King - who is a longtime campaigner on environmental issues - would not be going. In his speech at the 2021 Glasgow conference, King Charles called for ""a vast military-style campaign"" to ""marshal the strength of the global private sector"" in an effort to bring about changes needed to save the planet. He added: ""I can only urge you, as the world's decision-makers, to find practical ways of overcoming differences so we can all get down to work, together, to rescue this precious planet and save the threatened future of our young people."" \"

The question of losses and damages suffered by these countries is one of the major themes of COP27 , the United Nations Climate Change Conference taking place in Egypt. In an interview with Presse Canadienne before his departure for Egypt, Environment Minister Benoit Charette said his government will take advantage of the conference to announce ""significant commitments in terms of climate justice,"" though he did not specify details of the contribution. The issue of climate justice for countries that suffer the most from the effects of climate change is at the heart of COP27 discussions. ""It is a theme that is gaining importance, so Quebec will make its contribution,"" Charette said. ""We hear this signal sent by several countries in the south in particular, who say they are directly experiencing the effects of climate change."" The head of the United Nations Development Program warned on Wednesday that many low-income countries are struggling to raise funds to fight climate change because of heavy debt. Achim Steiner told The Associated Press his agency estimates 54 countries around the world now face potential ""over-indebtedness."" Steiner said one of the proposals being discussed at the summit is to cancel part of the debt if the countries commit to investing in clean energy projects and to adapt to global warming. So far there has not been much progress on this issue, Steiner said. An analysis by his agency showed low-income countries invest several times the amount they receive from high-income countries when it comes to climate action. Steiner said a recent estimate of the money needed to fight global warming is between US$1 trillion and US$2 trillion a year, a fraction of the total global wealth of US$430 trillion. ""Are we really unable to direct public and private financial flows to the tune of $1 trillion or $2 trillion, essentially saving humanity and our economies from the extraordinary disasters that are beginning to unfold?"" he said.

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada5","Trina Solar shares its low-carbon vision at COP27","November 30, 2022 Wednesday 8:33 AM Eastern Time","Canada NewsWire","SHARM EL SHEIK, Egypt, Nov. 30, 2022 /CNW/ --The global PV and smart energy total solutions provider Trina Solar was among those whose voices were heard at the recent United Nations climate change conference , COP27 , as the company put forward its views and vision on low-carbon practice in the supply chain. Topics related to low carbon emissions were a central focus of the conference, held in Sharm El Sheik, Egypt, from November 6 to 18, at which there were 35,000 attendees, including more than100 heads of state and government. About 2,000 speakers led in-depth discussions on climate change. Zeng Yi, Trina Solar's assistant vice-president of strategy and marketing, delivered a video speech titled ""Achieving synergy between pollution and carbon reduction and improvement of the eco-environment: balancing environmental, climate and economic gains"". Zeng cited what Trina Solar calls its Qinghai strategy in the speech. The strategy includes locating the whole value chain of the solar PV industry in Qinghai, the province with the highest proportion of green electricity in China, and developing utility-scale solar PV stations on its vast drylands. The strategy enables the deep decarbonation in the upstream supply chain of Trina Solar, avoiding carbon emission by almost 95%. It also creates added benefits of preventing desertification and stimulating growth for the underdeveloped local economy. Foreshadowing the conference, Trina Solar attended theZero-Carbon Mission International Climate Summit in Beijing in early November and was honored with a Climate Solver Award, the only PV company among the winners. The continuous innovation of low-carbon technologies is the core driving force of the global response to climate change. Trina Solar is committed to leading the way in smart solar energy solutions for a net-zero future. Its 600W+ high-power modules can effectively reduce the LCOE for PV power stations with high power, high efficiency, high energy yield and high reliability. In May, 2022, Trina Solar received LCA certificate for its 210mm Vertex modules from the independent testing and certification authority T\'dcV Rheinland,becoming the first solar company to receive LCA certification for 210mm modules. T\'dcV Rheinland issued a Carbon Footprint Certificate for Trina Solar's Vertex modules in October. The products cover a full range of 210mm p-type solar modulesfrom Vertex S 410W to Vertex 670W, with an industry-leading ability toreduce carbon emissions. Trina Solar joined the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in July last year, contributing to the common goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 C. It also initiated the campaign Clean Energy for Earth with WWF China, which promotes efforts to create a carbon-neutral future. Trina Solar has pledged that it will strive to achieve 100% use of renewable energy in its manufacturing and operations by 2030, in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goal 7.

In spite of the fact that combating climate change should be everyone's top priority, the COP27 meeting has drawn criticism due to the human rights and environmental records of its host country. Guilbeault should not shy away from addressing these issues with his Egyptian hosts. The Egyptian government's handling of the conference highlights how little respect it has for freedom of speech and peaceful protests. Egypt has limited the ability of activists and environmental groups to gain accreditation and enter the country. As a platform for African activists to speak up for communities ravaged by drought, floods and resource development projects, COP27 has been dubbed the ""African COP."" However, only 20 per cent( HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/06/ HYPERLINK cop27 -african-activists-climate-crisis COP27 .

Egypt also has a terrible track record of protecting the environment. Cairo is one of the most polluted cities on earth. Trees that have been growing for centuries( HYPERLINK https://www.voanews.com/a/cairo-construction-razes-green-spaces-ahead-of-climate-summit-/6694718/p1.html ) have been uprooted to make way for highways and overpasses. Meanwhile, the country faces a myriad of other problems. The Nile, Egypt's primary water source, is in jeopardy as a result of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. It has unprecedented levels of youth unemployment. And the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has threatened Egypt with a serious food crisis( HYPERLINK https://mei.edu/publications/russia-ukraine-war-has-turned-egypts-food-crisis-existential-threat-economy#:~:text=to%20the%20Economy-,The%20Russia%2DUkraine%20War%20has%20Turned%20Egypt's%20Food%20Crisis%20into,Existential%20Threat%20to%20the%20Economy&;text=With%20the%20outbreak%20of%20the,existential%20threat%20to%20its%20economy https://mei.edu/publications/russia-ukraine-war-has-turned-egypts-food-crisis-existential-threat-economy#:~:text=to%20the%20Economy-,The%20Russia%2DUkraine%20War%20has%20Turned%20Egypt's%20Food%20Crisis%20into,Existential%20Threat%20to%20the%20Economy&;text=With%20the%20outbreak%20of%20the,existential%20threat%20to%20its%20economy . ). To appease President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Egypt was chosen to host COP27 , but this decision will not make Egypt a leader in environmental policy, and it will not improve the Egyptian economy or its standard of living, which have both been in steady decline since Sisi came to power following the 2013 military coup that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people( HYPERLINK https://www.hrw.org/report/2014/08/12/all-according-plan/raba-massacre-and-mass-killings-protesters-egypt https://www.hrw.org/report/2014/08/12/all-according-plan/raba-massacre-and-mass-killings-protesters-egypt ). Understandably, a Canadian presence is required to advocate for our environmental vision. But has Ottawa taken any action to tie its involvement to the advancement of human rights, beginning with the release of political prisoners? Even though many Canadians have been arbitrarily detained in Egypt since 2013, Canada has turned a blind eye( https://nationalpost.com/opinion/why-is-canada-ignoring-the-horrendous-human-rights-violations-in-egypt https://nationalpost.com/opinion/why-is-canada-ignoring-the-horrendous-human-rights-violations-in-egypt ) to the gross human rights violations documented by human rights groups.

However, since it is already happening, Guilbeault should uphold Canada's longstanding reputation as a defender of democracy and human rights by showing his support for the Egyptian people's right to express themselves freely and openly.

SAN DIEGO,Calif., Oct. 25, 2022 /CNW/ - Greenbutts LLC (""Greenbutts"" or ""the Company""), a scientific leader in biodegradable material technology that has developed and patented a viable alternative to cellulose acetate filters, announces today they will be joining the official Canadian delegation at COP27 , the United Nations Climate Change Conference of 2022. The Company will bring attention to the issue of this massive source of plastic pollution and highlight its ability to assist in the transition away from cellulose acetate filters used in the global tobacco industry; a problem the UN describes as ""the most discarded waste item worldwide"". Greenbutts' message will speak to why nations need to address this plastic crisis, now, to mitigate the ongoing damage to our oceans, marine life, and ultimately, our lives. ""We are honoured to be invited to participate in COP27 as part of the official Canadian delegation, where we intend to shed meaningful light on the global crisis of single-use plastic cigarette filters and offer an impactful solution,"" said Luis Sanches, Chief Strategy Officer of Greenbutts. ""Greenbutts is in a unique position to deliver a sustainable innovation that can drastically decrease the amount of harmful plastic that is discarded every day and ends up in our oceans. Our IP and technology have advanced greatly, and we believe that we can now offer this solution to the global tobacco industry for mass implementation, effectively ending the reliance on single-use plastic filters,"" said Tadas Lisauskas, CEO of Greenbutts. ""We will have a very receptive audience including world leaders, policy makers, and members of the media at COP27 . We are optimistic our solution-focused proposal will contribute to meaningful and verifiable actions towards ending the plastic crisis,"" Lisauskas continued. The Climate COP is an annual meeting of delegates from nearly every country on Earth to negotiate global goals for tackling our planet's most pressing issues. This year's 27th annual COP is hosted in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt and takes place November 6-18. About 35,000 worldwide have so far registered on the UN website for COP27 , putting the upcoming UN climate change conference in Sharm El-Sheikh on track to possibly become one of the most attended COPs in history, the Egyptian Earth's Climate for Sustainable Development Foundation recently announced. COP27 follows a historic year in the fight against plastic pollution. On March 2nd, 2022, Heads of State, Ministers of environment and other representatives from UN Member Nations endorsed a world's first resolution at the UN Environment Assembly in Nairobi to End Plastic Pollution and forge an international legally binding agreement by 2024. About Greenbutts \'ef\'b8 Since 2010, Greenbutts has worked with R&D institutions, international tobacco companies, and industry experts to develop biodegradable filter technology trademarked as a ""Greenbutt"". The Company has developed and patented a ""zero-plastic"" filter, made without any synthetic materials or plasticizers, 100% biodegradable and water dispersing which meets certain industry criteria. The proprietary Greenbutts filter is designed to reduce the significant environmental impact caused by plastic cigarette filter pollution. Over 4 trillion are discarded every year making single-use filters the most littered plastic item in the world. With over a decade of R&D and strong intellectual property, Greenbutts offers the global tobacco industry a seamless transition to zero-plastic filters while meeting the new global single-use plastic (SUP) legislation initiatives.

Of all the conferences we have had, it was the one with the largest representation of Indigenous people, Kenneth Deer, who has been attending United Nations meetings for many years, said.  There was a lot of Indigenous people there, and a lot of energy. It was a step in the right direction, that\' s for sure. The historic agreement was reached after weeks of fraught negotiations that went into overtime at this year\' s conference climate-change conference \- called COP 27 (short for conference of parties). The conference started November 8 and ended this past Sunday. The conference hall of diplomats broke out in applause after COP27 President Sameh Shoukry sealed the deal \- which would see developed countries pool resources to help support developing countries in their battle against the very worst consequences of climate change with a strike of his gavel. Still, the crucial questions of which countries must provide financing for the fund and which will be eligible to benefit from it have been left to future negotiations. Deer said the high number of Indigenous people on site likely contributed to the successful outcome \- despite the questions of how and where the money will come from.  There was a variety of voices and I think that our resilience is partly to be credited. Indigenous people are stewards of the land and when we are gathered together, we are there to support each other and maintain the balance of nature and I think that was the case in Egypt, he said. Deer was not the only Kahnawake voice at the conference \- a youth delegation from Kahnawake was also on hand in Egypt  We are trying to stave off catastrophic effects of climate change and we are trying to fight the desertification of many natural habitats on the planet. Granted, Indigenous people haven\' t caused climate change, but we\' re doing everything in our power to fight it, Deer said. \"

Sean Bernard, a Grade 12 student from Waterhen Lake First Nation, about 290 kilometres northwest of Saskatoon, is in Egypt this week to attend COP27 , the United Nations Climate Change Conference . Bernard is a youth delegate, representing the youth of the world as well as Indigenous communities across North America. ""As soon as I heard about this, I took it on right away because I knew how important it is for my community and for people who are Indigenous from Canada,"" he said on CBC Radio's Morning Edition Wednesday. Bernard, who attends Carpenter High School in Meadow Lake, Sask., is enrolled in a virtual course called Northern Lifestyles 20, in which students ""investigate and negotiate personal, cultural, and community identity and sustainability through skills development, cultural experience, and experiential learning,"" according to a news release issued by the Northwest School Division last month. It was through this course that Bernard was selected to attend the UN conference. ""I see a phenomenal student,"" said Tanis Crawford, who teaches the course and is joining Bernard in Egypt. On Thursday, Bernard will be part of a presentation to world leaders that discusses youth and future generations. Bernard has been impressive enough throughout the conference that he also earned an invite to speak at the health pavilion, Crawford said. He is also among five youths given exclusive accreditation that, according to Crawford, grants him access to the major negotiations that are taking place. ""The five youths that were chosen are representing the youths of the world,"" she said. ""They have a place at the negotiation table, and they have a place [to speak] their demands."" While in Egypt, he has also met other Indigenous people to discuss how climate change is affecting their communities and how to take action. Canada's Changing Climate Report, released in 2019, broke down how climate change will affect the country's different regions. The chapter about the Prairies notes that climate change may exacerbate social inequities, specifically identifying Indigenous people as one of the groups that may be more vulnerable. The Prairie section also says that Indigenous knowledge is of ""tremendous value"" for climate science and adaptation planning. ""Many Indigenous peoples are accustomed and adaptive to environmental change, with Indigenous knowledge providing important perspectives on the relationship between human activity and the environment,"" the report says.

Ongoing global geopolitical challenges have only strengthened Canada's resolve to fight climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution while growing a clean economy that builds a more resilient, affordable future for all. The world must accelerate global efforts in this critical decade to keep the Paris Agreement goal of 1.5\'baC within reach and avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change. Ahead of COP26 in Glasgow, UK, last year, Canada committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by forty to forty-five percent below 2005 levels by 2030 in order to meet the Paris Agreement. Canada is now focused on implementation, having launched the 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan in March 2022, the most comprehensive sector-by-sector road map to achieve our target. As the transition to cleaner economies accelerates worldwide, Canada stands to gain from seizing opportunities in this competitive global race. Over the course of COP27 , Canada will support ambitious outcomes within the negotiations, including on issues related to climate finance and adaptation. Canada will also advance concrete actions that raise global ambition, including building international support for the phasing-out of coal-fired electricity, reducing methane emissions, increasing climate finance commitments from developed nations, cutting plastic waste, and protecting nature. For the first time in recent history, Canada will also have a national Pavilion to highlight both domestic and international leadership in the fight against climate change and promote Canadian innovations, from low-carbon businesses and clean technologies, to sustainable finance and nature-based solutions. The Pavilion will provide a critical venue to convene key partners and stakeholders on important discussions, including on carbon pricing and on Indigenous climate leadership in Canada. Canada's delegation, led by Minister Guilbeault, includes Catherine Stewart, Ambassador for Climate Change, and Steven Kuhn, Canada's Chief Negotiator for Climate Change. Canada has taken steps to ensure diverse perspectives are reflected through its inclusive delegation, which will be comprised of parliamentarians representing both the House of Commons and the Senate; Indigenous representatives; representatives from civil society organizations and youth, business, and labour, as well as most provinces and territories. Shortly after COP27 , Canada will welcome the world to Montr\'e9al from December 7\- 19, 2022, for the United Nations Biodiversity Conference, COP15, where it will continue to advocate for international collaboration on an ambitious post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. Protecting nature and halting biodiversity loss in Canada and around the world are top priorities for Canada. ""Canada has come a long way on climate action both at home and abroad, alongside international partners, since the coming into force of the Paris Agreement. But the reality is that we need to see a fundamental increase in global efforts. In Egypt, we will continue to push for the acceleration of concrete climate actions to reduce emissions and enhance resilience in communities and economies as the world faces the brunt of climate change impacts. Real, positive, and transformational change is possible. We won't back down."" SOURCE Environment and Climate Change Canada \"

Some critics argue the trip appears chiefly calibrated to speak to the concerns and frustrations of the governing United Conservative Party's voter base. As the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference enters its second week, much of the talk surrounding Canada's participation has focused on the makeup of the country's delegation( HYPERLINK https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/ruffing-some-feathers-at- HYPERLINK cop27 -canada-includes-oil-and-gas-companies-in-its-delegation ), which this year includes a political delegation from Alberta( HYPERLINK https://financialpost.com/tag/alberta/ https://financialpost.com/tag/alberta/ ) led by Savage - a reversal from the province's stance last year when former premier Jason Kenney dismissed the global climate conference as a ""gabfest.""

This is not acceptable."" Savage added that at past climate conferences, the federal government committed to targets that were not achievable only to return to Canada to hand down ""unrealistic objectives"" to the provinces in charge of developing those resources. But some critics have accused Savage of oilsands ""boosterism,"" arguing her message flies in the face of data that shows greenhouse gas emissions in Alberta have been increasing( HYPERLINK https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/environmental-indicators/greenhouse-gas-emissions.html https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/environmental-indicators/greenhouse-gas-emissions.html ) for the past two decades and are the highest of any province in Canada, largely because of oilsands production, which is responsible for some the highest per-barrel emissions in the world.

Li Wenxue, Vice President of LONGi, virtually attended a sideline meeting themed ""Green Finance and Chinese Industries Tackling Climate Change"" on November 12 and released the 2 ""Climate change is a common challenge, and it is related to the sustainable development of all humankind,"" Li Wenxue said in his speech, adding that the current state of global climate change has changed from a future challenge to an immediate crisis. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, in order to achieve the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, global greenhouse gas emissions need to reach a peak in 2025 and reduce by nearly half in 2030. Urgent actions are required to prevent the severe climate impacts caused by global warming by promoting a green, low-carbon transition through aggressive emission reduction measures. Li Wenxue stressed that in the face of the crisis brought about by climate change, replacing traditional energy with renewable energy is a key step in the green and low-carbon transformation. As per predictions, by 2030, the annual new photovoltaic installed capacity in the world will need to reach 1,500-2,000GW to form an effective support for the global energy transformation, thus laying the foundation for achieving global net zero emissions, which will be 10 times the new installed capacity of global photovoltaic in 2021. The green low carbon transformation will create a huge green market, which will serve as a fresh impetus for green development. As a globally leading energy technology company, LONGi firmly believes that technological innovation can help humankind achieve carbon neutrality at a rapidly declining cost. Since 2021, LONGi has broken the world record for the conversion efficiency of photovoltaic cells for 11 consecutive times, while firmly pursuing the innovative solution of ""Green electricity +Green hydrogen"". LONGi is always committed to becoming an advocate, practitioner and leader of sustainable development in the field of global clean energy, making positive contributions to global green low-carbon development and realizing a zero-carbon future. The report released by LONGi is the 2 While LONGi continues to meet the rapidly increasing global demand for photovoltaic capacity, its carbon emission intensity has been further reduced. The greenhouse gas emissions per unit revenue in 2021 are 20.7% lower than those in 2020, laying the foundation for the gradual decoupling of capacity growth and carbon emissions. It is reported that the report received technical support from The Carbon Trust, an international independent consulting agency, and comprehensively demonstrated the firm commitment and practical action of LONGi as a leading enterprise in the photovoltaic industry in dealing with global climate change. In terms of implementing corporate climate action, both the management and grassroots employees of LONGi are ambitious and pragmatic. In 2018, LONGi took the lead in proposing the concept of ""Solar for Solar"" at the 24th United Nations Climate Change Conference . In 2020, LONGi became the only Chinese enterprise to join the four climate initiatives, namely, RE100, EP100, EV100 and SBTi at the same time. In 2021, LONGi kicked off the construction of the first ""Zero Carbon Factory"" in the photovoltaic industry and established its hydrogen energy equipment manufacturing division. In 2022, LONGi released the ""Supply Chain Green Partner Empowerment Plan"", actively responding to the requirements of the national ""Double Carbon"" goals, and working with partners to continue to promote the goal of energy conservation and emission reduction. During the past year, LONGi has steadily promoted climate action, established a greenhouse gas emission accounting system covering the company's entire value chain (Scope I, II and III) and accelerated the construction of a sustainable development and ESG management system, actively used a high proportion of green power, continuously improved energy efficiency, reduced carbon emission intensity in products, and laid a solid foundation for achieving gradual decoupling of capacity growth and carbon emissions. At present, the world is facing multiple challenges such as geopolitical conflicts, the COVID-19 pandemic and instability in the supply chain. While some countries have wavered from their climate change policies, China has continued to attach great importance to tackling climate change and unswervingly followed the path of green development. ""LONGi also firmly believes that tackling climate change and achieving net zero emissions is a global consensus, and is willing to work with partners from all sides to take joint action to accelerate the transformation of clean energy and low-carbon green development. We will actively contribute to the innovation of green energy technology enterprises, and help China and the world move towards a zero carbon future,"" Li Wenxue said in his speech. The United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), the Energy Transformation Commission (ETC), the China New Energy Chamber of Commerce (CNECC), the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and other international organizations, as well as some representatives of LONGi's partners and customers took part and supported the release of LONGi's 2022 White Paper on Climate Action. As a leading solar technology company in the world, LONGi, along with Vanke Foundation and China Corporate Climate Action (CCCA), launched an enterprise-themed exhibition hall in the Green Zone of the COP27 conference and displayed its most recent generation of Hi-MO 6 series modules. About LONGi Founded in 2000, LONGi is committed to being the world's leading solar technology company, focusing on customer-driven value creation for full scenario energy transformation. Under its mission of 'making the best of solar energy to build a green world', LONGi has dedicated itself to technology innovation and established five business sectors, covering mono silicon wafers cells and modules, commercial and industrial distributed solar solutions, green energy solutions and hydrogen equipment.

For Canada's part, we're driving progress to reach our commitment of protecting thirty percent of our land and thirty percent of our oceans by 2030. To get there, we have launched the greatest conservation campaign in the country's history, fueled by multi-billion dollar investments available to the provinces and territories.""\- The Honourable Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change The Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society is a well-known, nation-wide organization with a strong history of involvement in the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity and biodiversity-related program delivery in partnership with the Government of Canada. The Government of Canada invested $1.3 billion into the Nature Legacy Program in Budget 2018, and $2.3 billion for the Enhanced Nature Legacy Program in Budget 2021. The Fifteenth Conference of the Parties (COP15) to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity will focus on a new Global Biodiversity Framework to guide the world's collective efforts to protect nature and halt biodiversity loss around the globe. There is an urgent need for international partners to halt and reverse the alarming loss of biodiversity worldwide. Canada will continue to advocate for international collaboration on an ambitious post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, including targeting thirty percent of land and oceans conserved by 2030. In 2021, Canada doubled its climate finance commitment to $5.3 billion over five years. One of the focus areas of its implementation is nature-based solutions and biodiversity. For example, Canada is providing $15 million to support the Ocean Risk and Resilience Action Alliance to enhance resilience to climate change through nature-based solutions, and the Global Fund for Coral Reefs, to support international efforts to conserve and restore coral reefs.

The Honourable Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change, supported by Catherine Stewart, Canada's Ambassador for Climate Change, and Steven Kuhn, Canada's Chief Negotiator for Climate Change, and a strong team, met with colleagues from more than 190 countries in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, at a critical time as countries are being devastated by climate events such as historic flooding, as well as rising energy and food crises due to geopolitical instability. Canada came to the table as a fully-committed partner in advancing cooperation and implementation for climate action and is leading by example with the 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan, the country's comprehensive sector-by-sector roadmap to achieve its goal to reduce emissions by at least forty percent by 2030, on the road to net zero by 2050. Negotiations focus on moving the needle on many important climate issues under the Paris Agreement, including mitigation, climate finance, and adaptation. Canada notes many challenges on the topic of loss and damage and heard vulnerable countries on the difficulties they are facing in accessing the resources they need. Canada has engaged, and continues to engage, constructively on loss and damage and is working toward a concrete outcome. Minister Guilbeault will share a statement on the final text decision in the coming days. Amid the often tough and ongoing negotiations underway, Canada announced many new commitments and investments over the course of the conference, including around emissions reduction, climate financing for the most vulnerable developing nations, and clean energy transition, along with multilateral partnerships. Canada announced increased cooperation with the United States on reducing oil and gas sector emissions with a special focus on methane. Cutting oil and gas methane emissions is one of the fastest and most cost-effective ways to combat climate change. This is why Canada joined the Joint Declaration from Energy Importers and Exporters on Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Fossil Fuels and reaffirmed its commitment to reduce methane emissions by at least seventy-five percent by 2030. To help achieve these goals, Canada published a regulatory framework to help to inform consultations and the development of forthcoming stricter oil and gas methane regulations. It also joined the International Methane Emissions Observatory to help monitor and share methane emissions data gathered by satellites. Canada is committed to helping the world's most vulnerable combat the impacts of climate change, and announced a number of practical initiatives totalling $84.25 million through its $5.3 billion international climate finance commitment and other sources of funding at COP27 . This includes $24 million for critical areas such as loss and damage, access to climate finance, and climate governance and $4 million to help Belize, Grenada, Guyana and Saint Lucia, Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in the Caribbean, reduce methane emissions and help them achieve their climate target under the Paris Agreement. Canada remains steadfast in its commitment, including working in partnership to reach the collective goal of mobilizing US$100 billion as soon as possible and through 2025. Canada is proud to have released the Climate Finance Delivery Plan Progress Report with Germany ahead of COP27 to provide further transparency on developed countries' commitment toward the goal. Canada continues to advocate for clean energy and is ambitiously pushing for the adoption of carbon pricing globally by rolling out with Chile the Global Carbon Pricing Challenge, launched by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at COP26. New Zealand, Sweden, and the United Kingdom are among countries that are considering, or have already made, carbon pricing key to their approach in fighting climate change. Canada announced an additional $16 million in support of the World Bank's Partnership for Market Implementation to advance the Challenge's goals, as well as two new initiatives under its $5.3 billion commitment to help developing countries transition to clean energy and drive global ambition. The relationship between protecting nature, halting biodiversity loss, finding nature-based solutions and climate change was emphasized at COP27 . Minister Guilbeault held bilateral meetings with his counterparts from other countries and organizations to discuss shared priorities on climate change, as well as nature and biodiversity loss, as Canada prepares to welcome the world to Montr\'e9al, Quebec, for the Fifteenth United Nations Conference on Biological Diversity (COP15). The international community cannot delay working together to jointly address these pressing challenges. Canada is ready to welcome the global community this December to come to an agreement on an ambitious post-2020 global biodiversity framework. Quotes ""Progress on commitments was at the forefront of this COP. It was very fitting, as it's time to move from ambition and pledges to concrete action, which is exactly what we are doing at home with our sector-by-sector Emissions Reduction Plan. Throughout the past two weeks, Canada actively looked for ways to make progress and bridge positions on cornerstone issues, including on the important matter of loss and damage. And in a time of significant global challenges, we remain more committed than ever to support the global transition to cleaner energy. We will keep up the momentum as we head to COP15 in Montr\'e9al next month and rally for ambitious commitments to protect our natural world.""

As a hereditary Chief and elected President of the Huni Kui People of Acre, in the Amazon region in Brazil, I (Chief Ninawa Huni Kui) chose to participate at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) because the Amazon is crying out for help and my people represent the voice of this biome. Sadly, as my co-author Vanessa Andreotti and I attend the meetings at the conference in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, it so far has confirmed my experiences at other COP conferences. The vast majority of the discussions reproduce colonial patterns of unsustainable economic growth, ecological destruction and Indigenous dispossession that have been responsible for climate destabilization in the first place.

The consensus seems to be that HYPERLINK green multicultural capitalism However, we believe that COP27 could still be an important space to co-ordinate accountable climate action for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples.

On the eve of COP 27 , we lay down the critical role of ICT and public-private partnerships in helping our world mitigate, adapt to and build resilience against climate catastrophe More and more, I think the questions we need to ask ourselves are no longer just 'what is climate change?', and 'why should we care?'. But now, the questions become even harder: what concrete solutions can we use to deal with it? On the eve of the COP 27 summit, I find my mind going back to last year's event that ended on a bit of a sour note. In a first for a COP, a plan to reduce coal-fired power generation had been agreed, but objections from India and China led to the text being weakened from an agreement to ""phase out"" coal, to a commitment to a ""phasedown of unabated coal."" Since last year's COP26, it feels like there has just been a barrage of bad news. Many reports, from many organizations, have highlighted that we are heading in the wrong direction. Greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise. Fossil fuel emission rates are now above pre-pandemic levels. Catastrophic weather has had devasting effects across the globe, particularly in Pakistan where massive flooding has left over 2.1 million people homeless. Now, more than ever, we need to spend time on coming together to talk about specific solutions that businesses and society can contribute to climate action. At COP27 , we want to bring all kinds of solutions to the table-from nature-based solutions to energy solutions. That is why we are excited to announce the 6th Exponential Climate Action Summit, hosted by Ericsson alongside our partners, the Exponential Roadmap Initiative, We Don't Have Time and UNDP. Hosted in Nature Zone, close to the COP negotiations and action, we will gather thought leaders from business and society to tackle the big issues we have in front on us when it comes to climate mitigation, adaption and resilience. What do we mean by climate mitigation, adaptation and resilience? Mitigation refers to efforts to reduce or prevent emission of greenhouse gases. This is basically a focus on slowing the rate of global warming. Adaptation refers to humans adapting to life in a changing climate and adjusting to the actual or expected future climate. Resilience is a measure of an area's ability to deal with the effects of climate change and 'bounce back' or recover. To think of it in real terms using the example of catastrophic weather: mitigation works to minimise climate change, so we don't get increasingly severe storms, adaptation helps prepare for the more severe storms which we are already beginning to experience, and resilience helps us bounce back more quickly following these storms. You could think of these as the three pillars of climate action-and technology can help with all three. For mitigation, the research is clear: ICT solutions can enable a reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions by up to 15 percent by 2030, while being responsible for only 1.4 percent of the global carbon footprint. With new emerging technologies like 5G, AI and IoT we can likely achieve even more reductions, if we implement them correctly. Technology can help with adaptation as well. One of the most visible consequences of a warming world is an increase in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events-from wildfires to flooding and hurricanes. In fact, there has been increase catastrophic weather over the last several years-but the death toll has not increased in the same way. In fact, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the number of disasters has increased by a factor of five over the 50-year period, driven by climate change. Yet despite these growing risks, around the world, disasters in general are becoming less deadly. According to the WMO, the number of disaster-related deaths has fallen by two-thirds. One reason for that is the increased monitoring and alert systems that are possible with ICT. For example, just this summer we teamed up with China Mobile Zhejiang and other partners to deploy 5G technology in public-safety-focused natural disaster management. The solution spans early-warning analysis, natural disaster monitoring, command and dispatch, and post-disaster assessment, focusing the region's vulnerability to large-scale natural disasters and flash floods during the increasingly severe wet season. And then there's resilience. Even as we work to avert the worst possible impacts of climate change, we must become more resilient to those impacts that are now unavoidable. One example is our award-winning Connected Mangroves project. By planting mangrove saplings with connected sensors, we have been able to have a full reforestation of the important mangrove forests in communities in the Philippines and Malaysia. These forests are one of Earth's most natural protectors against the impacts of climate change, particularly as they protect the local communities from catastrophic weather like typhoons and flooding, as well as protecting ecosystems vital for fisheries. By helping their reforestation, we help the local communities guard their homes and their livelihoods. I'm looking forward to hearing about more solutions at COP27 . We need to stay positive and show the world that it is possible, otherwise we will not be able to make it. And we need to make it. After all, this is the decade of action; it's more important than ever to work side-by-side with governments to scale up public-private efforts in the drive to Net Zero emissions globally.

In addition, it said Canada will host the COP15 conference on biodiversity in Montreal in December, ""underscoring our government's ongoing commitment to fighting climate change and protecting nature both here at home and around the world."" Trudeau's November itinerary will see the prime minister on the road from Nov. 12 to 20 to attend the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Summit in Cambodia, the G20 Summit in Indonesia, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Economic Leaders' Meeting in Thailand, and the Eighteenth Summit of La Francophonie in Tunisia. COP27 runs from Nov. 6 to 18. Laurel Collins, the NDP critic for environment and climate change, said the level of political representation to tackle greenhouse gas emissions is less important than commitment to promises. ""It doesn't matter who shows up if you don't put in the work that's needed,"" Collins told the Star. ""Justin Trudeau just keeps giving oil and gas CEOs billions of dollars in subsidies instead of fighting the climate crisis."" But one critic suggested Trudeau should attend the summit, not only to show Canada's commitment to its goals, but also to show he fights for the well-being of Canadians who have been hit by wildfires, floods and extreme weather linked to climate change. ""Prime Minister Trudeau's absence from COP27 would suggest that he does not recognize the mountain still in front of his government,"" said Julie Segal of the advocacy group Environmental Defence. ""Canada has a good climate plan but has not delivered results to cut emissions. In fact, Canada is the only G7 country where emissions keep increasing - now is not the time for our government to rest on its laurels."" The Green Party's environment critic Michelle Bowman said Trudeau's decision not to attend COP27 ""is totally unacceptable but not surprising given Canada's embarrassing record on climate action."" Guilbeault said in a statement that Canada ""will continue to push for the acceleration of concrete climate actions to reduce emissions and enhance resilience in communities and economies as the world faces the brunt of climate change impacts."" According to the environment department, Canada has committed $5.3 billion over five years to climate change, released a strategy to reduce emissions across the economy by more than 40 per cent by 2030, and plans to be net zero by 2050. COP27 is the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The annual conference oversees members' progress in addressing climate change. This year's conference will see 190 countries gather to discuss meeting shared goals. Irem Koca is an Ottawa-based general assignment reporter for the Star.

The inquiry concerns representations about natural gas made through the association's ""Fuelling Canada"" advertising campaign as well as other representations made to the public outside this campaign, according to a Nov. 4 letter sent to the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment (CAPE) by Josephine A.L. Palumbo, deputy commissioner in the competition authority's cartels and deceptive marketing practices branch. The complaint alleged representations by the Canadian Gas Association that natural gas is ""clean"" were false and misleading, as were claims that methane gas is more affordable than other home energy systems. ""When properly accounted for, 'natural'gas has comparable greenhouse gas emissions to coal, in part because methane, the main ingredient in 'natural'gas, has up to 80 times the climate-warming potential of carbon dioxide,"" CAPE claimed in a statement Thursday. The Canadian Gas Association could not immediately be reached for comment. A spokesperson for the Competition Bureau confirmed the watchdog ""has launched an investigation into the Canadian Gas Association's alleged deceptive marketing practices"" after receiving an application. Marie-Christine V\'e9zina said the Competition Act obligates the bureau to launch a formal investigation to determine the facts as long as such an application meets technical requirements. She said no further details about the matter will be provided. Greenwashing, in which environmental claims are not backed by substantial action, came under fire this week from Catherine Mckenna, Canada's former minister of environment and climate change, at this week's COP27 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. As chair of a UN expert group focused on net zero, McKenna laid out expectations for governments and companies and said it's ""time to draw a red line"" around greenwashing.

With oil and gas profits reaching record heights, now is the time for those companies to invest in positioning themselves for future success in a decarbonized world economy. ""In fact, Canada's largest oil and gas companies have committed to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, and many are making significant investments to further reduce their methane emissions. We welcome and encourage this commitment. The Government of Canada is reinforcing these efforts with new regulations to cap and cut emissions in the oil and gas sector, including regulations to cut methane from oil and gas by at least seventy-five percent from 2012 levels by 2030, clean fuel regulations, and funding to clean up orphan wells, as well as tax incentives for carbon-capture technologies and thedevelopment of clean fuels and technologies, such as hydrogen, biomethanization, and more.

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada32","COP27: Which countries will push to end fossil fuel production? And which won't?","November 7, 2022 Monday 12:13 AM EST","Canadian Press","This article was originally published on The Conversation, an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts. Disclosure information is available on the original site. Authors: Philippe Le Billon, Professor, Geography Department and School of Public Policy & Global Affairs, University of British Columbia; Nicolas Gaulin, Msc Student in Environmental Sciences, Wageningen University, and P\'e4ivi Lujala, Professor, Geography, University of Oulu Fossil fuels have provided a crucial source of energy over the past 200 years. But they also account for 75 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, enable massive environmental destruction and support many brutal regimes. The United Nations climate change conference COP27 ), begins Sunday in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, offering countries and organizations yet another chance to push for a phasing out of fossil fuel production. Russia\' s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting sanctions have made this move both urgent and challenging. As researchers working on climate change and resource governance, we believe that new initiatives like the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA) and rising support for a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty  which aims at addressing the threat posed by fossil fuel production  can help build momentum towards phasing out fossil fuels. A managed fossil fuel phaseout offers a chance for producers  including governments, corporations and unions  to negotiate the terms of a \' just transition\' to renewable energy that includes retraining workers, addressing lost income, securing new forms of energy and diversifying fossil fuel dependence economies. COP26 opened the doors for a phaseout The Glasgow Climate Pact, that emerged out of COP26 last year, called upon parties to  accelerate efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, recognizing the need for support towards a just transition. The COP26 also saw the launch of the BOGA through which governments like Costa Rica, Denmark, France, Greenland, Ireland, Qu\'e9bec, Sweden and Wales can pledge to either phase out the production of fossil fuels, commit to a production phaseout with a legislated end date for existing production, or make looser commitments. So far, no government with significant fossil fuel production has joined BOGA or endorsed the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty initiative, a fast growing civil society initiative calling for an end to new exploration and production, a fair phaseout of existing production and a just transition for fossil fuel workers, communities and producing countries. Having tracked through the Fossil Fuel Cuts Database which countries had previously adopted initiatives to curtail fossil fuel production, including moratoria, divestments, carbon taxes or subsidy phaseouts, we tried to determine which of them might join an international coalition for a managed phasing out of fossil fuel production. Who may join the phaseout coalition? Using the Fossil Fuel Cuts Database, we tested economic, political and climate vulnerability factors against initiatives already taken between 2006 and 2019 by 124 governments with fossil fuel reserves. We found that dependence on fossil fuel rents reduces the likelihood of constraint measures, but not the size of fossil fuel reserves or production. Richer countries are also more likely to use constraints. Based on our findings, we sketched seven main categories of countries for building up a global phaseout coalition. The first and most likely members of such coalitions are middle and high-income countries with democratic regimes, active domestic climate movements and fossil fuel reserves of little significance to their economy. This has been the case of most of BOGA\' s members. The second category includes small countries that have no fossil fuel industry and are highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, such as the republic of Vanuatu in Oceania, the first state to officially support the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty. The third category comprises countries with little prospect of fossil fuel production compared to major stakes in a green transition, such as Chile, a leading copper and lithium producer. A fourth category includes high-income democratic countries with significant fossil fuel production but a diversified economy, such as the Netherlands, which shut down some of its natural gas fields. A fifth category comprises countries where fossil fuel production is almost exclusively serving domestic energy markets that are slowly decarbonizing. China, India and the U.S.  the three biggest coal burners  have considered phasing down their coal production, but are yet to sign the Powering Past Coal Alliance  a coalition of national and sub-national governments, businesses and organizations working to advance the transition from unabated coal power generation to clean energy. A sixth category includes countries that are highly dependent on fossil fuel revenues but still interested in accelerating their economic diversification, such as Saudi Arabia, the world\' s largest exporter of crude oil, which embarked on an ambitious economic diversification plan. But, like with many other fossil fuel rich countries, this plan largely relies on fossil fuel revenues to finance diversification and a green transition, thus sustaining the paradox of increased production to pay for a planned phaseout. A seventh category comprises low to middle-income countries with a high level of dependence on foreign aid, foreign direct investment and fossil fuel revenues. These countries face challenges when translating fossil fuel wealth into inclusive forms of development and often become even more indebted. Compensating them for leaving their fossil fuel reserves has proven challenging. However, some countries like Colombia may at some point decide to join a coalition following initial pledges to keep fossil fuels in the ground. The right incentives can mobilize institutions With the right kind of economic and political incentives, including support for economic diversification and energy security guarantees, a phaseout agreement could attract producing countries and mobilize key organizations, including the International Energy Agency, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the World Trade Organization. The next two COP meetings taking place in Egypt and in the United Arab Emirates will play a crucial role in increasing pressure to phase out fossil fuels, expanding the number of BOGA members and starting substantive discussions on processes and principles for an international fossil fuel phaseout agreement. ___ Philippe Le Billon receives funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council.

It's not the COP sessions that change the world. It's the actual work that goes on after governments have made those promises. COP27 heard calls to transform the global financial system to deliver funding to help countries cut their carbon emissions, and adapt their economies to the changes caused by global warming. Calls to reform the financial system, including the IMF and World Bank, came from many including Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados. The Bridgetown Initiative contains five specific proposals that individually are achievable within 18 months and collectively will meaningfully redraw the global financial system to better respond to the climate and development crises.

The announcement was made by Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman at the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 ). For many regions, climate change is a food and economic crisis without precedent. More than 2 billion people depend on smallholder farms for food and income, yet less than 2% of global climate finance is devoted to helping these farms adapt to climate change. Food and economic crises will last longer and become more severe as climate threats escalate and further threaten food security by limiting smallholder farmers' yields and resilience. ""The effects of climate change have already been devastating, and every moment the world delays action, more people suffer, and the solutions become more complex and costly,"" said Suzman. ""Our commitment will help smallholder farmers adapt today and build resilience for the future. It is essential for this climate summit to produce bold commitments that address immediate and long-term needs. Leaders must listen to the voices of African farmers and governments to understand their priorities and respond with urgency."" The foundation's commitment will fund immediate action and long-term initiatives over four years to help smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia build resilience and food security. Funding will focus on spurring African-led innovation to build a pipeline of climate-smart agriculture projects, new applications of digital technologies, climate-smart innovations for smallholder livestock farming, and support for women smallholder farmers to capitalize on their untapped potential. ""Women in rural Africa are the backbone of their food systems, but they have never had equal access to the resources they need to reach their full potential or build resilience to looming climate threats,"" said Melinda French Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. ""As the climate crisis accelerates, women's vital role in their economies is too important to overlook. With the right financing and marketing support, women smallholder farmers could earn more in a day than they currently earn in a month, ultimately transforming these regional food systems and unlocking a healthier, more sustainable, and more prosperous future for families and communities across the continent."" To improve the livelihoods of rural women in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, the foundation is deepening its ongoing partnership with theInternational Fund for Agricultural Development(IFAD). The goal is to scale up initiatives that empower women farmers, support innovations at the nexus of gender and climate adaptation, and increase climate finance that gives rural women better access to the climate-smart resources they need to strengthen food systems. To accelerate the development of new adaptation innovations, the foundation is continuing to work with a coalition of partners to double the budget for the CGIAR agriculture research system. The CGIAR Excellence in Agronomyinitiative partners with African research institutes, local businesses, and farmer organizations. Together, they are using big data, analytics, and digital platforms to deliver insights that can boost incomes, food security, and ecosystem health in smallholder farming communities. ""The climate crisis is causing enormous harm every day as it jeopardizes entire regions of people and economies,"" said Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. ""More funding is necessary to ensure agricultural and technological innovations are widely available to vulnerable communities, helping them to adapt to climate change, save lives and increase economic growth."" Additional investments included in the commitment announced today will support: The Africa Adaptation Initiative (AAI) to quickly build a pipeline of climate-smart agriculture projects across 23 countries in Africa. Funding will provide targeted support for the technical capacity, planning, and project development required to implement programs.The development of new applications of digital technologies to ensure smallholder farmers can anticipate and respond to climate threats. This includes an innovative weather intelligence platform developed through a new partnership between the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) and TomorrowNow, which provides climate-smart agriculture strategies to farmers in East Africa via text messages.African-led innovations to develop climate-smart options for improving livestock health and productivity while also reducing their climate footprint. This will be done in partnership with Canada's International Development Research Center (IDRC). This funding builds on more than a decade of investments and the foundation's recent announcement during the United Nations General Assembly of $100 million in funding to help alleviate the current food crisis in Africa and South Asia and address its underlying causes. It also builds on funding commitments focused on agriculture adaptation made at previous climate summits: The Africa Adaptation Initiative (AAI) to quickly build a pipeline of climate-smart agriculture projects across 23 countries in Africa.

What share of mitigation and adaptation finance should be offered to vulnerable countries in the form of grants versus loans? How much, and under what circumstances, should firms use carbon offsets? Should funding for fossil fuel companies be part of the green transition? At the Canada pavilion on the floor of the Sharm el-Sheikh conference centre Wednesday, a panel of representatives from some of the country\' s largest pension funds disagreed on the answer to that last question. Evan Siddall, CEO of Alberta Investment Management Corporation, insisted that oil and gas companies are essential for Canada\' s energy transition that investing to decarbonize the sector is the best option for the industry, asset-owners and the environment. Marc-Andr\'e9 Blanchard, in his role as global head of sustainability at the Caisse de d\'e9p\'f4t et placement du Qu\'e9bec the only Canadian pension fund that has HYPERLINK https://thelogic.co/news/caisse-is-canadas-first-institutional-investor-to-plan-exit-from-oil-producers/ divested its fossil-fuel assets as part of its climate policy opposed the view.\~ In a panel discussion on GFANZ Wednesday evening, Carney, too, argued that divestment isn\' t the answer not at this stage.

But policy-makers need to direct financial markets on what to do next, he said.\~ On the same panel, International Monetary Fund managing director Kristalina Georgieva put a finer point on it.  To the private sector people in this audience, please scream bloody murder, she said, calling on corporate capital to demand policies, like a predictable price on carbon and subsidies for green investments, that remove barriers to their investments.  Because otherwise, she said,  we won\' t cross the finish line on time. \~ Elsewhere at COP27  U.S. climate envoy John Kerry HYPERLINK announced a new carbon market initiative to incentivise companies to buy carbon credits that will support countries switching off coal power.

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada52","Human rights defenders warn activists are being arrested ahead of Egypt's climate summit","November 4, 2022 Friday 9:48 AM GMT","CBC News","Human rights groups in Egypt had hoped the authoritarian government would relax its grip on civil society ahead of COP27 , but instead advocates say police have started cracking down and arresting anyone suspected of planning a protest in the lead up to the UN climate summit. The2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , also known as the 27th Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC ( COP27 ), kicks off on Sunday in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. But COP27 ""This is going to be probably the most restricted COPs in the history of COPs,"" said Hussein Baoumi, an Egypt and Libya researcher with Amnesty International. Baoumi spoke with CBC News from Brussels, where he lives in exile. Originally from Egypt, he left the country because his advocacy work defending human rights made it too dangerous to stay, he says. Unlike last year's summit in Glasgow, which saw mass demonstrations, Egypt has little tolerance for public dissent and protest. In 2013,human rights observers estimated hundreds of protesters were killed during the military coup that ousted the country's first democratically elected president, the late Mohamed Morsi, and saw the current president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, take over leadership of the country. Baoumi said in the lead up to COP27 , Amnesty International has confirmed that police have arrested as many as 90 people for allegedly calling for anti-government protests on Nov. 11. ""If you go to Cairo or any major Egyptian city now, what you will see is that there are police checkpoints everywhere. They are stopping people randomly, ordering them to open their phones and those who don't comply are arrested,"" Baoumi said. ""Those who have critical content of the authorities are arrested \'e2\€ \£6 if you try to protest anywhere in Egypt, there is no doubt that authorities will crack down without hesitation."" According to a human rights organization,The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms, those arrested have been charged with allegedly spreading false news, misusing social media and participating in a terrorist group. ""We were expecting that as Egypt hosts COP27 , the security grip would be eased on all forms of political activism in Egypt and openness in the public sphere, but this has not happened,"" director Mohamed Lotfy told Reuters, speaking in Arabic. ""What we see is toughening of the [security grip] even on civilians passing by on the streets and interference in their personal lives and breaching their privacy by forcing them to open up their mobile phones and inspecting their political views."" A designated protest zone far from the conference COP27 Already, the conference is taking place in a remote resort town on the coast of the Red Sea, about a six hour's drive from the bustling capital of Cairo. The designated area for protests is across the road from where the summit is taking place \'e2\€  called the ""Blue Zone"" \'e2\€  and confined to an enclosed space within what's called the ""Green Zone."" The Egyptian COP27 Activists who hope to plan a public climate march in town are required to submit notice 48 hours ahead of time. ""It's not like Glasgow or Madrid, the previous COPs, where there is going to be massive mobilization,"" said Ahmed El Droubi, the regional campaigns manager for Greenpeace Middle East and North Africa. He said the climate movement has been calling for decentralized actions around the world during COP27 The tightly controlled environment leaves little space for citizen dialogue during a global summit that's supposed to centre on the theme of climate justice, all while in a country that'sextremely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Canadian activists still plan on attending Despite the restrictions, some international activists \'e2\€  including Canadians \'e2\€  are planning on showing up. Sophia Mathur, a 15-year-old climate activist from Sudbury, Ont., whohas organized student protests in Canada will be flying to Egypt to attend the conference with her parents. ""It is a little upsetting that we can't hold big protests. But \'e2\€ \£6 I think there are lots of ways we can work around it, like holding discussions online,"" she said. Tia Kennedy, who is from Oneida Nation of the Thames and Walpole Island First Nation, will be at the summit as an Indigenous youth delegate with Kairos and For the Love of Creation. She said activism can take many forms and doesn't necessarily require marching in the streets. ""I think being in these spaces is a form of advocacy and activism in and of itself,"" she said. ""For a long time, Indigenous peoples were left out of these spaces on purpose. So just being able to show up as our authentic selves \'e2\€  that in itself is a form of resistance and activism."" While authorities in Egypt may try to muffle dissent, environmentalists say they will continue to fight to hold their governments accountable on climate action once they return home. ""We need to witness. We need to be there with the world governments,"" said Kupki7(Chief) Judy Wilson, who is the chief of Neskonlith Indian Band and will attend COP27 as secretary treasurer for the Union of BC Indian Chiefs. El Droubi agrees that meaningful climate action must have support from the citizens, which is why he will also be attending COP27 as a representative for Greenpeace. ""Policies cannot come top down,"" he said. COP27 but more importantly, in the future."" \"

We are ready to bring our Team Alberta approach directly to the world's audience at Sharm El Sheikh, and point to the critical advancements, innovations and emissions reduction in Alberta. In the past, we have not been there, and that meant missed opportunities. By taking our seat at the world's table, Alberta can showcase how we are global leaders, whether it is carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), reducing methane emissions and clean hydrogen. We see great work done on this front by the Pathways Alliance. In refusing to participate, we not only miss the opportunity to tell our story, but also allow the federal government to build a one-sided narrative. This is not acceptable. We have seen the federal government commit to targets, outcomes, and dates that are not achievable, and subsequently return to Canada to hand down unrealistic objectives that fall on the provinces to achieve. As constitutional owner of natural resources with the exclusive authority to manage and develop those resources, the provinces are then asked to deliver on climate plans that are neither technologically nor economically feasible. This is one of the reasons why Canada has never met a single climate target. We need to have an honest conversation about balancing climate policy with energy and food security. This means connecting the question of emission reduction targets with an understanding of the technology and economic costs required to get there. As COP27 If climate policy continues to drive away oil and gas investment in responsible energy producing jurisdictions like Canada, policy makers would be sentencing vulnerable jurisdictions to a continued energy crisis. The world's citizens are counting on their representatives to seize a balance between climate policy and energy security. Alberta is constantly demonstrating environmental leadership that is possible from a responsible energy-producing jurisdiction. We have been a leader in this space for decades. We established the first environment ministry in Canada in 1971, created the first climate plan in Canada in 1998, introduced the first North American carbon price on industrial emissions and emissions trading system in 2007, and currently have an internationally-recognized, methane emissions reduction framework. Canada's largest oil sands producers, via the Pathways Alliance, have committed to net zero-emissions by 2050. Our Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction (TIER) system and our world-leading progress on CCUS technology are prime examples of the innovation, technology and expertise Canada and the world need to reach ambitious emissions reduction targets. I am excited that our Team Alberta approach brings together a broader delegation comprised of industry, environmental non-government organizations, academia, investors, indigenous organizations, youth, municipal governments who are finding real, achievable solutions to emissions reductions. That is the message I will be bringing forward at COP27 . We can and we must succeed in balancing climate policy with energy and food security, or our climate ambitions will hit reality. Unfortunately, reality can have sharp teeth and bite hard. - Sonya Savage, Alberta's Minister of Environment and Protected Areas \"

The conference focuses on ""implementation"" and discusses climate issues froma practical level. As the only Chinese bus brand serving COP27 , thirty units of Higer's electric buses provide the zero-carbon shuttle service for the conference. Higer bus, China's leading clean technology bus company, shows the commitment and strength to serve such international conferences and provides China's solution to climate challenges in the global public transportation industry. The buses, jointly built by Higer andits Egyptian partner, G Company, are operated between Sharm el-Sheikh, the blue zone and green zone of the venue, providing excellent services for government officials and international organization representatives. The futuristic design language, zero-carbon emissions and comfortable riding experience have attracted the attention and praise of people from all walks of life. In 2020, G Company and Higer Bus agreed on localization bus production to achieve Egypt's environmental-friendly ambitions. As a result, G Company has invested in constructing a modern manufacturing infrastructure and started to produce Higer's cleantech bus.

During a session at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 According to the International Energy Agency, 40% of the CO2 reductions needed to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 will be achieved by technology not yet commercially available. For ambitious climate goals, such as the UAE's Net Zero by 2050 plan, this is especially relevant. The energy sector has made significant progress in developing clean energy technologies; however, the world still has a long way to go before it can meet its decarbonization goals. Through the AWS Clean Energy Accelerator 3.0, we are aiming to stimulate co-innovation through energy collaborations as well as meet the requirements of mature entrepreneurs from around the world. Amazon's Vice President of Worldwide Sustainability, Kara Hurst, remarked that 'the path to rapid decarbonization is not straightforward, and we must partner with and highlight companies that are developing clean energy technologies.' Many of the innovations that can contribute to the acceleration of the energy transition have been developed by startups. This year's cohort of Clean Energy Accelerators will be able to tackle the toughest challenges faster and create a cleaner, healthier planet with the assistance of the Clean Energy Accelerator.' Among the topics covered by industry and thought leaders during the program are energy, digital competencies, investment, public policy, innovation, and cutting-edge research. In addition to offering guidance on how to speed up experimentation, extend automation, and gain deeper insights using the cloud, leading energy corporations will collaborate with selected startups to address sustainable energy and decarbonization issues. To jumpstart their cloud-based data and operations transformation, the selected finalists will receive a $100,000 AWS Credit through AWS Activate, as well as technical and business mentoring from AWS. AWS (Amazon Web Services) Overview Amazon Web Services has been the world's most comprehensive and widely used cloud platform for over 15 years. There are more than 200 fully featured AWS services for compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI). There are 80 availability zones within 25 geographical regions for the Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, security, hybrid, virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR), media, and application development, deployment, and management. In Australia, India, Indonesia, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates, 18 additional Availability Zones and six additional AWS Regions have been announced. Many companies, including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies, trust AWS to power their infrastructure, become more agile, and lower costs.

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada70","A welcome step in the climate fight","November 24, 2022 Thursday","thestar.com","Is there time to prevent Tuvalu from disappearing? The future of the coral island chain - think sea birds, snorkeling, an unspoiled Pacific paradise-awaits-you vibe - should remain in our hearts and minds as we celebrate the landmark victory that emerged Sunday from the United Nations climate change conference . At long last HYPERLINK COP27 leaders agreed to so-called ""loss and damage"" funding to aid vulnerable nations ravaged by climate catastrophe. As HYPERLINK https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/2022/11/12/climate-change-meeting-a-reminder-of-inaction-on-past-promises.html recently documented in this space Yes. But. There's always a but. Governments agreed to establish a ""transitional committee,"" the purpose of which is to ""make recommendations"" on how to ""operationalize"" the fund at the time of next year's climate change gathering. Set that against the near surreal announcement from Tuvalu foreign affairs minister Simon Kofe that a plan is afoot to make Tuvalu the world's first digital nation. It takes a second to get one's head around that. But with sea levels advancing and temperatures rapidly rising and land literally disappearing, Tuvaluvians face the real prospect of becoming the world's first climate change refugees. Recreating the country virtually - piece by piece, as Kofe says - is a way to preserve for future generations what was. Imagine a child sitting on a grandparent's knee, immersed in computerized images of a homeland now lost, of hand-crafted canoes, of coconut trees, of wandering tattler birds wading along the seashore. Imagine a country continuing to function as a state exclusively online. We can't be incredulous about this possible outcome. Last year HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/08/tuvalu-minister-to-address-cop26-knee-deep-in-seawater-to-highlight-climate-crisis Kofe warned of his island nation's potential disappearance as he stood, in a business suit, thigh-deep in the ocean. That was before the monsoon floods in Pakistan that submerged a third of that country. Sherry Rehman, Pakistan's climate change minister, tweeted that the provinces of Sindh and Balochistan were ""transformed into horizon-free planes of unbroken water, with no land to pitch tents on, no rooftops left to huddle on."" More than 1,700 dead. More than two million homes destroyed or damaged. The aftershocks are ongoing. UNICEF says an acute child survival crisis has been left in the disaster's wake, with as many as 10 million children facing malnutrition, and malaria and dengue fever and . . . the list seems endless. Against the backdrop, HYPERLINK Rehman played a lead role COP27 in pushing through on loss and damage. After the at-long-last release of this year's agreement, she tweeted that the announcement was an important first step, and that the consensus lends ""some credibility"" to the COP process. That suggests caution, which is well warranted. The past promises of developed countries to, for example, finance adaptation and emissions reduction efforts in developing countries have fallen drastically short of commitments. The $100-billion (U.S.) annual pledge for climate finance has not come close to reaching that goal. Then there's the bureaucratese on display in the loss and damage language. Moving from the abstract to implementation will require, as HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/sherryrehman/status/1594162164369080320 Rehman noted in a tweet And then there's the thorny issue of China. The world's top polluter, which is still listed by the UN as a developing country, appears unlikely to contribute to a fund dealing with a climate catastrophe that, it argues, has historically not been of its making. Of course, this isn't just about the future of Tuvalu and other nations. We all have a collective stake in addressing the fallout from a changing climate and taking aggressive action to stem the pace of that change. Still, tiny Tuvalu is not giving up. Only a global effort can ensure that the country doesn't move online and disappear forever from the physical plane, Simon Kofe said last week. There's a sliver of time left before the country moves permanently to the cloud. \"

Environment Minister Benoit Charette made the announcement Sunday during a meeting with the Quebec delegation to the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. Quebec wants to encourage people to get involved through its Mobilization Strategy for Climate Action, which is an extension of other programs that have funded mobilization actions in the past. The amount of $46.4 million responds to a frequent request from groups consulted by the Environment Ministry, according to Charette. This is an increased amount, he added, compared to previous programs. By way of example, he cited Unpointcinq, a journalism project specializing in climate action that has benefited from the financial support of the government. Since 2016, approximately $35 million has been granted to 84 projects to fight climate change under the Action-Climat Qu\'e9bec program, including Agriclimat to help farms adapt to climate change; Mouvement V\'e9losympathique, which encourages the creation of favourable environments for cycling; Rendez-vous branch\'e9s to promote electric cars; as well as dozens of local projects. The new program is spread over the next five years. Interested groups will be able to present their mobilization initiatives during calls for projects, which will be evaluated by the ministry. All groups are invited to participate, Charette said. However, the government especially wants to support Indigenous communities in their climate actions. ""As part of the preparation of the plan for a green economy, we consulted the Indigenous communities and we promised them initiatives that could directly affect their community,"" Charette said. Organizations that offer training to the public also are encouraged to participate. ""The initiatives and possibilities are very, very numerous,"" Charette added, citing the example of training in residual materials management given by an organization. The program could also be a tool for municipalities wishing to encourage their residents to come together to take action. For example, ""a municipality (wanting) to accompany a group of citizens to help mobilize a neighbourhood in order to achieve a particular objective"" could apply for funding under the Mobilization Strategy for Climate Action. Other programs are also available to municipalities to deal with climate change, Charette said. ""For the local climate transition, a fund of $200 million will be available from the beginning of 2023 for plans (that the municipalities put in place) to fight climate change,"" Charette said. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2022 Postmedia Network Inc.

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada79","'It was transformative': Nelson residents reflect on attending COP27","December 1, 2022","Nelson Star","Marian Berry says attending COP27 in Egypt for a week in November changed her life. The Nelson neurologist spent the first week of the United Nations climate summit as an observer.ooo ""It was transformative,"" she says. ""I will be, I am, a new and different person."" Marian says one of the signs of change is that she has taken up a vegan diet, because meat production is one of the worst producers of greenhouse gases. She says the switch to a new way of eating is not easy. ""It's a challenge, but I'll get there,"" she says. COP27 , held Nov. 6 to 20 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, was the annual summit convened by the United Nations where up to 200 countries attempt to reach consensus on how to confront the climate crisis. The event was attended by more than 35,000 people. Marian knew about the problems of meat production before, but the experience of COP27 inspired her to act. She had already been active in climate action through the groups Doctors and Nurses Planetary Health, and Canadian Association of Physician for the Environment, as well as with Interior Health, and she says COP27 deepened her commitment to that work. ""I am going to be looking at everything I do in my life in a new way, in a mindful way, what I'm consuming, what I'm thinking, my relationship to the earth, and I'm going to be spreading that perspective."" The new commitment, she says, came not through her accustomed medical lens, and not from new technical information about climate change, but from a group of Indigenous women from various countries who presented workshops at the event. ""They were really advocating for women's voices and for Mother Earth, for treating the earth not as something to extract from and to utilize, but actually to be a part of."" Marian said she had been aware of such perspectives before, but on a surface level, and the presence and voices of the Indigenous women at the conference helped her understand more deeply. ""It really resonated with me. It was just very emotionally impactful."" Gender diversity at COP27 Gideon Berry attended COP27 as a delegate from the group Research and Independent Non-Governmental Organizations. Gideon invited their mother Marian to accompany them. A masters student in electrical engineering at the University of British Columbia, Gideon, 25, has an exhaustive array of technical and political concerns related to the climate emergency and COP27 . ""A lot of LGBTQ people had been told (by their families or institutions) that going to this convention, they should keep this under wraps and not be who they are,"" they said. But Gideon did not follow this advice. ""I wanted to be queer, because it is important for gender diverse people to be visible at these international events. But I did not know how safe I would be. I didn't know if I would be putting my safety on the line, being openly queer or presenting as female or presenting as trans or whatever people would perceive me as."" Gideon says if gender diverse people (or other marginalized people) can't be who they are, they can't meaningfully take part in conversations or negotiations at an event like COP27 . ""At COP, if you talk about gender it means girls and women, not other aspects of gender."" Neither Gideon nor Marian felt safe at the event because their accommodation, shared with Gideon's partner Aria Finley, was an hour-long bus ride away from the event compound in a city where they could not speak the language. All three felt uneasy, Gideon because of their appearance \- they sometimes wore a dress and make-up \- and Marian and Aria because they are women. Marian said the concept of safe space has never been part of the COP meetings. ""Where's the voice of gender diversity at the table as a delegate?"" she asks. ""Next year, it's going to be in Dubai, where you're not allowed to express anything LGBTQ. I think that's a big issue."" Young people are 'tokenized' Because Marian was not a delegate at COP27 but an observer, she was restricted to the Green Zone, in which she attended dozens of workshops, panels, and presentations. The venue was brand new, she said, much of it outdoors, with green grass, fountains, and art structures, a kind of bubble placed in the middle of an old city. ""Everything was artificial and beautiful,"" she said, with people from all over the world, but not crowded. She watched young entrepreneurs pitching new climate solutions and attended a session on green cities in which some Vancouver initiatives were featured. She heard presentations by business people that were, she thinks, a mix of ""greenwashing"" and legitimate solutions, and she went to sessions on the design of a circular economy in which you can live, work and shop close to home. She attended a session on insurance where the speaker said more investors are insisting that companies reduce their emissions and their climate risk. Marian heard a talk by Omnia El Omrani of Egypt, the first-ever official youth envoy to the conference who was actually involved in the climate negotiations. Omrani is a medical resident in Cairo, and therefore a professional colleague of Marian's. ""She's a voice that's going to be listened to,"" said Marian. ""Very eloquent."" As a delegate, Gideon was able to participate in the Blue Zone, in which it was possible to observe the negotiations between the countries, as well as attend panels and workshops. Gideon was a panelist in a forum for young academics sponsored by the UBC Sustainability Hub. For the first time at a COP, there was a youth and child pavilion, with events happening all day, where Gideon spent much of their time. There were opportunities for youth to have Q&As with high-level speakers and to participate in panel discussions and educational sessions, Gideon said. This year, the world's foremost youth climate activist Greta Thunberg decided not to attend COP27 , saying the event is little more than a forum for greenwashing by governments and businesses. ""Like Indigenous people, youth are very much tokenized with regards to COP,"" they said. ""We're kind of praised: 'Oh, we're so thankful to you for pushing us for better action,' but we are not given the space or power to actually get our voices heard and acted for."" Loss and damages At COP27 But so far there has been no decision on how the fund will be administered, who will contribute to it, who will receive funding, or how much. This has been left to future COPs. Gideon and Marion both think the fact that the fund was even talked about is simultaneously encouraging and disappointing. ""It's very important for trust between the global north and global south,"" Gideon said. ""However, it's something that's over-celebrated. We're celebrating so much for something that's the bare minimum."" Marian said she heard speakers from African countries who have suffered environmental loss due to floods and drought, and who said funding should be given at a very local level so they can develop their own solutions. What should have happened at COP27 , Gideon said, was for the countries to agree to phase out fossil fuels, which has never happened over the course of 27 annual COPs. They said Canada's refusal at COP27 to back a call for a phase-down of oil and gas production brought this into clearer focus. Gideon said the Canadian government is too focused on helping oil and gas workers and not on marginalized groups, and ""it's very focused on the development of green jobs and not on discontinuing fossil fuels."" COP27 conclusions are more personal than political, involving lifestyle changes that she wants to model for others. ""I feel really good about riding my bike instead of driving a car,"" she says, ""and I will continue to do that. But we have to do more. If there is one message, it's that we have to do more.""

My name is Tricia Clarkson and I am co-chair for PACA and a Climate Change Columnist for PTW. Thank you to everyone for showing up, once again, to try to pressure all governments around the world to speed up the reduction of CO2 emissions - for the sake of our health, and the health of our planet. Thank you also to 4RG for organizing this event with PACA and for initiating the letter writing campaign at the Whistle Stop that will take place after this rally. It's important that we use our energy wisely, in the most productive way we can, to speed up this transition, so writing and sending these letters and emails to our three levels of government is the best way to do this. So thank you Linda and Al for organizing this. There is power in numbers, so we just need to keep sending out as many emails as possible to speed up this transition. But I'm also here today to give you hope, because hope will give us the positive energy we need to keep pressuring our politicians until we see some positive results. So I have a hopeful message for you today ... As you know, The 27th Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) UN climate talks are now taking place. Civil society groups around the world called for a Global Day of Climate Action today to urge governments to cut GHG emissions and shift to a low-carbon economy. The coalition calls for an end to fossil fuel expansion and help for the poor and vulnerable who are most affected by the climate crisis. They will set up people's forums for grassroots level activism and call for marches and protests by millions of people to put pressure on 196 global governments to act now. Three years ago, Greta Thunberg inspired many of us across the globe to pressure governments to meet carbon emissions targets to help stop global warming. But after three years of protesting with emissions still rising, participation in marches has dwindled, climate change fatigue has set in and many activists are beginning to lose hope. Even Greta has been protesting remotely. So we need to restore that hope with positive energy. The good news is that there is a lot to hope for. Yuval Harari, author of a new book called Unstoppable Us says that if all governments invest just 2% of the global GDP budget in climate solutions, catastrophic climate change events could be prevented! We now have all of the green technologies available to us to do this, we just need the political will to implement them! So our new ""hopeful"" mantra should be ""We Have the Solutions Now! So Let's Use Them Now!"" It's not like we're trail-blazing. Other countries, provinces and cities have gone before us and implemented initiatives that are already working to reduce emissions. For example, the UK cut carbon emissions faster than any other G7 country, with renewable energy sources like wind and solar now making up more than 40% of their energy supply. GHG emissions on a residence basis fell by 13 per cent which proves that these technologies work. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has pledged to speed up the transition to renewables to create new high-wage jobs, protect UK energy security and deliver on net zero. Canada can speed this up too. We just need to move faster to transition to renewable energy and electrification of transportation. Some provinces are also speeding up the transition. In 2022, emissions from B.C. showed a decrease of almost three per cent, essentially due to clean transit, electrification of transportation, and low carbon building materials. By the end of 2022, BC's GHG emissions are expected to be reduced by 700 metric tons and by 7.6 per cent each year to 2030 to meet their targets. Ontario could do this too if we follow B.C.'s model. On the municipal level, the city of Kingston set an annual target to reduce their emissions by 15 per cent in 2022 and so far they're succeeding! Their Climate Change Action Plan emphasizes that, ""In order to meet our 15 per cent reduction of 2018 levels by 2022, the city must decrease its corporate emissions by a net total of 3,600 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) by 2022."" They did this with the continued use of electric city transit and electric fleet vehicles (seven per cent) and by retro commissioning and energy retrofits of existing city buildings. These initiatives are expected to contribute a further two or three per cent reduction. It all adds up. Peterborough could do this too because we now have Kingston's blueprint to follow that works to reduce emissions, but the city must start now - at the next council meeting. The new mayor of Selwyn has pledged to put climate change and sustainable at the top of her agenda and it will be the first motion at Selwyn's next council meeting! So there is lot's to be hopeful for. The bottom line is that we now have enough concrete solutions that are working to reduce emissions and reach our targets - we just need the political will to implement them quickly. Not having enough money to implement them is a non-starter, because climate change is now causing catastrophic damage that is costing billions of dollars a year. So why not spend two per cent of all government budgets on preventions instead of repairs? Linda and Al Slavin from 4RG have organized a letter campaign at the Whistle Stop after we leave here so you can email your municipal, provincial and federal governments and ask them to start implementing these solutions in 2023. If they need help researching them, offer to help, because politicians and staff are overwhelmed with other crises that also need immediate attention. As concerned citizens, we need to help each other to a better quality of life. We can even get our kids and grandkids to do some of the research and letter writing. They would love it. That's what working together in the same positive direction with concrete ideas to reach our targets, is all about. \"
"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada88","One huge win from COP27","November 23, 2022 Wednesday","The Toronto Star","The elements were all in place for COP27 , which concluded Sunday in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, to be a disaster. Even a quick tour of the global landscape reveals an array of forces lined up against far reaching climate action. Pick your poison: The Russian war of aggression on Ukraine and subsequent energy crisis in Europe and burgeoning global food crisis; the ongoing economic and social effects of COVID; rampant global inflation; U.S.-China tensions. Any one of these issues would make increased action a tough sell. Today, all are prominent and interconnected. Combine this global context with a problematic host country for the negotiations and a unprecedentedly large contingent of fossil fuel industry lobbyists and representatives carrying a beguilingly appealing message (you need energy, we have energy) and many observers braced for the worst. Yet disaster was averted. No one should hail the outcome as a resounding success, but COP27 concluded with one huge win on the issue of loss and damage and a series of ""it could have been worse"" results that provide hope for the resilience of global momentum. Loss and damage, providing funds to countries suffering from climate impacts (especially those countries with little responsibility for climate change), has been hotly debated by richer and poorer countries for years and was mostly a non-starter at the climate negotiations. This year was different. With climate catastrophes, especially the apocalyptic flooding in Pakistan, front of mind, the international community agreed for the first time to develop a global loss and damage fund. This alone makes COP27 noteworthy. But as many observers noted, it's perverse to push forward on loss and damage without also advancing on what's causing climate disasters. Here progress was depressingly scant. No new ambitions on cutting emissions were announced. Rather than acknowledging the obvious need to phaseout fossil energythe negotiators just cut and pasted the relatively weak call from COP26 to phasedown use of unabated coal. But it could have been much worse. The 1.5 C target survived despite significant worries it would be abandoned. Although oil and gas phasedowns did not make it into the final text, upwards of 80 nations called for them, including India and the United States, ensuring their prominence in future negotiations. The agreement also emphasized the financial necessities/opportunities involved in transitioning to a low carbon world and called for the refashioning of multilateral financial institutions aligned with the challenge at hand. Finally, multiple mentions of just transition, pursuing equity and justice in conjunction with climate action, suggest that climate justice concerns are becoming mainstream in the international community. ""It could have been worse"" is a low bar for success to be sure. For all the movement on loss and damage, no new money was committed. Similarly, calls for massive investments and transformations of multilateral banks are not new or specific, even if they are more emphatic. The world is not close to a 1.5 C path and a global transformation away from fossil energy must rapidly accelerate if we have any chance of avoiding a future featuring regular climate catastrophes. But there's something important here. The momentum around climate action, as inadequate as it is, appears to finally have an inertia of its own that even a close to worse-case scenario of global political-economic circumstances could not halt. This is a stark warning for Canada. For all its support of loss and damage and broad goals of transformation, its own energy and economic transition away from fossil energy needs to accelerate, something that Canada helped ensure was off the table in Sharm el-Sheikh. We simply cannot count on continuing demand for oil and gas exports. However infuriatingly slowly, the low carbon future is coming and is seen by more and more people and countries as the inevitable path forward. We face the danger of being left behind as the world moves toward it.

But Russia\' s invasion of Ukraine, an energy crisis, rising inflation and a global economic slowdown have transformed the world since nations last met in Glasgow at COP26.\~ \~ The Logic \' s Catherine McIntyre is reporting on the ground in Egypt, speaking to policymakers, climate experts, investors and business leaders to find out how the negotiations will affect Canada\' s net-zero ambitions.\~  This may be the panel with the highest ratio of media interest to seating capacity at COP, said moderator Mark Cameron, vice president of external relations at Pathways Alliance, an industry association representing oil sands companies that have set targets to reach net-zero emissions by mid-century. The Logic met with Cameron the evening before to discuss the industry\' s agenda at COP27 and what it\' s like being  the skunk at the garden party, as he put it.\~  The conversations are usually pretty friendly, said Cameron, adding that the backlash feels more  performative than genuinely hostile. But on the eve of his panel discussion, he was nevertheless bracing for a protest the following day.\~ Partway through the Pathways panel Friday, activists seated in the audience rose from their chairs and, holding white signs that read  kick big polluters out, quietly walked out of the room. The demonstration was stereotypically Canadian in its politeness it scarcely interrupted the panel but its message reverberated throughout the venue.\~ Canada\' s oil-sector has been a divisive presence at this year\' s global climate conference. Activists argue there\' s no place for fossil fuels in the global shift to net-zero and that the industry\' s presence at the conference serves only as a greenwashing tactic. Protests of industries that proliferate global warming are a fixture at COP conferences. At the meeting in Glasgow last year, banks took the brunt of activists\' ire for continuing to finance fossil fuel projects while claiming their practices were aligned with net-zero principles.\~ But there\' s a HYPERLINK https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/11/10/cop27-egypt-fossil-fuel/ substantially larger COP27  The reason we\' re here is because we have to be part of the solution, said Cameron.  This isn\' t just a meeting for NGOs and governments. It\' s a meeting for the people that have to decarbonize. Climate action is going to take unprecedented collaboration. Canada\' s Pathways alliance cd be a model. Impressive to see indigenous, govt, tech & corporate leaders working together on net zero oil. Also impressive to see at HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/hashtag/cop27?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw # cop27 how many other countries are too HYPERLINK https://t.co/JminK7BcJe pic.twitter.com/JminK7BcJe  john stackhouse (@StackhouseJohn) HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/StackhouseJohn/status/1590988124750254080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw November 11, 2022 Rhona DelFrari, chief sustainability officer at Calgary-based Cenovus, is among at least ten representatives from Canadian oil and gas companies that traveled to Egypt for the climate conference. It\' s her first time at a COP and she told The Logic she\' s here to exchange information with other fossil fuel companies on how to cut emissions in their operations.  We\' re looking at new technologies that are being presented, we\' re talking to others about the challenges we\' re having in Canada and how we could collaborate with other countries that are facing the same challenges. In an email, Enbridge which has three employees attending the summit shared a similar motivation.  COP27 is an excellent opportunity for Enbridge to engage with like-minded organizations and stakeholders on finding ways to partner to enhance our greenhouse gas emissions reduction and advance the energy transition through investments in clean technology and innovation, wrote spokesperson Gina Sutherland.\~ Oil-sands firms haven\' t just come to learn, of course; they\' re in Egypt to market Canada\' s fossil fuels to the world. The sector\' s large contingent (Suncor was the only company that sent someone to Glasgow last year) coincides with a dire energy crisis in Europe that\' s sent countries in the bloc scrambling for new sources of oil and gas after Russia cut their supplies earlier this year.\~  I\' m having a lot of conversations these days about energy security and climate change going hand-in-hand, said DelFrari.  If you do one without the other, it can be really disruptive to entire societies. That\' s what you\' re seeing right now in Europe. DelFrari said Cenovus and its peers can serve low-carbon sources of fuel for the energy transition.  If our\' s is the most sustainably produced oil and gas, then we should earn the spot to be that provider well into the future, she said. Most of the sector is at COP27 under the Pathways Alliance banner, a coalition of six oil sands companies working on technologies that they say will scrub greenhouse gas output from operations like drilling and refining their products. They\' ve pinned much of their net-zero plans on carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) facilities. They\' re also looking into small-nuclear reactors to power oil sands operations, and  solvent technologies to reduce the need for energy-intensive steam needed for extracting oil. Much of the technology is unproven and nowhere near operational.\~  It\' s highly ambitious, said Cameron.  If we lose a year or two to regulatory delays or lawsuits, we won\' t be able to achieve 2030 for many of the projects, he said, referring to the year by which companies have set interim emissions-reduction targets on route to reaching net-zero by 2050.\~ The Pathways projects require a lot of money to prove and develop about $24.1 billion. The group is funded by its members, but Cameron said they\' re also looking for government support.  None of these projects make money on their own. They cost billions of dollars, so we are looking for support in various ways, he said.\~ Many attendees at COP27 , however, say the oil sector\' s focus on cleaning up its legacy business isn\' t enough. Even if companies remove greenhouse gasses from their own operations, there\' s still the CO2 emitted when the products are burned.\~ A UN HYPERLINK https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/high-level_expert_group_n7b.pdf report released at COP27 on Monday from a task force led by Canada\' s former environment minister Catherine McKenna said that  net zero is entirely incompatible with continued investment in fossil fuels and called for their phasing out.\~ The federal government is rolling out financing tools to help decarbonization projects. In the 2022 federal budget, it https://thelogic.co/news/federal-budget-reveals-carbon-capture-tax-credit-smaller-than-what-oil-patch-called-for/ announced tax credits allowing industrial-scale emitters to write off 50 per cent of equipment costs for CCUS projects, and  direct air capture projects are eligible for a 60 per cent credit on their costs. In its fall economic statement earlier this month the government also HYPERLINK https://thelogic.co/news/special-report/fall-economic-statement-2022-whats-in-it-for-the-innovation-economy/ announced it will launch a 30 per cent tax credit for other green technologies like solar, wind and hydro, and small modular nuclear reactors.\~ The forthcoming Canada Growth Fund, meanwhile, will HYPERLINK https://thelogic.co/news/special-report/canada-bets-on-new-15b-canada-growth-fund-to-help-keep-up-with-u-s-industrial-spending-spree/ inject an additional $15 billion into emissions-reduction projects and firms developing new technology. The fund could guarantee revenue for carbon-capture or hydrogen projects using instruments called contracts for difference. The agreements would require Ottawa to make up the shortfall if the market price for a project\' s emissions-reductions falls below set targets.  We\' re looking at that pretty closely, said Cameron. Other support, he said, could potentially come from the Alberta government through the oil sands royalty payments scheme, though he said it\' s unclear how the system which allows companies to deduct part of their capital costs against royalty payments would apply to CCUS.\~ Along with the oil companies themselves, there\' s a large delegation supporting the sector from the province of Alberta, led by environment minister Sonya Savage.\~ Edmonton Mayor Amarjeet Sohi told Friday he had come to COP27 to tout the city\' s fledgling hydrogen industry, which promises to make clean-burning fuel from natural gas.\~  Edmonton region is poised to be a leader in hydrogen production, he said. Earlier this week, federal innovation minister Fran\'e7ois-Philippe Champagne announced construction on a $1.6-billion hydrogen plant will proceed in Edmonton after Air Products Canada, the company behind the project, HYPERLINK https://thelogic.co/news/exclusive/federal-government-fuels-up-1-6b-alberta-hydrogen-project-with-300m-from-flagship-fund/ secured a combined $475 million from the federal and provincial governments.\~ Laura Kilcrease, CEO of Alberta Innovates, said she\' s in Egypt to focus on  bitumen beyond combustion  alternative uses for oil sands products that don\' t involve burning fuels.

The agreement was announced early Sunday in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, after fraught overnight negotiations. But the summit failed to reach an agreement to further cut emissions, leaving the aim of limiting global warming to 1.5 Celsius in doubt. The agreement will establish a fund for climate compensation for ""particularly vulnerable"" countries. But it left open questions of exactly who would pay, to which countries, how much, and whether new money is required, to next year's meeting in the UAE. The U.K. and EU say they already provide sufficient funding for vulnerable countries to respond to natural disasters which have been made worse because of climate change. Health Secretary Steve Barclay on Sunday declined to commit to additional U.K. funding. ""We need to look at the detail. Obviously that's just coming through now,"" he told BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg. Alok Sharma, the Cop26 president, welcomed the ""historic"" decision, which he said would ""require contributions from the widest range of sources and parties,"" in a hint of the battle to come over whether China and others should contribute to the fund. But he warned the agreement was ""not a moment of unqualified celebration"" as it had failed to increase emissions cuts necessary to limit warming. Wrangling by gas-producing nations led to the deal stressing the importance of ""low-emission"" energy alongside renewables, seen as leaving open the door for gas use. ""I said in Glasgow that the pulse of 1.5 degrees was weak. Unfortunately, it remains on life support,"" Sharma said. ""And all of us need to look ourselves in the mirror, and consider if we have fully risen to that challenge over the past two weeks."" British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who attended the summit earlier this month, said that ""more must be done"" to tackle climate change. ""I welcome the progress made at Cop27 , but there can be no time for complacency,"" said Sunak. ""Keeping the 1.5 degrees commitment alive is vital to the future of our planet. More must be done."" The inclusion of ""loss and damage""was welcomed by developing nations and activists, who have been calling for climate compensation for decades. Molwyn Joseph, the chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, which has been a key player, said: ""The international community has restored global faith in this critical process that is dedicated to ensuring no one is left behind. The agreements made at Cop27 are a win for our entire world."" Negotiators had battled to reach agreement throughout the night as the summit, branded the most chaotic in years, extended more than 36 hours beyond its official close.

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada101","Savage leading Alberta delegation to Egypt for COP27","November 8, 2022 Tuesday","Edmonton Sun","Environment and Protected Areas Minister Sonya Savage will lead an Alberta government delegation of six to the annual COP27 climate summit this week. Savage is scheduled to arrive in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, on Thursday for the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework on Climate Change ( COP27 ) in an effort to show off Alberta's work on emissions reductions. The world's biggest and most significant climate change conference will see political leaders, activists, CEOs, and civil society representatives from around the world talk greenhouse gas emissions and climate change issues, and Alberta will want to be at the forefront of any climate action plans that could affect its energy industry. The conference began Sunday and runs to Nov. 18. That includes Edmonton Mayor Amarjeet Sohi and Stephanie McCabe, deputy city manager for urban planning and economy, who also plan to attend. In a Monday news release, Savage said she's proud to represent Alberta at COP27 , and hopes to showcase the province's environmental leadership. ""Having a seat at the table among world leaders gives us an opportunity to tell Alberta's exciting story and to ensure our policies continue to attract the investment needed to protect the environment and bolster the economy,"" she said. Miguel Racin, Savage's press secretary, did not immediately provide Postmedia Monday with an estimate of the trip's total cost to taxpayers. Savage's delegation is a turn from the UCP government under former premier Jason Kenney, who didn't send any of his ministers to last year's event in Scotland, dismissing it as a ""gabfest."" Premier Danielle Smith said in October she wanted to send an Alberta delegation because she doesn't believe the province is being properly represented by federal Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault. ""He clearly is hostile to our oil and gas sector,"" Smith told reporters. The government release noted the delegation will highlight Alberta's work in carbon capture, utilization and storage, investments in hydrogen and critical and rare earth minerals, and efforts to lower methane emissions in the oil and gas sector. Savage's itinerary includes discussions on innovation and energy transformation, speaking at a lunch session hosted by Emissions Reduction Alberta and Alberta Innovates, and going to bilateral meetings with representatives from other governments, including U.S. state officials, the United Kingdom and Germany.

""Loss and damage is already occurring,"" said Carlos Fuller. ""Severe erosion is altering communities; drought and floods (are) affecting farmers and causing infrastructure damage; (there is) coral bleaching; salt water intrusion is affecting the water supply."" From the catastrophic recent floods in Pakistan to the ongoing drought emergency in Kenya, similarly disastrous impacts are blighting developing nations across the globe. Many lack the economic resources to cope with new climate threats, which are overwhelmingly the consequence of historic carbon emissions by the world's richest countries. As the UN secretary-general, Antonio Guterres, stated earlier this month, ahead of November's Cop27 That promise, originally to be met by 2020, has still not been kept and there is little clarity on when it might be. The manner in which available climate finance has been distributed has also been deeply flawed. Belatedly, there are signs that the rich world is waking up to its responsibilities to the global south. Last month, Denmark became the first party to the Cop negotiations to offer funding related to ""loss and damage"" - defined as the destruction caused by climate-related disasters so extreme that no protection is possible against them. The $13 million pledged by Copenhagen to the Sahel region in north-west Africa must act as a catalyst for other developed nations to step up to the plate. Britain, which by cutting its overseas development aid contribution has scandalously moved in the opposite direction, could and should follow suit. As governments focus on spiraling energy costs, soaring inflation and the geopolitical fallout of the war in Ukraine, the climate emergency is in danger of being relegated to the back burner of policymaking. With only a month to go to Cop27 , there has been a global failure to follow through on commitments made last year in Glasgow - where countries pledged to provide more ambitious strategies to limit warming to the 1.5C goal. This month, climate justice demonstrations have taken place across Africa, and resentment is building in countries suffering ever more severe impacts as a result of past inaction. Mr. Guterres is right to identify Cop27 as a ""litmus test"" of how seriously developed nations are willing to take the growing toll on vulnerable nations. Announcing Denmark's loss and damage pledge, the development minister, Flemming Moller Mortensen, said: ""It is grossly unfair that the world's poorest should suffer the most from the consequences of climate change, to which they have contributed the least."" The forthcoming gathering in Sharm el-Sheikh must be the forum at which this injustice is not only recognized but acted upon. - An editorial in The Guardian (theguardian.com) Load-Date: \~October 15, 2022 \"

(AIMCo), said the pension giant is interested in participating in the Canada Growth Fund, a new public-private investment vehicle to be seeded by Ottawa with $15-billion and target innovative companies and green projects with economics deemed too risky by private capital. ""We've had conversations with the Department of Finance. We would very much like to be involved with the Canada Growth Fund,"" Siddall said in an interview from Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, where he is attending COP27 , the United Nations Climate Change Conference . Details provided in last week's fall economic update indicated the federal government is prepared to accept a lower return or increase its potential loss exposure in order to stimulate additional investments from institutional funds including pensions and private equity. The apparent vote of confidence from AIMCo would be welcome for the federal government, which has made several efforts to bring private capital into companies and projects including those that aim to create Canadian jobs, drive innovation, and help with the transition to a lower-carbon economy. A document prepared for the fall economic statement said the fund plans to source some investments by piggybacking on the deal pipelines of private funds. In addition, the fund will identify companies and projects and, if possible, convene multiple financial and strategic partners. Targets will include businesses and projects that reduce emissions or accelerate the deployment of key transition technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture, utilization, and storage. The fund will aim to help scale up companies that drive productivity, focus on clean growth, and encourage the retention of Canadian intellectual property. A further priority for the growth fund will be capitalizing on natural resources including critical minerals, and strengthening critical supply chains. Finance minister Chrystia Freeland said investments could include industries and infrastructure from critical minerals to ports. Siddall said he attended this week's climate change conference on Egypt - and planned a follow-up trip to Singapore - to connect with other global investors and governments to explore potential partnership in transition finance that targets carbon reduction. ""We're actively looking at ways of investing in the transition of our economy to a low-carbon future,"" Siddall said, adding that global partnerships are likely to play a role in AIM-Co moving beyond recent investments in green infrastructure, renewables, and clean energy storage. A Crown Corporation that invests for pensions and endowments in Alberta, AIMCo has steadfastly rejected a divestment strategy favoured by some institutional investors such as the Caisse de d\'e9p\'f4t et placement du Quebec. Last year, the Caisse said it planned to divest of all oil producing assets by the end of this year. Siddall and AIMCo chair Mark Wiseman have said being based in an energy-rich province gives the Alberta fund access to growing local transition expertise, and a Calgary office was opened last month to build on that ""unique home-field advantage in areas such transition finance."" AIMCo, which had $136.6 billion in assets under management at the end of June, also has offices in Toronto, London, and Luxembourg, and Siddall said the board of directors is weighing the possibility of one or two more offices, with potential locations in Singapore and New York. ""We have not yet made that decision - we are investigating them both,"" he said. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2022 Times &; Transcript (Moncton) \"

Down here at the lower levels, we think its implications should concern, if not even alarm, all Canadians. So far Canada's various climate plans and agreements have set emissions targets that balance the production of greenhouse gases against removals from the atmosphere, whether by tree-planting, sequestration or other means. The current plan is that by 2030 we reduce our net emissions by 40-45 per cent from what they were in 2005. But now McKenna's report is pushing hard, not for offsets, but for absolute reductions in GHG emissions( HYPERLINK https://financialpost.com/tag/carbon-emissions/ https://financialpost.com/tag/carbon-emissions/ ) - in other words, for taking much of the ""net"" out of ""net-zero."" If the report's recommendations are accepted, company boards and executives will have to pledge agreement with the Paris Agreement deep-decarbonization pathway and publish five-year plans for reducing absolute emissions ""along the entire value chain."" This includes ""embedded emissions within fossil fuel reserves"" with prioritization of ""urgent and deep reductions of (absolute) emissions"" rather than the use of carbon credits. Detailed company progress reports would have to be filed with a global, public database( HYPERLINK https://www.nzdpu.com https://www.nzdpu.com HYPERLINK https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2022/11/08/oil-companies-empty-promises-on-climate-under-fire-from-canadas-catherine-mckenna.html https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2022/11/08/oil-companies-empty-promises-on-climate-under-fire-from-canadas-catherine-mckenna.html ) of their products - a tall order indeed. The report summarizes its absolutist dogma in this way: ""Non-state actors cannot claim to be net-zero while continuing to build or invest in new fossil fuel supply ... Net-zero is entirely incompatible with continued investment in fossil fuels ... there is no room for new investment in fossil fuel supply and a need to decommission existing assets."" Get that, Alberta? The heart of the report is its recommendation for the ""phasing out of fossil fuels and scaling up renewable energy,"" with detailed provisions for businesses, financial institutions, cities and regions on how to end all hydrocarbon production by 2050: ""for businesses: on oil and gas, end (i) exploration for new oil and gas fields, (ii) expansion of oil and gas reserves, and (iii) oil and gas production."" The report's tenth recommendation, ""accelerating the road to regulation,"" would compel companies to action not only from government policy dictates per se, but directly through the regulatory and financial disclosure systems with the aim that: ""Non-state actors must align their external policy and engagement efforts, including membership in trade associations, to the goal of reducing global emissions by at least 50 per cent by 2030 and reaching net-zero by 2050. This means lobbying for positive climate action and not lobbying against it."" William Watson: Sharm el-Shakedown. More money for the UN black hole( HYPERLINK https://financialpost.com/opinion/william-watson-un-climate-change-cop27 https://financialpost.com/opinion/william-watson-un-climate-change- HYPERLINK cop27 ) Matthew Lau: Trudeau knows even less about entrepreneurship than monetary policy( HYPERLINK https://financialpost.com/opinion/matthew-lau-trudeau-entrepreneurship-monetary-policy https://financialpost.com/opinion/matthew-lau-trudeau-entrepreneurship-monetary-policy ) Opinion: WTO COVID-19 discussion could chill Canadian innovation( HYPERLINK https://financialpost.com/opinion/wto-covid-19-canada-innovation-ip https://financialpost.com/opinion/wto-covid-19-canada-innovation-ip ) Let that sink in. Not only would the UN's new climate regime disallow new investments in fossil fuels and end production of oil and gas, it would also compel an uncritical allegiance to the green transition by the very companies it proposes to put out of business. This is despite the fact that, as the Parliamentary Budget Office recently wrote( HYPERLINK https://distribution-a617274656661637473.pbo-dpb.ca/bbc2846795c541eddc656e484a15e7ecd91bd0aff45196f231523d8c5c9aafe4 https://distribution-a617274656661637473.pbo-dpb.ca/bbc2846795c541eddc656e484a15e7ecd91bd0aff45196f231523d8c5c9aafe4 ), ""Canada's own emissions are not large enough to materially impact climate change( HYPERLINK https://financialpost.com/tag/climate-change/ )."" Canadians need to think carefully before agreeing to adoption of the McKenna group's report. It ignores important unintended consequences that would inevitably affect our economy and energy security. This attempt to redefine the ""net"" out of ""net-zero"" undermines Canada's established ""transitional"" net-zero policies and would require elimination of all hydrocarbon production and use by 2050 - while apparently foreclosing consideration of managing offsets with carbon credits or carbon capture, utilization and storage. Such a redefinition of net-zero places the high-level expert group at odds, not just with a global community that increasingly recognizes the strategic and economic importance of hydrocarbon use, but also with current Canadian climate policy. Significantly, the COP27 final agreement did not contain language that called for the phase-out of all fossil fuels, including oil and gas. To quote( HYPERLINK https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-63677466 https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-63677466 ) Alok Sharma, the British MP who served as president of COP26 in Glasgow: ""A clear commitment to phase-out all fossil fuels? Not in this text."" A report that is at odds not just with Canada and the international community but also with the COP27 final agreement itself should be sent back to the UN with a failing grade.

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada127","This political prisoner will stop drinking water when world leaders arrive in Egypt","November 4, 2022 Friday 5:30 PM GMT","CBC News","WARNING: This story contains distressing details. Sanaa Seif is scheduled to visit her brother in prison in a week and a half. But she fears that by then, it will already be too late. Alaa Abdel-Fattah, a U.K. citizen and one of Egypt's most prominent political prisoners, began a full hunger strike on Tuesday in the Wadi El-Natrun prison complex north of Cairo, where he's currently being held. He plans to stop drinking water on Nov. 6, as world leaders gather in the country for COP27 , the United Nations climate change conference . He's trying to draw attention to his own case, and those of the tens of thousands of other political prisoners in the country. His family is begging for his freedom, saying that if he's not released, he'll surely die behind bars. ""I'm really scared,"" Seif told As It Happens host Nil K\'c3\'b6ksal. ""I sometimes lose it \'e2\€ \£6 and I panic. But I try to pull myself together and remind myself that as long as he's alive, then there is a chance."" Seif is in London, where she recently met with members of the U.K.'s Foreign Office about her brother's case after staging a sit-in outside the ministry. She'll be heading to COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, too, to raise his case with British delegates and other world leaders. Abdel-Fattah, 40, rose to prominence during the 2011 pro-democracy uprisings that swept the Middle East and in Egypt, and has spent most of the past decades behind bars. He was first sentenced in 2014 after being convicted of taking part in an unauthorized protest and allegedly assaulting a police officer. He was released in 2019 after serving a five-year term but was arrested again later that year in a crackdown that followed anti-government protests. In December 2021, he was sentenced to another five-year term on charges of spreading false news. He also faces separate charges of misusing social media and joining a terrorist group \'e2\€  a reference to the banned Muslim Brotherhood. His family has also been a target of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's government. Seif has herself been imprisoned for her activism. But with her brother starving in prison, she says her freedom tastes bittersweet. ""I can't really feel that I'm free,"" she said. ""I can't feel that it's over until we're all back together, reunited in a safe place."" 'He looked like skin and bones' For months, Abdel-Fattah has been on a partial hunger strike, consuming only 100 calories a day. Seif says the last time her mother saw him during her monthly visit on Oct. 16, he was barely able to stand. ""He looked very, very frail. He looked like skin and bones,"" Seif said. ""But he was in one piece."" In a recent letter to his family, he said he plans to take his hunger strike to the next level, coinciding with COP27 . Seif will be there as a UN-accredited civil society observer. So, too, will Rishi Sunak, the U.K.'s new prime minister. Asked if she had a message for Sunak, Seif begged him to press for her brother's freedom. ""If you don't do that, the Egyptians would interpret this as a green light to kill Alaa,"" she said. ""Please, please, please, bring Alaa home with you."" Abdel-Fattah has British citizenship through his mother, Laila Soueif, a math professor at Cairo University who was born in London. Max Blain, a spokesperson for Sunak, said the U.K. government is ""raising his case at the highest levels of the Egyptian government"" and ""working hard to secure Alaa Abdel-Fattah's release."" He said he could not say whether Sunak will raise the case at COP27 . An Egyptian government media officer did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. Egyptian authorities have previously denied that Abdel-Fattah is on a hunger strike. 'Alaa, to me, is not a symbol' In his letter, which his family has translated into English, Abdel-Fattah wrote: ""If one wished for death, then a hunger strike would not be a struggle. If one were only holding onto life out of instinct, then what's the point of a struggle? If you're postponing death only out of shame at your mother's tears, then you're decreasing the chances of victory."" Abdel-Fattah's other sister, Mona Seif, wrote on Twitter that regardless of whether her brother survives, he'll have won his fight. ""If he makes it out alive ... he would have done it using only his body and words,"" she wrote. ""If he doesn't make it and dies in prison ... his body will tell the whole world the truth."" Sanaa Seif agrees with her sister. Yet, she struggles to see her brother through that lens. ""I feel like the political or symbolic battle, yes, has been won. But that doesn't mean much to me. Alaa, to me, is not a symbol,"" she said. ""I would rather that we lose the political battle and be, I don't know, like [branded] in state media in Egypt as traitors or whatever, but have my brother back."" \"

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada138","World leaders must come out of their bubbles and hear other voices - especially Indigenous women - in climate-change debates","November 21, 2022 Monday","The Star (Toronto, Ontario) Online","World leaders making decisions around climate change must consider ideas originating beyond their own bubbles - especially those proffered by Indigenous people - if the problem is to be tackled in any meaningful way. The Native Women's Association of Canada (NWAC) recently sent us - two Inuit - to the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt where we were tasked with ensuring that Indigenous human rights were upheld in every negotiation. We think we had some success. But there is an inclination for people, even at international meetings like COP, to interact with their own kind. Members of country delegations tend to talk amongst themselves instead of reaching out to hear what others have to say. That is not how climate change will be curbed. And it makes it much more difficult for Indigenous voices like ours to inject themselves into the international conversation at a state level. That is a problem, because Indigenous people have a lot to offer. Many of us live in places where the effects of global warming are already forcing shifts in our traditional ways of life. And many of us work in the resource industries that are a prime cause of those shifts. It is a double vulnerability that should put Indigenous people at the centre of the climate-change debate. Too often, however, we are forced to sit on the sidelines while others in positions of authority make decisions about global warming without us, even though those decisions will profoundly affect our lives. If they listened, world leaders would hear us urging a just transition away from fossil fuels. Indigenous people are not uniformly demanding an end to all oil and gas production. Some of us own the companies. Many more of us are employed in the sector. According to a 2021 report by the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, Indigenous people make up 6.3 per cent of the upstream industry's workforce - nearly twice the Indigenous participation in the Canadian workforce at large. Making the move away from oil and gas will not be easy on those people. It will require investment and it will require skills training. We, as Indigenous people, are best positioned to decide where that money should be spent and how that training is delivered. NWAC is currently running a massive apprenticeship program for Indigenous women and LGBTQ+ people in the Red Seal trades that is funded by Indigenous Services Canada. That is the kind of co-operation required for a just transition. As for global warming, Indigenous people around the world have unique relationships with their environment based on intergenerational knowledge, skills and awareness. In the North, we have known from time immemorial that the climate is changing. Now we see it changing at an accelerated rate. We have the knowledge around climate change adaptation because we have been adapting through millennia. It is a citizen science where our hunters, our people, are effectively the eyes and ears on the ground. There is also an academic bias that excludes Indigenous women from these conversations and this knowledge sharing. We too hunt, whether it's caribou, seals, polar bears or deer. We are the berry pickers and the clam diggers. We are the ones who prepare game and fish, so we are the ones noticing the condition of the animals. This is valuable information that should not be discounted. But the participation by Indigenous women - and in fact all women - at international climate change meetings is depressingly low. A BBC analysis says less than 34 per cent of the negotiators at this year's COP were female. On a positive note, COP27 had the largest Indigenous caucus in the history of the conference. Collectively, we issued a statement emphasizing that Indigenous rights, including those affecting the places we live, are inherent and internationally recognized. We will not allow the international community to diminish them by conflating us with other vulnerable groups like minorities and local communities. But there has to be more than a simple acknowledgment of Indigenous rights in climate-change talks that are conducted among non-Indigenous men. Indigenous people, including Indigenous women, can inject a sense of grassroots reality to these discussions. The members of the international community need to accept the value that we bring to the table. The world needs our voices in the climate-change debate.

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada140","LONGi Stresses Energy Equity and Environmental Sustainability at COP27 Solutions Day","November 24, 2022 Thursday 1:59 AM Eastern Time","Canada NewsWire","XI'AN, China, Nov. 24, 2022 /CNW/ -- The 27th Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC ( COP27 ) concluded successfully in Sharm EI-Sheikh, Egypt, on November 20. During this year's conference, LONGi virtually released the 2nd White Paper on Climate Action and displayed its most recent generation of Hi-MO 6 series modules at the Green Zone along with Vanke Foundation and China Corporate Climate Action (CCCA). LONGi has consistently contributed to the transformation of clean energy and low-carbon green development. LONGi, which was one of the participating enterprises, stated the company's position at a leadership dialogue entitled 'Trailblazing Public-Private Action for a More Resilient World' at Solutions Day, which was convened by the COP27 Presidency in cooperation with the United Nations Science Policy Business Forum (UN-SPBF) on the Environment. Dennis She, Vice President of LONGi, attended the panel discussion on 'Incentivizing Technology-focused, Climate-sensitive Economies Towards Greater Partnership and Public-Private Action' togetherwith James Mnyupe, Namibia Presidential Economic Advisor; Shereen Zorba, Head of the Global Secretariat, United Nations Science-Policy-Business Forum on the Environment; Dr. Omnia El Omrani, COP27 Youth Envoy; Yossi Matias, Vice President Engineering and Research, Google; Nicole Karimi, Founder & CEO, Antankara Group and Joao Augusto Ribeiro Nardes, Minister, Federal Court of Accounts (TCU) of Brazil. The high-level Dialogue is designed to reflect the perspectives of prominentpolicymakers, corporate leaders, the financial community, international cooperation organizations, and members of society. Speaking at the panel discussion, Dennis She shared his insights on the current situation and future prospects of renewable energy popularization. He said: ""What I see in the front line of the PV industry is that the R&D investment and production of renewable energy have been developing rapidly. Despite various shocks in the last three years, the installed capacity of global solar energy has increased by about 30% annually. Thanks to continuous technological progress, the cost of photovoltaic power generation has dropped by more than 90% compared with 10 years ago. In many parts of the world, solar energy has become the most economical energy."" ""In Germany, for example, it only takes a week to install photovoltaic power systems on household roofs, and two months for large-ground photovoltaic power stations. LONGi is confident that renewable energy will continue to be widely used.""Dennis She added. This year marks the 50th anniversary of environmental multilateralism, however the world is not on course to reach any environmental goals, let alone those outlined in the Paris agreement. The COP27 conference has adopted the slogan ""Together for Implementation,"" and the Presidency is fully determined to move beyond pledges and forge ahead with transformative action. When asked what more can the government and relevant parties do to promote the application of renewable energy, Dennis She said: ""First of all, we call on all countries to stop subsidizing traditional fossil energy and put limited resources into urgent climate action. Nowadays, renewable energy has become an economic power and it is unreasonable to continue providing fossil energy subsidies. Second, we hope that the approval procedures for renewable energy projects will be more efficient and fast. When we have technically and economically feasible renewable energy solutions, we can hope that we will not waste time on links other than the project itself. Third, we hope that various parties will not politicize renewable energy and the public goods for all humankind."" While shedding light on the global climate action for talent development and skill upgrading, Dennis She said that the promotion of solar energy around the world requires a large number of local engineers and business talents. ""We have set up training camps in many different parts of the world to train local engineers and cultivate business talents. We hope to forge cooperation with all parties to train more talents to promote the implementation of renewable energy everywhere,"" he said. As a leading solar technology company globally, LONGi not only supplies photovoltaic modules and green energy solutions all over the world but also believes that technological innovation can help humankind achieve carbon neutrality. About LONGi Founded in 2000, LONGi is committed to being the world's leading solar technology company, focusing on customer-driven value creation for full scenario energy transformation. Under its mission of 'making the best of solar energy to build a green world', LONGi has dedicated itself to technology innovation and established five business sectors, covering mono silicon wafers cells and modules, commercial & industrial distributed solar solutions, green energy solutions and hydrogen equipment. The company has honed its capabilities to provide green energy and has more recently, also embraced green hydrogen products and solutions to support global zero carbon development.

Many will be watching closely as global leaders and stakeholders gather in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, for the Conference of Parties (COP) climate conference from Nov. 6 to 18, also known as COP27 . The world's wealthiest countries are going into the summit having failed to meet the financial goal of putting $100 billion US toward annual climate financing. That commitment was made over a decade ago. Canada and Germany both admitted through a progress report that wealthy countries, including their own \'e2\€  which produce a bulk of the world's carbon emissions \'e2\€  have fallen short, and that more work was needed to reach the target in 2023. But there is hope real change may come from the upcoming conference. What On Earth spoke to a number of Canadians about what they hope to see from COP27 . Here's what they had to say. Eriel Deranger, executive director of Indigenous Climate Action, Edmonton My hope for COP27 We need to be advancing climate justice solutions, not false solutions wrapped up in carbon markets that allow big polluters to continue to buy their way out while they continue to pollute, or for corporations to continue to collect massive amounts of economic power while disempowering some of the poorest people and some of the people that are protecting critical biodiversity, which is Indigenous peoples. Indigenous peoples have been advancing some of the most progressive and aggressive solutions within the UN climate spaces for decades. It's time for colonial governments to listen to us and stop listening to greedy corporations and oil and gas companies. Stephen Buhler, organizer with Climate Justice Edmonton My hope for COP27 But I think further to that, I just really want to see some real climate action come out of this. As a worker who has experience in oil and gas, I think it's really important to see jobs come out of this for workers, as well as reparations being made for the communities that have been most hit by climate change. Bashar Rahman, student at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver My hope for COP27 is to look at policies surrounding climate finance with a particular focus on South Asia and Africa. I have been having conversations with my friends from back home [in Bangladesh], and one fact about Bangladesh is one third of Bangladesh is going to be underwater by 2050. And in that one third is my hometown where my dad still lives and works. So it's very frustrating to see policies that make some of these lands go underwater. So one thing that I am very optimistic [for], despite all of these circumstances, is if I see people acknowledging issues, particularly the Global South. There are going to be a lot of climate refugees, however, the UNHCR still doesn't recognize climate refugees as refugees. It's very difficult to stay optimistic, but I think that's the last thing we can do as young people. Emma-Jane Burian, student at the University of Victoria My hope for COP27 And so we have to move beyond thinking about just renewable energy, but we also have to think about poverty and about racism and colonialism and all these other issues that are intrinsically connected to the climate crisis.

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada145","COP27 goes into overtime as Canada continues to face criticism on oil and gas stance","November 18, 2022 Friday","National Post (f/k/a The Financial Post) (Canada)","Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault, a former environmental activist who is seen as an enemy by much of the oil and gas industry, resisted heavy lobbying from India and other countries at the UN's annual climate conference to sign a final agreement that would commit signatories to a complete phaseout of fossil fuels. In response to a question about Canada's position on the phase-out language, Guilbeault said on Nov. 17( https://youtu.be/qqb2Lpsq-HA?t=289 https://youtu.be/qqb2Lpsq-HA?t=289 That position generated criticism about Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's commitment to fighting climate change. The following day, Guilbeault deflected questions about his remark during a virtual press conference from COP27 , saying that such language wasn't even on the table, but he didn't try to reverse his position. ""I would like to point out that there is no such text,"" Guilbeault said. ""But we support reducing our dependencies on fossil fuels. The very foundation of our climate change plan rests on that, which is why we've adopted a law to ban the use of coal-fired electricity in Canada by 2030, we're putting in place measures so that 100 per cent of vehicles sold in Canada will be zero-emission vehicles by 2035, our electrical grid will be net-zero by 2035. All of these measures, and many more, will lead to a significant reduction of our consumption of fossil fuels and therefore our dependencies on fossil fuels in Canada. And we obviously support that. That's what we're here for."" As the COP27 On the sidelines, non-governmental organizations, activists and industry lobbyists have been watching closely as Canada pushed its priorities going into COP27 around methane reductions, the phasing out of coal power generation, and carbon pricing - while also absorbing intense criticism as the world's fourth largest oil-producing nation. Pembina Institute executive director Chris Severson-Baker said Canada managed to credibly talk about its success in retiring of coal-fired power plants, and won praise for its leadership on methane emission reductions, but fell short when it came to offering specifics on its plan to reduce pollution from oil and gas. ""That's the biggest source of emissions in Canada,"" Severson-Baker said. ""It's the one that people in the international (community) point at and say, 'you're telling us what to do on greenhouse gas emissions, but what are you doing about that big sector? Where's the actual plan to reduce emissions from the oil and gas sector?' And we don't have an answer for that yet."" Keen to participate Nevertheless, the sector was keen to participate in this year's COP discussions in how it could help meet climate goals. Canada's delegation included a number of representatives from Canadian oil and gas companies( HYPERLINK https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/ruffing-some-feathers-at-cop27-canada-includes-oil-and-gas-companies-in-its-delegation https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/ruffing-some-feathers-at- HYPERLINK cop27 -canada-includes-oil-and-gas-companies-in-its-delegation ) and advocacy groups, including pipeline companies such as Enbridge Inc. and oilpatch majors such as Cenovus Energy Inc. and Imperial Oil Ltd. Globally, there were more than 600 fossil fuel lobbyists in attendance, a 25 per cent increase over last year, according to some estimates( HYPERLINK https://www.corporateknights.com/category-climate/oil-and-gas-lobbyists-swarm-cop27/ https://www.corporateknights.com/category-climate/oil-and-gas-lobbyists-swarm- HYPERLINK https://www.corporateknights.com/category-climate/oil-and-gas-lobbyists-swarm-cop27/ cop27 / ). Including the industry responsible for such a large share of emissions in talks about solutions to achieving decarbonization is only practical, the industry and some provincial political commentators argued. ""There is a bit of a misperception from some NGOs about what we're doing there, that we're somehow there to influence the negotiation, reduce climate progress, which is far from the case,"" said Mark Cameron, vice-president of Pathways Alliance, a group representing Canada's six largest oilsands companies. ""We weren't really involved in anything that was going on in the negotiations, we were basically there to tell our story and learn from others. That was the purpose of us being there."" The Pathways Alliance, which has set a goal of reaching net-zero by 2050, organized a panel discussion at COP27 about decarbonization in the oilsands and met with other industries working on carbon capture technology to discuss approaches and financing. Existential threat The Canadian oilsands, and much of the country's oil and gas sector, face an existential threat in the form of Canada's promised oil-and-gas emissions cap( HYPERLINK https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/oil-gas/ottawa-to-begin-consultations-on-oil-and-gas-sector-emissions-cap Ottawa has so far resisted calls from environmental groups to impose a production cap on the sector, but an emissions cap that's too rigid would effectively function as a cap on production, the industry has argued. ""Ottawa's target is roughly 42 per cent (from current levels) by 2030. So that's a big gap that we couldn't meet. The 22 megatonne rule that we have is really a very extreme stretch goal that is going to take all of our effort to achieve. So we'd be 15 megatonnes short and the only way we could make that up would be a production cut."" 'This is mostly theatre': Alberta's message at COP27 is oilsands 'boosterism,' critics say( HYPERLINK https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/oil-gas/alberta-cop27-oilsands-boosterism-critics https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/oil-gas/alberta- HYPERLINK cop27 -oilsands-boosterism-critics Sonya Savage: Alberta is taking a seat at COP27 to help solve the global energy crisis( HYPERLINK https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/oil-gas/sonya-savage-alberta-cop27-energy-crisis https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/oil-gas/sonya-savage-alberta- HYPERLINK https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/oil-gas/sonya-savage-alberta-cop27-energy-crisis cop27 -energy-crisis ) Canada ruffles some feathers at COP27 by including oil and gas representatives in its delegation( HYPERLINK https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/ruffing-some-feathers-at-cop27-canada-includes-oil-and-gas-companies-in-its-delegation https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/ruffing-some-feathers-at- HYPERLINK cop27 -canada-includes-oil-and-gas-companies-in-its-delegation ) But critics of the sector have said there have been plenty of incentives from government to decarbonize and that it's past time the industry show good faith by investing some of its recent windfall profits in reducing carbon emissions. However, the consortium of oil majors behind the Pathways Alliance have yet to make a final investment decision on the sector's linchpin climate project, a massive $16.5-billion carbon capture network and storage hub. Discussion around fossil fuels at this year's COP have been complicated somewhat by a global energy crisis, exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, that have brought issues of energy security and affordability to the fore.

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada152","Canadian Delegation at COP27","November 10, 2022 Thursday","CTV NEWS CHANNEL Television, Inc. POWER PLAY WITH EVAN SOLOMON 17:00:00 ET","MIKE LE COUTEUR: A global push to fight climate change is underway in Egypt. COP27 brings the world together in search of a united path forward to lower global temperatures before it's too late. Environmental activists are worried that real ambition is being muted because they say there are 100 more fossil fuel lobbyists at this year's COP compared to last year's. And some of those lobbyists are part of the Canadian delegation. So should the oil and gas industry even get a seat at the environmental table? And what is Canada willing to do to drive climate action agendas forward? Let's find out. Joining me now from COP27 in Egypt is Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault. Welcome, Minister. Thank you very much for making the time today. I'm going to jump right into this. Your government has proudly said this is the largest delegation that Canada has sent to a COP. However included in that delegation are representatives from the oil sands industry. What do you say to critics who believe having them there will prevent true ambition when it comes to tackling climate change? STEVEN GUILBEAULT (Environment Minister): Canada is a democratic society, and in a democratic society all voices can be heard, and should be heard. And we need to work with the oil and gas sector to reduce our emissions and tackle climate change, just like we need to work with the auto sector, the cement sector, aluminum, steel. We won't solve this problem by ignoring some of our largest industrial sectors. So I'm, I think it's fine for them to be here, and I think it's fine for organizations, some organizations to say that they disagree with their presence, they don't think they should be here. That's the beauty of being in a democracy. LE COUTEUR: But what do you say to people who think that we lack ambition because they're sitting at the table, that they would actually be holding back some of that ambition? GUILBEAULT: There's a difference between them being here and what we need to do and what we're doing as government. And as a government, we fought all the way to the Supreme Court to be able to put in place carbon pricing in Canada. We're imposing on these companies a number of regulations so that they will reduce their pollution, regulations to reduce methane emission, a powerful greenhouse gas. We will cut methane emission in the oil and gas sector almost by 50 percent by 2025. We're forcing gas and diesel distributers, gasoline and diesel distributers in Canada to reduce their carbon footprint of the fuel that they sell by investing in cleaning alternatives, by investing in electrification of transportation. So they have, they can voice their concern, they can voice their point of view, but it won't stop us from doing what we need to do in Canada to fight climate change. LE COUTEUR: And I ask this especially because Global Witness, which is a climate action group, says there's over 100 more fossil fuel lobbyists at COP27 than there were at last year's talks. So I guess the question is should there be a cap on lobbyists, and how many can be in the conversation? GUILBEAULT: I think it's a false debate, Mike. I was in a meeting with the head of the International Energy Agency two days ago, and he said, you know, despite what we're hearing about coal making a comeback, and fossil fuels because the illegal, Putin's illegal invasion of Russia(sic), well actually, the facts are that this year globally there will be 20 percent more investment in clean technologies than in fossil fuels. And in Canada, there's two times more investment in clean technologies and renewable energy than in fossil fuels. I think that's what we need to be looking at. For me, whether or not, you know, there's two lobbyists from the oil industry, there's a hundred lobbyists from the oil industry, it's meaningless. What's important is what we're actually doing to fight climate change. LE COUTEUR: I want to ask you about what you're doing there. Today's youth day at COP, however, activist Greta Thunberg says that these summits have been used by world leaders as a green washing exercise. How do you respond to that? GUILBEAULT: I have lots of respect for Ms. Thunberg. I disagree with her on that. Ten years ago the world was heading into a temperature increase in the order of 4 to 6 degrees Celsius, which would make many parts of the world simply unlivable for humans. And through our collective actions over the last decade we've managed to bring those projections for temperature increase from 4 to 6 degrees Celsius to 1.7 to 2.4. Now what we agreed upon is to be try to be as close as possible 1.5 degrees Celsius. So we're not there and we're already seeing the impacts of climate change of a 1.1 degree Celsius warming world. That's where we are now. And we're seeing Fiona, we're seeing forest fires in BC. So the more there's warming, the more there will be climate impacts. But through our collective work over the years we've managed to reduce billions of tonnes of pollution that would contribute to global warming. Now we're not quite there yet. We need to continue acting and we need to accelerate this because we know that climate impacts are accelerating. But through our work, we are getting there. LE COUTEUR: Speaking of not quite there yet, at the last COP in Scotland there was a failure to get richer countries to pay into that fund that would help poorer countries deal with the effects of climate change. What has Canada been doing at this COP to finally get that over the finish line? GUILBEAULT: So I wouldn't call it a failure because... LE COUTEUR: Well other people called it a failure, Minister, with all due respect. Other people did. GUILBEAULT: Yeah, and I'm saying I wouldn't, because we made a commitment that by 2020 we would provide $100 billion, countries like Canada, Europe, Japan and the US to the developing world to help them tackle climate change. In 2020 we were at $83 billion. So some would call it a failure, and I respect that, but $83 billion is not a hundred, but it's not nothing either. And we know that we will get there next year in terms of that commitment, and that on average between 2020 and 2025 we will meet the $100 billion goals per year. So we're getting there. Again, we're not quite there, and Canada, that's why we doubled our international climate assistance last year in Glasgow, and we're working, we presented a report yesterday with Germany and the United Kingdom that shows how we get there, and what are the things we need to do to get there. LE COUTEUR: Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault, thank you so much for joining us this evening. GUILBEAULT: Thank you very much, Mike. LE COUTEUR: Coming up, masking indecision. As we see a rise in respiratory viruses put pressure on Canadian hospitals, will governments bring back masking mandates or will governments leave it up to individual Canadians to figure it out?

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada156","Ahead of COP27, young African climate activists speak out","November 6, 2022 Sunday 01:19 AM EST","Canadian Press","WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP)  Young climate activists from African nations have high demands but low expectations for the U.N. climate conference which begins Sunday in the Egyptian coastal resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. Observers and organizers of the COP27 summit have made much of its location, branding the conference as an  African COP where the positions of African countries on issues like finance for adapting to climate change or moving to renewable energy sources will be central to the talks. Activists hope that's true.  For COP27 to be the 'African COP\' , the needs, voices, and priorities of the African people need to be reflected in the outcome of the negotiations,"" Kenyan climate activist Elizabeth Wathuti told The Associated Press. "" COP27 is a chance to bring justice to the most impacted countries through global solidarity and cooperation. Analysts point to sticking points between richer and poorer nations, such as questions around whether vulnerable countries should receive compensation for climate-related catastrophes, known as  loss and damage in climate negotiations, as hindering progress at previous summits. Some youth activists, like Wathuti, say that the continent should be looking to rich nations for massive emissions cuts and for compensation for loss and damage caused by climate catastrophes. Africa is responsible for only 3% to 4% of global emissions despite having 17% of the world\' s population but it is more vulnerable than most places as many people, especially those outside urban centers, are less able to adapt.  Financial delivery is fundamental to enable the development of Africa,"" Wathuti said. ""The African population is growing rapidly and securing energy for people will be crucial to combat poverty and create opportunities for a higher quality of life. Others say African countries need to look inward as developed nations have failed to keep their promises. Hounaidat Abdouroihamane, an activist from the Comoros Islands said Africa should stop relying on developed countries for funding.  Why should we beg the polluters for answers and money when we know so well they will not provide it and if they do, it will be in the form of a loan? asked Abdouroihamane, adding the continent should  put in adaptation measures that are easy and less costly to implement such as better management of water resources and reforesting and restoring land. Developed nations have already failed to fulfill pledges on climate change funding, including a $100 billion-a-year pledge that is two years past its deadline and hasn't yet been fulfilled. Wathuti said that the negotiations should be about  accountability and hoped the conference will address the  delivery of promises made but not met. Ugandan activist Vanessa Nakate agreed that financing from developed countries was central for the continent to achieve its aims.  The $100 billion promised is no longer enough. There needs to be additional finance,"" Nakate told the AP, adding there needs to be a separate fund for loss and damage. 116 million people in Africa\' s coastal states and islands face sea-level risks and by 2050 African nations are projected to spend $50 billion annually on climate-related impacts, the U.N. weather agency said. Although activists have long been part of the conversation, many feel that they are not listened to. Increasingly, climate campaigners particularly in Europe have started taking drastic measures to make their arguments heard, including throwing food at famous paintings or gluing themselves to roads to a mixed reception.  There are efforts to increase youth participation, but more often than not, young people are put in meetings to fill a seat, Wathuti said.  For youth participation to be truly meaningful, young people need support to navigate the intricate spaces of climate negotiations."" She added:  Young people have not caused the situation we are in, but young people are the solution. That is why participation of youth is key in high level forums like COP27 . ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada157","COP27: Host resort town gives Egypt tight grip over protests","November 5, 2022 Saturday 05:30 AM EST","Canadian Press","SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt (AP)  With turquoise seawaters and rich coral reefs, Egypt's resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh is a picturesque location for this year\' s United Nations global summit on climate change, known as COP27 . In a country where protests are virtually banned, the government has set up a specific venue for climate protests  except no one is quite sure where it is. Notifications are required 36 hours in advance. As COP27 approaches, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi's government has touted its efforts to make Sharm el-Sheikh a more eco-friendly city, with new solar panels and electric vehicles.  From the beginning, there was a big question mark on the choice of Egypt as a host country, said one Egyptian activist, who was detained for over two years without trial during the government\' s crackdown on dissent. He spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing he could be re-arrested.  They know that the choice of Sharm means there would be no protests. The scene is likely to be a sharp contrast to COP26 last year in Glasgow, Scotland, where some 100,000 people marched through the streets in one rally and protesters massed frequently in public squares, parks and bridges. On Friday, a group of activists took part in a small protest calling for climate action on the African continent at a roundabout in front of the conference venue in Sharm el-Sheikh. A line of police stood by. Since 2013, el-Sissi, a U.S. ally with deep economic ties to European countries, has overseen a massive crackdown, jailing thousands of Islamists, but also secular activists involved in the 2011 popular uprising. Many others have fled the country. A prominent rights activist, Alaa Abdel-Fattah, escalated his hunger strike this week, refusing also water. Outside the Sinai Peninsula, where Sharm el-Sheikh is located, rights groups say more than 100 people have been detained the past two weeks in Cairo and other cities as security forces stepped up their presence in main squares after rumors of planned protests on Nov. 11. COP27 starts on Sunday and is expected to last through Nov. 18. The government has repeatedly said its security measures are vital to maintaining stability in a nation of more than 104 million people after a decade of turmoil that started with the Arab Spring and was followed by years of deadly Islamic militant attacks. For decades, Sharm el-Sheikh has been the government\' s favorite spot for conferences and high-level summits precisely because it is so easy to control. The 1996 Mideast peace summit attended by then-President Bill Clinton was held there. Isolated in the desert near the Sinai's southern tip, Sharm  as it\' s often referred to  is a six-hour drive from the capital, Cairo. Vehicles must pass through a closely guarded tunnel under the Suez Canal, then numerous checkpoints along the highway, enabling authorities to turn back those considered undesirable. A concrete and razor-wire barrier surrounds parts of Sharm. One entrance is set into a several-story-high concrete wall, painted with a gigantic peace sign  a reference to the  City of Peace, a nickname authorities have tried to make stick to Sharm. Large boulevards in the desert link walled resorts, with few public spaces for people to gather. Hussein Baoumi, Amnesty International's researcher for Egypt and Libya, called it a  dystopic city.  There is so much surveillance, so much control over who enters and who leaves the city, which is again an attempt to control who gets to speak to the international community,"" he said. Hotel workers say security is particularly tight for COP27  all must obtain security clearance and since Tuesday, they have been barred from leaving their places of work or housing. Some decided to return to their hometowns until the conference ends.  We are accustomed to restrictions, but this time it is very harsh and there were no exceptions, said a waiter at a four-star hotel. Security has always been high in Sharm because to the north, across the length of the peninsula, Egypt\' s military has been battling a decade-old insurgency led by a local branch of the Islamic State group. In 2015, a Russian MetroJet plane crashed soon after takeoff from Sharm el-Sheikh, killing all 224 people onboard, an attack claimed by IS. Sinai has twice been occupied by neighboring Israel: first during the Suez Crisis in 1956, which also involved France and Britain, and later in the 1967 Middle East war. It was returned to Egypt in 1982 as part of the U.S.-brokered peace deal between Egypt and Israel. Since then, government-licensed development has helped resorts along Sinai's southern coast become a top beach and scuba-diving destination. The COP27 conference is taking place at Sharm's large convention center. As in past COPs, only official U.N.-accredited delegates can enter the venue, known as the Blue Zone, which during the gathering is considered U.N. territory and subject to international law. Another venue, the Green Zone, is for businesses, youth and civil society to hold events on the sidelines of the summit. It remains unclear where protests are meant to happen. A government COP27 website says that besides the 36-hour notification for protests inside the venue, a 48-hour notice via email is required for protests outside it. From the few photos of the Green Zone in pro-government press, it appears to be on a section of highway or a parking area with cafeterias set up. Maj. Gen. Khaled Fouda, the provincial governor, called the site  very chic and clean in comments to local TV last month.  Protests are allowed, but smashing and insulting are not allowed, he said. The government has dispatched 500 taxis to transport COP27 attendants, Fouda said  all with cameras connected to a  security observatory meant to monitor the drivers\' behavior. None of this bodes well for activism, climate protest leaders say. Greta Thunberg, a youth leader of the protest movement, has said she would not attend.  The space for civil society this year is extremely limited, she said at a recent London event.  It will be very difficult for activists to make their voice heard. Cost is another factor. The recently released Egyptian activist said that many can\' t afford to travel, with the cost of a plane ticket from Cairo out of reach for many amid double-digit domestic inflation.  It\' s crucial for us to be given an opportunity to take part, she said. \"
"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada158","Takeaways: Calls for reparations, emissions cuts at COP27","November 7, 2022 Monday 02:34 PM EST","Canadian Press","SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt (AP)  The first full day of the year's most important summit on climate change, known as COP27 , got underway on Monday with urgent calls by leaders to slash greenhouse gas emissions as the planet warms and severe weather events become more frequent and destructive. Scores of presidents, along with thousands of diplomats, climate negotiators, business leaders, activists and journalists descended on the Red Sea resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh to take part in discussions and negotiations slated to go through Nov. 18.  Climate change will never stop without our intervention,"" said Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, opening the day's session. ""Our time here is limited and we must use every second that we have.\' \' Former U.S. Vice-President Al Gore, one of the first leaders to raise the alarm about climate change, framed the question of whether to decarbonize as a ""life over death choice by leaders. Nigeria\' s Environment Minister Mohammed Abdullahi, along with many others, argued that the action needed to go beyond just cutting emissions in the future. Rich nations, most responsible for climate change, must help poor nations hit hard by impacts of climate change.  The blame game should stop, he said, adding that the country would be  aggressive during negotiations about financing and reparations for vulnerable countries. Here is a look some of the largest storylines on the first day of COP27 : In the world of climate negotiations, loss and damage refers to reparations. That would be rich nations, the most responsible for the emissions that have led to climate change, making reparations to developing countries that are often most impacted. While the idea has long been around, traditionally it's been more on the fringes of climate discussions than in the forefront. On Monday, it dominated many of the talks. For the first time, developing nations got on to the summit agenda the issue of loss and damage, and numerous leaders brought it up and urged action. The setting of this year's summit, Egypt, a developing nation in Africa, seemed to give the initiative a symbolic push.  The damage is obvious, Ghana\' s President Nana Akufo-Addo told The Associated Press.  Those who are responsible should be very, very much aware of the need to compensate others. Throughout the speeches, leaders urged their counterparts and negotiators not to get distracted amid so many things competing for attention. There are the U.S. Midterm elections on Tuesday. Now in its eighth month, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has pushed some countries to speed up plans to transition to green energies while others have come under criticism for turning back to dirty fuels like coal to make up the energy shortfall. And COP27 will still be happening when leaders of the world's richest nations meet in Bali in Indonesia for the G20 summit next week.  Today\' s urgent crises cannot be an excuse for backsliding or greenwashing, said Antonio Guterres, the U.N. secretary general. On the sidelines, there was also talk about who wasn't attending the summit, and what that might say about their commitments. Leaders of two of the biggest emitting countries, China and India, thus far appear to be skipping the talks, though they are sending underlings to negotiations. The leader of the historically top polluting country, U.S. President Joe Biden, is coming days later than most of the other presidents and prime ministers on his way to Bali. EGYPTIAN ACTIVIST STRIKE To coincide with the summit start, jailed opposition activist Alaa Abdel-Fattah escalated a hunger strike, refusing also water, according to his family. On Monday, Agnes Callamard, secretary general of Amnesty International, warned that failure by the Egyptian government to release him would lead to his death. Abdel-Fattah, 40, has spent most of the past decade behind bars. For many Egyptians, his detention is a symbol of the country's return to autocratic rule. For more than six months, Abdel-Fattah has been on a partial hunger strike, consuming only 100 calories a day. Hoping to push the issue, Abdel-Fattah\' s younger sister, Sanaa Seif, came to Sharm el-Sheikh early Monday. She arrived on a flight from London through the Turkish city of Istanbul.  I\' m here to do my best to try and and shed light on my brother\' s case and to save him, Seif said upon arrival. Since 2013, el-Sissi has overseen a massive crackdown, jailing thousands of Islamists, but also secular activists involved in the country\' s 2011 uprising. Many other activists, journalists and academics have fled the country. SAUDI ARABIA INITIATIVE As expected, Saudi Arabia had a large presence, both inside the COP27 venues and outside. On the sidelines of an event, on Monday Saudi Arabia\' s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman pledged $2.5 billion to fund regional efforts to combat climate change. The crown prince said the money would support initial projects and the budget for the Middle East Green Initiative, which Saudi Arabia launched a year ago. Saudi Arabia had a large pavilion outside the venue dedicated to its green initiatives. Salman also said the kingdom\' s Public Investment Fund would target net zero carbon emissions by 2050, through a circular carbon economy approach. Many climate change activists say the strategy and investments are simply a way for Saudi Arabia, one of the world's largest oil producers, to continue with business as usual. They say the circular carbon strategy focuses on unreliable carbon capture and storage technologies rather than phasing out fossil fuels. ______ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada161","Countries Adopt COP27 Deal With 'Loss and Damage' Fund in Overnight Session","Chiang Rai Times"," ","At the COP27 climate meeting early on Sunday, nations accepted a contentious final deal that establishes a fund to aid poor nations suffering from climate catastrophes but does not step up efforts to reduce the emissions that cause them. After difficult talks that lasted all night, the Egyptian COP27 chair made the final language of the agreement public and convened a plenary meeting to swiftly approve it. The session rapidly accepted the text's proposal to establish a 'loss and damage' fund to assist poor nations in bearing the immediate expenses of climate-related calamities like storms and floods. However, it deferred many of the more contentious choices about the fund until the next year, when a 'transitional committee' would suggest that nations subsequently accept at the COP28 climate conference in November 2023. Those suggestions would include 'identifying and growing sources of revenue,' which would address the contentious issue of which nations should contribute to the new fund. The two-week conference has been dominated by demands for such a fund, extending the discussions beyond their Friday deadline.\£9 Negotiators had no complaints as COP27 President Sameh Shoukry blasted through the last items on the agenda after Switzerland requested a break to study the final wording. The agreement was completed by the time dawn dawned over the summit site in the Egyptian vacation town of Sharm el-Sheikh. Fossil fuel Fizzle Even if a war in Europe, unrest in the energy market, and rising consumer prices divert focus internationally, the two-week meeting has been considered a test of the world's commitment to combating climate change. The gathering in Egypt billed as the 'African COP,' had promised to draw attention to the predicament of developing nations dealing with the worst effects of global warming, which is mostly the fault of affluent, industrialized nations. Negotiators from the European Union and other nations have previously expressed concern about attempts to thwart steps aimed at strengthening the Glasgow Climate Pact from last year. Ani Desgupta, president of the nonprofit World Resources Institute, said: 'While progress on loss and damage was welcome, it is disheartening that the decision essentially copied and pasted wording from Glasgow regarding lowering emissions, rather than adopting any meaningful new initiatives. The accepted pact did not include the phase-down of £ll fossil fuels,' as was desired by India and several other delegations, in keeping with previous versions. Instead, it urged nations to implement the COP26 Glasgow summit's decision to 'scale down unabated coal power and phase out expensive fossil fuel subsidies.' The draught also makes mention of 'low-emissions energy,' which has some people worried that it might pave the way for an increase in the usage of natural gas, a fossil fuel that emits both carbon dioxide and methane. \"

Sameh Shoukry, Egypt\' s foreign affairs minister and the current COP president announced Sunday that the topic has been added to the summit\' s official agenda.

The quip came during a question-and-answer session and got a laugh from the crowd of business leaders in the provincial capital. ""It's going to be a bit bumpy for the next 90 days. Any time you're changing a major area of government, there's going to be some bumpiness,"" Smith warned, referring to her plans to rapidly restructure management of the provincial health authority even as multiple groups representing Alberta health workers call for stability in the system. ""I would hope that there's a bit of goodwill, that some of the successes get reported as well as when we're making some mistakes along the way. Just be patient and gentle with us because we know that we have to do this for Albertans,"" said Smith. Smith's appearance comes after a tumultuous start to her tenure. Following her first news conference as premier last Monday, she offered a clarification on her statement that unvaccinated people are the most discriminated-against group she's seen, and earlier this week apologized for controversial past social media posts about the Russian invasion of Ukraine. During her keynote address to chamber members Thursday, Smith talked about her dislike of vaccine passports and her plans to amend the Alberta Human Rights Act to add protections for people who have chosen to not get vaccinated against COVID-19 - a move that she recognized will change the landscape for some businesses and organizations across the province this fall. ""I just wanted to give you a fair warning that we are going to be making a serious pivot in that regard,"" said Smith, who asked that businesses get in line with the government's new direction. ""We want to send the message to the community and to the world investment markets that this is a place that is open for business. This is a place that believes in freedom. This is a place that believes in free enterprise, and this is a place where we're not going to be making arbitrary decisions that are going to disproportionately impact small and medium businesses,"" said Smith to a smattering of applause. ""I'm very aware that our hardest hit sector of our economy was the tourism sector, the hospitality sector, restaurants, hotels, and I'd love to get some feedback from you today,"" said Smith. While Smith did not take questions from reporters at the event, she did touch on a wide variety of issues, including encouraging electric vehicle infrastructure, and working with municipalities to change their fleets to hydrogen. ""The government can take the lead on creating the supply and building the infrastructure, and once we do that, then others will be able to follow suit - but there has to be some catalyst that's going to push that forward,"" said Smith, who also emphasized her plans to better talk about Alberta's oil and gas sector on the international stage. Smith has said she will send a provincial delegation to COP27 , the United Nations Climate Change Conference , in November. On Thursday, she promised further announcements soon on the mental health and addiction file after having touted the UCP government's recent $187-million commitment towards fighting homelessness with emergency shelters and fighting addiction with recovery facilities. Smith is expected to announce her new cabinet Friday following a team-building caucus retreat in Sylvan Lake this week. She has said her cabinet will include some ministers who served under previous premier Jason Kenney, but will bring more rural voices to the table.

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada175","'Loss and damage' deal made at COP27","November 25, 2022 Friday","Kingston Whig-Standard","Finally, there is a little bit of good news in the global struggle to respond to the devastating climate crisis. The recently concluded global climate change conference hosted by Egypt yielded a last minute agreement to establish a United Nations loss and damage fund to assist developing nations recover from extreme weather events caused by climate change. However, the details of the deal have yet to be negotiated. CO 27 The 27th gathering of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, commonly referred to as COP27 , brought together wealthy and developing nations to address the imperative of holding global surface temperatures to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels. Equally important were the discussions focusing on the damage inflicted on low income countries by climate related disasters and the culpability of major carbon emitters in the Global North for the climate crisis. The Climate Action Network- a coalition of 140 organizations from across Canada-heralded the agreement to establish a loss and damage fund as ""historic."" The network is composed of environmental groups, faith groups and grassroots initiatives, health and youth organizations, trade unions, First Nations and other nongovernmental actors. ""Climate Action Network Canada joins communities from the Global South, island states, and civil society worldwide in celebrating this global agreement after a thirty-year-long fight,"" read a Nov. 20 statement issued by the network from COP27 at Sharm el-Sheikh. ""This decision sends a message of climate justice and hope that polluters will be made to pay up for the suffering they are inflicting and that those on the front lines of the climate crisis will have support to rebuild and recover,"" reads the statement. The Climate Action Network acknowledged that Canada, ""a major and historic emitter"" of carbon pollution that contributes to global warming, ""played an important role in offering early support for the call of climate-vulnerable nations."" However, the network insists that Canada must do more. ""Now, it must extend this support by committing funding and ensuring that the set-up of the fund is led by and responds to the needs of the most vulnerable countries."" BACKGROUND What is the proposed 'loss and damage'fund all about? The decision at COP27 to establish the fund is ""ground breaking,"" because ""it is something that lower income countries have been talking about for the past 30 years,"" Ian Thomson, manager of policy at Oxfam Canada, told the Whig-Standard in a telephone interview. ""They are experiencing climate impacts directly."" That means their lives and livelihoods are being lost and communities are being destroyed by extreme weather events, Thomson continued. ""And so the people who are least responsible for all the carbon emissions that are causing climate change are really bearing the brunt of the damage that's being created by climate change,"" he explained. ""At this year's summit, after finally a lot of pressure from lower income country delegations and civil society groups like Oxfam, we had a breakthrough, and they agreed that they would set up a fund that would actually provide financial resources to poorer countries that are hit by climate disasters."" Resilience ""All countries are going to be facing climate impacts. It's just a matter of who has the resources to rebuild and bounce back after they strike,"" Thomson stated. For example, Pakistan experienced ""unprecedented flooding"" earlier this year, ""and the storms that brought these flood waters were clearly supercharged by climate change."" The Oxfam staffer noted that Pakistan lacks the resources to rebuild after such a disaster. In contrast, when Canada experienced flooding last year, government possessed the necessary resources to rebuild communities and support people in need. ""Some countries really don't have these resources and shouldn't be expected to pay for the extreme weather events that they had so little a hand in causing in the first place,"" Thomson insisted. Are women and children in low income countries hit harder by extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding? ""The extreme weather events caused by climate change are certainly harder on women and children. They disproportionately bear these impacts. And they're often not in as good a position to move to safer ground, to leave before disaster strikes, and also have less access to power and resources to rebuild their lives afterwards."" In addition, Thomson said that climate disasters ""actually exacerbate gender inequality,"" setting ""women back even further in their struggle for equality."" For example, ""gender based violence increases after these disasters as women are displaced and their lives are uprooted,"" he said. ""If we really want to make sure that women facing climate disasters get the supports that they need, then we need to tailor our climate disaster responses to meet the needs of women."" How could a loss and damage fund help women and children in low income countries? ""What is exciting about the fund is that it won't only support government entities,"" Thomson answered. ""Women's rights organizations could turn to the fund and try to bring gender responsive climate disaster relief to the communities that they represent."" Details to be negotiated ""One concern that we have is that there's still a lot of details to be worked out, and that none of the rich donor countries have made major pledges on what they're going to contribute to this fund,"" Thomson said of the agreement reached at COP27 . How could the funds be dispersed in transparent and accountable ways? For example, when Canada delivers international aid, it traditionally works with trusted humanitarian organizations and partners. Would that model work? ""I think it's true that we do have a well-developed humanitarian system with lots of actors. Some are government agencies, some are not governmental organizations. Some are UN agencies. So there's a whole family of different organizations that respond when disaster strikes. What we've seen that is they are often relying on a charity model where donor governments are kind of asked for a contribution after the disaster strikes."" However, Thomson stressed that the loss and damage fund is different. ""It really requires the countries that have created the climate crisis to contribute the funds that will be available in a timely way and can still go to the same family of humanitarian organizations, UN agencies, or government agencies to help the rebuilding,"" he said. ""And all of the check and balances and accountabilities that we have in the humanitarian system can continue to support that good work."" What do you want to see from the Canadian government? ""I want Canada to design a fund that is responsive and accessible to lower income countries as possible,"" Thomson replied. ""We certainly have a responsibility to contribute to the new fund."" How much should Canada contribute? ""Our carbon footprint will play a big factor in determining what our fair share of loss and damage funding should be."" CANADIAN RESPONSE The Whig-Standard reached out to the office of Environment and Climate Change Canada Minister Steven Guilbeault for comment, submitting a series of questions about the fund. In response, the minister's office emailed a copy of his public statement. In that Nov. 21st press release, Guilbeault insisted that the international community must move forward with ""the work needed to set this fund up so that it delivers for the world's most vulnerable and draws from expanded sources of funding, including all countries who have the capacity to contribute as well as multilateral, philanthropic, private and other innovative sources of finance.""

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada181","Alberta's COP27 team has a different goal","November 6, 2022 Sunday","The Toronto Star","Alberta Premier Danielle Smith is sending an official delegation to the upcoming COP27 Climate Change Conference in Egypt - but one seemingly less focused on battling global warming than on waging war against the federal government. Alberta Environment Minister Sonya Savage says she is absolutely not going with the intention of disrupting work of Canada's delegation, headed by federal Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault. ""We're over there to represent the interests of Albertans and the views of Albertans and not to be in a fight with the federal government,"" Savage said in an interview. However, the Alberta premier was less diplomatic in explaining her reasons for sending Savage. ""The reason why we are sending our own delegation is I don't believe that we're being properly represented by Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault. He clearly is hostile to our oil and gas sector, he's clearly trying to step into areas he's got no business regulating,"" Smith said Monday. The federal government shot back, with a spokesperson saying, ""It is unfortunate when politicians seem more interested in picking a fight than getting on with the job."" Savage says she'll be taking part in panel discussions, roundtables and meeting with other delegations. She'll be talking about the need to reduce emissions from, among other things, Alberta's oilsands, but in the context of making sure the federal government is not writing emission-reduction cheques that the oilsands can't pay. Ottawa has yet to announce its hard cap on greenhouse gas emissions, but Savage, like Smith, sees this as the federal government ignoring the Constitution, which ""gives exclusive jurisdiction for the development and management of natural resources and electricity to the provinces."" That's why Savage will be in Egypt, to make sure Ottawa, as Smith says repeatedly, ""stays in its lane."" As far as they are concerned, a cap on emissions from the oilsands is really a cap on production. While it's true provinces have exclusive jurisdiction over exploiting their natural resources, protecting the environment is a shared responsibility between the provinces and the federal government. They share the lane. She is not arriving with an olive branch, but with a chip on her shoulder the size of a Rocky Mountain Douglas fir - ready to poke Guilbeault in the face if he dares make any grand announcements that would hurt Alberta. Savage is no pushover. A lawyer by profession, she was a strong proponent for Alberta's energy industry even before entering politics, including working as a lobbyist for the pipeline company, Enbridge. Upon entering politics in 2019, she became Alberta's energy minister. During her time in that portfolio, she was put in the awkward position of creating and defending Jason Kenney's plans for a silly ""war room"" that was supposed to fight back against anti-oil propaganda, but gained notoriety instead for going to war with a children's cartoon; and a public inquiry into environmental groups that held no public hearings, found no wrongdoing and led to a lawsuit by the groups against Kenney. Savage also tried and failed to defend coal mining in the Rocky Mountains. She has handled many political hot potatoes, and proved herself a stoic soldier ready to follow orders. That has critics questioning why a devoted energy minister has recently been named environment minister. Savage is certainly smart, articulate and knows all about the struggle by Alberta's energy industry to reduce its emissions. She is also often an apologist for the energy industry, and Smith is signalling to her Conservative base and the energy industry that when it comes to energy versus the environment, Alberta's United Conservative government clearly stands with oil and gas. Smith has said she is in favour of reducing emissions and getting to net zero, but on her timeline, not Ottawa's. At least Smith is not ignoring COP27 , as Kenney did last year, dismissing COP26 in Scotland as nothing more than a ""gabfest in Glasgow (that) is not going to make any meaningful difference."" Smith, on the other hand, is taking a different tack. In fact, two tacks: one pragmatic; the other Machiavellian. By sending Savage to Egypt, Smith wisely wants someone in the room speaking up for Alberta, but also listening to what world leaders are saying. She can tell Albertans who take climate change seriously that she has sent a delegation to COP27 - while she can also tell Albertans who think climate change is as much of a hoax as COVID-19 that she sent a delegation to COP to stand up to Ottawa. It is just one more tightrope Smith is unsteadily trying to walk as she transitions from UCP leadership candidate to premier of Alberta. Graham Thomson is a political columnist based in Edmonton. \"

Governments will play a key role in &ldquo;unlocking&rdquo; private funds, Carney said during a panel discussion at the COP27 climate summit in Egypt on Wednesday. Policy makers should &ldquo;align financial regulation with net zero&rdquo; by making net zero transition plans mandatory, he said. Carney made the comments on the summit&rsquo;s Finance Day, which will be a leaner affair than in Scotland last year after a number of prominent chief executives including BlackRock Inc.&rsquo;s Larry Fink and Citigroup Inc.&rsquo;s Jane Fraser opted to stay away. An energy crisis and a changing political landscape in the U.S. are making it harder for banks and investors to turn their backs on fossil fuels. Financial firms are also increasingly nervous of the legal ramifications of joining net-zero alliances, with some in the U.S. claiming that such goals are at odds with fiduciary duties. Those legal risks may intensify, depending on the outcome of midterm elections in the U.S. But there&rsquo;s also a legal risk involved in making climate promises that firms don&rsquo;t live up to. &ldquo;Firms should be wary of being caught in the riptide of unrealistic ambitions as it may expose them to both litigation and reputational risks if they don&rsquo;t meet these commitments,&rdquo; Sonali Siriwardena, partner and global head of ESG at Simmons & Simmons in London. \"

The United Nations said Sunday that it was investigating allegations of misconduct by Egyptian police officers who were part of the force providing security to the global body at the venue. Germany had raised concerns after attendees at events hosted by the country were photographed and filmed. But Wael Aboulmagd, a veteran diplomat who heads the Egyptian delegation, said he had not received any direct complaints from Germany.  I\' ve seen reports in the media, he told reporters.  They\' re rather vague, imprecise, inaccurate. Germany\' s Foreign Ministry said Saturday that it was in contact with Egyptian authorities about the incidents at its pavilion.  It seems ludicrous because that\' s an open event, Aboulmagd said, referring to a panel last week at the German pavilion at which the sister of a jailed Egyptian pro-democracy activist, Alaa Abdel-Fattah, spoke.  Why would any untoward surveillance exist in an open event? He suggested the issue was being raised to divert attention from the substantive topics being discussed at the climate talks.  We\' re tired of these apparently intentional distractions from climate issues, excessive focus on unfounded allegations, said Abouldmagd. The United Nations has confirmed that some of the security officers working in the part of the venue designated as United Nations territory come from the host country, Egypt, citing the  scale and complexity of providing security at a large scale event such as the COP27 climate talks. It said that U.N. security  has been made aware of allegations of the Code of Conduct violations and is investigating these reports. Egypt\' s hosting of the international summit has trained a spotlight on its human rights record. The government has engaged in a widespread crackdown on dissent in recent years, detaining some 60,000 people, many without trial, according to a 2019 tally by Human Rights Watch. ___ Follow AP\' s climate and environment coverage at HYPERLINK https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

Alexandra Masako Goossens-Ishii, SGI representative to the UN, comments, ""Although the loss and damage due to climate change is finally higher on the agenda, deep divisions remain on how to address them. I believe faith communities have a unique moral voice in calling on world leaders to take the decisions needed to move to a just transition for all humanity, while also embodying a resilient spirit, providing community support and moving towards a just transition at the local level."" To counter youth tokenism, Lucy Plummer of SGI-UK led a November 15 side event that modeled genuine participation and showcased the voices of faith-based youth who are speaking out about climate-related suffering and leading action by faith groups. David N. Munene of co-organizer CYNESA (Catholic Youth Network for Environmental Sustainability in Africa) stressed that young people of faith can contribute most when they act in solidarity with others, and participants emphasized that the world needs the idealism and positive vision of youth. On the same day, SGI cosponsored a workshop on REDD+, which aims to reduce emissions from deforestation and conserve forests, together with the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO). Cecile Ndjebet of REFACOF, the local partner in a joint Soka Gakkai and ITTO project that supports reforestation efforts by rural women in Togo, highlighted the crucial role of women at the grassroots throughout Africa. Soka Gakkai members around the world are taking action, convinced that even in the face of the insurmountable odds presented by the climate crisis, every individual's contribution can lead to positive change. As SGI President Daisaku Ikeda has stated, ""When youth stand up in solidarity, confident that they can determine the future, this fresh awareness and momentum will surely become the driving force toward a brighter future."" The Soka Gakkai is a global community-based Buddhist organization promoting peace, culture and education with 12 million members around the world.

Thousands of responses quickly poured in. Several were hostile or questioned his sincerity, but they also included rigorous questions about fossil fuel subsidies, sea pollution and nuclear energy. Macron, who will take part in the U.N. climate talks opening in Egypt on Sunday, promised to respond to the questions starting next week. In the video, he read from a letter from the public asking why he doesn\' t declare an  environmental state of emergency. He said the letter  prompted me to ask questions about what we are doing about this ecological challenge, the challenge of our generation. Early in his presidency, Macron pledged to make tackling climate change issues a top priority, but he has come under widespread criticism for not instituting enough tangible change. At the COP27 talks in Egypt on Monday, Macron is expected to discuss climate-related financing, protecting forests, Africa\' s Great Green Wall, and other climate adaptation measures, according to his office. He\' s also expected to raise the importance  and challenge  of sticking to climate commitments as Europe faces an energy crisis stemming from Russia\' s war in Ukraine. Those are all key issues at the climate talks at the Red Sea coastal resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, which are expected to include more than 120 world leaders and run from Nov. 6-18.

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada206","The Amazon gets a badly needed break","November 7, 2022 Monday","Niagara Falls Review (Ontario)","This year's United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) opened in Cairo on Sunday and continues for two weeks, but all that hot air is less important than the single fact that Luiz In\'e1cio ""Lula"" da Silva narrowly won the Brazilian presidency. He may be able to save the Amazon; they can't move fast enough to do that. I'm not denigrating these massive conferences, because that's the only way to bring all the world's governments together and put them under intense pressure to up their game on global heating. In fact, it's the only place that big commitments on cutting global greenhouse gas emissions ever get made. So last year, they doubled down on the summits. They went from big conferences every five years - but only ""expert"" meetings in between - to big summits where the political decision-makers are present. Physically present, not just following the talks sporadically on websites, because human beings are animals, and only physical presence creates real social pressure. If all the presidents and prime ministers have to show up every year and demonstrate to their fellow leaders that they are pulling their weight, the thinking goes, then that should ratchet up the commitments they make at these now annual meetings. This new system may really produce better results in the end, but the short-term effect was bound to make this year's summit feel like a disappointment. Last year's conference could showcase all the new commitments that had been extracted from governments over the previous five years. This year's conference has only the result of one year's efforts to show. But the pundits who will use the probably unimpressive results of the Cairo summit as evidence that the new system has failed are passing judgment too soon. Over the long run, the new approach is likely to produce better results. On the other hand, these massive global meetings, with well over 100 governments in attendance together with many NGOs, fossil fuel lobbyists in thin disguise, and various odds and sods, move very slowly and require huge compromises. The final statement of last year's COP26 in Glasgow, for example, was the first to mention the word ""coal"" in the final statement. So we are a long way from the Promised Land, and the best news this year has to offer on climate is that the Amazon, which may have been on the brink of irreversible collapse, has got a reprieve. The past four years, with Jair Bolsonaro as president of Brazil, have seen unprecedented levels of illegal mining operations and of land being cleared for cattle-raising by burning the rainforest. The rate of deforestation fell from a peak of 28,000 sq. km. a year (about the size of Belgium) when Lula took office in 2003 to only one-fifth as much by 2014. However, it was already rising again when Bolsonaro came to power in 2019 and is now at a record high. There is reason to fear that the Amazon might actually flip from rainforest to savannah. That wouldn't just harm people in the Amazon; it's a global concern. The Amazon is one of the key ecosystems that regulate the global climate, and changing it drastically could weaken the West African monsoon, strengthen hurricanes, even accelerate the melting of the world's ice. There has long been a scientific debate about whether the Amazon is doomed anyway, no matter what people do or don't do. A decade or so ago, most scientists believed that just the general heating of the planet, with or without illegal logging, mining and land-clearance, would dry the region out. However, further research has reversed that conclusion. The latest Earth system models show little sign of dieback except where there is direct human deforestation. Elsewhere, the phenomenon of ""CO2 fertilization"" provides a positive impulse to tree growth that outweighs the negative effect of higher temperature. In other words, the Amazon can survive unless human intervention overwhelms it. Gwynne Dyer's new book is ""The Shortest History of War."" \"
"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada207","Is the credibility of carbon credits at stake in negotiations at COP27?","November 21, 2022 Monday 06:25 PM EST","Canadian Press","The fate of the world's carbon trading market is in limbo as negotiations at the COP27 climate conference threaten to make an already complex system of offset trading among countries more opaque. That system, governed under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, seeks to help countries meet their climate goals by allowing them to trade carbon credits. A country that exceeds its climate goal, for example, can sell credits to countries that fall short of their targets. The goal of these carbon credits is to offset greenhouse gas emissions by investing in projects that reduce or store carbon through electrification, carbon capture or possibly through natural carbon sinks, like forests or wetlands. Currently, Saudi Arabia is leading a pushback against transparency in the system, calling for  confidentiality for countries\' carbon-trading registries, Matt Williams, climate and land program lead at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said in an interview. If the current draft text outlining rules for the global carbon trading market is adopted, countries will be able to veil their credits in secrecy while trading with other nations, as the regulators of those credits will be very limited in scope, Williams said. The draft is not set to be finalized at COP27 but may be completed at next year\' s COP or earlier. Theoretically, a country could claim greater climate progress than they are making as a result, Williams explained. It would be difficult to assess whether these credits, which can offset a country\' s planet-warming emissions but don\' t reduce them, are actually benefiting the planet. For example, two countries could effectively double-count the same credit under the guise of  confidentiality, creating an illusion of more emissions savings. Williams\' only explanation for maintaining  confidentiality revolves around credits related to a country\' s defence sector, which could leak information about national security. That  sounds pretty extreme as a justification for confidentiality across the board, he said. Whether these rules are robust and transparent or poorly designed, open to fake emissions cuts and double-counting, there are strong implications for the private market, Williams said. If  confidentiality provisions are adopted by the United Nations, they could be adopted as a model for private carbon trading, too, which is currently dictated by ad hoc regulatory bodies.  We shouldn\' t hold our breath that other standards or markets will set a higher bar than these UN rules, Williams explained. Secrecy around credits will also erode confidence in a market that already is developing a bad reputation, Williams said. There\' s a lot at stake, given the world\' s multibillion-dollar funding gap for spending on nature and biodiversity every year.  If it was done right, this could generate a significant amount of financing that could benefit nature and biodiversity, Williams said.  But at the moment, the rules are not doing it right. It looks like the rules are going to result in a market that is open to being gamed. Matteo Cimellaro / Local Journalism Initiative / Canada\' s National Observer \"

To date, the HYPERLINK https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aau5153 ocean has absorbed 40 per cent of fossil fuel emissions through chemical processes collectively known as the ocean carbon pump. Despite having buffered human carbon emissions since the onset of global warming, the process by which oceans absorb carbon is changing at an uncertain rate. Coastal HYPERLINK https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/ecosystems/coastal-blue-carbon/#:%7E:text=Salt%20marshes%2C%20mangroves%2C%20and%20seagrass,hundreds%20to%20thousands%20of%20years. blue carbon ecosystems such as seagrasses and mangroves lock up critical carbon stores in sediments and conserve a rich biodiversity. But the largest carbon sink of all is on the high seas - the deep blue carbon embedded in the open ocean as plankton, salts and organic matter. Deep-blue carbon and the associated diverse ecosystems are challenging to observe due to difficulties in terms of access, expensive equipment and the fact that these exist beyond national jurisdictions. This formal COP agreement provides a strong foundation for nations to act and for policymakers to heed the ocean observation community's urgent appeal for investment in the internationally-linked observation systems that will resolve these problems. But these requests need to be focused and united - and the science community is anything but that. Bridging the science and policy gap Scientists, more often than not, have to focus on the technical minutiae of their work, even when attending such broad international meetings as COP27 , to remain credible in their field. Intergovernmental work being done by groups like the UNFCCC's HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process/bodies/subsidiary-bodies/sbsta Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice is, often, invisible to them. This week at the HYPERLINK https://cop27oceanpavilion.vfairs.com/ Ocean Pavillion at HYPERLINK COP27 , Nigel Topping, the UK's COP26 lead, criticized ""the narcissism of small differences"" in the climate community, highlighting how researchers, NGOs and even governments, sometimes, fail to achieve consensus for climate action because of minor differences in their perspective.

But they can rely on strong frameworks from the intergovernmental institutions like the HYPERLINK https://www.ipcc.ch/ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) , which is building the bedrock of climate information through regular global assessments. This relies on the careful compilation of scientific knowledge and a remarkable international consensus process that informs governments and other stakeholders of the climate trajectory.

Computer mice made from recycled ocean waste plastic. Hundreds of millions of trees planted in the desert. Saudi Arabia's vision of an environmentally friendly future is on display just a short drive from the venue of the U.N. climate summit being held in Egypt. What's not highlighted in the glossy gallery are the earth-warming fossil fuels that the country continues to pump out of the ground for global export. Fossil fuel emissions are the reason why negotiators from nearly 200 countries have gathered at the annual two-week conference, haggling over how pollution can be cut and how fast to do it. In and around the conference, Saudi Arabia is presenting itself as a leader in green energies and eco-friendly practices, with flashy pavilions, glossy presentations and optimistic assessments of technologies like carbon capture, which can remove carbon dioxide from the air but is costly and years away from being deployed at scale.  We have hugely ambitious goals and targets,"" Saudi climate envoy Adel al-Jubeir said at the two-day Saudi Green Initiative Forum on COP27  s sidelines.  We want to be an example to the world in terms of what can be done."" The Saudi energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman al Saud, announced a raft of new green projects or updates to existing ones, from beefed up tree planting pledges to fresh solar energy energy projects in the pipeline. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman launched his Saudi Green Initiative at last year's COP26 conference in Glasgow, Scotland, with a target for  net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2060, which he changed to 2050 at the start of this year's meeting. Still, energy exports are the Saudi economy's mainstay, earning $150 billion in annual revenue, despite efforts to diversify revenue as the global transition away from fossil fuel reliance accelerates. At the Saudi forum, officials and invited guest speakers from renewable energy companies held forth on topics like clean hydrogen, greening the desert, and a futuristic desert city project called Neom. State-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco's CEO, Amin Nasser, said the world needs more investment in oil and gas, not less, a message at odds with the sentiment among many country delegations and climate experts and activists attending COP27 .  Yes, there is good investment happening in the alternatives, such as wind and solar power, he said, adding that the amount of money spent on oil production capacity has fallen to $400 billion a year from $700 billion in 2014.  That is not enough to meet global demand in the mid to long term, he said. An Aramco spokesman said Nasser wasn't available for an interview. Among the Saudi announcements, there were plans to set up a regional center to  advance emissions reductions and one to host a regional climate week ahead of next year's COP meeting. There's also a plan for 13 renewable energy projects with a total generating capacity of 11.4 gigawatts, though experts said that's a step back from numbers announced in previous years. Once they\' re up and running, the new energy projects will cut carbon dioxide emissions by about 20 million tons a year. Saudi Aramco plans to build the world's biggest carbon capture and storage hub, which will store up to 9 million tons of carbon dioxide when its up and running in 2027. It's all part of the kingdom's pledged to cut emissions by 278 million tons a year by 2030. That's still small compared to about 10 billion metric tons of carbon spewed globally into the air annually. The kingdom also upgraded its tree planting goal to 600 million by 2030, including mangroves, up from its 450 million initial target. Climate experts weren't convinced.  Saudi Arabia would be better placed to focus on cutting emissions rather than relying on carbon capture and storage and questionable reductions from planting trees, the offsets of which would simply allow them to continue increasing emissions from burning fossil fuels,"" said Mia Moisio, a an energy policy expert focusing on Middle East and North Africa at the New Climate Institute think tank.  To keep emissions on a 1.5 C pathway, all governments must focus on cutting fossil fuel emissions, not offsetting them. The Climate Action Tracker, operated by the institute and its partners, rates Saudi Arabia as  highly insufficient. The tracker analyzes nations\' climate targets and policies compared to the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement that spells out ideally limiting the Earth's temperature rise to 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit). Saudi Arabia\' s oil and gas assets spew 900 million tons of emissions a year, according to an inventory of top known sources of greenhouse gas emitters compiled by the Climate TRACE coalition and launched at COP27 . There's also a plan for a greenhouse gas crediting and offsetting scheme next year, with few details. Carbon credits, which allow countries and companies to pay to reduce their carbon footprints, say by planting trees, have become increasingly controversial, with critics saying they're a license for polluting companies to keep polluting. At least year's talks in Glasgow, Saudi Arabia faced accusations that its negotiators were working to block climate measures that would threaten demand for oil - a charge that the energy minister called a lie.  The Saudis may well be coming to COP27 with a green hat on and extolling the virtues of planting trees, but this is a state that continues to profit wildly from the destructive practices causing the climate crisis,"" said Alice Harrison, a campaigner at Global Witness, one of the groups that did the count.

""We've committed to Canadians that we were going to tackle climate change and that we were going to do it faster, and that's exactly what we're doing,"" he told host Catherine Cullen. Some observers have protested the presence of over 600 representatives of the oil and gas sector at the COP27 meetings in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Several of those representatives are part of the official Canadian delegation, including Pathways Alliance, a group of six Canadian oil and gas companies committed to reducing oil sands emissions to net zero by 2050. LISTEN | Environment minister on Canada's emissions reduction strategy: ""There are more oil and gas representatives at this climate change conference than there are representatives from ten of the most vulnerable nations in the world,"" Tzeporah Berman, international director for environmental organization Stand.earth, told CBC News.

COP27 to influence Canadian government policy, but instead to learn from international peers about how to contribute to emissions reduction. ""Our size of contribution to the problem also means that we have to be a major part of the solution. There's really no way of addressing issues around climate without having people involved in major industries, whether it's cement or steel or oil and gas, as part of the conversation,"" Cameron said. Emissions cap to be in place by end of 2023 One of the items Guilbeault listed as an example of action on climate was a cap on emissions in the oil and gas sector, which he now says will be in place by the end of next year. Guilbeault said the measure \'e2\€  which was announced at last year's COP26 in Glasgow \'e2\€  needs time for adequate consultation. ""You can't, in a country like Canada, a democracy like ours, you can't flick a switch and then make new regulations appear out of thin air,"" Guilbeault said. He argued that two years was a relatively speedy timeline, noting the five years it took to implement a clean fuel standard. WATCH | Shift away from oil a focus at COP27 : The oil and gas sector is the largest source of emissions in Canada, accounting for about 27 per cent of total emissions in 2020. The emissions cap put forward by the government is meant to contribute to an overall goal of reducing oil and gas emissions to 42 per cent below 2019 levels. There are currently two proposed options for the policy: a cap-and-trade model or a modified carbon price system. When the government first put forward its emissions cap plan, it was criticized by some environmentalists for focusing on emissions output, rather than on oil and gas production itself. An emissions focus could allow for the increased production of oil and gas, so long as emissions decrease through improved efficiency and measures like carbon capture and storage \'e2\€  a technique the federal government is backing through $1.5 billion a year in tax credits starting in 2026. Advocating for a production cap, Green MP Mike Morrice told The House that ""when they use the word emissions, what's critical there is that allows our country to continue to produce more oil and ship it to other countries for them to register the emissions on their target."" Guibeault responded that the government's measures were frequently challenged legally and he had to proceed cautiously. ""If we're not being very careful and making sure that we're staying in our constitutional lane, then we will lose in the courts, and no one wins. The environment doesn't win. Canadians don't win, companies don't win. There's nothing to gain from us trying to do things that we can't legally do in Canada,"" he said. Government preparing to spend billions more on climate adaptation Guilbeault also revealed the federal government's strategy for adapting to climate change may be delayed. The document, which looks to ""outline how the Canadian economy and society can be more resilient and prepared for the impacts of climate change,"" was originally expected from the government before COP27 . When the plan does come, it will have considerable funding attached, he said. However he made it clear he also expects provinces to play a role in financing as well.

Phasing down ambition to curb fossil fuels: In Glasgow, world leaders agreed to phase down the use of coal and phase out  inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels. This year, India has pushed for a commitment to phase down all fossil fuels, including oil and gas. Though the proposal received support from the European Union and the U.S., along with most island nations, it didn\' t appear in the draft document published Friday morning. Instead, the document includes language that weakens last year\' s commitment to limit fossil fuel subsidies and coal production, said Catherine Abreu, climate advocate and advisor with the Net-Zero Advisory Board, which counsels Canada\' s environment department on its emissions goals. The draft language  suggests some countries don\' t have to phase down coal if their national circumstances don\' t dictate they should, she said.  Even those baby steps [made in Glasgow] risk being watered down. Canada has recommended HYPERLINK https://thelogic.co/briefing/agreement-to-phase-down-fossil-fuels-would-risk-legal-challenges-in-canada-guilbeault/ against phasing down all fossil fuels, citing the lack of federal jurisdiction over natural resources in the country.  Every single piece of regulation we put out on climate change is being challenged in court by provinces and companies, and sometimes both, said Guilbeault during a briefing for COP27 participants Thursday.  If we\' re not careful from a constitutional point of view, then our regulations will be shut down by the courts. Abreu acknowledged that limitation, but said there\' s growing precedent for the Supreme Court determining the federal government has authority over issues related to climate change, citing the national carbon pricing HYPERLINK decision .\~ Abreu said resisting language around phasing out fossil fuels will hinder the energy transition.  No one\' s here pushing for the inclusion of fossil fuel phase out in the text because we think that means that all fossil fuel production ends tomorrow, she said.  But it\' s very clear that this transition has to take place, so let\' s set up a process that brings us all together to talk about how it\' s going to happen and make sure that happens in a just and fair way. 1.5 C is still (barely) alive: Friday\' s draft text reaffirms the need to keep global warming from exceeding 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels, and that getting there requires cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 and to net-zero by mid-century. The language HYPERLINK https://thelogic.co/briefing/g20-leaders-agree-to-uphold-paris-agreement-speed-up-fossil-fuel-phase-down/ echoes the declaration the G20 made this week and assuages fears a COP27 deal would soften that target.\~ The missing loss and damage fund: Loss and damage, which would see upper middle-income countries pay emerging economies for harms they\' ve suffered because of climate change, has been the defining theme of COP27 and many countries in the latter camp have said they won\' t accept an outcome that doesn\' t include a specific fund or financing mechanism through which money will start flowing.  Canada has been playing a very constructive role in the loss and damage discussion, Guilbeault said during a briefing for delegates in Sharm el-Sheikh on Thursday, adding he could see  the contours of what could be a real agreement on the topic. As of Friday morning, however, the draft document included only a blank placeholder where language on a loss and damage funding arrangement could be added, suggesting an agreement on the issue is far off.\~ The EU gave the issue a boost Friday by formally agreeing to establish a loss and damage fund. The move puts pressure on the U.S. and China, the world\' s largest emitters, which have rejected the idea for a dedicated loss and damage fund.

Trudeau\' s absence will be conspicuous at a conference where global leaders were expected to give substance to their commitments at past COP summits, detailing their implementation plans and showing their progress to date in reaching emissions-reduction goals.

Other delegates include Catherine Stewart, Canada\' s ambassador for climate change, and Steven Kuhn, the country\' s chief negotiator for climate change.

HYPERLINK https://thelogic.co/news/expectations-vs-reality-canadas-climate-progress-ahead-of-cop27/ have or have not done. In Glasgow last year, parties began the first  global stocktake  assessing progress they\' ve made on implementing the goals laid out in the Paris Agreement. The process continues through next year, and is considered a necessary accountability tool to compel countries to make good on their commitments. As national governments strain to put the best face on their efforts, you can expect to hear a lot over the next two weeks about what\' s actually getting done. Confronting inequality between developed and developing nations: Wealthy countries, including Canada, have made an outsized impact on global warming while also benefiting from industries that exacerbate climate change. Poorer, developing nations, meanwhile, have suffered the worst effects of the crisis and many have reaped few of the benefits.\~ Shifting that power imbalance, and obtaining reparations for it, is expected to be a priority for the bloc of developing nations at COP27 .\~ High on the agenda is the promise from developed countries to HYPERLINK https://thelogic.co/briefing/private-financing-elusive-in-global-effort-to-raise-us100b-annually-for-climate-adaptation/ raise US$100 billion annually to help developing nations mitigate and adapt to climate change. In addition to rounding up more commitments for the resilience fund, there\' s pressure on developed countries to pay for climate-related losses and damages caused by disasters like fires, floods and droughts.  The bargain between the Global North and the South is not working, and it needs to be fixed for the Global South to survive the oncoming train of climate change, HYPERLINK https://www.argusmedia.com/zh/news/2386379-pakistan-to-push-for-climate-justice-at-cop-27?amp=1 said Pakistan\' s climate minister Sherry Rehman. The country is among those pressing for reparations at COP27 after floods in Pakistan this year killed at least 1,700 people and caused an estimated US$40 billion in damages. Oil and gas producing countries like Canada have traditionally resisted these types of payments, out of fear they\' d be exposed to a raft of liability claims, said Eddy P\'e9rez, international climate diplomacy director at Climate Action Network Canada. But that is beginning to change. Denmark has made a small contribution to a loss and damage fund, and Canada\' s environment department, led by Minister Steven Guilbeault, will HYPERLINK https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-10-20/justin-trudeau-defends-canada-s-minuscule-climate-progress reportedly push for the initiative at COP27 , though the government hasn\' t committed money to the fund.\~  So many people have looked to Canada as an emerging progressive voice on this issue, said P\'e9rez.  The discussion is shifting towards one where a country like Canada and Minister Guilbeault have come forward and requested that this issue [be] treated as one where it\' s not just about liability or compensation claims, but one based on solidarity. What form this financing takes is also under question. As of 2020, the most recent year for which figures are available, loans made up 71 per cent of climate financing compared to the 26 per cent that came from grants. Canada, meanwhile, has committed to issuing grants for 40 per cent of its climate financing for developing countries.\~\~ Ryan Riordan, director of research at Queen\' s University\' s Institute for Sustainable Finance, said while reparations should be paid through transfers and grants, there\' s a case for financing mitigation and adaptation using equity and debt. Though piling on debts is always bad, he said, capital markets have the discipline to make sure financing is well-allocated.  That\' s one of the advantages of using debt structures, instead of just saying, \' Here\' s US$100 billion, tell us when it\' s all gone,\'  he said.  We want it to go to projects that are really going to mitigate or help adapt to future climate. \~ The host country\' s contradictions: Egypt in many ways embodies the dilemmas that limit global progress on the climate crisis. Even though the country is HYPERLINK https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2022/06/15/CF-Egypt-Nile-Delta-sea-level-rise#:~:text=Egypt%20is%20highly%20vulnerable%20to,will%20be%20at%20particular%20risk. vulnerable to the effects of global warming, it is substantially scaling up its fossil fuel industry, HYPERLINK https://www.gecf.org/events/ministerial-statement-of-the-gecf-ministerial-meeting framing natural gas as  the perfect solution to the energy transition.\~ The position is at odds with the COP presidency\' s calls for  higher ambition on mitigation, adaptation and climate finance, as well as recommendations from the International Energy Agency, a global industry association, which determined there should be no new oil and gas fields approved for development if global warming is to remain below 1.5 C.\~ Meanwhile, human rights groups have raised HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/31/egypt-cop27-showcase-charms-sharm-el-sheikh-protest-mall concerns that protesters who are typically fixtures outside COP conference centres calling out world leaders for climate inaction and greenwashing will be silenced in Sharm el-Sheikh.

The European Union HYPERLINK https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-6500-2022-ADD-1/en/pdf committed to end public financing for fossil fuel projects abroad, but that has been complicated by Russia cutting gas exports to the EU in response to the bloc\' s support for Ukraine. The EU has signed new gas deals to cope with the dearth of supply and rising costs. For its part, Canada is increasing oil exports to Europe by 300,000 barrels a day.\~ Along with compromising its climate commitments, Europe\' s energy crisis is spilling over to poorer countries that can\' t pay the same rates for gas, raising concerns about equity.\~  When it comes to the energy crisis, we need to talk about it as a fossil fuel crisis, said P\'e9rez, noting that Europe\' s scramble for energy underscores the urgency to move away from emissions-intensive sources.  But it\' s not going to be an easy discussion, he said.  This is going to be one of the biggest debates at COP27 . \~ \"
"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada223","O\u8217 Regan defends Canada against COP27 criticisms","November 21, 2022 Monday 07:41 AM EST","Canadian Press","Newfoundland and Labrador\' s federal cabinet minister suggested Friday that criticism of Canada\' s climate change mitigation efforts is misdirected.  Germany got rid of seven nuclear reactors and decided to start digging for coal again, Seamus O\' Regan told reporters following a funding announcement at the First Light friendship centre in St. John\' s.  Thanks, but hold your criticism. Holy cow. I\' m still in awe. O\' Regan was responding to news that 15 Canadian and two German environmental groups presented an open letter to Canada\' s Environment and Climate Change Minister Steven Guilbault at the COP27 climate change summit.  This is about emissions, and they got that wrong  and I think that they know that, O\' Regan said, pointing the finger at Germany.  So we\' re going to work with them now  on hydrogen, on natural gas. We need to lower emissions together. There\' s no perfect solution and no one has a perfect record. The letter focuses primarily on plans to expand liquid natural gas (LNG) production in Eastern Canada.  Eastern Canada is already feeling the effects of climate change, with Hurricane Fiona, the second largest hurricane to hit the East Coast in three years having severe impacts, the authors wrote.  Prime Minister Trudeau affirmed that the severity of Fiona\' s damage is a product of climate change. The letter cited an Abacus poll that found 52 per cent of Atlantic Canadians agree climate should be a deciding factor in energy decision-making. That\' s more than double the number who disagree. Newfoundland does not produce LNG, but has come under fire for continuing to push for offshore oil development and exploration in the Orphan Basin. That criticism was raised again in another salvo this week from the Sierra Club, which launched a new campaign called Equinor Out of Oil and Gas Alliance.  Bay du Nord's approval sets a terrible precedent. Approval of this project has opened the door to even more fossil fuel exploration off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador, Mary Best, Atlantic regional organizer for the Council of Canadians, said in a release.  Since federal Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault rendered his decision in April 2022 allowing the Bay du Nord project to move forward, the C-NLOPB (Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board) has approved five more bids for licenses to explore for offshore oil. Three of the five licenses were secured by Equinor, the company behind Bay du Nord.  The environmental impacts of Bay du Nord alone will be devastating. The potential for that harm to be multiplied fivefold is horrifying, Best said.  At a time when we should be moving away from reliance on fossil fuels and into a period of just transition, we are significantly expanding and retrenching our stake in the fossil fuel industry. Rather than fighting for a liveable planet, we are actively destroying it. But O\' Regan insisted the lower emissions from Newfoundland\' s offshore oil are still the better of two evils.  If we are going to need oil for the next 40 or 50 years, which we will  then they have to be the absolute lowest emitting ever. We are going to meet those targets that we have set. And we have to be even more ambitious about those targets,"" he said. \"

Now, as delegates enter the final stretch of negotiations over various texts and communiques, what has Canada achieved during the conference? This was dubbed the ""African COP"" and has become a forum for countries in the entire Global South \'e2\€  countries that have generally not been the largest historical emitters of greenhouse gases, but will bear the brunt of the climate crisis \'e2\€  to bring forward their demands. Chief among them is funding for loss and damage \'e2\€  the unavoidable economic, cultural and human losses that countries will suffer as natural disasters wreak havoc on their communities and rising seas swallow up their coastlines. Support for loss and damage, but no fund yet Heading into COP27 , Canada threw its support behind adding loss and damage to the official agenda of the conference \'e2\€  a big win for vulnerable countries who have been calling for funding for decades. The Alliance of Small Island States, a group of low-lying and island countries, has proposed a multilateral fund organized under the UN climate change convention which would be established over the next year. But the announcement of such a fund has proven to be elusive. Several wealthy countries made individual pledges for loss and damage, including Germany, Ireland, New Zealand and more. But the largest economy, the U.S., has been notably silent. U.S. President Joe Biden's speech last week at COP27 did not mention loss and damage at all. ""Canada has to look at other progressive countries within the European Union, other countries like New Zealand, that are showing willingness to really respond to the calls of climate vulnerable nations,"" said Eddy P\'c3\£9rez, international climate diplomacy manager at advocacy group Climate Action Network Canada. Steven Guilbeault, Canada's environment minister, said that he wants to see an agreement on loss and damage heading out of the conference. ""There is, I can imagine, frustration and great impatience on the part of the developing world because they're been trying to have this conversation for 30 years. And countries like ours, and many other developed countries have refused to have that conversation,"" Guilbeault said at a chat organized by Climate Action Network Canada at the conference venue in Sharm el-Sheikh. ""But that has changed this year."" Canada joins Global Shield program Canada did pledge money for another program that will address loss and damage. Global Shield, which is being led by Germany and was officially launched at this COP, will provide a form of insurance to vulnerable countries facing climate disasters. Canada will provide $7 million to Global Shield, out of its pre-existing $5.3 billion climate finance commitment. ""We're kickstarting here a response to loss and damage with that instrument. I think that is valuable,"" said David Ryfisch, team leader for international climate policy at Germanwatch, a non-governmental climate research and advocacy group based in Germany. ""What is critical, however, is that this is just one element of a range of instruments we will have to see in terms of loss and damage."" Ryfisch acknowledged that the approximately $200 million US that has been pledged to Global Shield, from Germany and countries around the world, was a drop in the bucket compared to the billions that will eventually be needed. Global Shield is also focused on immediate recovery after disasters, not more slow-onset climate events or non-economic losses like the loss of human life. ""It cannot respond to all of the nuances of loss and damage,"" Ryfisch said. ""But it's a start."" Though described as insurance, the program is aimed toward creating a pool of money from various donor countries that can be rapidly deployed after a climate disaster. The program will also help vulnerable countries pause their debt payments after a disaster so they can redeploy those funds to recovery. Seven ""pathfinder"" countries have been chosen as the first recipients of the Global Shield program. They include countries like low-lying Bangladesh, island nations like the Philippines and Fiji, and notably Pakistan, which suffered devastating floods this year that inundated a third of its landmass. The idea behind Global Shield is that insurance \'e2\€  unlike sometimes slow-moving humanitarian aid \'e2\€  can be dispersed quickly after a disaster. People and countries affected by climate events receive funding quickly to preserve their businesses and rebuild infrastructure, and can avoid falling into debt or losing their livelihoods in the immediate aftermath of disasters. Getting closer to cutting methane Canada also announced a framework for new methane regulations to reduce emissions of the potent greenhouse gas from the oil and gas industry. Methane is about 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide and is responsible for a quarter of global warming seen until now. Tackling methane emissions is seen as essential for fighting climate change. Canada's goal, announced last year, is to reduce methane emissions by 75 per cent below 2012 levels by 2030. The new framework is now open for public consultations, and the draft regulations are expected next year. Laying the groundwork for a biodiversity agreement Closely following COP27 , Canada will host the COP15 conference on the Convention on Biological Diversity in Montreal This year's conference is seen as a pivotal moment to gain a landmark agreement on protecting nature around the world, which is linked closely to reducing the impacts of climate change. Steven Guilbeault, Canada's environment minister, said that COP15 ""must reach a deal as ambitious and comprehensive as the deal reached for climate in Paris,"" referring to the 2015 Paris agreement to limit global warming to well below 2 C and ideally 1.5 C. COP15 will run from Dec. 7-19. \"

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada229","COP27 Approves Last-Ditch Deal For Historic Climate Damage Fund","November 21, 2022 Monday","Daily Oil Bulletin","(Bloomberg) &mdash; The COP27 climate talks in Egypt, which came close to collapse in the closing stretches, ended with an early-hours deal to create a fund to pay poorer countries for the harm caused by climate change. The agreement on loss and damage is a landmark moment in global climate politics &mdash; an acknowledgment that richer nations are responsible to the developing world for the harm caused by rising temperatures. Final agreement came after 9 a.m. local time following a marathon final session that went through the night. The closing day started with a threat from the European Union to walk out if the text didn&rsquo;t strengthen ambition to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and in the end there was no blanket pledge to phase down all fossil fuels and no target to see global emissions fall by 2025. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock complained about stonewalling from &ldquo;an alliance of oil-rich nations and major emitters.&rdquo; Canada&#39;s environment minister,Steven Guilbeault, said last week the country wouldn&rsquo;t agree to add language calling for the phaseout of all fossil fuels &mdash; including oil and gas &mdash; to the final agreement. Still, the agreement on loss and damage is a breakthrough, even if it&rsquo;s not clear how a fund will be financed or structured. It came after a flurry of last-minute negotiations over how to address the increasing toll climate change is exacting from developing nations that have contributed little of the emissions driving the phenomenon. The issue took on new urgency following monsoon flooding this summer in Pakistan that left more than 1,700 dead and caused at least $30 billion in losses. Just getting the issue on the formal negotiating agenda was seen as a milestone. Even then, it appeared unlikely that COP27 talks would result in a new loss and damage fund. &ldquo;We have struggled for 30 years on this path and today, in Sharm El-Sheikh, this journey has achieved its first positive milestone,&rdquo; said Pakistan climate minister Sherry Rehman. &ldquo;The establishment of a fund is not about dispensing charity. It is clearly a down-payment on the longer investment in our joint futures.&rdquo; Looking ahead, COP president Sameh Shoukry pledged to work out what a loss-and-damage fund will look like over the next year before handing the presidency over to the UAE. The Sharm El-Sheikh agreement calls for a committee with representatives from 24 countries to lay out which countries and financial institutions should contribute, and where the money should go. The committee will have two co-chairs, one from a developed country and one from a developing country. At the same time, the global energy squeeze is unlikely to make the task of reducing fossil fuel emissions any easier and Baerbock&rsquo;s comments highlight one of the core tensions in the global climate debate after Saudi Arabia and others resisted language calling for a broad phase out of fossil fuels. &ldquo;It is more than frustrating to see overdue steps on mitigation and the phase-out of fossil energies being stonewalled by a number of large emitters and oil producers,&rdquo; said Baerbock. &ldquo;The world is losing valuable time to move towards 1.5 degrees&rdquo; Celsius, she said, referring to the Paris Agreement&rsquo;s goal of limiting rising temperatures. That disappointment was shared by some of the countries most widely impacted by climate change and rising sea levels. &ldquo;We have heard the majority of parties over 80 countries attending this COP voicing their concern and support for stronger mitigation action,&rdquo; said Prime Minister Kausea Natano of the Pacific Island nation of Tuvalu. &ldquo;But that is not reflected in the cover decision before us and that is our challenge for the next 12 months leading to Dubai.&rdquo; \"

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada231","COP27 shows Higgs out of touch with reality","November 21, 2022 Monday","The Daily Gleaner (New Brunswick)","New reports from COP27 are useful tools to assess whether Premier Blaine Higgs's natural gas policies reflect current reality. The premier calls for a new shale gas industry. The IISD tested 97 possible pathways to stay under 1.5 C. None succeeded if new fossil fuel development was allowed. The IEA said new development should have ended in 2021. The premier believes that the Russian/Ukraine war means Europe needs our gas. The IEA stated that the energy crisis caused by Russia's invasion ""is in fact going to accelerate the clean energy transition,"" with increased government spending on clean energy marking a ""historic turning point"" in transitioning from fossil fuels. The Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air verified Europe's falling demand for fossil fuels. ""EU markets are responding with a surge in renewables, heat pumps and electric vehicles. EU governments have raised their ambition on the transition to low-carbon energy. The response from markets and governments suggests this trend is likely to accelerate."" It specifically warned countries scrambling for LNG projects to avoid getting locked into contracts that won't be needed in a few years. The premier claims that New Brunswick gas is more desirable, because it is 'cleaner.'All natural gas (methane) produces the same CO2 emissions when burned, regardless of source. However, gas from fracking creates substantially more CO2 emissions than conventional gas. The fracking process requires burning lots of fossil fuels to run generators, pumps and fleets of trucks. The premier also wants to sell the gas by turning it into liquid natural gas (LNG) for exporting. This process requires enormous amounts of energy to cool the gas to minus 160 C (-260\'b0F). Norwegian research firm Rystad Energy has calculated that the CO2 embedded in LNG production is 10 times higher than in piped gas. Multibillion-dollar LNG terminals require long contracts to be economical - up to 40 years - locking in for decades the very greenhouse gases that we need to eliminate. LNG facilities, and gas fields are also among the biggest leakers of unburned methane - the fastest growing of greenhouse gases - into the atmosphere, where it is 86 times more powerful than CO2 in trapping heat over a 20-year period. Bloomberg News recently reported that, ""Canadian regulators said they were unaware of a methane cloud spotted by the European Space Agency's Sentinel-5P satellite last month near gas pipelines, highlighting a disconnect between the nation's climate ambitions and its emissions, which are the second highest per capita among G-20 countries. Canada's methane and carbon dioxide releases have climbed more than any other G-7 country."" Such embarrassing headlines diminish Canada's international standing. Finally, the premier believes that New Brunswick gas could replace Atlantic Provinces'coal-burning power plants. It would take many years and billions of dollars to complete the development of a major shale gas play, transportation infrastructure, and gas-fired power plants. Meanwhile, the world will be leaving fossil fuels behind. It's too late in the climate crisis to replace coal with another fossil fuel. A new U.S. Department of Energy study said that the world will blow past 1.5 C, unless greenhouse gas emissions are halved by 2030. Scientific and economic reality undercuts each of the premier's policies, as does the moratorium condition requiring scientific certainty that fracking can be done safely - the lack of which brought down the last PC government. Recently, the U.K.'s Conservative Prime Minister lifted a moratorium on fracking, only to quickly reinstate it after public outrage - including from fellow Tories, whose Manifesto also requires scientific certainty. COP27 This year has already seen 29 multibillion-dollar weather disasters, and witnessed the crippling of the world's great waterways, affecting commerce, food and water supply, and energy production.

Egypt\' s poor human rights record has come under renewed international scrutiny ahead of its hosting of the global COP27 summit in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. Since taking office in 2013, President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi\' s government has relentlessly silenced dissenters and clamped down on independent organizations through mass arrests, detentions and prison sentences, among other restrictions. In a statement issued Friday, U.N. human rights experts joined dozens of international rights groups in criticizing Egypt\' s  sustained crackdowns on civil society and human rights defenders."" \' \' The wave of government restrictions on participation raised fears of reprisals against activists,\' \' the statement said. The group also called for future summit hosts to meet human rights criteria as part of the deal for holding the major climate event. Among several issues, U.N. experts have condemned Cairo for a lack of transparency over the accreditation for Egyptian NGOs, an increase in hotel room rates, visa delays and restrictions over gatherings and protests. A draconian law introduced by el-Sissi\' s government in 2013 effectively bans all street protests. However, Egypt\' s foreign minister and president-designate of COP27 , Sameh Shoukry, told The Associated Press in May that there will be designated zones in Sharm el-Sheikh where protests can take place. The office of Egypt's foreign minister did not immediately respond Friday to a request for comment. Earlier this month the foreign ministry denied allegations that it was thwarting participation, saying in a statement that the process for accreditation to the conference was governed by U.N. rules. It added that as host, it had put forward 56 organizations from Egypt, Africa and the region to join the discussions. Egyptian authorities have recently released dozens of high-profile detainees under presidential pardons and established a new  strategy to upgrade human rights conditions. Earlier this year, it also announced a national dialogue, claiming that it will include voices from opposition groups. Amnesty International has described these measures as  a shiny cover-up,  accusing the government of using November\' s summit as an attempt to whitewash their poor human rights record. The group's website is one of dozens blocked in Egypt. Egypt is among the world\' s worst jailers of journalists, along with Turkey and China, according to 2021 data produced by the U.S.-based Committee to Protect Journalists. Human Rights Watch estimated in 2019 that as many as 60,000 political prisoners are incarcerated in Egyptian prisons. A large number of those arrested and charged with crimes related to  spreading false news and joining an  illegal group  a reference to the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood which governed Egypt during 2012 and 2013. These are typical charges for detainees and political activists who oppose the government. Many of the major activists involved in Egypt\' s 2011 popular uprising that rocked the Middle East and toppled former leader Hosni Mubarak remain behind bars. El-Sissi has said in the past that the country has no political prisoners and justified detentions on grounds of national security. \"

This outcome from the 27 ""The process has been challenging with many difficult points in the negotiation along the way. Early versions of the decision text undermined the ambition of the Paris Agreement and failed to reflect and build on the ambition and alignment reached by all parties just one year ago in Glasgow. This made no sense. Canada's position was steadfast: the latest science says that we need to limit temperature increases to 1.5 degrees in order to avert the worst consequences of climate change, and that countries need to be accelerating their climate mitigation efforts, and we must not backslide. This is exactly what we are doing at home with our sector-by-sector Emissions Reduction Plan. With the help of many like-minded countries, we successfully prevented any backslide, but I am disappointed we were unable to get any further than that. ""Canada came to COP27 having laid the groundwork for a robust discussion on loss and damage, pushing to ensure it was an agenda item, something that has never happened in the three decades of COP. Today, we have achieved a historic result for the creation of a fund for assisting developing countries that are particularly vulnerable in responding to loss and damage that are caused by the adverse effects of climate change. Countries must now carry this momentum into the work needed to set this fund up so that it delivers for the world's most vulnerable and draws from expanded sources of funding, including all countries who have the capacity to contribute as well as multilateral, philanthropic, private and other innovative sources of finance. ""Canada also fought hard so that the world did not backslide on the phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies and coal, still the single largest sources of CO2 emissions. Canada reiterated our commitment to phase out fossil fuel subsidies by 2023, two years earlier than the G20 commitment. We are also on track to eliminate coal-fired energy at home by 2030. During a global energy crisis, we are more committed than ever to support the global transition to cleaner, renewable forms of energy, by transitioning away from our dependency on fossil fuels. ""I am also pleased that for the first time ever, the cover text calls on multilateral development banks and financial institutions to reform their practices, ensure greater access to climate finance and develop operational models to adequately address the global climate emergency. ""Canada would have liked to have seen stronger references to human rights and the rights of Indigenous Peoples and to the importance of traditional knowledge in achieving climate ambition.

He spoke with Postmedia before his second lecture, set to be delivered Wednesday. Q What are some key points from your talks? A Warming is proceeding faster in the mountains than other parts of the world. Glaciers are retreating, snowpacks are melting earlier in the year. We're also getting extremely high temperatures, such as in 2021, and massive forest fires in areas as well as flash flooding coming form heavy rainfall at times. All these are occurring at once, which is making it very challenging. At the same time, we've got declining snow cover, particularly through the Rockies and Western Cordillera in Canada, and parts of Central Asia, the Alps, the Caucasus. We're losing about three days of snow cover per decade since 1970. There are almost no glaciers that are expanding anywhere on the planet now, no matter where you go. So we're not going to be able to preserve some of these glaciers because of climate warming. They're melting away. But we can build awareness of the loss of snow and ice and the need to limit global warming. We have to inform adaptation to the loss of snow and ice, so how will we manage water in different parts of the world without glaciers and with diminished mountain snowpacks? We need better observations. We need to predict what's happening and we need to use that information to protect the communities that are impacted by this. It's freshwater for half the world's population. And we have to work with people to make sure that communities are getting more involved in the research, make sure that they're helping to define the outcome of the research and making sure they're getting the data and using that to help improve their lives. Q Did carbon emissions factor into you attending by video? A We were originally going to have a session at the UNESCO pavilion there. And when we started looking seriously at flying all the people over from Western Canada, the cost of that was going to be very, very high. And then also, we began to question, a little bit, the effectiveness of being there in person when we can Zoom in. So we've cancelled that and these are a couple of invited talks that could still be effective. Q What's your view of these conferences in light of ongoing climate change? A Well, it's very disturbing we're at the 27th Committee of Parties and we still don't have this problem under control. Many other large environmental issues were sorted out with one meeting. The meeting that led to the Montreal Protocol to reduce ozone (depletion) in the atmosphere back in 1988. The science was very clear, just as this science is clear, the countries got together in Montreal, they made an agreement, and we got it under control. It's not an increasing problem, it's a declining problem. HYPERLINK mailto:blevy@postmedia.com blevy@postmedia.com \"
"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada242","Canada doesn\u8217 t appear to have a plan to welcome climate migrants","November 25, 2022 Friday 02:29 PM EST","Canadian Press","This is the second in a two-part series examining the impacts of climate change on migration, in partnership with Ricochet. Read part one here: HYPERLINK https://newcanadianmedia.ca/climate-migration-front-and-centre-at-cop27-in-egypt https://newcanadianmedia.ca/climate-migration-front-and-centre-at- HYPERLINK cop27 -in-egypt / Growing up in Ghana, Jamima Baada watched her community, including members of her own family, migrate from one region to another less impacted by climate change. Now she teaches climate change and human migration at the University of British Columbia. Baada, who immigrated to Canada for educational opportunities, is in a relatively privileged position compared to the rest of Ghana, where many are farmers still surviving on subsistence agriculture, and unable to move to Canada because of a lack of resources.  The populations most impacted by climate change cannot afford airplane tickets, Baada said.  And that is assuming that they\' re able to go through the visa application process. More and more people are increasingly displaced by the global climate crisis because their homelands are no longer habitable. As many as a billion people could be displaced and forced to migrate over the coming decades, driven from their homes and communities because of extreme weather events, conflict and extreme heat. Global heating is slowly boiling the oceans, which is melting the ice and causing the world\' s water to rise. As the sea level rises, several cities and even countries could disappear over the next few decades. According to a 2021 report from the International Organization for Migration, as many as 280 million people\' s homelands could be submerged by the end of the century.  No one is spared. No place in the world will be safe in the future, said Caroline Dumas, the Special Envoy for Migration and Climate Action at the start of the United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP27 , in Egypt.  Hundreds of millions of people, especially children and women, are today facing an existential threat. There are two main drivers to climate-induced migration: Sudden onset, which refers to natural disasters, conflict, water and food shortages; and slow onset, such as land degradation, or desertification, and rising sea level, or ocean acidification, explains Rachel Bryce, co-chair of the Climate Migration Working Group for the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers. Syed Hussan, executive director of the Migrant Workers Alliance for Change, says slow onset is generally overlooked even though it is one of the most important drivers of climate migration.  Climate change is still seen through a very Western lens, as almost exclusively floods or earthquakes, rather than what it is largely, which is a slow erosion. Deteriorating agriculture is a main driver of human migration, Hussan explains. Most of the Latin American workers in Canada are farmers who lived on subsistence agriculture back in their countries. Many were forced to migrate north through the continent because desertification has made the land unliveable, he said. Baada says that countries throughout the Global South are disproportionately bearing the burden of climate change, even though rich countries in the Global North are the ones that created the problem in the first place. Global South countries are also the least equipped to cope with climate change because of the lack of development. The long-term impact of underdevelopment has created the conditions where extreme weather events can be catastrophic, Hussan said.  Floods of a similar magnitude in Canada would not have resulted in millions of people being displaced.  In Pakistan right now, 30 million people  almost the population of Canada  are displaced, because of floods. But if those kinds of floods had happened in Canada, you would not see the entire country displaced. Federal NDP immigration critic Jenny Kwan said Canada has a responsibility to increase the number of accepted refugees and asylum-seekers.  Instead, she said, pointing to new numbers released this month,  the government is reducing the numbers, so it\' s going in the opposite direction. Sean Fraser, Canada\' s immigration minister, declined requests for an interview.  The work of lowering emissions and transitioning the energy sector must happen while supporting communities on the frontlines, Kwan said.  [These changes] have to happen simultaneously because people are being displaced right now. Coming out of COP27 , Kwan says she is not seeing the urgency from the Canadian government that is required on this issue. In addition to pushing to end oil and gas subsidies immediately, and to stop pursuing pipeline expansion, Kwan says the NDP is demanding the government sign on to an environmental bill of rights  for people and nature.  We need public accountability, truth be told, she said.  We can\' t trust the government on this issue. They say nice words, but they don\' t match that with action. We need independent oversight with regard to climate action. What that means for Canada is making significant financial contributions to a fund for countries experiencing the ravages of the crisis right now.  We must respond to what is happening in the global community, Kwan says.  Climate migration is already happening. People are already dying as a result of it. At this year\' s global climate talks, adaptation and mitigation efforts, as well as loss and damage funding for countries in the Global South, were a central piece of the negotiations. At the eleventh hour, a deal was reached to provide funding for vulnerable countries hit hard by climate disasters, overcoming years of resistance from rich nations who contribute the bulk of the world\' s emissions. The agreement calls for a committee with representatives from 24 countries to work over the next year to figure out exactly what form the fund should take; which countries and financial institutions should contribute; and where the money should go. Many of the other details are still to be determined. Importantly, the agreement makes clear that payments are not to be seen as an admission of liability. While establishment of a new international fund for loss and damage is a historical breakthrough, activists say COP27 ultimately failed to achieve any consensus for a phase-out of fossil fuels. Many hoped Canada would announce an end to fossil fuel expansion, a cap on oil and gas emissions, and a windfall tax on oil and gas profits, none of which happened.  When COP27  Canada must stop bowing to fossil fuel lobbyists and putting the interests of a small number of wealthy individuals ahead of all Canadians  and indeed the entire global community. Canada\' s current legal definition of a refugee doesn\' t include those who are forced to flee their countries because of climate change. Bryce, of the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers (CARL) said that needs to change. Like most countries, Canada\' s definition of a refugee is based on the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees text written in 1951 in the aftermath of the Second World War and the Nazi persecution of Jews and others. The legal definition of a refugee is therefore very specific to this period and only concerns someone  unable or unwilling to return to their country of origin owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion. The only scenario in which someone affected by climate change could receive refugee status is if  the effects of climate change cause instability, and the state is unable or unwilling to provide protection against some aspects of persecution that resulted, Bryce said. Climate migrants might also be able to seek permanent residency through  humanitarian and compassionate grounds, but those considerations are exceptional and rarely granted, she adds. A 2021 report from the refugee lawyers association, suggests a number of ways Canada could modernize its policies to include climate-induced displacement. For example, climate migrants could be added to Canada\' s legal definition of a refugee. Guidelines could also be created to tell officers reviewing humanitarian and compassionate considerations to look specifically into climate risks. A third suggestion is providing  climate visas following the example of Argentina, which recently introduced a three-year visa for people displaced by natural disasters. But these are only temporary measures created to assist in response to specific events, Bryce said. It does not help those affected by slow onset climate change. Climate migrants might also come through regular pathways, such as study and work permits, and family sponsorship. But CARL believes these policies are not enough  to contend with the growing scale of climate migrants, Bryce said. In addition, she said it disadvantages those most vulnerable to climate change  the people who don\' t have enough resources to immigrate. However, for Hussan of the Migrant Workers Alliance for Change, changing definitions on paper  are not real solutions; they are tinkering. They don\' t actually deal with the scale and scope of the crisis. He said changing definitions also doesn\' t address Canada\' s responsibility and accountability for its disproportionate damage throughout its 150-year history. Canada is among the 10 top worst polluters in the world, and greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise. At the same time, the Canadian government and industry are planning to expand oil and gas production well past 2050, the year the government has previously committed to achieving  net-zero emissions.

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada247","Canada won't back call at COP27 to 'phase down' oil and gas production","November 17, 2022 Thursday 06:39 PM EST","Canadian Press","OTTAWA - Canada won't agree to add language calling for the phaseout of all fossil fuels  including oil and gas  to the final agreement at this year's United Nations climate talks in Egypt, Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault said Thursday. The agreement from the UN conference in Scotland last year called for countries to move faster to get rid of coal-fired electricity plants that are not abated with technology to capture emissions. It was the first time a COP pact included any reference to reducing any kind of fossil fuel use. India spent the last two weeks of COP27 negotiations pushing to add oil and gas to that paragraph in this year's final pact. The European Union said it was supportive of the idea as long as it does not weaken the language on coal. United States climate envoy John Kerry said the U.S. was on board as long as it applies only to ""unabated"" oil and gas. But there was no sign of any such language in the draft text of the COP27 pact released Thursday. The final draft was still being negotiated as the two-week climate talks near their final day Friday. Canada backed the coal language last year, but Guilbeault said it's not open to adding oil and gas to the pact this year. During a one-on-one conversation in Egypt Thursday with Climate Action Network Canada's national policy Caroline Brouillette, Guilbeault said Canada's focus is on regulations and policies that curb greenhouse gas emissions, like regulations on how much methane oil and gas producers can emit. It's also focusing on reducing demand for fossil fuels with policies that promote energy conservation alternatives, such as electric vehicles, clean power and more efficient buildings. He said if Canada backed the addition of oil and gas phaseout language it would prompt pushback from the provinces, including in court. ""Everything we do is challenged in the court,"" he said. (Carbon) pricing was challenged, our plastic pollution regulations were challenged, our environmental impact assessment is being challenged  either by provinces or companies, or both. And if we're not on very solid legal ground, we will lose in front of the tribunals and that doesn't help anyone."" Guilbeault said Canada hasn't been challenged over plans to phase out coal, but is on almost everything it does on the oil and gas side. ""We have to be super careful in terms of what we do  that what we do will hold in court,"" he said. ""Otherwise we're wasting time, and precious time, to fight climate change."" Julia Levin, national climate program manager for Environmental Defence, called that a disappointing excuse. ""I'd say it's clear that the government of Canada is beholden to fossil fuel lobbyists and putting their interests ahead of public welfare,"" said Levin. She added that Canada's position is strange, considering the agreement would likely have included the same abatement provision as coal. While Levin doesn't back carbon capture and storage as a serious solution to cutting emissions, she said even that would be ""a clear signal that, according to the U.S. and others, the age of oil and gas is over."" The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, meanwhile, said getting lower-emission oil and natural gas to international markets is paramount for its members. ""As global demand for natural gas and oil will remain strong for decades, Canada has a role to play in providing safe and lower emission resources to the world\' s energy mix,"" said Lisa Baiton, CAPP's president and CEO, in a written statement. The hope in Egypt is that countries would reach a consensus on action to cut greenhouse gas emissions enough to still make it realistic to reach the goal of limiting global warming to no more than 1.5 C. There is also a push for a loss-and-damage agreement so the wealthier countries most responsible for climate change help the poorer countries that bear most of the brunt of extreme weather and less of the responsibility. A loss and damage fund is also not in the draft text. Guilbealt told The Canadian Press in an interview earlier this week that Canada backs the idea, but this COP was going to just be the first steps toward such a policy. ""We won't solve it here,"" he said. ""And in fact, the agenda item specifies that we're giving ourselves two years to have that conversation."" UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres said Thursday that progress is not good enough. ""The time for talking on loss and damage finance is over,"" he said. ""We need action.""

He said if Canada backed the addition of oil and gas phaseout language it would prompt pushback from the provinces, including in court. &ldquo;Everything we do is challenged in the court,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;[Carbon] pricing was challenged, our plastic pollution regulations were challenged, our environmental impact assessment is being challenged &mdash; either by provinces or companies, or both. And if we&rsquo;re not on very solid legal ground, we will lose in front of the tribunals and that doesn&rsquo;t help anyone.&rdquo; Guilbeault said Canada hasn&rsquo;t been challenged over plans to phase out coal, but is on almost everything it does on the oil and gas side. &ldquo;We have to be super careful in terms of what we do &mdash; that what we do will hold in court,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Otherwise we&rsquo;re wasting time, and precious time, to fight climate change.&rdquo; The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), meanwhile, said getting lower-emission oil and natural gas to international markets is paramount for its members. &ldquo;As global demand for natural gas and oil will remain strong for decades, Canada has a role to play in providing safe and lower emission resources to the world&rsquo;s energy mix,&rdquo; said Lisa Baiton, CAPP&rsquo;s president and CEO, in a written statement. The hope in Egypt is that countries would reach a consensus on action to cut greenhouse gas emissions enough to still make it realistic to reach the goal of limiting global warming to no more than 1.5 C. There is also a push for a loss-and-damage agreement so the wealthier countries most responsible for climate change help the poorer countries that bear most of the brunt of extreme weather and less of the responsibility. A loss and damage fund is also not in the draft text. Guilbeault told The Canadian Press in an interview earlier this week that Canada backs the idea, but this COP was going to just be the first steps toward such a policy. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t solve it here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And in fact, the agenda item specifies that we&#39;re giving ourselves two years to have that conversation.&rdquo; \"

Countries in the Global South will be asking for compensation for the losses and damages that they are already suffering as the climate crisis escalates \'e2\€  and will continue to suffer in an increasingly uncertain future. At the heart of the demand is the fact that the countries most vulnerable to climate change are the least responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions that have caused the problem. WATCH | Will rich nations pay for global climate disasters? ""This is a clear injustice, because it is obviously unfair that particularly vulnerable countries like ours have to have to figure out our own solutions, if basically limited to no support,"" said Michai Robertson, lead negotiator on climate finance for the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS). That alliance, which began in 1990 to represent the interests of 39 vulnerable and low-lying countries, is pushing to have loss and damage on the agenda this year. They want negotiations over compensation to begin now and a funding mechanism to be finalized over the next year. Climate injustice on the agenda Robertson is from Antigua and Barbuda, one of the island countries most at risk of suffering massive losses from climate change. In 2017, Hurricane Irma forced the evacuation of all of Barbuda's 1,600 residents, and destroyed most of the buildings on the island. Climate change will make such disasters more frequent. Island countries face devastation from storms and floods, and an existential threat from rising sea levels that may swallow up entire communities. At the same time, the greenhouse gas emissions of island countries are minuscule compared to the resource-based, highly industrialized economies of wealthy nations, and their budgets cannot afford all the recovery and rebuilding that future disasters will need. ""In developed countries, you have your treasuries to lean on,"" Robertson said. ""We don't have that safety net\'e2\€ \£6. We need support to build that safety net and cushion when all of these things happen, to address these things once they happen."" AOSIS is asking for a ""fit-for-purpose multilateral fund"" to be set up under the UN's climate change convention, with the money going to not just vulnerable countries but also directly to communities most impacted by climate change. A dollar figure hasn't been proposed. How might climate reparations work? In an interview on her way to COP27 , Canada's ambassador for climate change said that Canada supports adding loss and damage to the conference's agenda. ""A lot more needs to be done on averting, minimizing and addressing loss and damage in developing countries, and more funding will be required,"" said Catherine Stewart. Stewart said the details of loss and damage funding will need to be negotiated, and could come from many different sources of money and support. Outside of the UN Conference of the Parties (COP) process, Germany has proposed a program called Global Shield that would be run by the G7 group of industrialized nations to address some of these losses. Global Shield will help vulnerable countries and communities get insurance to help rebuild and recover after climate disasters. But Ahmed El Droubi, regional campaigns manager for Greenpeace in the Middle East and North Africa says the proposals don't match the scale of support that will be needed. ""There are concerns that such a system is going to profit insurance company executives more than communities in the Global South,"" he said. El Droubi says that having COP27 in Egypt \'e2\€  an ""African COP"" \'e2\€  is ""a chance for countries in the Global South to stand united and demand climate justice."" What's been pledged so far? That goal has not been met. According to latest estimates, wealthy countries came up with about $83 billion U.S. in 2020. But Canada and Germany have led a diplomatic effort to wrangle wealthy countries and reach the $100 billion, which they estimate will happen by 2023. However, that money is not specifically for losses and damages, which include economic and non-economic losses that cannot be avoided through adaptation. ""We need a system. The UN does not have a system at the moment that helps countries around the world apply, get funding immediately after climate disasters,"" said Eddy P\'c3\£9rez, international climate diplomacy manager at advocacy group Climate Action Network Canada. Recent disasters emphasize losses The need for such a system was brought into focus during the devastating floods in Pakistan caused by unusually heavy monsoon rains. A study by the World Weather Attribution initiative found that the increased rainfall was likely caused by climate change. The floods disrupted the lives of 33 million people and submerged a third of the whole country. The economic losses are estimated at over $33 billion US. The entire annual budget of Pakistan's government is $43 billion U.S. According to the latest report on the impacts of climate change from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, even limiting global warming to 1.5 C in the near-term, which is a goal of the international Paris Agreement, will not eliminate all the projected losses and damages to humans and ecosystems. ""It's just a serious reminder that you can have today, but you cannot have tomorrow, for us,"" said Ineza Grace, a loss and damage activist and researcher, and a member of Rwanda's delegation to COP27 . ""And it's really, really terrifying."" Grace said that while negotiating on loss and damage, wealthy countries need to let the Global South take the lead and let them propose the solutions. ""What we were demanding is for, really from the Global North, to unlearn everything they think that we need \'e2\€  and listen to what we know we need,"" she said. \"
"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada256","COP27's great pyramid scheme","November 12, 2022 Saturday","National Post (f/k/a The Financial Post) (Canada)","Justin Trudeau is not attending the adipose gathering in Egypt of the world's global warming princes, policy merchants, press camp followers and true believers. It's as if the Pope was skipping Mass. A most rare abstention. From what I read, counting delegates and press, there will be a mere 35 to 40 thousand meeting in the land of the pyramids. None of course is swimming there or, following the past example of the queen of the movement, dear Greta Thunberg the anti-capitalist, relying on sail power, or paddleboat, to get to COP27 . Of course Steven Guilbeault, with the usual overstuffed cohort of the Canadian warmist community, is attending. I have a pious hope he will not attempt to scale any of the great monuments. The tombs of the ancient Egyptian pharaohs should be off-limits to environmentalist display. It would be rude to climb them to spread a banner, and infinitely declass\'e9 to glue protesters'hands to the base of any of them. I am sure, however, the ancient Giza mausoleums are secure from his scramblings. Now that Guilbeault wears the dignity of being a minister of the Crown (and has all those aides), rope-shimming and banner-unfolding is beneath - or, considering the activity in question - above him. The pyramids are safe. Tutankhamun and his relatives may rest in peace. The prime minister's choice of Cambodia (for that is where he shall be) over Egypt for his wanderings is interesting. For a leader so deeply bound - it is his government's priority concept - to (that wonderful phrase) ""the fight against global warming"" - to choose Cambodia over Egypt, might signal a slight revision of priorities. In the light of brutal inflation and an energy crisis, is there a hint here of a retreat on his government's global-warming fixation? That the politics of climate change, with Russia and Ukraine, and the European winter coming on, is taking a turn? Can, or does it suggest, a slight retreat from the doctrinal adhesion to climate alarmism? A lapse in conviction? Or, more plausibly, because politics governs everything, has there been a realization that Canada has very little to offer to the cause, while what it does offer only works to the injury of Canada itself - the strangulation of our key industry? Dampen the Canadian economy during an already bleak period, for no effect globally and hard estrangement in the West? We are seeing some vigorous pushback from both Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe and Alberta Premier Danielle Smith - and long overdue it is. The federal government is a partner, not a ruler in this Confederation. And federal diktats, especially on climate change, should be contested rigorously. It is encouraging to see some premiers push back. To add to this disjuncture, a ""climate"" conference in drear Egypt, not an Eden of human rights, is more than a little ""off."" Are those who nominate themselves as green, as warriors for the planet, as super-sensitive citizens of our global world, happy with the country they chose for their broodings? Let me put this gently - Egypt is not a great place for the ordinary liberalities of western democracy. Yet the would-be planet saviours are very willing to ignore the regime hosting the conference. The green message is much diminished, if it is not fully evacuated, by its readiness to overlook egregious violations of human rights in the country it chooses to ""honour"" with its meetings. There are kinder countries than Egypt. Is it impolite to ask the green leaders what their view is of Egypt's stance on LGBTQ rights? It probably is. For that would darken the righteous concord of the planet saviours. And who would wish to do that? And it is certain that the Canadian delegation, so keen on such rights at home (is not Trudeau about to be the first prime minister to show up on Canada's Drag Race?), would never raise such issues at the conference.

NEW YORK, Sept. 22, 2022 /CNW/ -- A global coalition of 108 leading wind energy companies and associations, representing 81% of installed wind energy worldwide, has challenged governments to take dramatic action to scale up wind and renewable energy in this decade. If the world is to get on track for 1.5\'b0C-compliant pathway to net zero, annual global wind energy installations must quadruple by 2030 to around 390 GW per year, according to theInternational Energy Agency, and by 2050, wind energy must generate more than one-third of global electricity, up from 6% today. But urgent action must be taken to realise this goal and unleash the full potential of wind technology to provide secure, affordable and clean energy for communities across the world. The Global Wind Energy Manifesto for COP27 warns that while wind energy is one of the most competitive, mature and quickly deployable energy technologies we have today, to thrive it needs large, steady and visible volumes for deployment and a robust global supply chain. This can only be achieved through clear and practical actions set out in the manifesto, including: urgently streamline planning and permitting schemes for grid scale renewables projects;rapidly build out vital grid infrastructure for integration of clean energy and cross-sector decarbonisation;to evolve power markets to both incentivise investment in renewable generation and allow citizens to benefit from the affordable, secure generation provided. Making it clear that the wind industry stands ready to work together to achieve the required rapid scale-up of wind installations this decade, signatories of the manifesto include the largest companies in the sector such as Iberdrola, \'d8rsted, EDP Renewables, Vestas, Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, as well as the wind industry associations in China, Brazil, South Africa, Europe, the UK, Australia and more. The wind industry is already delivering significant growth and benefits to the global energy system on security, cost and climate. In 2021 94 GW of wind energy capacity was added globally producing around 275 TWh of electricity per year more than the current annual electricity demand in Australia and enough to displace over one-third of the EU's imports of Russian gas prior to the invasion. But decisions at COP27 and in the next few years will determine whether the world can leverage wind and renewable energy to get on track for net zero and secure a livable, just and equitable energy transition.

That our city core is no longer decaying. There are no more perpetual traffic snarls caused by endless municipal construction projects. The Blatchford development at the old city centre airport is selling overpriced, eco-condos like hotcakes. Crime isn't rising and the administration has finally figured out how to clear snow from the streets. Oh, yeah, and council won't be approving the 3.9 per cent property tax increases requested by administration every year for the next four years. Whew! So it was absolutely fine that Mayor Amarjeet Sohi flew off to Egypt's Red Sea resort at Sharm el-Sheikh for the UN's annual climate-alarmism festival to hobnob with celebrities, other ""green"" politicians, solar and windfarm lobbyists, Gaia gurus and the few remaining enviro-activists who haven't thrown canned food on an old masterpiece or glued themselves to a gallery wall.

It's hard to imagine what Edmonton taxpayers will gain from our mayor, our deputy city manager for urban planning, Stephanie McCabe, and others being at COP27 , the 27th annual United Nations gathering to discuss - again - how dire the climate ""crisis"" is and how the world's governments are never doing enough to save the planet. Over mountains of shrimp, planeloads of expensive meats and oceans of champagne. To be fair, Sohi made a presentation on Edmonton's efforts to promote a low-carbon economy at a sideshow venue, along with the Kenyan minister of energy, the executive secretary of the Brazilian panel on climate change and the minister of petroleum for the Islamic Republic of Mauritania. He also participated in a sustainable cities forum and a municipal leadership in achieving net-zero emissions forum. (As if those couldn't have been held via Zoom. For free. And without all the emissions generated by jetting a delegation to the southern Sinai.) It's not clear yet just how many private and government jets will fly into Sharm el-Sheikh before the conference ends this weekend. But as the conference officially opened, the app FlightRadar24 counted around 60 landing at the resort's airport and another 20-plus flying into Cairo, perhaps carrying dignitaries bound for the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UN's climate treaty. More jets carrying celebrities and leaders have arrived in the week since the opening. Last year at COP26 in Scotland, a total of more than 200 private and government jets descended. These events seldom achieve anything of substance. They are held largely to let ""green"" politicians pat each other (and themselves) on the back for how much they care about the environment. They attract as many as 25,000 participants from governments, ""woke"" corporations, environmental organizations and the media, who indulge mostly in 10 days of virtue signalling, empty promising and fairy-tale rhetoric about the ease of converting to electric vehicles and alternate energy. Sohi pointed out, for instance, that Edmonton's construction of ""1,100 kilometers of shared pathways, and over 20 kilometers of protected bike lanes ... has doubled our city's daily bike usage in the last 10 years."" Doubled. In 10 years. From a few hundreds to double a few hundreds. No doubt he puffed up about the additional $170 million the city wants to spend on bike lanes over the next four years. The biggest controversy this year (so far) was over the event's VIP menu, which included salmon flown in from the North Atlantic for Cdn$55, Angus beef medallions with mushroom sauce for Cdn$140 and grilled sea bass or orange chicken for Cdn$50. Animal rights activists claim the delegates should be eating only plant-based entrees such as falafel and couscous, while climate activists have complained about flying meat and fish thousands of kilometres to the site.

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada269","VIDEO: People with disabilities raise voices at international climate talks","November 10, 2022","Abbotsford News","Last year, climate activists who focus on disability rights scored a major victory at the United Nations climate change conference known as COP. They gained official status as a caucus recognized by the U.N. Secretariat, the conference organizer. They say it was the culmination of years of effort to be officially included in the proceedings. Here's what that means for this week and beyond. COP27 conference Someone from the caucus will have the chance to address conference attendees at the closing plenary about disability inclusion. People will have an official space to gather. Members of the caucus will also have more access to the conference organizer, making it easier to connect with other attendees including country delegates, negotiators, disability rights organizations, as well as to participate overall in events. This year there have been two changes to make the venue more accessible to people with disabilities, according to Kera Sherwood-O'Regan, an Indigenous and disabled climate activist from New Zealand. People with mobility issues or chronic pain may enter the conference via a separate line, so they don't have to wait as long, and there are more ramps into buildings and onto some of the stages. Still, there is a lot more the conference organizers can do to ensure that the proceedings are accessible to all, like making sure attendees who use wheelchairs or walkers can move around the venue freely and that sign language interpreters are at all events, said Jason Boberg, a member of the disability caucus and a founder of the disability climate action network SustainedAbility. The issue of payment for harm caused by climate change, known in the jargon as ""loss and damage,"" is also on the agenda for people with disabilities. Activists want to include disability rights in conference negotiations on this subject. Boberg has been a key proponent in pushing for inclusion of disabled communities in climate action at the international level. He said figuring out where loss and damage finance will come from and how to secure some of it for disabled people living in disaster-prone areas is ""front of mind"" for members of the disability caucus.Next objectives Boberg said one of the next goals will be formal elevation of the new caucus to the level of a ""constituency"" within COP. Constituencies are umbrella groups of other organizations such as Indigenous alliances, business and industry coalitions, or farmers and agricultural associations. A disability constituency would have the authority to convene meetings with government officials and suggest speakers and attendees for official COP functions. They would have the right to participate at workshops and events that are otherwise closed. ""We are the most impacted because we're left behind, we're left on the sidelines and our voices need to be there,"" said Dee Woods, the food justice policy coordinator for the U.K.-based agricultural union The Landworkers' Alliance, at a November 2021 event that was held in Glasgow during last year's conference, but was unaffiliated with the U.N. Boberg said also that it is important for people with disabilities to be included in something called the U.N.'s Action for Climate Empowerment short-term action plan, which will be hashed out in the coming days. This is the U.N.'s framework for getting people, organizations and communities to reduce emissions and prepare for the effects of climate change. Last year, COP delegations adopted a 10-year plan to roll out the Action for Climate Empowerment. ""It's really crucial for disabled people and organizations to be included"" in those plans, Boberg said, so they can get more resources from countries for climate action and prepare for climate emergencies. This could mean assurance that relief shelters are accessible. Or it could mean the creation of registries of disabled people, to help governments deliver extra assistance to the right places in the lead up to extreme weather. It also could mean help cleaning up in the aftermath. Activists are also pushing to ensure disability rights are included in international climate action plans, since there are over 1 billion people in the world living with a disability, according to the World Health Organization.Getting this far The recognition of the disability caucus by the leadership of the U.N. climate conference last year was a milestone. People have been meeting and organizing on this unofficially at the conference since COP23 in 2017 in Bonn, Germany. ""Back then (we'd meet) in the corridors and cafes and wherever we could get a space,"" Boberg said. He was able to give the disability caucus' first-ever address to conference attendees last year. In it, he said world leaders and society at large have considered disabled people as ""expected losses"" to climate change. He implored world leaders to include human rights and Indigenous and disabled people's rights in Article 6 of the Paris climate agreement, which outlines how countries can achieve pledges they've made to reduce emissions and promote sustainable development.

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada271","People with disabilities raise voices at climate talks","November 10, 2022 Thursday 03:09 PM EST","Canadian Press","SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt (AP)  Last year, climate activists who focus on disability rights scored a major victory at the United Nations climate change conference known as COP. They gained official status as a caucus recognized by the U.N. Secretariat, the conference organizer. They say it was the culmination of years of effort to be officially included in the proceedings. Here's what that means for this week and beyond. COP27 CONFERENCE Members of the caucus will have more access to the conference organizer, making it easier to connect with other attendees including country delegates, negotiators, and disability rights organizations. Someone from the caucus may have the chance to address conference attendees at the closing plenary about disability inclusion. People will also have an official space to gather. This year there have been two changes to make the venue more accessible to people with disabilities, according to Kera Sherwood-O'Regan, an Indigenous and disabled climate activist from New Zealand. People with mobility issues or chronic pain may enter the conference via a separate line, so they don't have to wait as long, and there are more ramps into buildings and onto some of the stages. Still, there is a lot more the conference organizers can do to ensure that the proceedings are accessible to all, like making sure attendees who use wheelchairs or walkers can move around the venue freely and that sign language interpreters are at all events, said Jason Boberg, chair of the disability caucus and a founder of the disability climate action network SustainedAbility. The issue of payment for harm caused by climate change, known in the jargon as  loss and damage, is also on the agenda for people with disabilities. Activists want to include disability rights in conference negotiations on this subject. Boberg has been a key proponent in pushing for inclusion of disabled communities in climate action at the international level. He said figuring out where loss and damage finance will come from and how to secure some of it for disabled people living in disaster-prone areas is  front of mind for members of the disability caucus. NEXT OBJECTIVES Boberg said one of the next goals will be formal elevation of the new caucus to the level of a  constituency within COP. Constituencies are umbrella groups of other organizations such as Indigenous alliances, business and industry coalitions, or farmers and agricultural associations. A disability constituency would have the authority to convene meetings with government officials and suggest speakers and attendees for official COP functions. They would have the right to participate at workshops and events that are otherwise closed.  We are the most impacted because we\' re left behind, we\' re left on the sidelines and our voices need to be there, said Dee Woods, the food justice policy coordinator for the U.K.-based agricultural union The Landworkers\' Alliance, at a November 2021 event that was held in Glasgow during last year\' s conference, but was unaffiliated with the U.N. Boberg said also that it is important for people with disabilities to be included in something called the U.N.'s Action for Climate Empowerment short-term action plan, which will be hashed out in the coming days. This is the U.N.\' s framework for getting people, organizations and communities to reduce emissions and prepare for the effects of climate change. Last year, COP delegations adopted a 10-year plan to roll out the Action for Climate Empowerment.  It's really crucial for disabled people and organizations to be included"" in those plans, Boberg said, so they can get more resources from countries for climate action and prepare for climate emergencies. This could mean assurance that relief shelters are accessible. Or it could mean the creation of registries of disabled people, to help governments deliver extra assistance to the right places in the lead up to extreme weather. It also could mean help cleaning up in the aftermath. Activists are also pushing to ensure disability rights are included in international climate action plans, since there are over 1 billion people in the world living with a disability, according to the World Health Organization. GETTING THIS FAR The recognition of the disability caucus by the leadership of the U.N. climate conference last year was a milestone. People have been meeting and organizing on this unofficially at the conference since COP23 in 2017 in Bonn, Germany.  Back then (we'd meet) in the corridors and cafes and wherever we could get a space, Boberg said. He was able to give the disability caucus\' first-ever address to conference attendees last year. In it, he said world leaders and society at large have considered disabled people as  expected losses to climate change. He implored world leaders to include human rights and Indigenous and disabled people\' s rights in Article 6 of the Paris climate agreement, which outlines how countries can achieve pledges they've made to reduce emissions and promote sustainable development.  Until parties recognize disabled leadership on climate and uphold our rights, this COP will be critiqued as an exclusionary event where disabled people are missing, he said in that 2021 statement. Boberg told The Associated Press in an interview days before he departed this year for COP27 that more than once he's seen language that recognizes disability rights appear in draft text of negotiations  for example funding disability rights organizations to do climate action work. But the language was cut from the final agreements at the negotiations. Sherwood-O'Regan said it's  really disappointing when that happens.  You hope for the best, but plan for the worst and I like to keep my expectations not too high, she said.

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada273","ESG a good idea that's now 'broken, cynical, counter productive,' Shopify's L\'fctke says","November 15, 2022 Tuesday","National Post's Financial Post & FP Investing (Canada)","Shopify Inc. chief executive Tobi L\'fctke has joined the backlash against ESG. ""ESG the idea is really good,"" L\'fctke, chief executive of Canada's highest profile tech company, tweeted to his nearly 270,000 followers on Nov. 13. ""ESG the current implementation is broken, cynical, and counter productive."" He called for a ""reboot"" by people ""who understand systems design."" ESG stands for environment, social and governance, capturing three themes within the investment strategies of those who believe capital should be directed towards companies that are committed to fighting climate change, taking stands against discrimination and putting diverse leadership teams in place. Funds managing trillions of dollars purport to follow those principles, but there has been pushback over the thoroughness of the research that determines the companies that are deemed worthy of that money. L\'fctke was reacting to an ESG assessment that gave a higher rankings on leadership and governance to troubled cryptocurrency exchange FTX - which entered bankruptcy protection over the weekend amid reports that a related company was using customer funds and that hundreds of millions of dollars were moved in suspicious circumstances - than to Exxon Mobile Corp. Companies around the world have been quick to respond to growing investor demand for ESG considerations by proclaiming commitments to ""green"" and sustainable operations. Meanwhile, regulators have been hammering out detailed requirements that would force corporations to disclose what they are doing to track and control environmental, social and governance risks, including those stemming from financing activities that produce carbon emissions. However, a lack of co-ordinated global measurement, among other factors, has led to accusations of ""greenwashing,"" in which environmental claims are not backed by substantial action, as well as a backlash against corporate decision-making based heavily or even solely on ESG concerns. Critics of ESG criteria come from both sides of the ideological spectrum. On one hand, environmental groups and others are stepping up their tactics to combat what they see as greenwashing - with recent complaints to Canada's Competition Bureau compelling the watchdog to look into ESG claims made by Royal Bank of Canada and the Canadian Gas Association. And Catherine McKenna, Canada's former minister of environment and climate change, laid out fresh expectations for companies at the COP27 United Nations Climate Change Conference taking place in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, telling them it's ""time to draw a red line"" around greenwashing. On the other hand, there has been a growing backlash, particularly evident in the United States, against investing decisions based on ESG factors. BlackRock Inc., the world's largest asset manager, has been involved in a balancing act in recent months, pledging to reject overly prescriptive shareholder climate change resolutions, while also pushing back against Republican attorneys general in more than a dozen states that accused the asset manager of being anti-fossil fuel and undercutting profits in state pension funds as a result of factoring ESG into investment decisions. And a survey by CNBC in September found that only 25 per cent of chief financial officers supported the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's climate disclosure proposals, while 45 per cent of those surveyed backed moves by Texas and Florida to ban pension funds from investing based on ESG factors. The same month, a report by Thomson Reuters Institute stated: ""After a period of ascendancy, the momentum behind ESG initiatives among companies and governments has recently come under strain."" Leanne Keddie, an assistant professor of accounting at Carleton University's Sprott School of Business, said Shopify's L\'fctke ""absolutely has a point"" in the statement he made on Twitter over the weekend. ""Many people seem to think ... that somehow 'good'ESG leads to sustainability - there is no evidence that I am aware of that that is true,"" she said. ""Until people wrap their heads around this distinction, we are going to continue to have confusion on this point. ESG ratings will continue to tell investors about the risks/opportunities they face on ESG topics but not on how a firm contributes towards a sustainable world,"" Keddie said. Charles H. Cho, professor of sustainability accounting at York University's Schulich School of Business, said a mini-industry has sprung up to measure and catalogue environmental, social and governance impacts, with a money-making motive that hurts credibility. ""ESG ratings have evolved to become a product to sell,"" he said, adding that they can be hard to compare, biased and misleading. ""So they don't really mean much."" This the lack of standardized terminology and measurement, which appears to have been at the heart of L\'fctke's assessment, is a key stumbling block in resolving the ESG debate, say those who follow the issue closely.

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada274","Ghanian girl cuts through jargon, delivers message at COP27","November 18, 2022 Friday 01:05 PM EST","Canadian Press","SHARM el-SHEIKH, Egypt (AP)  By their very nature, U.N. climate negotiations are filled with scientific and diplomatic jargon. So, when 10-year-old Nakeeyat Dramani Sam spoke during a plenary session Friday with hundreds of delegates, her soft voice and direct message cut through the dryness, a reminder to negotiators and everybody listening that decisions made at climate talks can have a direct impact on people. Talking about suffering in Ghana due to flooding, she held up a sign that said,  Payment Overdue.""  I put a simple question on the table,"" she said.  When can you pay us back? Because payment is overdue. Sam was talking about a thorny issue that has taken center stage over the last two weeks of negotiations at the summit called COP27 , hosted in the Red Sea resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Many developing nations are insisting that rich countries, which have contributed most to climate change because of high greenhouse emissions, compensate them for the damage. In climate negotiations, the issue is called  loss and damage. It's a topic that produces a wide range of opinions and nuanced battle lines. Developed nations like the United States have resisted such calls for compensation, not wanting to be on the hook for what could be open-ended liability. China, also a high-carbon emitting country, supports the idea of rich nations contributing to such payments but doesn't want to pay. On Thursday, the European Union put forward a proposal to create a fund for loss and damage. While the proposal gave negotiators something specific to chew on, it also likely deepened divisions. Sam's speech didn't bother with the machinations of negotiations, but rather had the kind of frankness and freshness that comes natural to children. She told the attendees that she had met with U.S. Climate Envoy John Kerry earlier this week. Kerry had been nice, she said, and the meeting got her thinking about the future. Her next sentence had humor in it, though she certainly didn't mean for that.  By the time I\' m his age, God willing, it will be the end of this century, she said, implicitly saying, as kids often do about adults, that Kerry was old. Kerry is 78. Shortly after that came a powerful and direct message. Talking about how scientists say the world has less than a decade left to continue polluting at today's rates before the effects of global warming get much worse, Sam said:  Have a heart and do the math. It's an emergency."" When Sam finished speaking, she received a standing ovation. In an interview afterward, Sam said that her environmentalism began a few years ago with a love for trees. She wrote a children's book about trees in Ghana and to date has planted over 100 trees.  I also call for action that every child must plant a tree, she said, standing with her mother and aunt. Sam said that she was a poet, and when prompted recited from memory a poem about climate change that ended with exhortations for rich countries to assume responsibility for historical climate damage and pay up. Children were the best people to deliver such messages, she said, because they would be around to suffer the consequences of warming planet.  We are the future leaders, so when we talk people listen,"" she said.

Will countries get behind a proposal to phase down all fossil fuels? Will the demands of developing nations that rich countries compensate them for climate impacts be part of a final deal? What about calls to lower interest rates and overhaul how world financing works so that developing nations can invest in green energies? The resounding answer to all of these questions appeared to be  no for most of Thursday, at least if one carefully parses rhetoric and readouts from closed-door meetings. That was not to say that a significant deal couldn't be reached, however. There would be another round of talks on Friday with extensions into the weekend a possibility. A look at where thing stand late Thursday. LOSS AND DAMAGE From the start of the climate conference, the dominating issue, both from many leaders and protesters, has been the question of whether rich nations should provide compensation to developing nations. Rich, high-carbon producing countries like the United States have historically done most to create global warming while developing nations have contributed little but are often most impacted by extreme weather events. While the idea has been around for years, until this year it was mostly on the fringes. For the first time, it made the official agenda. Negotiators from countries that support the idea, called  loss and damage in climate negotiations, have said some industrialized nations are blocking efforts at a deal. But late Thursday, the European Union surprised everyone by proposing a pot of money for poorer nations more vulnerable to climate change. The EU executive vice president also put forward an extra push to cut down carbon dioxide emissions by all countries. The move was welcomed by many developing countries, but it\' s prospects were unclear. Earlier on Thursday, Lia Nicholson of the delegation of Antigua and Barbuda, speaking on behalf of the Association of Small Island States, said the issue of loss and damage wasn't getting serious consideration. She said there was no text on it that delegates could haggle over.  Mr. President, where is the text? she said to Shoukry, Egypt's foreign minister the president of COP27 . Shoukry, presiding over the session, told Nicholson she was mistaken and that there were informal discussions about the issue. BLAME GAME Amid many happenings in the world  the war in Ukraine, recent U.S. elections, the Group of 20 summit in Bali, among other things  trying to build consensus between so many nations was always going to be tough. That said, many long-time observers of the annual climate conference said negotiations shouldn\' t have been in such a poor state at this juncture. Longtime negotiations analyst Alden Meyer of E3G told The Associated Press that unlike in previous years, the president of the conference, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, delayed putting together special teams of ministers to push through solutions on big issues, except loss and damage, and that\' s putting everything behind. Several other analysts and negotiators laid blame at the feet of the COP27 presidency. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres, arriving in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, from the G20 meeting in Bali, issued a statement calling for calm and a willingness to work together to confront climate change.  This is no time for finger pointing, said the statement.  The blame game is a recipe for mutually assured destruction. CONFUSING RELEASE Adding to a feeling of confusion and chaos among negotiators was an Egyptian draft that had ideas which hadn\' t been discussed during the summit, which began Nov. 6. The lengthy document released early Thursday included a call for developed countries to achieve  net-negative carbon emissions by 2030. That target goes further than any major nation has so far committed to and which would be very hard to achieve. The EU and U.S., for example, have said they aim to reach net zero emissions by 2050, China by 2060. Negotiators were quick to make clear it was just a draft, both criticizing it and making clear it wasn\' t their guide. The head of the European Parliament at the U.N. climate conference, Bas Eirkhout, described it as  a bit of wish list with  all the topics thrown in. It was  too broad, too many topics, too vague language and too many items, which I don\' t think have to be in a cover decision, said Eirkhout. EXTERNAL BOOSTS Up to this point, arguably the two most important developments to limiting climate change have come from outside developments. First, the victory of Brazilian President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in last month's election gave hope that his administration would crack down on illegal deforestation in the Amazon, the world's largest rainforest. Da Silva, president between 2003 and 2010, has promised as much. On Tuesday and Wednesday, da Silva got rockstar treatment as he met with Indigenous groups, climate activists and several ministers, including U.S. Climate Envoy John Kerry. Speaking of Kerry, he began talks with his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua during the conference. Relations between the U.S. and China have been tense because of several things, most recently the visit by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan. As such, talks between Xie and Kerry had broken down. U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping met at the G20 meetings in Bali on Monday. They both said they were committed to having high-level officials from their administrations resume talks on several issues, including climate change. China and the U.S. are the world\' s No. 1 and 2 climate polluters.

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada278","Foundations call for cooperation, some new pledges at COP27","November 18, 2022 Friday 12:11 AM EST","Canadian Press","As communities around the globe press their case at the COP27 conference in Egypt that climate damage is forcing migration and causing suffering as never before, philanthropic foundations pooled their resources to donate more than $2 billion to support climate adaptation projects. Overall, though the amount of charitable funding directed toward climate related projects remains small. Global climate talks were scheduled to end negotiations Friday, though many expect they will go beyond the deadline to reach a deal. On COP27 's opening day last week, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced $1.4 billion in support for agricultural projects, across Africa and South Asia that it said will help small farmers adapt to climate change. The commitment was $434 million larger than initially planned through 2025, funding projects including research to increase the productivity of seeds and livestock farming and a partnership that would provide weather information to farmers in East Africa by text message. The Gates Foundation pledged another $7 billion over four years to go to its work on agriculture, health and gender equality in Africa while Bill Gates was visiting Kenya. Gates warned Thursday, at an event with students at the University of Nairobi, that aid or investments from governments to finance climate adaptation and mitigation was limited and may be reduced because of the war in Ukraine and the cost of energy.  A lot of these health and climate solutions are going to have to be very frugal because even though I\' m the biggest proponent and meeting with rich people and politicians all the time that they should do even more  we\' re not going to see some gigantic uptick in those amounts, Gates said, adding,  Really innovation and spending what aid resources there are, also increasing domestic resources, will be very necessary. Philanthropic giving to support projects that try to prevent the worst impacts of climate change represented less than 2% of all estimated philanthropic donations in 2021, though it grew faster than other categories, according to a report by ClimateWorks Foundation. In addition to making financial pledges, philanthropic foundations facilitated conversations at pavilions and side events, said Alice Amorim, project coordinator, Global Philanthropy for Climate Movement. Her organization seeks to engage philanthropies to be active on climate issues and to help them find entry points, with some 600 foundations from all over the world having joined to date.  It\' s not necessarily about the size of the pledges of the money, but its catalytic role that it can play, like providing seed money or enabling projects that corporations or governments aren't willing to back, she said. For example, some foundations help shape agreements that countries like South Africa and Indonesia are making with lenders and other nations to increase the use of renewable energy sources. Amorim also pointed to the way that philanthropic collaborations have grown from year to year with the Forests, People, Climate collaborative raising another $400 million. The collaborative is dedicated to reversing tropical deforestation in part through channeling funds to grassroots organizations. A group of foundations, including Bloomberg Philanthropies and Sequoia Climate Foundation, jointly pledged $500 million to support an equitable energy transition in low and middle-income countries, though each organization will decide where to grant its portion of the funds.  We recognize that the international community continues to fall unacceptably short of its promises for financial support to tackle climate change and its impacts,"" said Christie Ulman, President of Sequoia Climate Foundation, in a statement. ""While this investment cannot and is not intended to make up for it, we are working to support countries in addressing their challenges and commitment to a clean energy transition."" The Ikea Foundation promoted research that it says will guide its donations of $620 million (\€ 600 million), part of a pledge made at last year\' s climate summit in Glasgow to give $1.03 billion (\€ 1 billion) over five years to climate change programs. The Bezos Earth Fund disclosed it would invest $50 million in restoring degraded landscapes in two places: along the Rusizi River that runs between the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda and Burundi, and in the Great Rift Valley in Kenya. That amount is part of the $3 billion that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos first announced in Glasgow that the fund would spend on land conservation and restoration and the transformation of food systems. The fund along with the The Rockefeller Foundation and the U.S. State Department also launched a new initiative to try to connect private funds with countries seeking to phase out the use of coal through carbon credits. They hope to work with countries that already have made energy transition commitments, like South Africa and Indonesia.  What we keep on hearing from those countries is, you know, where is the help going to come from? Where is the concessional capital? Where is the grant-like capital going to come from? Dr. Joe Curtin, director of the Rockefeller Foundation's climate and power team. Retiring coal plants, which he said would likely be the focus of the mechanism, would require some investments that do not require a return, he said. The project, which U.S. climate envoy John Kerry announced last week, met resistance from some governments and civil society organizations who said further carbon credit systems have the potential to allow polluters to continue polluting. The Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley proposed another initiative to unlock financing to support energy transitions and other climate adaptation measures by altering the terms under which major international development banks offer loans. The Rockefeller Foundation also announced $11 million in grants to support agricultural projects that promote soil health, water quality and biodiversity  especially those drawing on indigenous knowledge as part of a transition away from industrial farming that relies on fossil fuel based fertilizers which generate large amounts of greenhouse gases.  This represents a real shift and a message that we need to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels in our food system, said Roy Steiner, senior vice president for the foundation's food initiative. The foundation announced $105 million in funding for health and sustainable food systems in March and these grants are a part of that commitment. A project launched by the Ikea Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation and Bezos Earth Fund at last year's COP, the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet, also signed an agreement with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to finance $1 billion in energy transition projects. ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP\' s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Environmental groups and climate activists say the industry responsible for the country's largest share of emissions should not be at an event dedicated to climate action. But that argument is being dismissed by some federal and provincial officials who argue Canada won't meet its climate goals without significant input from industry. ""What's happened, unfortunately, in the past, is sometimes climate-change goals have been set that pick a random date and a random reduction target with no technical, technological or economic means to get there, so we just missed the target and that's what's happened with the last nine climate-change targets in this country,"" Alberta environment minister Sonya Savage said. ""The resource industry absolutely has to be there, because we have to have that honest, realistic conversation of what it's going to take to get to net zero by 2050 (and) how difficult it is."" The Canadian delegation led by federal environment minister Steven Guilbeault includes a mix of parliamentarians, labour groups, Indigenous and youth representatives, and the Canada Pavilion will also host a clutch of experts, bureaucrats and delegates from non-governmental organizations (NGOs), provincial governments, crown corporations and the private sector. This year's event has attracted corporate representatives from the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), pipeline giant Enbridge Inc. and oil majors Cenovus Energy Inc. and Imperial Oil Ltd. Attendees also reported seeing a representative from Suncor Energy Inc. at the Pavilion on Tuesday. A panel presentation being hosted later this week at the pavilion by Pathways Alliance, which represents the country's six largest oilsands companies, is expected to showcase the sector's plan to slash emissions through a $16.5-billion carbon-capture and storage network in northern Alberta. Inviting oil and gas companies to the table to discuss climate solutions may be anathema to environmentalists who perceive industry involvement as mere lobbying to enable the continued production of fossil fuels. But governments are facing stark choices because of the cost of decarbonization, so they may be motivated to find a path to net zero that won't decimate an industry expected to contribute in the range of $48 billion to $50 billion in taxes and royalties to government coffers this year. ""There really is no solution without the industry. Yes, we acknowledge that we're one of Canada's largest emitters, but that's also why we're critical to the solution,"" Pathways Alliance vice-president Mark Cameron said from Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, where COP27 is being held for the next two weeks. ""The very simplistic solution is to stop production and give up 10 per cent of Canada's GDP, but the more constructive solution is, how do we use technology to maintain this industry but reduce emissions? The problem is not energy; the problem is carbon emissions."" Part of the answer, say the Pathways Alliance and other heavy-emitting sectors of Canada's economy, is making large investments in carbon-capture and storage projects and other clean technologies, ideally with direct or indirect support from governments in the form of loans, tax credits and grants. Dramatic geopolitical upheaval since the last UN climate conference, including a global energy crisis resulting from tight energy supplies and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, also hangs over COP27 . Alberta's Savage said western democracies are at risk of ceding influence and market share to authoritarian regimes with poor environmental and labour track records, pointing to comments made Monday by United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan that his country will continue to supply oil and gas for ""as long as the world needs.""

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada280","COP27's Coke sponsorship leaves bad taste with green groups","October 24, 2022 Monday 05:45 AM EST","Canadian Press","LONDON (AP)  This year\' s United Nations climate summit is brought to you by Coke. Soft drink giant Coca-Cola Co.'s sponsorship of the flagship U.N. climate conference, known as COP27 , sparked an online backlash and highlighted broader concerns about corporate lobbying and influence. The COP27 Activists slammed the company for its outsized role contributing to plastic pollution and pointed to the deal as an example of corporate  greenwash""  exaggerating climate credentials to mask polluting behaviors. An online petition calling for Coke to be removed as a sponsor has garnered more than 228,000 signatures, while hundreds of civil society groups signed an open letter demanding polluting companies be banned from bankrolling or being involved in climate talks. Coca-Cola said its participation underscores its ambitious plans to cut its emissions and clean up plastic ocean trash. Critics say corporate involvement goes against the spirit of the meetings, where tens of thousands of delegates from around the world gather to hammer out global agreements on combating climate change to stop the earth from warming to dangerous levels. This year, the focus is on how to implement promises made at previous conferences, according to the Egyptian presidency. At COP meetings,  the corporate presence is huge, of course, and it\' s a slick marketing campaign for them, said Bobby Banerjee, a management professor at City University of London\' s Bayes Business School, who has attended three times since 2011. Over the years, the meetings have evolved to resemble trade fairs, with big corporations, startups and industry groups setting up stalls and pavilions on the sidelines to lobby and schmooze  underscoring how a growing number of companies want to engage with the event, sensing commercial opportunities as climate change becomes a bigger global priority. IBM, Microsoft, Boston Consulting Group and Vodafone also have signed up as sponsors or partners but have drawn less flak for their participation than Coca-Cola. The United Nations Climate Change press office referred media inquiries to the organizers, saying it was a matter between Egypt and the company. The Egyptian presidency didn't respond to email requests for comment. U.N. Climate Change's website says it  seeks to engage in mutually beneficial partnerships with non-Party stakeholders. Georgia Elliott-Smith, a sustainability consultant and environmental activist who set up the online petition, said she's calling on the U.N. ""to stop accepting corporate sponsorship for these events, which simply isn\' t necessary, and stop enabling these major polluters to greenwash their brands, piggybacking on these really critical climate talks. Environmental groups slammed the decision to let Coca-Cola be a sponsor, saying it's one of the world\' s biggest plastic producers and top polluters. They say manufacturing plastic with petroleum emits carbon dioxide and many of the single-use bottles are sold in countries with low recycling rates, where they either end up littering oceans or are incinerated, adding more carbon emissions to the atmosphere. In a statement, Coca-Cola said it shares  the goal of eliminating waste from the ocean"" and appreciates  efforts to raise awareness about this challenge."" Packaging accounts for about a third of Coke's carbon footprint, and the company said it has  ambitious goals, including helping collect a bottle or can for every one it sells, regardless of maker, by 2030. Coca-Cola said it will partner with other businesses, civil society organizations and governments  to support cooperative action"" on plastic waste and noted that it signed joint statements in 2020 and 2022 urging U.N. member states to adopt a global treaty to tackle the problem  through a holistic, circular economy approach.""  Our support for COP27 is in line with our science-based target to reduce absolute carbon emissions 25% by 2030, and our ambition for net zero carbon emissions by 2050,"" the company said by email. Experts say sponsorships overshadow a bigger problem behind the scenes: fossil fuel companies lobbying and influencing the talks in backroom negotiations.  The real deals are handled indoors, you know, in closed rooms, said Banerjee, the management professor. At the first one he attended  COP17 in Durban, South Africa, in 2011  he tried to get into a session on carbon emissions in the mining industry, a topic he was researching.  But guess what? They turned me away, and who walks into the room to discuss, to develop global climate policy? CEOs of Rio Tinto, Shell, BP, followed by the ministers, Banerjee said, adding that a Greenpeace member behind him was also blocked.  This group of people  mining companies and politicians  are deciding on carbon emissions. Elliott-Smith, the environmental activist, attended last year's COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, as a legal observer to the negotiations. While she's not naive about corporate-political lobbying, she was  really shocked at the amount of corporates attending the conference, (and) of the open participation between CEOs and climate negotiating delegations in these conversations."" In Glasgow, retailers, tech companies and consumer goods brands were signed up as partners, but fossil fuel companies were reportedly banned by the British organizers. Still, more than 500 lobbyists linked to the industry attended, according to researchers from a group of NGOs who combed through the official accreditation list. This year, oil and gas companies might feel more welcome because Egypt is expected to spotlight the region and attract a big contingent from Middle Eastern and North African countries, whose economies and government revenue depend on pumping oil and gas. Egypt historically sided with developing countries resisting pressure to cut emissions further, which say they shouldn't have to pay the price for rich countries' historical carbon dioxide emissions. Ahead of the meeting, U.N. human rights experts and international rights groups criticized the Egyptian government's human rights track record, accusing authorities of covering up a decade of violations, including a clampdown on dissent, mass incarcerations and rollback of personal freedoms, in an attempt to burnish its international image. The country's foreign minister told The Associated Press earlier this year that there would be space for protests. Against this backdrop,  it will be that much easier to censor, prohibit or silence attempts by civil society seeking to hold the process accountable to delivering the needed outcomes, said Rachel Rose Jackson, director of climate research and policy at watchdog group Corporate Accountability. ""It will also make the polluter PR and greenwashing surrounding the talks that much more effective. ___ Follow all AP stories on climate change at HYPERLINK https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada281","As UN climate conference begins, not much good news, but room for hope","November 6, 2022 Sunday","Times Colonist (Victoria, British Columbia)","One of the five great turnarounds proposed in the recent Earth For All report to the Club of Rome is the energy turnaround. So with COP27 - the annual UN conference on climate change - opening in Egypt, this is a good time to look at this issue. Regrettably, there is not much in the way of good news, although there is still room for some hope. In a September joint report with other major UN agencies and the U.K. Met Office, the World Meteorological Organization announced that while CO2 emissions went down a bit during COVID, ""atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise,"" with the three main greenhouse gases - CO2, methane and nitrous oxide - all reaching new record highs in 2021. The report also noted preliminary data for January to May 2022 show a 1.2 per cent increase in CO2 emissions over pre-pandemic (2019) levels. This is particularly troubling given that the world is supposed to be working to reduce emissions. Unsurprisingly, current commitments by the nations of the world are not sufficient to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. For example, the Lancet Countdown - an annual report on the health impacts of climate change by The Lancet, one of the world's leading medical journals - reported ""the carbon intensity of the global energy system has decreased by less than 1 per cent"" in the 30 years since the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change was adopted. With the current policies and commitments, we will hit betweeen 2.5 and 2.8\'b0C warming by 2100, well beyond the 2\'b0C target, never mind the 1.5\'b0C target. In fact, the report found an almost 50 per cent chance that during the next five years, at least one year will exceed the 1.5\'b0C target. If all national pledges are met - which has not been happening - warming could be kept to 1.9-2.1\'b0C. The consequences of a mere 1.1\'b0C of warming are already becoming very apparent; the impacts of a rise above 1.5 or even 2\'b0C will be severe. Within the coming decades, in some parts of the world, temperatures could reach dangerous levels at which outdoor labour becomes impossible. The report notes a five-fold increase in the frequency of weather, climate and water-related disasters in the past 50 years, noting it is costing, on average, $202 million US in losses daily - that's DAILY! And as is always the case, ""the world's most vulnerable populations will suffer most, as seen in recent extreme weather events."" Then there are the health impacts. Released in late October, the Lancet Countdown report proclaimed health is ""at the mercy of fossil fuels"" and notes ""heat-related deaths [among those 65 and older] increased by 68% between 2000 and 2004 and 2017-21."" Among other things, the countdown reported, ""heat exposure led to 470 billion potential labour hours lost globally in 2021"" and the potential for the spread of diseases such as malaria and dengue fever was markedly increased, while ""every dimension of food security is being affected by climate change."" The countdown urges a ""healthcentred response,"" which would ""reduce the likelihood of the most catastrophic climate change impacts, while improving energy security, creating an opportunity for economic recovery, and offering immediate health benefits."" Those global health benefits would include preventing many of the 1-2 million annual deaths from fossil-fuel air pollution, while a shift to a more plantbased diet would prevent some 11 million deaths annually. Six of the 10 actions received a failing grade, and for two of the four where there was some progress, most of the detailed actions also earned a failing grade. So here is a challenge for our new B.C. premier, David Eby, as he takes office: Shuck off the legacy of failure bequeathed you by John Horgan and become a true climate champion by adopting a health-centred response to climate action and energy-policy. Next week, I will discuss what such a policy would look like.

First Nation leaders from Haisla, Nisga£ and Halfway River among others, will be joining Canada's official delegation and will be presenting the climate action plan they chalked out. The FNCI delegation to COP27 , consists of Darlene Hunter elected Chief of Halfway River First Nation; David Myers, technical representative, Halfway River First Nation; Candice Wilson, environmental manager, Haisla Nation; and Alex Grzybowski, Pacific resolutions facilitator at FNCI. They aim to highlight that solutions focused on restoring the balance of nature for future generations are critical to overcoming the complex challenges facing First Nations, Indigenous Peoples and society at large. The group will also look at raising awareness of how First Nations-led climate action solutions and equity are needed for a just transition to net-zero. FNCI's climate action plan, which highlights investment in nature-based solutions to address climate change impacts and ecosystem restoration, outlines seven recommendations to achieve a low carbon economy in B.C. The FNCI's suggested actions include expanding the carbon markets and investing in expanding the 500 KV northwest energy transmission grid to provide more renewable energy. They are also asking for increased tax incentives and direct government investment for demonstration projects to support the development and growth of new low-carbon and negative-emission energy systems. Fast-tracking Indigenous-led climate solution projects as well as expediting programs that enable First Nations to invest in and become major equity partners in de-carbonized projects are among some of the other recommended actions. FNCI, which was formed in 2019, recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Oct. 17. formally recognizing the upstream/downstream ecological impact of one Nation's economic development activities on another Nation's territories and way of life. The group of member Nations formally committed to working together to find solutions to these impacts. The group said they are exploring nature-based solutions on Halfway River territory to recover the capacity of ecosystems to support traditional values, while protecting and expanding carbon sinks. ""For decades, Halfway River First Nation said it has felt first-hand the devastating impacts of oil and gas projects that have been developed to meet the broader needs of society,"" the group said in a statement. To address these concerns, the FNCI Nations are creating pathways for environmental and economic reconciliation to remedy the brunt of heavy industry on their lands without receiving any of its benefits, they said. \"

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada290","Rights groups: Egypt should open civic space ahead of COP27","July 12, 2022 Tuesday 04:03 PM EST","Canadian Press","CAIRO (AP)  Several dozen organizations Tuesday called on Egypt to end its crackdown on civil society and allow people to exercise freedom of expression ahead of the Egypt-hosted U.N. summit on climate change. In a joint statement signed by 36 groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, they expressed concern that Egypt will largely keep in place its prohibition on protests during the conference in November. Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, who is also the president-designate of the next annual Conference of the Parties, told The Associated Press in a May interview that a facility is being developed next to the conference venue where demonstrations can take place. He also said activists would be given access, as is customary, to negotiations in the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh. He did not elaborate on whether protests would be allowed elsewhere. The Egyptian government effectively banned all public protests in 2013 shortly after President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, then a chief in the country's army, led the military\' s overthrow of an elected but divisive Islamist president. In the years that have followed, el-Sissi was elected president and any demonstrators that dare to take to the streets have been quickly arrested. Many have received years-long prison sentences. Authorities claim that any gathering needs their approval. In the statement, the groups also called on other countries to hold Egypt accountable to international human rights laws and standards and said they should not limit protests to a particular space.  UN member states, particularly those attending COP27 , should urge the Egyptian authorities to end limitations on freedom of assembly, association, and expression and take other meaningful steps to address concerns by civil society and ensure their safe and meaningful participation that can contribute to a successful COP27 , the statement said. In the statement, the organizations also said that the government should halt its  relentless assault on human rights defenders, civil society organizations, and the independent media, and stop using draconian laws to detain people for expressing opinions or exercising their basic rights. El-Sissi has overseen an unprecedented political crackdown, silencing critics and jailing thousands. Shortly after the military took power in 2013, a sit-in by Islamists was broken up by security forces in an operation that left hundreds dead. Since then, a handful of small protests have been met with force and their participants detained, often for months or years without a trial. Egypt is the world\' s third worst jailer of journalists, following China and Myanmar, according to a 2021 tally from the Committee to Protect Journalists, a U.S. based non-profit. \"

Thunberg also said she's boycotting the UN's 27th annual Conference of the Parties on climate change from Nov. 6 to 18 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt because it's being ""held in a tourist paradise in a country that violates many basic human rights."" Canada, on the other hand, will send a delegation headed by Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault to this annual, massive UN conference, colloquially known as COP 27 . COP 1 was held in Berlin, Germany in 1995 and since then everywhere from Paris to Bali, Copenhagen to Cancun, Doha to Marrakech and Buenos Aires to Madrid. Never has it convened in a place where the energy that powers modern civilization is actually produced - for example Fort McMurray in Alberta's Athabasca oil sands. These massive UN meetings, attended by tens of thousands of politicians, protesters, special interest groups and UN and government bureaucrats descending on the world's vacation hotspots, was appropriately mocked by British musician Matt Bellamy in 2007 as ""Private Jets for Climate Change"". That's because of the annual fly-ins by attention seeking celebrities these outdated events attract, who are oblivious to the massive carbon footprints they leave in their wake. Meanwhile, greenhouse gas emissions linked to climate change are at record levels following a brief decrease in 2020, caused not by UN conferences but by the global economic downturn in the first year of the pandemic. While the Trudeau government has pledged to reduce Canada's emissions to at least 40% below 2005 levels by 2030 and to net zero by 2050, a UN report last week said even if every nation on earth met its current commitments under the UN's Paris climate accord, the world will still be heading for catastrophic warming. Nothing meaningful will be achieved as long as the UN continues its blatant hypocrisy of demanding everyone drastically reduce their carbon footprint, except the UN.

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada293","'Bridge fuel' or climate villain? Natural gas in the spotlight as COP27 continues","November 17, 2022 Thursday 04:00 AM EST","Canadian Press","CALGARY - After long enjoying a reputation as a ""bridge fuel"" capable of helping the world achieve its climate goals, natural gas is losing some of its environmental lustre  and that has implications for Canada's energy sector. Canada is the fourth-largest global producer and sixth-largest exporter of natural gas. And with the war in Ukraine driving a global energy crisis, companies like Enbridge Inc. and TC Energy say they expect demand to grow for liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports from Canada in the coming years. But natural gas  once seen as a low-emitting fuel able to act as a stopgap until more renewable sources of energy could be developed  has been taking heat at this year's U.N. COP27 climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.  It\' s the right time to clear the air on natural gas,"" said Binnu Jeyakumar, clean electricity director for clean energy think-tank the Pembina Institute, in an interview from the COP27 climate summit, which she is attending this week. ""We as Canadians need to have a fuller view of the emissions profile of natural gas."" Canadian energy companies have long touted natural gas as a ""cleaner"" alternative, suggesting that projects like the massive LNG Canada export terminal currently under construction near Kitimat, B.C. can be part of the climate change solution by helping to displace coal-fired power generation around the globe. It's true that, when burned, natural gas produces far fewer carbon dioxide emissions than oil or coal. That means that in some cases, it has made sense for jurisdictions to move from a ""worse"" fossil fuel to a better one. For example, by converting its coal-fired power plants to natural gas, the province of Alberta has managed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions from electricity by nearly 40 million tonnes in less than a decade, a feat that has been hailed by experts as a major climate success story. But delegates at this year's climate summit are increasingly calling attention to the natural gas industry's role in the production of methane, a particularly potent greenhouse gas that leaks from natural gas pipelines and wells in the form of ""fugitive emissions"" or is released during the venting and flaring part of the natural gas extraction process. Jeyakumar said if the world is serious about its goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, then to drive greenhouse gas production down even further, the majority of electricity production going forward needs to be done through renewables.  I think the risk with viewing (natural gas) as a bridge fuel is that it could lead one to build natural gas assets, and these assets have an economic life of several decades,"" she said. ""So what this does is lock us into these assets . . . and they become stranded assets. In Sharm el-Sheikh, both Canada and the U.S. pledged to take further steps to reduce methane emissions, with Canada stating it aims to eliminate 75 per cent of methane emissions from the oil and gas sector compared with 2005 levels by 2030. But David Hughes, president of energy consultancy Global Sustainability Research Inc., said even without any LNG exports, Canada will be hard-pressed to meet its climate targets. He said once LNG Canada comes on-stream  and its full life-cycle of emissions from production and processing of the gas, pipeline transportation, liquefaction and shipping are taken into effect  it will be nearly impossible. ""It really makes it a hopeless situation,"" Hughes said. ""The amount of carbon capture and storage and so forth that you would need to do in order to meet your commitments would be huge."" Dennis McConaghy, a former executive vice-president at TransCanada Corp., now TC Energy, said he believes the current debate over natural gas needs to take into account that the world needs affordable, reliable energy. ""The minute you say you are going to decarbonize, you can demonize natural gas,"" McConaghy said in an interview. ""But the cost of trying to do this has almost gone without consideration."" McConaghy said he believes a balanced approach that mitigates the worst effects of climate change while still strategically using natural gas to maximize human well-being is the answer. ""Because to completely eliminate the production and use of all hydrocarbons is, in my view, an extraordinarily extreme view and an extreme objective,"" he said. According to the International Energy Agency, the ""golden age"" of natural gas was in the 2010s, when the U.S. was going through a large-scale phaseout of coal-fired power plants in favour of natural gas. With the climate policies that have been implemented by countries since, the IEA now says it expects the world will hit peak natural gas demand as early as the end of this decade, after which demand will begin to fall. \"

He added: ""We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator."" The 27th UN conference on climate change , known as COP27 If there were ever a summer to prove that speedily implemented decisions to drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions and the subsidies given to oil and gas, 2022's months of drought, floods and forest fires surely would convince anyone. Demands from non-G7 nations to finally receive for climate adaptation the billions of dollars promised by those wealthy industrial countries that almost singlehandedly caused the climate crisis will feature prominently at COP27 . But the hypocrisy of countries like the US and Canada that subsidise or promote new fossil fuel projects while not doing nearly enough to accelerate the production of renewable sources of energy fuel projects will also be highlighted. With the spotlight now on Africa, as COP27 is taking place there, transitioning away from oil and in particular ending new fossil fuel projects will be a key barometer of this year's conference. But are countries like the US really interested? Please see tinyurl.com/US-Africa-fossil-fuels Two other focal points will be aimed at having debt as well as loss and damage to developing countries examined. Massive debts that have grown in these countries must be rescinded, since those debilitating debts to rich countries stop them from initiating climate adaptation, including building infrastructure that can withstand the new reality of climate breakdown such as the devastation caused by flooding in Pakistan. Take a look at this summer's catastrophes through this video: tinyurl.com/climate-carnage-2022 In what is thought of as a slap in the face to social justice groups, the Egyptian dictatorship decided to arrest hundreds more people days before the convention. There are many people who are so upset that the global conference will take place in a police state that they are boycotting it. Many activists, including Greta Thunberg, will not show up, with Thunberg citing UN meetings'propensity to ""encourage gradual progress,"" which is not plausible now with the accelerating climate emergency. King Charles, another longavowed climate advocate, will not be going to the UN conference on the advice of Rishi Sunak, the new prime minister of the UK, perhaps because Sunak didn't wish to be outshone by the king's climate credentials. Billionaire Sunak, who initially said he would not be going because he had more pressing domestic matters to deal with, changed his mind after receiving massive condemnation for his statement. Justin Trudeau won't be going to Egypt either. Green MP Elizabeth May had this to say about his absence: ""No one will miss more self-congratulatory platitudes from Canada, but we'll all lament the lack of leadership. It is only critical for Justin Trudeau to attend if he is part of the solution... He could come to COP27 to set a new standard for climate leadership - cancelling the TMX pipeline, reversing the Bay du Nord decision, cancelling all fossil fuel subsidies while expanding forest protections."" Canada will instead be represented by environment minister Steven Guilbeault, joined by Catherine Stewart, the country's climate change ambassador, and Steven Kuhn, the federal government's chief negotiator for climate change. As Naomi Klein has pointed out, this world climate change summit is more than just green-washing a polluting state: it's greenwashing a police state. The entire conference's integrity is being called into question. Nobel laureates and US congress members have signed letters demanding the release of political prisoners, including Alaa Abd el-Fattah, who is on hunger strike in prison, but recently the state of terror has intensified to the extent that people are being taken off the streets and even Indigenous people of Sinai have been displaced because of the extreme paranoia of the totalitarian regime of Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. It has long been recognized that political, social and climate/biodiversity injustices hamper or stop any real progress towards climate/biodiversity protection. The Egyptian human rights crisis will clearly continue to be an impediment to the overall success of this year's summit, which is in itself another crime perpetrated upon Egyptian society. The next seven weeks will be filled with apprehension. Not only is the outcome of the climate negotiations of vital importance, but also, starting on December 3, the Montreal Convention on Biological Diversity will bring the world's nations together to try to finalize a framework for halting biodiversity loss. Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, executive secretary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, said: ""What's at stake are the fundamentals of human existence. Bio-diverse, well-balanced ecosystems provide climate moderation, fertile soil and foods, clean water, modern drugs, and the foundation of our economies... Nearly half of humanity depends directly on natural resources for livelihoods and, in many cases, their daily subsistence needs."" It's crucial to be knowledgeable about these crises. Failing to educate ourselves on these vital planetary issues will not help our children's future, and nor will ignorance contribute to democracy. The word of the year chosen by Collins English Dictionary is ""permacrisis,"" which is defined as ""an extended period of instability and insecurity, especially one resulting from a series of catastrophic events."" Certainly climate/biodiversity breakdown is playing a part here. However, doom and gloom are not conducive to getting people to act. Future articles will explore ways in which individuals can contribute to a safer and more just alternative. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2022 The Record (Sherbrooke) \"

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada299","EDITORIAL: UN climate bash merits extinction","November 12, 2022 Saturday","Toronto Sun","Every year since 1995, the United Nations has staged a huge conference, ostensibly to address climate change, that directly contradicts its message about the importance of lowering greenhouse gas emissions. That's because the tens of thousands of politicians, bureaucrats, special interest groups and protesters pouring into these annual events - including hypocritical global celebrities flying in on private jets - undermine the UN's message. While it calls for global citizens - particularly in the West - to adopt more modest lifestyles to lower their carbon footprints, these annual meetings are a monument to unnecessary conspicuous consumption. The UN's ongoing climate meeting in Sharm el-Sheik, Egypt - a seaside vacation resort - is the 27th edition of the UN's signature annual climate meeting. This year, Canada's official delegation - numbering more than 300 people - is headed by federal Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault. It's interesting to note where the UN holds these annual meetings as they always seem to end up in popular tourist destinations. Since 1995, these massive annual events have been held in Berlin, Geneva, Kyoto, Buenos Aires (twice), Bonn (four times), The Hague, Marrakech (twice), New Delhi, Milan, Montreal, Nairobi, Bali, Poznan, Copenhagen, Cancun, Durban, Doha, Warsaw, Lima, Paris, Katowice, Madrid and Glasgow. Next year, the meeting will be in Dubai. The results have been less than impressive. Global greenhouse gas emissions are at their highest level in human history. There have only been two major decreases in emissions in the modern era - in 2008 and 2020. GOLDSTEIN: Liberals said greenhouse gas emissions would drop but they're up( HYPERLINK https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/goldstein-liberals-said-greenhouse-gas-emissions-would-drop-but-theyre-up https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/goldstein-liberals-said-greenhouse-gas-emissions-would-drop-but-theyre-up ) LILLEY: Will Trudeau government stick taxpayers with $6,000 hotel rooms at UN climate conference?( HYPERLINK https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/lilley-will-the-trudeau-government-stick-taxpayers-with-6000-hotel-rooms-at-un-climate-conference https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/lilley-will-the-trudeau-government-stick-taxpayers-with-6000-hotel-rooms-at-un-climate-conference ) COP27 HYPERLINK https://torontosun.com/news/world/cop27-un-chief-tells-climate-summit-cooperate-or-perish https://torontosun.com/news/world/ HYPERLINK cop27 -un-chief-tells-climate-summit-cooperate-or-perish ) But they were caused, temporarily, by global recessions - one that started in 2008 with the subprime mortgage derivative scandal in the U.S., eventually leading to a global credit freeze - and in 2020, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. During recessions, emissions drop because there is less economic activity. People have less money to buy, grow, manufacture and transport all goods and services that use fossil fuel energy from oil, coal and natural gas. With modern-day technology, such as video and virtual conferencing, there is really no need to continue the UN's travelling climate change dog-and-pony show. The fact is these annual meetings - grandly known as the Conference of the Parties, which is why the current one in Sharm al-Sheik is called COP 27 - are political dinosaurs meriting extinction. \"

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada301","Western premiers step up defence of resources; Energy; Ottawa on 'notice': smith","October 13, 2022 Thursday","National Post's Financial Post & FP Investing (Canada)","CALGARY Canada's energy transition is at risk of becoming mired in political wrangling, as both Alberta and Saskatchewan signalled more determined resistance to federal environmental policy, seeding new uncertainty about the direction of climate policy. On her first day in office, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith fired a warning shot at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, pledging to use the courts to keep Ottawa out of provincial jurisdictions, and saying she might even attempt to counter Trudeau's policies on the floor of the next United Nations Climate Change Conference . Smith reiterated her campaign pledge to mount another legal challenge of the federal carbon tax - despite the Supreme Court of Canada upholding the levy in March 2021 - and suggested that her government won't shy away from engaging Ottawa in further battles over perceived incursions into provincial jurisdiction. ""I feel like there is a mandate to get tough with Ottawa,"" Smith, who was elected leader of the governing United Conservative Party last week, said at a press conference after she was swornin as premier. ""I know it'll be a bit of change because we've acted like a subordinate level of government, but I feel that when you are going to change a relationship, you should give notice."" Smith made the comments just hours after Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe signalled that he is also prepared to battle Ottawa over natural resources, releasing a new study decrying the economic cost of federal climate policies and pledging to defend the Prairie province's economic autonomy. Combined, the two events signalled a new level of stridency, complicating the ability of investors and executives to predict where Canadian energy policy is headed. Smith slammed the federal Liberals for failing to facilitate a deal with Germany for liquefied natural gas exports during Chancellor Olaf Scholz's visit in August, and for comments made by Trudeau that disparaged the business case for LNG exports from the East Coast. ""I do not trust that our message will get out by relying on them to deliver that message,"" Smith told reporters. ""We need to deliver it ourselves."" Smith said Alberta will send a delegation alongside the federal team headed to next month's COP27 conference in Egypt to talk about how Alberta's oil and gas sector plans to deploy carbon capture and storage technology to reduce emissions. Smith said the province should be at the table to ensure decisions are not made that will cause Alberta's energy sector to be ""transitioned out."" ""If they're not going to be constructive in helping us to meet with the German chancellor so we can get an LNG deal, or develop economic corridors with our neighbours so that we can get our products to market, we're going to have to take the lead on doing that ourselves,"" Smith said. Moe was just as strident, accusing Ottawa of continually interfering in Saskatchewan's jurisdiction over natural resources. The Saskatchewan government's study alleged that federal climate plans will cost the province $111 billion by 2035. The report points to nine federal policies - including the federal carbon tax, zero-emissions vehicle sales targets and Ottawa's plan to cut fertilizer emissions by 30 per cent - as potentially having a detrimental impact on the Saskatchewan economy. Moe's headline figure of $111 billion in economic damages has already been challenged by some economists and academics who argue that Saskatchewan's calculations fail to account for carbon tax rebates and overestimate the costs associated with Canada's new clean fuel regulations. The premier was unmoved by such criticism. Invoking language similar to that used by Smith during her leadership campaign, Moe said his government will introduce legislation to ""reaffirm"" Saskatchewan's provincial jurisdiction under the Canadian constitution. ""It's really about defending Saskatchewan's opportunity and defending our jobs,"" Moe said at an event in North Battleford, Sask. ""And pioneering a way for us to be able to ultimately have more jobs in our community, have more of an opportunity for that next generation. Moe said the federal government should be incentivizing companies to invest more in improvements to reduce emissions, rather than implementing regulations that could shrink economic activity in Canada, resulting in emissions being pushed offshore. ""We should not in any way be backing away from what we are producing here, how we are producing it,"" he said. ""We should be yelling from the rooftops that it's some of the most sustainable product available in the world."" Smith, a former leader of Alberta's Wildrose Party and a talk radio host, said she spoke to Trudeau last week about the opportunity for Canada to earn carbon credits for helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in other countries - a mechanism laid out in Article 6 of the Paris climate agreement. The new premier has echoed an argument advanced by proponents of Canadian LNG exports who say it could reduce emissions in Asia if it were used to displace coal-produced energy. ""That's going to be central in us exporting LNG and displacing higher-emitting fuels like coal and wood, and other more polluting fuels,"" Smith said. ""If we can work with our federal counterparts to be able to get that kind of credit here, and accelerate some of the expansion of our LNG, I think that those are the kind of global wins and local wins that we're looking for."" Smith also used Tuesday's press conference to walk back some of her prior rhetoric on her proposed Alberta Sovereignty Act. Previously, during her campaign for UCP leadership, Smith had said the act could give the province the power to disregard federal laws and court decisions - but on Tuesday, Smith struck a more conciliatory stance: ""When the Supreme Court makes a decision, we have to abide by that,"" she said.

As governments discuss policies, companies are bringing positive change to the marketplace by finding environmentally sustainable innovations to improve major industries. One potential innovator is Laser Photonics Corp. (NASDAQ: LASE), a company helping change the $35 billion sand and abrasive blasting market through its industrial laser technologies. Laser Photonics Corp. are integrators of low and high-power industrial fiber lasers along with its R &D department are seeking to lead the growing industrial market. Its lasers which were showcased at North Americas largest metal forming and finishing trade show have uses ranging from engraving and 3D printing to cleaning and conditioning. Through its innovation and commitment to safety, it hopes to create an industry that is more green for the environment and more protective of workers health. The company recently completed an order for the U.S. Navy that is part of a series of order completions in both the public and private sectors that are geared toward reducing waste and helping give the industry an environmentally positive future. The company delivered its CleanTech Handheld LPC-1000CTH lasers to the U.S. Navy Kings Bay Trident Refit Facility as the Navy tackles rust and corrosion of its ships and equipment. 21st-Century Solutions To Age-Old Problems Laser Photonics industrial laser products aim to provide a modern alternative to the less efficient, more pollutive, and more risky sand and abrasive blasting industry. Labor Unions, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), are waging war on unsafe industry practices as they close in around abrasive blasting methods. The EPAs guidelines on blasting put parameters around its use based on air quality, noise pollution, and waste production. OSHA has also described the significant risk to workers health associated with exposure to crystalline silica a common hazard in abrasive blasting procedures and has imposed strict rules regulating this kind of exposure. Meanwhile, Laser Photonics lasers, which frequently get the job done in half the time, produce no hazardous waste, and employ the combination of safe design and use regulations could effectively make cleaning and conditioning a fast and hassle-free procedure. This is why numerous Fortune 1000 companies are choosing Laser Photonics, which has built a strong blue-chip customer base of key players across industries. These range from Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE: DELL) and DuPont de Nemours Inc. (NYSE: DD) to Elkhart Plastics Inc., Evergreen Solar, Sony Group Corp. (NYSE: SONY), and Seagate Technology Holdings PLC (NASDAQ: STX). Laser Photonics has also seen diverse interest from government agencies, including the U.S. Army, Navy, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and Veterans Administration. We are continually working to penetrate new verticals within the U.S. government, including the DoD (Department of Defense), to demonstrate both the efficiency and financial benefits of using our technology to drive sales to new customers within the organizations, Laser Photonics CEO Wayne Tupuola said. Other companies in the industrial laser market include Coherent Corp. (NASDAQ: COHR), Lumentum Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: LITE), Novanta Inc. (NASDAQ: NOVT), and Adapt Laser.

I am sure this conference will attract a lot of participants, as COP26 in rainy, cold Glasgow, Scotland last November attracted 120 world leaders, 40,000 registered participants, 22,000 delegates, 14,000 observers, and 4,000 individuals from the media. The vast majority of those above travelled to and from Glasgow by air, the mode of travel ordinary citizens are now encouraged by governments to avoid. Any reasonable person would think that after 26 conferences some positive progress would have been made, particularly in respect of CO2 reduction in the atmosphere, which is supposedly the main driver of climate change. Unfortunately, CO2 content in the atmosphere has increased every year since the first conference and is now 62 per cent higher than it was 26 years ago. Considering western governments are imposing rules, regulations, and laws that will adversely affect their electorates'living standards, the results of the experts efforts, as described above, indicate something seriously wrong.

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada308","Canada backed last-minute bid to phase down \u8216 unabated\u8217  fossil fuels, but pledge never made it into the final COP27 text","November 25, 2022 Friday 10:03 AM EST","Canadian Press","Canada was one of more than 80 countries to call for the phasedown of unabated fossil fuels as COP27 negotiations went into overtime. Ultimately, that call did not appear in the final text of the COP27 agreement, which guides global action on climate change. Instead, the final agreement repeated a pledge from last year\' s Glasgow Climate Pact referencing the need for a  phasedown of unabated coal. But more than 80 countries pushing to name fossil fuels  not just coal  as the root of the climate crisis is significant, environmental activists say. Supportive countries were split on whether the word  unabated should be included, Canada\' s National Observer reported early this week. Using that term would still allow fossil fuel production to grow if companies used carbon capture and storage, a largely unproven technology that traps planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions during the production stage. Environmentalists, academics and climate scientists warn embracing carbon capture technology could lock-in future fossil fuel production and jeopardize climate goals.  Consistent with our Emissions Reductions Plan and net-zero policy, Canada gave our support to the position that calls for the phasing out of unabated fossil fuels, federal Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault told Canada\' s National Observer in an emailed statement.  I think it is important we address the elephant in the room. His statement acknowledged the  important role environmental non-governmental organizations played in communicating the importance of the issue and giving it prominence in the media.  Language around phasing down of fossil fuels was never presented or discussed in any of the consultation sessions I was a part of for the opening days, said Guilbeault.  It was only late on the Friday that text was presented to us verbally by the United Kingdom. Canada was not the only oil-producing nation to lend its support to the U.K.\' s position. The United States, Norway, Australia and India were also on board, with India seeking language to phase down all fossil fuels, abated or not, earlier in the conference. The world is currently on track to exceed 1.5 C of global warming, which climate scientists warn is a dangerous temperature tipping point, as early as 2030 unless emissions are halved this decade, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. If we want a shot at staying at 1.5 C or less, Canada and other wealthy fossil fuel-producing nations must stop all production by 2034, according to a report by the International Institute for Sustainable Development. Canada plans to increase fossil fuel production. If oil companies can reduce their emissions, then there\' s room for more production, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recently said at a climate conference in Ottawa. Recently, over $238 million worth of oil and gas exploration licences were greenlit by the provincial-federal regulator off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador. The federal government has already put up big bucks to help the energy sector achieve emissions reductions. Budget 2022 introduced an investment tax credit for carbon capture, utilization and storage worth up to $8.6 billion, and the federal government is expected to announce a cap on oil and gas sector emissions in the coming months that would limit pollution from the industry but not production. Canada came under fire for having fossil fuel lobbyists in its official delegation at the conference and hosting an event run by the Pathways Alliance, a group of companies operating about 95 per cent of Canada\' s oilsands production. At least 636 fossil fuel lobbyists from around the world were in attendance at COP27 , representing a 25 per cent increase from the previous year, according to analysis from Corporate Accountability, Corporate Europe Observatory and Global Witness.  I think there is a growing concern about the tactics that the fossil fuel industry has played to really oppress Indigenous people (and) communities, said Eddy P\'e9rez, international climate diplomacy manager at Climate Action Network Canada.  Civil society, both in Canada but also at these climate summits, comes with a very clear focus to raise pressure so that the Canadian government understands that going to COPs and not talking about fossil fuels is hypocrisy, said P\'e9rez. It's important to view the effort to include phasing down unabated fossil fuels in the final text as part of a broader mobilization effort, he added. P\'e9rez thinks this shows  the effort to have a global movement of countries that want to make the fossil fuel phasedown a reality  is becoming something that is inevitable. COP27  failed to deliver by remaining silent on phasing out oil and gas, but  calls from around the world for an equitable phaseout of oil, gas and coal have never been louder, Environmental Defence said in a press release. Guilbeault said the Canadian delegation  fought hard so that the world did not backslide on the commitments made to phase out unabated coal and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies from last year\' s COP in Glasgow, Scotland.  We helped prevent a backslide and kept 1.5 alive, but I am disappointed we were unable to get any further than that, he said, referring to the need to hold global warming to 1.5 C to avert the worst consequences of climate change. Canada also played an influential role in securing a loss and damage fund for vulnerable countries bearing the worst impacts of climate change, said P\'e9rez. Months before the conference, Canada adopted a  progressive position on the issue and distanced itself from the U.S. during negotiations on the fund, which P\'e9rez thinks  influenced the way in which other G7 allies shifted their positions. He said it was critical for a country like Canada to step up on this issue and thinks  Minister Guilbeault did so, and it's important that we recognize it. Despite Canada\' s  significant role on loss and damages, P\'e9rez said Canada\' s performance was not the most ambitious because we didn\' t bring much money to the table and did not present a strengthened climate plan. Next year\' s COP will take place in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, the seventh-largest oil producer in the world. In less than a month, international delegations will gather in Montreal for a parallel COP on biodiversity, an issue inextricably linked to climate change.  With files from John Woodside \"

Held in the China Pavilion on November 9, Finance Day, the event brought together GAUC members with global climate leaders including Xie Zhenhua, China's Special Envoy on Climate Change; Chrysoula Zacharopoulou, French Minister of State for Development, Francophonie and International partnerships; Inger Andersen, Executive Director, UNEP; Nick Stern, Chairman of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, LSE; and Elizabeth Yee, Executive Vice President, the Rockefeller Foundation. Xie Zhenhua, China's Special Envoy on Climate Change emphasized the importance of youth contributing to the synergistic approach to the climate problem: ""The cross section between climate change solutions and other SDG goals is the key to mankind's green revolution, which is the spirit of 'Climate X'. Now is the time to encourage more young people to join this movement and put forward innovative solutions."" During the event, youth ambassadors from GAUC unveiled a letter to global leaders on behalf of students across six continents, highlighting the need to harness the skills and drive of young people towards urgent climate action. Yenziwe Mbuyasa, GAUC's Global Youth Ambassador from Stellenbosch University said: ""The global youth have vested interests in climate action to help the world and are ready to contribute their passion, insights, intellect, and actions to protect our planet for a sustainable future."" Developed by the next generation of climate leaders, the letter calls on decision makers to honor the principles of intergenerational equity and multilateralism, and to broaden channels for young people to effectively participate in global climate governance. ""Beyond being observers and voicing out, young people are capable of making transformational changes with our wisdom and solutions."" Canyang Xie, GAUC Ambassador from Tsinghua University expressed. ""With diversified opportunities and platforms, we will strengthen our climate leadership and broaden our horizons,"" Ghilan Mara Andreea, GAUC Ambassador from London School of Economics emphasized. You can read the full letter here. The climate X event is part of GAUC's 2022 Climate x Campaign, which includes a series of events at the national, regional, and global levels, such as a Climate x Youth Leadership Training Pilot, an Africa Regional Climate Forum as well as the 2022 'Climate x' Global Youth Summit on Net-zero Future, and the Global Youth Climate Week. Michael R. Bloomberg, the UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy for Climate Ambition and Solutions and founder of Bloomberg L.P. and Bloomberg Philanthropies said, ""When it comes to tackling climate change, young people deserve a seat at the table. The Global Alliance of Universities on Climate is helping to provide that seat, while supporting their work to build a more sustainable future. We need more global and cooperative partnerships like this to accelerate our progress"". As the convening partner, Bloomberg L.P is proud to build on its successful collaboration with GAUC and to announce that it will grant 100 students from GAUC's Climate x Pilot program complimentary access to Bloomberg L.P's newly released ESG certification. The Campaign also gained support from the Rockefeller Foundation. Its Executive Vice President Elizabeth Yee said ""GAUC embodies the global effort necessary across generations and sectors to halt climate change. By connecting and supporting students globally, GAUC is preparing youth climate leaders for their future role and enabling their contribution today.""

It\' s going to be tough, said Eddy Perez, international diplomacy director at Climate Action Network Canada.

In March, the government increased oil and gas exports to Europe by 300,000 barrels a day.\~  Some in Canada believe that given the urgency of the energy security issue, the government must set aside its concerns and actions relating to climate change. Meanwhile, others believe that any production of fossil fuels even if to aid Europe in a time of crisis should not be pursued given concerns about climate impacts, Guilbeault told The Logic by email through spokesperson Katilin Power.  Neither of these extremes represent a tenable position. Canada has a duty to respond to calls for assistance from its European friends while also ensuring it continues to aggressively address the existential threat climate change poses to our planet. Guilbeault said the government will ensure energy reinforcement for Europe  accounts for and works to minimize domestic emissions and ensure any net additional emissions are incorporated into the government\' s current climate plan. Expectation: Update net-zero plans in financing portfolios Canada\' s Big Five banks signed onto the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero last year, an umbrella group meant to hold organizations across financial sectors to account on their climate pledges. The 120 members in the banking alliance are required to submit climate-change plans that meet criteria set by a UN campaign called Race to Zero. That includes pledging to reach net-zero emissions in their portfolios by 2050 or sooner and come back within 18 months with a solid plan and interim targets for how to achieve that goal.\~ Twelve months on, the Big Five\' s plans fall short of the Race to Zero parameters. Organizations agreed to contribute their  fair share to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in their financing portfolios by 50 per cent by 2030. The language leaves room for some interpretation, but it appears none of the banks come close to that goal. BMO is the only Big Five bank to include absolute emissions targets which account for the overall greenhouse gasses released by borrowers but its targets are still well below the agreed-to criteria. Plans from RBC, CIBC, Scotiabank and TD so far focus solely on emissions intensity, which reflects the amount of CO2 a borrower produces per unit of energy; not its overall emissions.\~ Some U.S. banks have HYPERLINK https://www.ft.com/content/0affebaa-c62a-49d1-9b44-b9d27f0b5600 reportedly threatened HYPERLINK https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-mark-carney-gfanz-banks/ concerns that some criteria are too restrictive particularly around phasing out fossil fuels and could put them at legal risk. Race to Zero issued a HYPERLINK https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/race-to-zero-clarifications/ letter in September clarifying that members can  independently find their own route. \~ Still, members will soon have to confront their delays in creating more robust plans around other criteria. Under the alliance, banks need to publish a progress report within a year of setting their targets. Those have to include stats on both emissions intensity and absolute emissions.\~\~ Expectation: Raise US$100 billion annually for climate mitigation and adaptation in developing countries by 2023 Reality: Canada and Germany were put in charge of wrangling US$100 billion annually from developed countries to finance climate mitigation and adaptation efforts in vulnerable regions. They were tasked with securing commitments by COP26, but missed the deadline and moved the target to 2023.\~ A progress HYPERLINK https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/canada-international-action/climate-finance/delivery-plan/progress-report-2022.html#toc1 report published on the delivery plan published last week does not disclose how much money countries have raised in the 12 months since setting the new deadline. The report does, however, indicate that demand for financing has increased.  It is abundantly clear that the global investments needed to respond to the climate change threat are much larger than US$100 billion, it reads.\~ Expectation: Strengthen climate targets to align with the Paris Agreement\' s temperature goals. Reality: Canada showed up in Glasgow with a commitment to cut emissions by 40 to 45 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030. The government agreed to return the following year with an updated plan showing how it\' s going to achieve that.\~ Just 24 countries have submitted updated climate plans to the UN since Glasgow, and Canada isn\' t one of them.\~ Although Ottawa has HYPERLINK https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/climate-plan/climate-plan-overview/emissions-reduction-2030.html produced an Emissions Reduction Plan (ERP), climate policy experts say it still falls short of its own target for reducing greenhouse gasses.  The ERP doesn\' t even reach the lower end of this range, said Caroline Brouillette, national policy manager at Climate Action Network Canada.  The projections get us to 36 per cent and it\' s not clear where an additional four per cent is found. Brouillette also criticized Ottawa\' s plan for being short on details for how it will achieve net-zero as well as other pledges it made in Glasgow. Currently, there\' s no clear way to know whether Canada is making progress on HYPERLINK https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/canada-international-action/un-climate-change-conference/cop26-summit/achievements-at-cop26.html commitments like reversing deforestation and drastically reducing methane emissions.\~  We were looking forward to the ERP being this clear and detailed work plan for the government to achieve its climate targets: Who is responsible for which policy? On what timeline? With what budget? she said.  What we have is only a very vague implementation annex. \~ Brouillette expects Canada to be scrutinized at COP27 for what she describes as an implementation gap.  As one of the largest emitters in the world Canada will have to answer to how it\' s playing its role in the context of its responsibilities, and its capacity as an industrialized country, to do more faster. \~ \"

The Biden government has yet to convince Congress or the public to spend more on climate aid through carbon credits. Now they're trying to make it easier for private corporations to send money to the developing world in exchange for looking green at home. John Kerry announced the plan at the Wednesday COP27 climate summit in Egypt. It involves tapping private funds to finance developing nations' transition to clean energy by selling 'high quality' carbon credits to companies trying to make their carbon emissions 'net zero.' Kerry said at a launch event, 'We want to put the carbon market to work, deploy otherwise idle capital, and speed the transition from dirty to clean power.' carbon credits Environmental groups and climate experts opposed the idea, saying it would encourage polluters to continue. It came a day after the U.N. warned businesses about shady carbon credits. Activists heckled Kerry as he announced the plan, accusing him of 'promoting false solutions' before security guards removed him. Poorer nations criticized wealthier nations at this year's COP summit for not funding their 'green transition.' The developed world needs hundreds of billions of dollars to ditch coal, oil, and gas, but Congress is reluctant to help. Kerry said that without more money, climate change could not be stopped. Kerry's Energy Transition Accelerator proposal is backed by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Bezos Earth Fund. They hope it will unlock $100 billion for green projects by 2030. Kerry wants it operational by next year's COP. Under the plan, verified greenhouse gas emission reductions could be sold as carbon credits. Kerry said PepsiCo and Microsoft are interested in buying them. Kerry said the credits would have 'strong safeguards' Buyers, 'not including fossil fuel companies,' need a net-zero CO2 emissions goal and a science-based interim target. The credits can't replace deep cuts to their emissions, and they only boost them. carbon credit coal power Kerry said that these carbon credits would only be allowed to phase out coal power plants in developing nations and create more renewable power. He called that £buse-proofing.' Companies, governments, and individuals who want to reduce their carbon footprint buy carbon credits. Environmental and climate activists say they're problematic because they can't guarantee reducing emissions. These activities are monetized and sold as offsets in net-zero plans. A U.N. expert panel warned on Tuesday that tougher standards are needed to fight greenwash by companies and investors making net-zero pledges, including a ban on businesses and local governments buying cheap carbon credits instead of cutting their emissions. Wednesday's proposal drew skepticism. coal power Mohamed Adow, director of a climate and energy think tank, called carbon offsets an £ccounting trick' that allows big polluters to continue polluting. Big cuts in greenhouse gas emissions in both wealthy Northern nations and developing countries in the global South are needed, Adow said, 'not rich polluting companies in the north paying to destroy the planet.' Climate scientist Bill Hare of Climate Analytics said the proposal shocked the climate summit and many governments. 'Because everyone must reduce emissions at this point in history.' John Kerry's proposal means companies don't have to reduce emissions if they buy offsets. A senior European official questioned the U.S. launch proposal. The official spoke anonymously due to the sensitivity of the topic. Micah Carpenter-Lott, the heckler, wanted to call attention to big polluters, wealthy nations' inaction, and Kerry's 'false solutions.' 'We don't need to partner with polluters,' Carpenter-Lott said after being kicked out of the U.S. pavilion. 'Polluters shouldn't be here and shouldn't be allowed to partner with governments because that won't solve the climate crisis.' \"

The climate crisis is expected to create the largest human displacement ever seen in modern history. As many as a billion could be displaced over the coming decades, as more and more people are forced to leave their homes and communities because of floods, droughts, extreme weather events, wildfires, conflict, and extreme heat. At COP27 Caroline Brouillette, national policy manager for Climate Action Canada, a coalition of more than 100 environmental groups across the country, says fighting the climate crisis is about more than reducing emissions. It's about how humanity takes care of the most vulnerable.  Migrant justice is part of climate justice.  Canada has a responsibility to contribute to international climate finance to help countries in the Global South, not only mitigate their emissions, but compensate them for losses and damages resulting from climate change, she said.  We also have a responsibility to care for people by welcoming people and granting them full human rights and a safe home. The Alliance of Small Island States has drawn up plans for a loss and damage response fund  which UN chief Ant\'f3nio Guterres advocates be funded by a windfall tax on oil and gas companies\' profits.  Canada is one of the larger emitters in the world, both per capita and in absolute terms. This is part of Canada\' s larger climate debt, Brouillette said.  The science tells us that extreme climate events are made more intense and frequent as the global temperature warms. Hazards resulting from the increasing intensity and frequency of extreme weather events, which are already causing millions to leave their homes and move to other areas within their borders, as well as neighbouring countries, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Intersectional effects of climate change on migration In 2020, more than 30 million people were internally displaced by extreme weather events. By the end of the century, the homelands of 280 million people could be permanently submerged due to rising sea levels, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate. Syed Hussan, executive director of the Migrant Workers Alliance for Change, said Canadians have a misunderstanding about climate migration.  It is completely centered around the idea of extreme weather events, which is actually the minority of what climate migration looks like. It\' s not all floods and hurricanes and typhoons. Agricultural impacts are the main driver forcing people to leave their communities, he said, such as reduced crop outcomes, livestock becoming ill and dying, and changes in agricultural practices. In Sri Lanka over the last decade, extreme weather events have seriously damaged the country\' s fisheries and agriculture, including the country\' s tea industry. People in rural areas who would normally rely on these industries have been forced to move, prompting a steady migration to urban areas and even overseas. Ishanka Ratnayake, a farmer in Sri Lanka\' s Uva province, said he\' s seen massive rains wipe out not only houses, but also the crops on which he and other farmers rely.  Farmers talk about climate change with the rain, which has become unpredictable, he said. As the farmland has deteriorated, Ratnayake has been trying to support his community through mutual aid projects.  The kind of migration we are seeing most, said Hussan, of the Migrant Workers Alliance,  is people being forced to move out of villages into towns, and out of towns into cities. Climate migration isn\' t actually this tidal wave of humanity rushing away from extreme weather events. Climate migration represents the breaking down of subsistence communities throughout the Global South, leading to hunger, desperation, and diminished resources, he said.  There\' s also conflict and war happening as a result of, and on top of, the climate emergency. Anna Triandafyllidou, a professor at Toronto Metropolitan University and the Canada Excellence Research Chair in Migration and Integration, said people who are forced to migrate often don\' t consider themselves climate migrants.  People are not often aware that environmental degradation is what\' s driving them from their homes, she said. Triandafyllidou is leading a team of 37 researchers that just received a $2.49 million grant to investigate migration systems, including environmental and climate factors. Environmental factors that cause degradation and impact production systems set off a chain reaction, she said.  It then depends on whether governments can support their people, or whether the people find solutions themselves. Hussan said climate and economic migration are almost always connected now.  Climate is not separate from the economy, which is not separate from cultural and agricultural practices.  It\' s this intricate web of capitalism, global finance, massive agri-food production. There\' s so many ways that the deterioration of ecology is forcing people to move, he said. In June, catastrophic floods hit Pakistan, putting a third of the country under water and displacing eight million people. As many as 5.7 million people will face a starvation crisis in the coming months, the Associated Press reports. Canada's ""climate debt"" Canada\' s responsibility to these countries must account for the disproportionate damage done throughout history, Hussan said.  We are talking about 150 years of greenhouse gas emissions... Canada\' s carbon footprint is massive compared to Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Brouillette and the Climate Action coalition recently wrote to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, asking him to take bold action in support of refugees and migrants fleeing the climate crisis and global conflict.  Your government has repeatedly championed the vision of Canada as a welcoming, diverse safe haven, she wrote.  The reality for many migrants, however, is still one of uncertainty, fear, and exploitation. Global climate talks started this week in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, the first such meeting to take place on the African continent. Though it\' s home to nearly a fifth of the world\' s population and the devastating impacts of climate change are being felt in each of its nations, Africa is responsible for just three per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Losses and damages to climate-vulnerable countries are on the agenda and expected to be central to discussions. A new report by the Loss and Damage Collaboration, has found that profits from just six fossil fuel companies from the first half of 2022 would be enough to offset the financial impacts of extreme weather and climate-related events in developing countries around the world. At COP27  Managed migration is really about controlling the flow of people, he said.  For Canada and the US, the discussion is largely around limiting who can enter your borders.  What needs to happen is people need to be able to stay in their homes, and not be forced to migrate in the first place. But if they do, people need equal rights wherever they arrive. \"

Then there was too much of the wrong kind. Attendees of this year's U.N. climate conference in Egypt found themselves stepping over streams of foul-smelling fluid Wednesday after a pipe or tank holding liquid waste appeared to have burst near one of the venue's main thoroughfares. The incident was the latest of several infrastructure and planning problems that have emerged this week during the conference, which runs through Nov. 18. Participants have complained that basic necessities such as drinking water and food are not available or require lengthy queuing under the simmering Sinai sun. Floors sometimes buckle and toilet paper in the various venues has frequently run out. The problems raise broader issues about planning for an event meant to help solve climate change and promote green living. Giant AC units blow cold air into vast tent-like buildings with little insulation and doors wide open. Empty rooms are brightly lit into the night. Solar panels, wind turbines or electric vehicles are hard to find. The event's Egyptian hosts didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Questions around sustainability have dogged U.N. climate meetings for years. For example, during the meeting in Katowice, Poland, in 2018, hot air had to be pumped into the prefabricated buildings to keep participants warm in sub-zero temperatures. Last year in Glasgow, Scotland, the plastic wrapping of sandwiches and drinks being stored in open refrigerated units raised eyebrows. Responding to criticism, many recent hosts have highlighted their efforts to keep the talks green, with vegan food, recycling containers and various  carbon offsets for unavoidable emissions caused by the conference. This year's meeting in Sharm el-Sheikh, a resort by the Red Sea, drew 33,449 participants at the last count, many of whom arrived by plane. \"

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada347","COP 27: Glass half full or empty?","November 22, 2022 Tuesday","The Hamilton Spectator (Ontario)","As after every climate summit, the air is filled with shouts of rage and despair. What was agreed was unclear and inadequate, and what was left undecided or simply ignored was vast and terrifying. For example, they still haven't managed to agree that the world needs to stop burning fossil fuels. What? Isn't that what this whole travelling circus is about? The climate is getting hotter because we're burning fossil fuels for energy, soon people will be dying in large numbers, in 20 or 30 years entire countries will become uninhabitable, so stop! Alternative energy sources are available! Act now, or global disaster will happen! Yes, that's what it's about, and every year tens of thousands of politicians, experts, campaigners and lobbyists trek to a different location - Glasgow last year, Sharm-al-Sheikh this year, the United Arab Emirates next year - to debate and decide how to deal with this literally existential threat. And in all those 27 years they haven't even managed to mention the name of the threat? No, they haven't. Last year, for the first time, they actually inserted the word ""coal"" into the final report - we will eventually ""phase it down"" (not ""out""), they said - but the words ""gas"" and ""oil"" are still taboo. This is what you get when a global institution is ruled by consensus. Everybody has a veto, including the coal-gas- and oil-dependent countries - and the short-term interests of some (money and rapid fossil-fueled economic growth) clash with everybody's long-term interest in not experiencing a huge population dieback and civilizational collapse. So much for the philosophy. What actually happened at Sharm-al-Sheikh? After the inevitable all-night negotiations (two all-nighters, in fact), they managed to agree on a new fund that will recompense poor countries that suffer ""loss and damage"" from extreme climate events. The money will come from the developed countries whose historic and current emissions are the reason for the damage. It should now take only two or three more years to set up the new ""loss and damage"" agency and agree on the rules for who pays how much into it each year, and exactly what qualifies as climate-related damage eligible for compensation. The biggest remaining question by far is what about China? It is still classed as a developing country and therefore automatically a victim, but actually it is a middle-income country and the world's single biggest emitter of carbon dioxide. It's bigger than all the rest of the developed countries together, and almost three times bigger than the United States. Should it be paying into the ""loss and damage"" fund, rather than claiming money from it? And how about India? It's only third in total emissions now, after the United States, but it will also probably overtake America in the next 10 years. So the titanic struggle over who pays for the climate-linked loss and damage inflicted on the poorest countries will continue, but at least the next climate summit can also focus on other things. Just as well, because stopping at the ""aspirational"" target of no more than a 1.5 C rise in average global temperature is probably a lost cause by now. The ""never-exceed"" hard target is no more than 2 C, because after that we lose control. The heating we have already caused will trigger warming ""feedbacks"" in the system that we cannot turn off, and away we go into the nightmare future. So it's good to see them getting a little more reasonable each year at these summits. There's still a very long way to go, but at least we're moving in the right direction.

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada351","The climate crisis is a rights crisis, too; COP27 presents crucial opportunity to alter path, Ketty Nivyabandi says","November 16, 2022 Wednesday","The Vancouver Sun (British Columbia)","The World Health Organization predicts that climate change will cause 250,000 deaths per year between 2030 and 2050. Those most at risk are people who already experience multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, including women and girls, racialized communities, people with disabilities and younger generations. Indigenous Peoples'rights to life, lands, territories, food systems and informed consent are also under threat in the context of climate change. This makes the climate crisis a human rights crisis, and a massive one. It's why Amnesty International is at the UN Climate Change conference ( COP27 ) this week, urging measures that are desperately needed as our world hurtles toward global warming of at least 2.5 C and the unprecedented horrors that would ensue. Avoiding that future requires all governments, especially the G20 countries responsible for more than 80 per cent of global emissions, to update their emission targets - then meet them. Amnesty International is also calling for a rapid phase out of the use and production of fossil fuels, without relying on harmful and unproven ""shortcuts"" such as carbon markets and carbon-removal mechanisms. Canada's record to date is far from reassuring. Canada is among the highest per capita CO2 emitters in the G20. Ottawa's 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan, released in March, allows for increased oil and gas production since emissions generated in countries that burn Canadian fossil fuels are not counted in Canada's emission tally. Such accounting is no solution. Canada is also the second-largest provider of public finance for fossil fuels in the G20, directing billions of dollars to support climate-wrecking oil and gas activity in Canada and abroad. This includes a loan of up to $500 million for construction in northern British Columbia of the Coastal GasLink Pipeline that is opposed by the hereditary chiefs of the Wet'suwet'en Nation, whose territory the fracked-gas pipeline will cross. Wet'suwet'en land defenders have reported threats, harassment and unjust criminalization as they seek to protect water and a spawning ground for wild salmon. Canadian authorities have failed to comply with the UN committee on the elimination of racial discrimination and remove police and security from Wet'suwet'en territory. Canada is also accountable for failing to publish a policy to deliver on its Glasgow pledge to end public financing for some international fossil fuel projects. Moreover, Canada exempted projects that use unproven carbon capture, utilization and storage technology. A serious response to climate change requires much more than this. We must end our addiction to fossil fuels. But urgency must not be an excuse for further human rights violations. There can be no greenwashing or sacrifice zones. Instead, we must heed the voices and experiences of the communities on the front lines of the climate crisis. Take the experience of the Innu people in the community of Pessamit, Que., where rising temperatures have led to reduced coastal ice and other weather changes that have severely affected the community's way of life. There are fish in the rivers, but they don't care. There are animals, but they don't care. Even if it floods the land, they don't care about humans, let alone animals."" Indigenous peoples protect 80 per cent of the world's biodiversity. They safeguard forests, fundamental to combating climate change, and they bring the knowledge needed for real solutions to climate change that go beyond lip service to localized nature-based solutions. Yet in Canada and around the world, Indigenous Peoples continue to be attacked as they seek to defend land, water, trees and a healthy environment, as well as the rights of Indigenous women, girls and gender-diverse persons threatened by megaprojects, man camps and false ""green"" solutions. COP27 is a crucial opportunity to change course. It is time to bring to the foreground the voices of Indigenous Peoples and other communities on the front lines of the climate emergency. It is time for climate action that respects and promotes states'obligations to Indigenous Peoples. Real solutions to the climate emergency - and hope for us all - are at stake.

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada358","Here are 5 things to know about COP15 and how it affects B.C","December 8, 2022 Thursday","The Vancouver Sun (British Columbia)","The world's largest biodiversity summit known as COP15 began Wednesday in Montreal. Addressing the conference, UN secretary general Ant\'f3nio Guterres said humanity has become a weapon of mass destruction and out of harmony with nature. ""Deforestation and desertification are creating wastelands of once-thriving ecosystems,"" he said. ""Our land, water and air are poisoned by chemicals and pesticides, and choked with plastics."" Over the next two weeks, delegates from 200 countries will try to find common solutions to this global ecological crisis. Here are five things to know about the conference and what it means for B.C.: A police officer rides his bike around the fenced off perimeter of the Convention Centre ahead of the COP15 UN conference on biodiversity in Montreal, Thursday, Dec. 1, 2022. 1. What is COP15 and how is it different than COP27 , which recently happened in Eqypt? About 2,000 delegates from around the world are meeting in Montreal beginning on Tuesday for COP15, a Conference of Parties that meet to discuss the Convention on Biological Diversity. It's also been called the UN biodiversity summit. The goal is to protect nature by setting a target of protecting 30 per cent of land and water by 2030. As of now, Canada protects about 13 per cent of its land and water. COP27 , the 27th United Nations Climate Change conference was held from Nov. 6 to Nov. 20, in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. The UN climate summit focussed on how the world can cut greenhouse gas emissions and boost financial aid for poor countries struggling with the impacts of the climate crisis. While the focus at COP15 in Montreal is not on climate change, the loss of biodiversity on the planet is inextricably linked to global warming. Climate change is one of the main reasons for biodiversity loss, but also the destruction of ecosystems, for example clear-cut logging of forests can accelerate climate change by removing important carbon sinks. 2. What are some of the issues being discussed at COP15? The world's last set of nature targets, the Aichi Targets, expired in 2020, so there will be an effort to reach a new global agreement. Delegates are considering 23 new targets, including one of the top goals, known as the 30 by 30 target. This goal asks countries commit to protecting 30 per of their land and sea territories by 2030. Already, more than 110 countries, including Canada, have pledged support for this goal. Other issues include banning pesticides to save at risk species such as the Monarch butterfly. A landmark UN report in 2019 found that a million species may be pushed to extinction before the end of this century, which has serious consequences for human survival. It also said three-quarters of land-based ecosystems and two-thirds of marine environments had been ""significantly"" changed by human actions, including agricultural and industrial expansions, consumption patterns and population growth. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Tuesday that this loss comes at a cost: ""A cost we measure in lost jobs, hunger, disease and deaths. A cost we measure in the estimated $3 trillion in annual losses by 2030 from ecosystem degradation. A cost we measure in higher prices for water, food and energy."" File photo of a monarch butterfly. REUTERS/Josue Gonzalez 3. How does this affect British Columbians? As Canada works toward the ambitious goal of preserving 30 per cent of its land and water by 2030, much of those conservation efforts will be in B.C., a province rich in biodiversity. UBC professor of law, policy, and sustainability David Boyd said while B.C.'s percentage of protected land (about 15 per cent) is slightly higher than the national (13 per cent,) the province still has a lot of work to do to conserve 30 per cent in eight years. ""From protecting the old growth forest, which desperately needs more protection to the coral reefs, incredible sponges and B.C.'s marine area, there's a lot of fantastic nature here that needs to be better protected,"" he said, adding he hopes that COP15 will give B.C. the nudge it needs to step up biodiversity conservation efforts. For instance, he said B.C. must ""absolutely protect"" what's left of its old growth forest. Boyd, who is also the UN special rapporteur on human rights and the environment, said the other key part of COP15 that affects B.C. is the focus on Indigenous stewardship. ""Indigenous people in B.C. have a really close relationship with the natural world. They, according to their customs and traditions, have responsibilities to take care of the land, the water and the other species. And if they do that job as they fulfill their stewardship responsibilities, that nature will in turn, take care of them and fulfill their needs,"" he said. Peter Arcese, a professor at UBC's Department of Forest and Conservation Sciences, believes B.C. can meet the 30 per cent target in eight years. He said more land that is being used for traditional logging practices will need to be conserved, while governments, First Nations, and private firms find alternative sustainable economic opportunities for the land. For example, he said more land can be set aside for recreational purposes with increased fees for parking or camping, and there should more initiatives like the one in the Great Bear Rainforest. There, First Nations have reduced the number of trees cut, and then make up the difference by selling carbon credits. Buyers use the credits to offset their own greenhouse gas emissions. 4. What is Canada doing to support Indigenous stewardship? On Wednesday, as COP15 got underway, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the federal government will spend up to $800 million to support four major Indigenous-led conservation projects across Canada, in B.C., Ontario, Northwest Territories and Nunavut. Among the projects to be funded is a marine conservation and sustainability initiative in the Great Bear Sea along British Columbia's north coast, championed by 17 First Nations in the area. Another project includes protection for boreal forests, rivers and lands across the Northwest Territories, spearheaded by 30 Indigenous governments. Funds will also go to an Inuit-led project involving waters and land in Nunavut's Qikiqtani region and to a project in western James Bay to protect the world's third largest wetland, led by the Omushkego Cree in Ontario. 5. How will countries pay for protecting nature? A draft of the deal being negotiated includes a call for slashing these so-called harmful subsidies by at least $500 billion annually from the estimated $1.8 trillion given to activities that degrade nature. It also envisions increasing both public and private sector financing to at least $200 billion per year.

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada359","Oil companies tout climate pledges; Activists at COP27 argue sector has history of broken promises","November 11, 2022 Friday","The Toronto Star","Not that many years ago, the idea of showcasing the Canadian oilsands at an international summit on climate change would have been laughable. It is just three years since green energy think tank the Pembina Institute declared the oilsands as on a ""collision course"" with this country's climate goals, and fewer than six years since Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sparked fury in Alberta by commenting in a public forum that the province's oilsands industry needs to be ""phased out"" as part of Canada's transition off fossil fuels. So the fact that representatives of the Pathways Alliance - a consortium of Canada's largest oilsands companies - are not only attending the United Nations' COP27 climate conference in Egypt this week, but scheduled to make a presentation Friday in the federal government-hosted Canada Pavilion shows just how far the industry has come in terms of its willingness to be a full-fledged partner in the fight against climate change, said Pathways president Kendall Dilling. ""Even within the last two or three years, there's been a marked shift within the industry,"" Dilling said. ""There's a recognition that there's a massive decarbonization challenge ahead of us as Canadians and globally. No one party can do that on their own, we have to be working together."" Some environmentalists have expressed their frustration over the oil and gas sector's presence at COP27 Stand.Earth's international program director Tzeporah Berman called the presence of Pathways at the Canada pavilion ""embarrassing,"" arguing in a series of tweets that the sector has a history of failed promises when it comes to the environment and climate change. It's true that Alberta's oil and gas sector is the country's largest polluter, and while oilsands companies have managed to reduce their emissions per barrel, total emissions from the oilsands have more than doubled since 2005 due to increased production. But the Pathways members - Suncor Energy Corp., Imperial Oil Ltd., Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., Cenovus Energy Inc., MEG Energy Corp. and ConocoPhillips Canada - have collectively pledged to work together to reduce the sector's absolute emissions by 22 million tonnes by 2030 and to reach net-zero by 2050. It's the first time a pledge like that has been made, and Dilling said the sector now realizes its very future depends on it. ""We've hit that TSN Turning Point, and we're moving aggressively on this,"" Dilling said. ""And it's not even because of regulation. It's because the financial community is demanding it of us, our insurers are demanding it, the public writ large is demanding it of us."" The key plank in the Pathways plan is a proposed carbon capture and storage network in northern Alberta, which could see member companies invest $16.5 billion before 2030. The group is also planning an additional $7.6-billion investment in other major emissions reduction projects and technologies, including hydrogen development and steam reduction. Pathways hasn't yet committed to pulling the trigger on that headline carbon capture project and a growing chorus of voices has been calling for industry to move faster with its climate pledges - especially given the record profits energy companies have been earning in 2022. Dilling acknowledged the criticism but said the decision to go ahead can't be made until regulatory approval for the project is granted, a milestone that's at least two years out. ""We're sort of in that awkward position right now where people are saying we're not spending enough, and we're saying we're doing everything we possibly can to advance this project,"" he said. ""We're spending tens and hundreds of millions, and that will soon become billions, but that ramp-up takes a couple years."" Pathways is also still in negotiations with the federal and provincial government. While the federal government has already created an investment tax credit for carbon capture that will help to offset capital costs of the Pathways proposal, its members are also requesting support with ongoing operating costs. In the meantime, close to 500 people - member company employees as well as contractors - are working full-time for Pathways, pushing ahead with environmental and engineering work to ensure the carbon capture project can be ready to go as soon as possible. ""We're certainly not sitting on our laurels,"" Dilling said. ""We're doing everything we can to ensure all this front-end work is progressing so that when we finally get these final pieces nailed down, we're not already behind."" With a tight time frame and a long list of hurdles to clear, the emissions reduction challenge facing the oilsands is daunting, to say the least, Dilling said. ""But I also genuinely believe, in the depths of my soul, that we just need to show really positive constructive progress,"" he added. ""Do we get this done by 2030, or by 2031? I don't know that the world is going to judge us on that. I think they're going to judge us by whether we're actually doing this. Are we putting steel in the ground? That's our mantra now at Pathways. ""Let's shift from policy to projects, and get steel in the ground."" The Canadian Press \"

First Nations delegation at COP27 presents its strategy at world event","November 17, 2022 Thursday","The Vancouver Sun (British Columbia)","A delegation of B.C. First Nations attending the United Nations climate conference in Egypt this week said that even though Indigenous people around the world are on the front lines of climate change, they remain an ""afterthought"" in government plans to address the crisis. The delegates, which include leaders of the First Nations Climate Initiative, were invited to present their climate action plan at the Canada Pavilion at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt on Tuesday. The plan includes seven proposals that were presented to the provincial and federal governments in September to help First Nations achieve decarbonization and decolonization. In a media briefing from Egypt on Wednesday morning, Hugh Braker with the First Nations Summit said Indigenous people around the world stand to lose ""their culture, their traditions, their way of life"" due to climate change. Braker said a ""catastrophe appears to be descending"" and referenced the recent wildfires and flooding in B.C. ""Once again the governments of the world are gathering to talk about climate change,"" he said. ""Once again the governments of the world don't seem to understand or appreciate the impacts of climate change on Indigenous people. We seem to be an afterthought at best."" Braker urged governments to pay more attention to the plight of Indigenous people: ""We have nowhere to go. This is our homeland."" Terry Teegee, regional chief of the B.C. Assembly of First Nations, said securing funding for climate disasters has proven challenging. ""We have a climate change strategy ... but the issue of climate change is much more than just a strategy,"" he said. ""It's also getting proper resources and capacity to deal with the change of climate, and in particular funding for many of these disasters that we've experienced."" Teegee said he's pushing for a First Nations climate fund that could help First Nations deal with climate change issues and emergencies. Judy Wilson, a member of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs executive, said it feels like the world is at a ""critical junction"" and must work together to meet and maintain emissions targets. In B.C., selling more gas and reducing emissions ""don't go hand in hand,"" she said. Taylor Behn-Tsakoza, a member of the Assembly of First Nations youth council, said the record number of Indigenous attendees at the global conference made her feel hopeful. ""I think what keeps me going and keeps me hopeful is knowing that our people are here in these spaces despite all the challenges we face,"" she said. This year marks the 27th Conference of the Parties. The parties are the 198 nations, including Canada, that agreed to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada373","Canadian senator aims at financial backing of fossil fuels","November 9, 2022","Yukon News","T he United Nations climate change conference , COP27 , has begun in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. In the lead-up to the conference, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report revealed  a litany of broken climate promises by governments and corporations.  It is a file of shame, cataloguing the empty pledges that put us firmly on track toward an unlivable world, he said. Canada is high on the list of empty pledges. The government\' s COP26 commitment to reduce carbon emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2030  enacted by the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act  is not only seen as an inadequate target, it\' s also been sharply criticized for lacking the necessary action to meet its commitments. That\' s deservedly so, given its poor track record in meeting past targets. A report commissioned by the International Institute for Sustainable Development has found that high-income countries like Canada must cut oil and gas output by 74 per cent by 2030 and end production by 2034 to keep global warming within 1.5 C. And yet Canada\' s national energy regulator anticipates oil production will keep increasing until 2040 and decline only slightly after that. Financing oil production Despite the proliferation of climate-related disasters across Canada and around the globe, the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau bought  and continues to guarantee  bank financing of the Trans Mountain pipeline. It will carry oilsands bitumen to the West Coast. The federal government also approved the Bay du Nord oil development project off the coast of Newfoundland, which aims to double oil production by 2030. The Coastal GasLink pipeline across Northern British Columbia is also supported by government money. Governments have turned a blind eye to the role of financial institutions that are responsible for the lion\' s share of money pumped into the Canadian fossil fuel industry. The Big Five banks  RBC, TD, Scotiabank, BMO and CIBC  are among the 20 largest funders of fossil fuels globally and have loaned or invested more than $900 million in fossil fuels since the 2015 Paris Agreement. Roughly 20 per cent of their directors also serve on the boards of fossil fuel companies. Sun Life and Manulife Insurance together hold almost $20 billion worth of investments in coal companies. Despite touting their questionable sustainable financing credentials, Canada\' s major financial institutions have only committed to reducing the carbon intensity of their fossil fuel clients\' activities. They have yet to commit to reducing absolute emissions. In the public sector, Export Development Canada provides oil and gas companies with considerable financing, loan guarantees and insurance. Canadian and Qu\'e9bec pension plans hold billions of dollars in fossil fuel investments. While the Qu\'e9bec plan  CDPQ  has committed to divest from oil producers by the end of 2022, the Canada Pension Plan continues to explicitly rule out divestment. Senator proposes real climate action Amid this sea of hypocrisy, delusion and denialism   Blah blah blah, in the words of climate activist Greta Thunberg  there are a few bright spots in Canadian Parliament. One resides in the Senate. Independent Qu\'e9bec Sen. Rosa Galvez, one of Canada\' s foremost experts in pollution control, was a professor of environmental engineering at Laval University for more than 25 years before being appointed to the Senate in 2016 by Trudeau. Galvez has called for ambitious and coherent government intervention to address the risks that financial institutions pose to climate and to shield financial institutions from system failure. She\' s called out conflicts of interest by bank directors who concurrently serve on fossil fuel corporate boards, alleging earlier this year: It\' s just a big family  In March 2022, Galvez tabled Bill S-243, the Climate Aligned Finance Act, aimed at holding governments and financial institutions to account for their actions. She outlined her legislation in a keynote speech at the Group of 78 conference in September. The act would:-Hold corporate directors, officers and administrators accountable for meeting the companies\' climate commitments.-Mandate corporate climate action plans and targets with annual progress reports.-Ensure that boards have the necessary climate expertise and ensure no conflicts of interest exist.-Align existing laws for the relevant government organizations to climate priorities, including requiring the federal supervisor, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI), to mandate climate targets. Facing pushback A recent report examining the carbon footprint of banks is calling for the adoption of the Climate Aligned Finance Act as soon as possible. However, it faces major pushback from financial and fossil fuel corporations and from politicians and senior government officials. To stand a chance of becoming law, it will require aggressive advocacy by climate-committed citizens\' groups and politicians at all levels of government. If successful, it would be an important step toward phasing out fossil fuel production in Canada in line with scientific and UN warnings. The Trudeau government\' s climate incrementalism doesn\' t inspire optimism. The record of most provincial governments inspires even less. The rise of authoritarian populism accompanied by climate denialism within a large segment of the Conservative base presents an even more disturbing roadblock to effective action on climate change. In the 1930s, philosopher Antonio Gramsci wrote of  the pessimism of the intellect, the optimism of the will, contrasting his pessimistic analysis of the present with hope for the future. With planetary survival in peril, voices like Galvez\' s offer some optimism. But she\' ll need Canadians to rally around her proposals  and fast.

And over the coming days, a group of Canadian researchers hopes to persuade the world that the ocean has a crucial role to play in fighting climate change. Prof. Anya Waite is leading a delegation from Dalhousie University's Ocean Frontier Institute to attend the 27th annual Conference of the Parties of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change  better known as COP27  in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, starting Sunday. They plan to share ways the deep blue carbon sink acts as a buffer and impacts climate forecasts. Waite said most people know that rainforests are the lungs of the planet, keeping temperatures down and filtering the air. ""But oceans hold more carbon than all the rainforests on Earth,"" she said in an interview. ""And deep blue carbon is carbon that's held by the deep blue sea. So the open ocean, the high seas, which go down to 4000 meters in depth  they hold most of the carbon on Earth. And that's something people really aren't aware of."" Scientists must understand the role oceans have played to date in mitigating climate change, she said, noting it's also important for coastal communities to know how they must adapt to shifting conditions. Oceans have absorbed 90 per cent of the earth's heat emissions so far, Waite said. She credits oceans for the fact the world has not yet blown through the goals set out in the Paris Agreement, the international climate pact that pledged to limit warming to below two degrees Celsius and curb it to 1.5 if possible. But there is a danger that these carbon sinks will turn to emitters as the waters warm, melting caps of frozen methane and other greenhouse gases that lie scattered on the sea floor, she said. ""The capacity of the ocean to absorb carbon is gently declining,"" Waite said. ""But then on top of that we're seeing that there's these  extreme events or rare events that can potentially release carbon in short notice. And we don't really understand those."" Scientists and communities are beginning to understand the importance of common shoreline features such as marshes, kelp forests and sea grass meadows that keep blue carbon rooted in the soil, she said. Waite said such ""blue carbon ecosystems"" help retain emissions, in addition to enhancing biodiversity. But it is further offshore that the biggest carbon stores are to be found, she said. Changes in ocean temperatures also change water currents, she noted, adding melting glaciers from the Arctic put fresh water into the ocean and force marine animals to either relocate or adapt to their changed environments. The endangered North Atlantic right whale, for instance, has moved from the Gulf of Maine it used to call home into the Gulf of St. Lawrence. ""There's a whole lot more shipping in the St. Lawrence, and those animals are now coming in contact with ships way more often, bringing an already endangered species to the brink of collapse,"" Waite said. Shifts in ocean circulation and temperatures also change animal behaviour, sometimes causing them to move in search of more comfortable environs that ultimately put them at greater risk. Canada is uniquely positioned to tap into the ocean's potential benefits, Waite said, noting the country is surrounded by wide open spaces of water on three sides. But though Canada has the luxury of using the deep blue to balance its carbon output, she said the issue has received limited attention and financial resources so far. ""Climate change is essentially a multi-billion dollar problem. And yet to observe and care for the oceans costs, way less than that,"" she said. ""So a small investment can bring an enormous benefit for humankind. The problem we have is that the ocean is sort of out of sight, out of mind.""

"COP27","Canada","COP27_Canada377","Students get hands-on education making nunavik documentary","November 2, 2022 Wednesday","The Gazette (Montreal)","When Aphrodite Salas left her CTV reporting job four years ago and became an assistant professor in Concordia University's journalism department, she was determined that she wouldn't be spending time in class pontificating about her career, and instead would get her students into the field for a hands-on reality check about the work. In addition to teaching, her goal was to undertake research projects, with a focus on climate change and Indigenous affairs. Her first effort entailed taking five students to the Gull Bay First Nation community, 200 kilometres north of Thunder Bay, to shoot the award-winning 10-minute documentary From Shore to Sky: A Reconciliation Story, on the plight of community residents dealing with constant flooding and power issues. The pandemic prevented Salas from getting her class into the field for a couple of years. But with restrictions lifted a little, she set off last November with three students on a 1,500-kilometre trip to the village of Inukjuak in Nunavik to start making the documentary Innavik: Leading the Way to a Clean Energy Future, about a game-changing hydroelectric power project. The doc, shot on three iPhones, makes its world premi\'e8re Wednesday at Inukjuak's Uquutaq High School and will be launched on the CTV Montreal website Thursday. It will also be screened next week at the Canada Pavilion of COP27 (the United Nations Climate Change Conference ) in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. While in Inukjuak, the team also produced Simeonie Nalukturuk: In His Own Words, a moving short documentary about the recently deceased community leader and residential school survivor. It, too, will be presented at the high school and on the CTV website. After decades of diesel being relied on to power the community, this hydroelectric facility - 16 years in the planning and making - is scheduled to be up and running in the spring. The project, a $125-million partnership between Inukjuak's Pituvik Landholding Corporation and the Quebec renewable energy company Innergex, will result in massive per capita greenhouse gas reductions. There will even be excess power, which will be sold to Hydro-Qu\'e9bec. ""The point of this program is twofold: to report on these incredible stories of climate leadership we're seeing in Indigenous communities, and also to respond to Call to Action 86 from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission,"" says Salas. ""This is about bridge-building and creating space for new kinds of journalism partnerships, about exploring conciliatory journalism. ""We know that generations of journalists have caused great harm by using negative Indigenous stereotypes and by parachuting in and out of communities, practising extractive journalism. As a journalism educator, I asked myself how I could respond to this, both in learning about how to report during times of social polarization and to teach my students. As a non-Indigenous person, I have lots to learn and approach this work with humility, and I can encourage each of my students to do so as well."" Prior to embarking on this mission, Salas's students Luca Caruso-Moro, Virginie Ann and Kaaria Quash did two years of prep. They were all instructed by Indigenous journalist Willow Fiddler on Indigenous reporting. They were also schooled on Inukjuak's history by community members. ""The idea is to speak with the people from the communities many times before we go,"" Salas says. ""There is a lot of preparation that goes into this. It's not just a field trip. It can't be seen as that, or else we risk doing journalism in the same wrong way. It's all about developing relationships."" One of the relationships Salas and her students have developed is with Inukjuak resident Sarah Lisa Kasudluak, president of the Pituvik Landholding Corporation and one of the pivotal players behind the hydroelectric project. ""We are so proud that we have been able to help put together this hydroelectric facility that will result in our community being transformed from one of the most polluted to one of the most green in the country,"" Kasudluak says. ""Not only will we be getting away from being reliant on diesel and being able to power our community cleanly, we'll also be providing jobs and be selling some of our energy to Hydro-Qu\'e9bec. ""In the process, we are showing the world that this can be done in a small community like ours. Our community leaders had long looked into ways to get our high unemployment rate down, how to bring in more jobs and how to get our community self-sufficient, so they started looking into new ways of bringing in energy and making it clean."" They had tinkered with the idea of windmills, but rejected that concept for reasons including what would have been the loss of land. Then they started researching the possibilities of creating hydro energy and looked into finding the perfect partner to make it happen. ""It's a wonderful and liberating story about creating clean energy,"" says Kasudluak, the first woman to head the Pituvik Landholding Corporation. ""For thousands of years, my ancestors were always resourceful. Nothing was wasted, and this is just a modern way of not wasting energy. They would be so thrilled with this project."" ""And this is just the beginning of the story,"" Salas adds. ""We hope to be there as it continues to evolve."" mailto:bbbrownstein@postmedia.com twitter.com/billbrownstein !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2022 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved. \"

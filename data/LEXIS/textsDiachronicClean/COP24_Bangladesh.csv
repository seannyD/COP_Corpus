"COP24","Bangladesh","COP24_Bangladesh1","COP24: Strong words, weak actions","December 26, 2018 Wednesday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Dec. 26 -- After two weeks of tension-filled discussions, the Katowice Climate Change Conference, mostly known as COP24 concluded on Saturday evening. In two weeks the delegates focused on outlining strategies for a common ""Rulebook"" for all nations that will govern the basics of how countries cut their emissions, provide finance to vulnerable countries and ensure that all countries are doing as promised.It is estimated that, nearly 23,000 delegates from all over the globe descended on the coal-tinged city and finally secured an agreement on a range of measures that will make the Paris climate pact operational in 2020.The agreement concerned the starting of a new international climate regime under which, all parties will have to report the status of their emissions and progress in cutting them every two years from 2024.At the end of the first week, many expressed frustration and disappointment when the US, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait objected to the conference ""welcoming"" the IPCC report which was launched last October on the impacts of a temperature rise of 1.5C. The report said that the world is now completely off track, heading more towards a global temperature increase of about 3C, inevitably leading to upheavals and a global climatic collapse. Saudi Arabia had fought strongly in Korea to limit the conclusions of the document and finally they gave in. But it now seems that they have brought their objections to Poland. Most of the parties felt that acknowledging the science was critical at this conference.The outcome incorporated hints at the need for more ambitious climate pledges before 2020. NGOs and CSOs representatives were disappointed at the absence of more forceful language. Yet, poor countries won the assurances that rich ones would help pay for their efforts to curb their greenhouse-gas emissions and to adapt to rising sea-levels, droughts, floods, storms and other climate-induced disasters. Meanwhile, new research released at the COP showed that global emissions were going up, not down. The Talanoa Dialogue concluded at COP24 with an appeal to update the climate pledges and increase finance flows particularly for developing or vulnerable countries to tackle the adverse impacts of climate change. However, the conclusions of this year-long process are only ""noted"" in the final decision text, and parties are ""invited"" to look at them. The issue of imposing legal binding for triggering climate change has long been rejected by richer countries. A stalemate between Brazil and other countries over the rules for monitoring carbon credits threatened to derail the discussions. Brazil was suggesting a weaker set of rules on carbon markets, in spite of facing a strong disagreement from many other nations. These talks have now been postponed to next year.One of the most striking things about this Katowice conference was the active participation of energized youth groups in far greater numbers particularly, in numerous side-events. Hosting COP 24 at Katowice, the home of Poland's coal miners, was meant to signify the transition from an old, dirty world to a new, clean one.During the conference, technical progress was made but thousands of people on the street didn't demonstrate for a rulebook, rather they demanded ambitious climate protection. We have more to do but we can move forward now, as the negotiators in Katowice have finally secured an agreement on a variety of measures that will make the Paris climate agreement operational in 2020 which is believed to ensure that countries will keep their promises to cut emissions.In this context, technical talks will continue as governments are yet to prepare for next year's conference in Chile. If and its successors want to make a long-term impact and have a realistic evaluation of global conditions, they must prevail on narrow conceptual enthusiasm and adopt specific actions.Researcher, Centre for Climate Change and Environmental Research (C3ER), BRAC University HYPERLINK mailto:marjan.nur@bracu.ac.bdmarjan.nur@bracu.ac.bdPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

"COP24","Bangladesh","COP24_Bangladesh6","COP24 and greater awareness of climate change","December 11, 2018 Tuesday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Dec. 11 -- The UN Climate Change Conference (COP24) began on December 03 at Katowice, Poland. It is scheduled to continue till December 14. This conference is an important bridge between the Paris conference (COP21) and another to be held in 2020, when all the signatory countries would need to revise their climate commitments upwards.There was a lot of expectation for actions following the Paris conference. In reality, no significant achievements were made during this period.So, what can be expected from COP24?As the world leaders have said at the conference, dealing with climate change is the world's biggest challenge right now for the future survival of mankind. Frequencies of different natural disasters and catastrophic events like floods, cyclones, wildfires, heavy rainfall, extreme cold or warm temperature etc. are increasing across the globe. Numerous initiatives taken to minimise global temperature and reduce climate change consequences are not having an impact. This is leading to more deaths, increasing financial losses in damaged crops, houses and properties and causing displacement of population, with every passing year.There is still a glimmer of hope from the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), which estimated in its recent report that it is still possible to maintain an under 1.5C of global temperature increase till 2100.Additionally, many development banks have claimed that they are bringing about changes to their dimensions of investing in projects. For example, the World Bank has set an objective to support 28 per cent of projects, aimed at ensuring climate co-benefits by 2020. The organisation's achievements have already exceeded its target and now stand at the 32 per cent mark.Considering the different level of outcomes from all the conferences, the agenda is still focused at the strong commitment by leaders and following through on them. The experts at the ongoing conference have said that enough strategies were decided in the previous years. But immediate and radical actions were yet to be taken by the respective stakeholders in order to restrict global warming to 1.5C. Even the countries, who had committed to decrease their carbon emission at COP21, have pushed the world on a path that will suffer more than 3C of global warming from now till the end of this century.Only 16 signatories out of more than 150 of the Paris Agreement are executing their commitments, according to recent information. Unfortunately, none of the steps are coming from the biggest emitters. So, the reality of ""actionable"" commitments is a great concern in making agendas for ongoing and future meetings.The commitments by countries in COP21 could be localised among citizens of the signatory countries. Awareness of citizens about the commitments by their leaders can force the latter to take significant actions.So, more awareness about climate action should be emphasised upon at COP24, where the governments need to negotiate about the so-called rulebook applied in the Paris Agreement. As there is still no common framework for measuring greenhouse gas emissions, the following areas can be considered as common platform to reduce global warming, especially in the high carbon emitter countries.The awareness mechanism can lead to:1. PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF GREEN ENERGY: For example, an energy-saving bulb usually consumes five times less energy than the consumption of a normal bulb. Encouraging the use of such power-saving products can play a significant role.2. CHANGES IN HUMAN BEHAVIOUR AND ATTITUDE: Changes in human behaviour and attitude can also help. For example, many people forget to switch off lights and fans after leaving a room. This accounts for 20 to 40 per cent of regular consumption of power. If such carelessness can be addressed, then less power will be consumed. Similarly the wastage of water, fuel and other resources can also be addressed in this manner.3. NATURAL AIR CONDITIONERS: Green energy can be used to heat and cool rather than using air conditioners and other electrical devices.4. CUTTING DOWN ON ELECTRICAL DEVICE AND GADGET USE6. DEVELOPING ZERO WASTE STRATEGIES in all organisations, especially at the time of product choice and its end use.7. GRADUALLY DEVELOPING PAPERLESS WORK ENVIRONMENT: Most paper being used is manufactured from trees. The cutting down of trees is also contributing to climate change. Paperless offices can address this problem.8. CHANGING AGRICULTURE PATTERN AND FOOD CONSUMPTION HABIT: Arable farming is better for the global climate than the traditional form of farming.Finally, it is important to raise the voice for a common platform that would reduce greenhouse gas sources along with identifying practical gas reduction techniques. COP24 must ensure that the momentum of the climate-change initiatives taken by countries increase and this continues till 2020 and beyond.Polin Kumar Saha is Senior Research Associate and sustainability professional at BRAC Research and Evaluation Division.

"COP24","Bangladesh","COP24_Bangladesh7","Roadmap to Paris Agreement","December 20, 2018 Thursday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Dec. 20 -- Three years on since the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015, more than 23,000 delegates from across world came together at the 2018 United Nations (UN) Climate Change 24th Conference of Parties (COP24) in Katowice of Poland. The conference that continued from December 02 to 15 had one aim: to finalise the rulebook for implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change.Three years earlier, at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) held in Paris, France, the agreement's language was negotiated by representatives of 196 state parties. As of November 2018, 195 UNFCCC members have signed the agreement, while 184 have become party to it. The Paris Agreement's long-term goal is to keep the increase in global average temperature to well below 02 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius, as this would substantially reduce the risks and effects of climate change. The world would need to achieve zero emissions sometime between 2030 and 2050 in order to achieve the 1.5 degree Celsius goal.At COP24ActNow.bot, an innovative campaign by the UN was created with the support of Facebook and advertising company Grey. The campaign harnesses the progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) with social media messaging to engage people in the growing movement of taking climate action. The campaign was launched on December 04.In an address at the opening session of COP24, renowned naturalist and media personality Sir David Attenborough spoke for ""The People's Seat"" initiative. He called it the result of new activism shaped by people from around the world and collected through social media. The collective actions taken through the initiative will be presented during the Secretary-General's Climate Summit in New York in September 2019.Also, at the conference, international home furnishing business IKEA showcased the ways through which people can be inspired and enabled to live within the limits of the planet, and how to take climate action for a greener and a cleaner world.A special report, titled ""Health and Climate Change"" and launched by the World Health Organisation (WHO) during , revealed that burning fossil fuels is not only heating up the planet, but also polluting clean air. In the process, around 07 million people in the world are dying every year. This is also leading to losses in the form of welfare costs worth $5.11 trillion. The report also presented recommendations for policymakers to mitigate the multifaceted impacts of a changing global climate on human health.Dr. Diarmid Campbell-Lendrum, the lead author of the special report and Team Leader, Climate Change and Health at WHO said that the sources of air pollution are the same as those of greenhouse gas emissions which are driving climate change. Hence steps to protect the climate will also pay for themselves in terms of health benefits.Research has shown that what the world is experiencing now is just the beginning of what global warming will mean for our planet. A study released this August predicts that heat wave mortality rates will skyrocket in coming years.A lot of hope was riding on the COP24 summit as climate change consequences are becoming severe around the world with every passing year. In 2017, carbon dioxide levels were the highest that they have been in 3-5 million years. As a result, 2017 was the second-hottest year globally since 1880. Additionally, 18 out of the 19 warmest years on record have happened since 2000.A recent UN report found that global emissions of CO2 in 2017 were 53.5 gigatons (a gigaton is 1 billion tons), the most ever released into the atmosphere, representing an increase of more than one per cent over 2016 emissions.Global emissions are increasing with every passing year causing extreme weather events. The brunt of these consequences is being faced by developing and least developed countries.A World Bank report revealed that Bangladesh saw around 234,000 deaths, including 80,000 in urban areas, due to environmental pollution and related health risks in 2015.Additionally, Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change disasters including floods, river erosion, droughts, cyclones and more.The Bangladesh government is trying to address this issue in its national policy and has a national action plan on Short-lived Climate Pollutants (SLCP). Moreover, the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP) 2009 may be updated this year. Also, the 1992 environment policy, updated in 2018, shows the linkages between air pollution and climate change. Now it is focussing on transitioning to clean energy.IPCC says by 2050, around 50 million people will migrate because of climate change. Due to riverbank erosion, people are already forced to migrate from their places of origin to other places in Bangladesh. Major rivers like Jamuna, Ganges and Padma has already eaten up around 1,590 square kilometres of floodplains rendering 1.6 million people homeless since 1973, according to Centre for Environmental and Geographic Information Services in 2009.Around 4.7 million people were displaced between 2008 till 2014 due to natural disasters in Bangladesh, according to 2015 estimation by Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre.It is imperative for the developed countries of the world to consider the consequences being faced by countries like Bangladesh because of climate change. They should act responsibly and aim towards taking climate actions under the new international climate regime.Tarequl Islam Munna is aconservator of wildlifeand environment.

"COP24","Bangladesh","COP24_Bangladesh9","Climate change: Meaningful action elusive","December 16, 2018 Sunday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Dec. 16 -- Divisions among the governments in favour of real actions to address the issue of global climate change have been putting obstructions to work out effective action plans to reduce Green House Gas (GHG) emissions. This division has surfaced at the 24th Conference of Parties (COP24) under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which began in Katowice, the century-old coal miner's town in Poland, on December 02.The Guardian reports (December 11, 2018) that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report produced by scientists following the Paris Climate Summit in 2015 invited fierce debate in the COP24 on the findings on global temperature rise between 1.5 and 2.0 celsius. Most of the country representatives remained in favour to 'welcome' the report and to restrict fossil fuel use and promote greater role of renewable energy. But the four major oil producing and exporting nations - the USA, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait - insisted that the study should merely be ""noted"".The Donald Trump administration had earlier decided that it no longer wanted to be part of the Paris Climate Agreement (which was signed by 193 countries in 2015). Many observers consider that the Trump administration not only wants to withdraw from the Paris climate deal but to prevent any progress on the deal. Vanuatu's Foreign Minister, Ralph Regenvanu, while speaking at the COP24 stated that the United States and other high carbondioxide-emitting developed countries had deliberately tried to frustrate the UN climate summit in Katowice, Poland. The US administration preferred so far not to comment on such remarks. On the other hand, Australian government's position is that 'fossil fuels can be used as efficiently and cleanly as the use of emission free nuclear energy'. Practically, Australia and the host Poland have reaffirmed their commitment to coal and supported US position.Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary General, strongly criticised the position of the four major oil producing countries that have been refusing to ""welcome"" the IPCC special report on 1.5C global warming, and termed the rejection as indefensible. In his statement Mr. Guterres said, ""We're running out of time...To waste this opportunity would compromise our last best chance to stop runaway climate change. It would not only be immoral, it would be suicidal."" He further added, ""The IPCC special report is a stark acknowledgment of what the consequences of global warming beyond 1.5 degrees will mean for billions of people around the world, especially those who call small island states home. This is not good news, but we cannot afford to ignore it.""The COP24COP 24. Unless drastic measures are taken to reduce carbon dioxide and other Green House Gas (GHS) emissions by the world community, scientists consider that hundreds of thousands of people living in the low lying islands and in the coastal areas will be forced to leave their homes and loose livelihoods within next few decades due to global warming and sea level rises.A study by researchers at the US Geological Survey (USGS), the Delters Institute in the Netherlands and Hawaii University, found that many small islands in the Pacific and Indian Oceans would be uninhabitable for humans by the middle of this century due to rapid sea level rise.Drastic GHG emission reductions may help to cope with the race to reverse the rapid rate of global warming by 2030 through de-carbonisation of electricity production and improving energy efficiency in different sectors such as transportation and manufacturing industries. It further requires technological innovations and unprecedented adjustments in society's behaviour and lifestyle. Unfortunately, the major contributors of GHG emissions in the atmosphere prefer little meaningful action but want to continue the debate on the impacts of climate changes.Mushfiqur Rahman, a miningengineer, writes on energy andenvironment issues.

GCF itself has received only USD $ 7.0 billion so far while the pledged figure was $100 billion.To ensure transparency of financing under the Paris Agreement, a 'transparency framework' under Article 13 has been proposed.As this framework does not have any legal binding, a doubt has arisen whether the target set by the Paris Agreement would be achieved, he said.Funding ratio of adaptation to mitigation was supposed to be 50:50; but only 32 per cent of the approved amount has been allocated for adaptation so far, he added.TIB, however, placed eight proposals for the LDCs for consideration in the COP-24, which include 'finance must be in the form of grant not loan or other form'.'Polluters Pay (Compensation) Principle' should be considered in defining the climate finance that recognises only public grants instead of loan, it proposed.

"COP24","Bangladesh","COP24_Bangladesh12","For climate safety, call in the engineers","December 25, 2018 Tuesday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Dec. 25 -- This month's United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP24) in Katowice, Poland succeeded in producing a rulebook to implement the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Every UN member state signed on. But that will not be enough to head off climate catastrophe. It's time to call in the engineers.The diplomatic success at COP24 was remarkable, given relentless lobbying and foot-dragging by the fossil-fuel industry. The diplomats have read the science and know the truth: without a rapid move to a zero-carbon global energy system by mid-century, humanity will be in grave peril. In recent years, millions of people have suffered the hardships of extreme heatwaves, droughts, flood surges, powerful hurricanes, and devastating forest fires, because the Earth's temperature is already 1.1Celsius (roughly 2 Fahrenheit) above the pre-industrial average. If warming exceeds 1.5C or 2C later this century - temperatures never experienced in the entire 10,000-year history of human civilization - the world will become vastly more dangerous.The Paris accord commits national governments to keep temperatures ""well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and [to pursue] efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels."" We now have a rulebook for measuring greenhouse-gas emissions, sharing know-how, and measuring financial transfers from rich to poor countries. Yet we still lack the plans for shifting the world energy system to renewable energy by mid-century.The diplomats, of course, are not technical experts. The next stage needs the world's engineering experts on power generation and transmission, electric vehicles, hydrogen fuel cells, artificial intelligence for energy systems management, urban design for energy efficiency and public transport, and related specialists. Diplomats, rather than engineers, have been at the forefront at UN climate summits for the past 24 years. The time for engineers to take centre stage has arrived.The Paris accord assumes that each government consults with its own country's engineers to devise a national energy strategy, with each of the 193 UN member states essentially producing a separate plan. That approach reflects a deep misunderstanding of how the global energy transition must work. We need solutions that are agreed and coordinated at the international scale, not country by country.Global engineering systems require global coordination. Consider civil aviation, a triumph of globally coordinated engineering. In 2017, there were 41.8 million flights without a single fatal passenger jet accident.The transition to renewable energy can be greatly accelerated if the world's governments finally bring the engineers to the fore. Consider that in May 1961, President John F. Kennedy called on Americans to land a man on the moon and return him safely to Earth before the end of the decade. NASA quickly mobilised hundreds of thousands of engineers and other experts, and completed the moonshot in July 1969, meeting JFK's remarkably ambitious timel"

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is hosting the two-week conference when the global leaders will try to reach a consensus to adopt a Rulebook for implementing the Paris Agreement.A draft of the Rulebook was prepared in COP22 and COP23 with a view to approving in the COP24. There are still some issues in which opinion differs, but all the stakeholders are optimistic about reaching a meeting of minds for approving and adopting the Rulebook. A senior representative of Bangladesh delegation informed the Energy and Power that it would not be possible to launch initiatives by different countries for implementing the Paris Agreement from 2020 through amending and adjusting laws and regulations unless the Rulebook is approved in 2018.Meanwhile, the progress of mobilizing the necessary fund, Green Climate Fund (GCF) of US$ 100 billion, to implement the agreement is so far being considered to be frustrating, which has aggravated further following the USA\' s pulling out of the agreement.The Paris Agreement was adopted in COP21 to replace the Kyoto Protocol (KP) -- a legally binding emission reduction commitment by the developed nations. The then number one emitter, USA, never ratified the KP and rendered it virtually ineffective despite the fact that the European Union lived up to its reduction commitment. The developing countries, including major emitters like China, India, Brazil and South Africa, were exempted.Finally, the Paris Agreement was adopted under which all countries pledged to comply with their submitted Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to bring down the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius or well below 2 degrees C. The developed countries, which are expected to lead the process, will focus more on the review and transparency mechanisms to ensure compliance to the submitted NDCs by the developing countries.The countries have already submitted what they need to do for controlling the GHG emission, finalizing their respective NDC. The Rulebook would ensure the features of NDC and would prescribe the information and accounting process. A tracking framework for monitoring performance of achievement of NDC envisaged targets would also be embodied in the Rulebook. The provision of stocktaking of NDC after every five years will also be there. Monitoring of NDC implementation would start under a framework from 2023. A compliance mechanism would be finalized, approved and adopted. A committee would monitor the implementation.According to a provision, the developed countries would provide required financial supports to developing countries for contributing to limit the global warming.

""We have been bearing the brunt of disproportionate impact of climate change despite being a low carbon-emitting country.""The Paris agreement vowed to limit global temperature rises to under two degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) and to the safer cap of 1.5C if at all possible.For this, richer nations must provide funding--$100 billion per year by 2020 -- to steer developing countries towards greener energy while drastically drawing down their own emissions.But developing nations have complained that richer states-responsible for the vast majority of historic fossil fuel use-aren't doing enough to help them adapt to our warming planet.""We feel as if we have been penalised for the mistakes we never made,"" said Bhandari. ""It is incumbent on the international community to ensure that justice is done.""Trust in the Paris process has been hit by US President Donald Trump's decision to renege on his country's commitment, and there are fears the political will to act is waning as negotiations drag on.Not a single G20 nation sent a top-level representative to the COP on Monday.With just one degree Celsius of warming so far, Earth is already being subjected to raging forest fires, flooding and superstorms made worse by rising seas.A string of UN reports have sounded the alarm: levels of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere are the highest in 3.0 million years and the last four years were the four hottest in history.In October a team of more than 90 independent scientists said mankind must reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by half within the next 12 years to avoid heat rises that could tear at the fabric of society.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned nations that their plan to chart a route away from runaway global warming was ""way off course"".Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

With clear benefits to people and natural ecosystems, limiting global warming to 1.5\'b0C compared to 2\'b0C could go hand in hand with ensuring a more sustainable and equitable society, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said recently.The special report on global warming of 1.5\'b0C was approved by the IPCC in Incheon, Republic of Korea. It will be a key scientific input into the Katowice Climate Change Conference in Poland in December when governments would review the Paris Agreement to tackle climate change. With more than 6,000 scientific references cited and the dedicated contribution of thousands of expert and government reviewers worldwide, this important report testifies to the breadth and policy relevance of the IPCC, said Hoesung Lee, Chair of the IPCC.Ninety-one authors and review editors from 40 countries prepared the IPCC report in response to an invitation from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) when it adopted the Paris Agreement in 2015.The report\' s full name is Global Warming of 1.5\'b0C, an IPCC special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5\'b0C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty. One of the key messages that comes out very strongly from this report is that we are already seeing the consequences of 1\'b0C of global warming through more extreme weather, rising sea levels and diminishing Arctic sea ice, among other changes, said Panmao Zhai, Co-Chair of IPCC Working Group I.The report highlights a number of climate impacts that could be avoided by limiting global warming to 1.5\'b0C compared to 2\'b0C, or more. For instance, by 2100, global sea level rise would be 10 cm lower with global warming of 1.5\'b0C compared with 2\'b0C.

So, majority of the people in surveyed 14 unions like Kapilmuni, Raruli, Koyra Sadar and Morrelganj Sadar were not getting access to the bank's services, he added.A total of 490 households were surveyed under the study.However, the research showed that Dhaka saw most of the internal migration followed by Khulna, Chattogram, Gopalganj, Feni, Jessore, Barishal and Bagerhat.Ahmed Munirus Saleheen, additional secretary at the Ministry of Expatriates' Welfare and Overseas Employment, said climate change became a reality for Bangladesh.So, they would give priority to the overseas job seekers from the climate change-affected areas, he added.OKUP Chairman Shalirul Islam said the government should address the huge internal migration taking place due to the climate change.In last 30 years, Bangladesh had been hit by more than 100 tropical cyclones and 60 flash floods. The coastal zones of Bangladesh are especially susceptible to climate change-srelated hazards, according to the OKUP study paper.Rights activists said on Monday Bangladesh needed to build climate resilience, as the recently held CoP-24 negotiation hardly yielded any positive outcome for the most vulnerable countries (MVCs).They also said the outcome of , held on December 01-14 in Poland, was frustrating and hardly incompatible with the Paris Agreement.The Civil Society Organisation (CSO) representatives expressed these opinions at a press conference, held at National Press Club in the capital.They also criticised the proposed 'Paris Rule Book', as it ignored interest of the MVCs.There is no specific decision and text regarding reducing global temperature up to 1.5 degree Celsius, financing, displacement, and loss and damage, which were the key points of demand of the MVCs. M Rezaul Karim Chowdhury, chief moderator of EquityBD, moderated the press conference, and Syed Aminul Hoque of the same organisation presented the keynote paper.Mr Aminul Hoque said, ""The outcome of CoP-24 negotiation is frustrating, and there is hardly any particular text in the proposed 'Paris Rule Book' on financial commitment, technology and capacity building issues for the vulnerable countries."" He also condemned the developed countries for backtracking from their commitment to provide these supports.The refusal of the developed countries to take the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report would seriously undermine the implementation of Paris Agreement. In fact, it would further aggravate the sufferings of the MVCs, he added.Mr Rezaul Karim opined that the country's leaders should be more serious about the environmental issues in future, and political parties should also state their position in this regard in their election manifesto.

Such a dynamics has had a functional imperative in developed countries. At the same time, this equation has led to the general assumption that greater use of hydrocarbons and fossil fuels is contributing to heating of the atmosphere and subsequently leading to climate variability.This has led the world to seek alternatives through the creation and use of renewable energy - in the form of solar energy, bio-gas, bio-fuel and wind energy.This functional approach has gained momentum over the last two decades and a half.

Two reasons - market and transparency - would hinder achieving the target of limiting the global warming at 1.5 degree Celsius.Dr. Saleemul Huq, Director, International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD), explained how the Katowice, Poland conference fell short of the expectation despite adopting the Paris Rulebook. In an exclusive interview with Energy and Power Editor Mollah Amzad Hossain, he also spoke about how the differences could be removed in the upcoming events.How would you evaluate the Paris Rulebook finally adopted in Katowice, Poland?Designing the rulebook was the main issue in the COP24, aiming to establish different measurement reporting and verification (MRV) for implementation of different articles of the Paris Agreement like the issues of mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage, financing and forestry. We have been successful in almost all the cases, barring one or two issues market and transparency that we had to postpone. In number, I would say we have been 90% successful with regard to the rulebook. However, I think, the climate change issue has become a very important issue in 2018, for which only the technical agreement or rulebook is not enough mainly because of the two reasons. First, the scientists showed clearly the dangers of limiting temperature at 1.5 degree Celsius in the IPCC special report. Apparently it seems that 0.5 degree difference from 2.0 degree target is not a very big deal. But it\' s not a small issue either.It\' s a big deal because at 2.0 degree the damages would be much higher than that of the 1.5 degree. Not only the poor countries, but also many rich countries would also be affected. So, it has become very important issue now to set the target at 1.5 degree. I think, it is difficult but possible to do. To achieve this target, dependence on fossil fuel should be reduced as soon as possible and convert those into 100% renewables. The deadl"

This 36-page report comprehensively examines the scope and causes of climate displacement across Bangladesh. Drawing on extensive fieldwork, the report highlights that climate displacement is not just a phenomenon to be addressed at some point in the future, it is a crisis that is unfolding across Bangladesh now. Sea-level rise and tropical cyclones in coastal areas, as well as flooding and riverbank erosion in mainland areas, are already resulting in the loss of homes, land and property and leading to mass displacement. Further, all of the natural hazards that are causing displacement are expected to increase in both frequency and intensity as a result of climate change - almost inevitably leading to the displacement of many millions more across Bangladesh. This report comprehensively examines current and future causes of climate displacement in Bangladesh. The report also examines existing and proposed Government and civil society policies and programmes intended to provide solutions to climate displacement. The report highlights a number of protection gaps in the response of both the Government of Bangladesh and the international community to the plight of climate displaced persons. The report emphasizes that rights-based solutions, in particular, housing, land and property rights solutions must be utilised as the basis for solving this crisis. The report concludes by proposing a number of concrete recommendations that could be utilized to provide solutions to climate displacement.""The situation in Bangladesh reveals that the problem of climate displacement is a present. one signaling future uncertainties. The government of Bangladesh and that of other poor countries have been urged upon to take heed of the climate displacement nightmare unfolding to add to humanitarian crisis.All national governments have been directed to make best use of the funds that may be placed at their disposals. Local bureaucracies and other implementing agencies must be sensitized to make best use of the fund keeping an arm's length from fuzzy governance.The effects of climate change may cause large-scale human displacement.. The global project intervention t must address the problem of climate change displacement. The focus of th global project intervention is contained in a proposal for a convention for climate change displaced persons (CCDPs). The convention would establish an international regime for the provision of pre-emptive, adaptive assistance to those likely to be displaced by the devastation caused by climate change.The green climate fund is intended to help climate vulnerable countries to fight out global warming. Launched at a UN climate conference at Durban, in December 2011 the green fund is to 'channel up Dollar 100 billion a year by 2020 in aid of poor, vulnerable countries to adapt to climate change and cut emissions.Earmarking funds from the recently agreed green climate fund(GCF) of the Durban climate meet (2011) has happened to be 'one concrete means by which the international community could ensure that the displaced people in Bangladesh receives their fair share of the funds required to deal with the consequence of climate change'The United NationsClimate Change ConferenceThe Chief US negotiator Todd Stern said: 'Obviously the package is not going to solve climate change by itself, but I think it is a big step forward.' 'In a key area, the agreement set up a 'Green Climate Fund' to administer assistance to poor nations, which many experts say are already suffering more floods and drought as temperatures steadily mount'. 'The green climate fund is intended to raise and disburse dollar 100 a year by 2020 to protect poor nations against climate impacts and assist them with low carbon development.'Worst victims in Bangladesh are expected to get formal support from major players in the climate negotiations Bangladesh, which tops a Global Climate Risk Index published during the Copenhagen talks, strongly backs an extension of the Kyoto Protocol, as the only existing binding instrument on emission cuts, rather than creation of an entirely new climate deal.Bangladesh is also urging rich nations to contribute at least US$100 billion for a global fund to help poor nations adapt to climate change. Britain, meanwhile, is the first country to contribute 75 million pounds for creation of Bangladesh's own multi-donor trust fund for climate change adaptation.The small island states have threatened to boycott the conference. These states including African union have been organized into three alliances each expressing common views about limiting temperature to not more than one degree Celsius. They demanded compensation package for the victims. Human rights activists in various countries demanded climate justice and fair deal, heavy compensation package even immigration of the climate displaced people from poor and vulnerable countries.The situation in Bangladesh reveals that the problem of climate displacement is a present one signaling future uncertainties. The government of Bangladesh and that of other poor countries have been urged upon to take heed of the climate displacement nightmare unfolding to add to humanitarian crisis.Bangladesh is a country badly affected by natural calamities caused by climate change. Flood is an annual affair. Tornado with tidal surge wreck havoc in coastal areas rendering much shelter less.

A chatbot is a computer programme designed to simulate conversation with human users over the internet. ActNow.Bot uses the Facebook messenger platform to speak with users based anywhere across the world, about the ways through which they can take personal action that will contribute in the global fight against climate change.If any user opens the chatbot, it takes him or her to a chatbox where the user is given the following message, ""you have the power to tackle climate change.

"COP24","Bangladesh","COP24_Bangladesh42","Bangladesh 7th most affected countries due to extreme weather events: Report","December 5, 2018 Wednesday","United News of Bangladesh","Bangladesh is the seventh most affected country in the world due to 'extreme weather events' over the last 20 years from 1998 -2017, says a new global report.The other top nine affected countries are Puerto Rico (1), Honduras (2), Myanmar (3), Haiti (4), the Philippines (5), Nicaragua (6), Pakistan (8), Vietnam (9) and Dominica (10), according to Global Climate Risk Index 2019 released in Poland on Wednesday.Of the 10 most affected countries and territories (1998-2017), eight were developing countries in the low-income or lower-middle income country group, one was classified as an upper-middle income country (Dominica) and one an advanced economy generating high income (Puerto Rico).Bangladesh's climate risk ranking is 9th in 2017 against 13th position in 2016.The report says massive rainfalls have led to floods across Nepal, Bangladesh and India, which affected more than 40 million people.Some 1 200 people lost their lives in these three countries and millions were displaced throughout the region.The floods spread across the foothills of the Himalayas and brought landslides leaving tens of thousands of houses and vast areas of farmland and roads destroyed.Nepal experienced flashfloods and landslides in August across the southern border, amounting to US$ 600 million in damages.Nearly 250 people were killed by collapsed buildings or drowning in regions of India, Nepal and Bangladesh. 950, 000 houses were damaged or destroyed in the floods.Puerto Rico, Sri Lanka and Dominica were at the top of the list of the most affected countries in 2017.Between 1998 and 2017, Puerto Rico, Honduras and Myanmar were the countries most affected by extreme weather events.Altogether, more than 526 000 people died as a direct result of more than 11 500 extreme weather events; and losses between 1998 and 2017 amounted to around US$ 3.47 trillion (in Purchasing Power Parities).Storms and their direct implications - precipitation, floods and landslides - were one major cause of damage in 2017. Of the ten most affected countries in 2017, four were hit by tropical cyclones.Recent science has found a clear link between climate change and record-breaking precipitation of 2017's hurricanes.It also suggests that the number of severe tropical cyclones will increase with every tenth of a degree in global average temperature rise.In many cases, single exceptional disasters have such a strong impact that the countries and territories concerned are also ranked high in the long-term index.Over the last few years another category of countries has been gaining relevance - countries like Haiti, the Philippines and Pakistan that are recurrently affected by catastrophes continuously rank among the most affected countries both in the long-term index and in the index for the respective year.The Climate Summit in Katowice should adopt the 'rulebook' needed for the implementation of the Paris Agreement, including the global adaptation goal and adaptation communication guidel"
"COP24","Bangladesh","COP24_Bangladesh43","Climate action: Seeds of hope for 2019","January 20, 2019 Sunday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Jan. 20 -- 2018 was a big year for climate change. The release of the groundbreaking IPCC report last October sent jolts throughout policy circles and civil society, confronting us with the latest scientific information on the widespread impacts to the planet if we failed to drastically cut CO2 emissions. And the European Commission committed to reach net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050, a major step forward and a first on the global level.Public concern of the climate situation grew throughout 2018, as Europe's summer temperatures broke records, and wildfires ravaged California. The fall and winter months followed with climate marches taking place across Europe, gathering tens of thousands of citizens demanding loud and clear much stronger, quicker, climate ambition. This growing public momentum was palpable at last month's COP. Embodying this impetus, 15-year old Swedish youth activist Greta Thunberg memorably called out the passivity of global leaders, warning them that: ""Change is coming"", whether they are part of it or not. Another 2018 trend that gives some reason for optimism has been the greater involvement of the private sector, with several companies and private sector coalitions taking active steps to reduce their carbon footprint. Danish shipping industry giant Maersk for example committed last month to having carbon neutral vessels by 2030. Over 500 companies, including Ikea and Unilever, have committed to align their greenhouse gas emissions with the Paris Agreement targets. These commitments have been helped by the decreasing costs of solar and wind, and other renewables technologies. And from a policy perspective the year culminated in the release of the European Commission's long-term climate plan in November, which laid out several scenarios to reach net zero emissions by 2050.The European Commission will unveil its long-awaited strategy for a ""climate-neutral Europe"" later on Wednesday (28 November), in an effort to show EU countries how to stick to the goals of the Paris Agreement. The commitment of achieving net-zero emissions was a first for climate action within the global community. The strategy rightfully espoused the massive benefits of reaching this target, ranging from the euro 170bn estimated savings in health cost, to the euro 2-3 trillion which could be saved in fossil fuel imports.While this policy impetus in Brussels did not translate into greater ambition from the global community at last month's UN Climate Change Conference COP24, seeds of hope were nevertheless planted to make 2019 a potentially good year in the fight against climate change.But to make 2019 a successful climate year, EU member states will have to take on board the lessons learned in 2018. While there is a growing recognition of the need for climate action, last year taught us that for a sustainable long-term energy transition to be effective, the roadmap to get there needs to be inclusive and citizen-driven. The 'gilets jaunes' movement that has been rocking France for the last couple of months has reminded us that policy actions need to be supported by a continuous conversation with citizens, and a regular evaluation of the possible effects of said policy on the different sections of society. This will be particularly important in light of the necessary phase-out of coal power, which will affect mining communities across Europe. Protests against high fuel prices in France have propelled climate policy to the forefront of the political debate, just days before Poland hosts the UN's annual conference on climate change, with a focus on the ""just transition"" to low-carbon energy.The year 2019 will provide member states with important opportunities for such citizen-inclusive climate action and ""just transition"". Over the course of 2019, member states will be finalising their final national energy and climate plans (NECPs), but they also need in parallel to produce their national long-term strategy. Both should align with the EU's long-term climate strategy target of net-zero emissions by 2050. In this process, it is required of national governments to ""ensure that the public is given early and effective opportunities to participate in and to be consulted on the long term climate plan and the short-term preparation of the integrated national energy and climate plans"".(Imke Lubbeke is head of climate and energy at the WWF European policy office).Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

"COP24","Bangladesh","COP24_Bangladesh44","Challenge of feeding a warming world","December 24, 2018 Monday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Dec. 24 -- Agan Soyan Hassan and her six children lost everything, including their home and livestock as flood waters engulfed their village of Ranranle in south-east Ethiopia. Wading through water for four grueling hours, they reached higher ground with a mere plastic sheet for shelter. To feed her family, Hassan and her children had to depend on relatives and neighbors for their survival. This family is not the only one to have suffered such a fate. Climate variability and extremes are pushing millions of people into severe food insecurity.This year, the world has again watched extreme weather tear apart communities across the globe. These impacts used to be viewed as a threat to future generations. No longer. Climate change is super-charging droughts, heat waves, floods, and wildfires that are destroying lives, property, and livelihoods. Crucially for those of us working in development and humanitarian aid, climate change is piling stresses on small-scale agriculture, serving to exacerbate hunger around the world.The latest report on the global state of food security finds that hunger is on the rise, with the number of undernourished people increasing to nearly 821 million in 2017, returning to levels from a decade ago. Alongside conflict and economic slowdown, the report attributes this rise to extreme climate events.The frequency of these events has been rising and will continue to do so as global warming continues. The number of extreme weather events has more than doubled since the early 1990s, with an average of 213 occurring each year in the past decade.Those most vulnerable to climate-related hazards are the world's 2.5 billion small-scale farmers, herders, fishers, and forest-dependent communities. They often lack the resources to rebound from extreme events that can cause a total loss of livelihood assets, while also facing more insidious challenges: gradually changing and more erratic weather patterns that reduce crop yields, increase the risk of harvest failure and food price swings, and make it more difficult for people to meet their food needs for the entire year.Each degree of warming matters. In October, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its landmark report on the impacts of 1.5 degree Celsius of warming, as opposed to the 2 degree Celsius limit that forms the basis of the Paris climate agreement.It is unequivocal. The IPCC report finds that ""overall, food security is expected to be reduced at 2degC of global warming compared to 1.5degC, owing to projected impacts of climate change and extreme weather on yields, crop nutrient content, livestock, fisheries and aquaculture and land use."" Harvests of maize and wheat will be lower with temperature increases between 1 degree Celsius and 2 degrees Celsius, as well. For example, global maize production is projected to fall by 10 percent with a warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius, and 15 percent with a warming of 2.0 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial averages. Two degrees of temperature rise could push an additional 189 million people into food insecurity. Four degrees warmer could increase that number to 1.8 billion.As humanitarians, our efforts need to focus on the protection of the most vulnerable. Even if we were to stop producing greenhouse gas emissions tomorrow, the inertia in the climate system guarantees that we remain burdened with decades of negative impacts. We need to help governments and vulnerable communities prepare for less predictable weather and more frequent extreme events while strengthening the resilience of those most at risk.In parallel to strengthening our ability to absorb unavoidable shocks through humanitarian assistance, we need to capitalize on our skills in risk monitoring and early warning to act before people are plunged into a food crisis. We can provide information to governments, farmers and vulnerable communities that allow them to plan ahead, reduce crop losses and use a better understanding of the climate system to inform policies, planning and investment decisions. Building on this, we can ensure that complementary structures and mechanisms are available to cover the most catastrophic risks - such as weather-index insurance, forecast-based financing, and shock-responsive social protection systems.Climate change will, without a doubt, continue to place additional pressures on global food security and development. We can and must apply our humanitarian principles, skill sets, and experience to protect the world's most vulnerable from its impacts. What humanitarian actors require on this journey are predictable, long-term investments that can accompany our humanitarian programs with a complementary effort in risk reduction, risk transfer, and forecast-based early action. Without such a twin-track approach, there is little chance that the world can achieve zero hunger by 2030.Echoing the words of Sir David Attenborough from his recent address at COP24, we are facing ""our greatest threat in thousands of years."" Climate change is no longer a vague future concern. For many communities from the Americas to Africa to Asia, it is already a grim reality.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

"COP24","Bangladesh","COP24_Bangladesh46","Renewable Surge in India: Implications for Regional Cooperation","June 30, 2018 Saturday","Energy & Power","India showed huge courage to accept bold commitment to address the problem of climate change, probably beyond its means. India\' s INDC include reduction in the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33 to 35 percent by 2030 from 2005 level and to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent through additional forest and tree-cover by 2030.India\' s INDC also builds on its goal of installing 175 gigawatts (GW) of renewable power capacity (100GW from solar alone) by 2022 by setting a new target to increase its share of non-fossil-based power capacity from 30 percent today to about 40 percent by 2030 (with the help of international support).But even before the Paris Agreement, India adopted the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission which is an initiative of the government of India with active participation of the state governments to promote solar power in order to address the issues of climate change and energy security. The mission is one of several such initiatives that are part of the National Action Plan on Climate Change. The mission was launched by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on 11 January 2010 with a target of 20GW of generation capacity by 2022 which was later increased to 100 GW of generation capacity by the NarendraModi government in 2015. Given this, increasing the share of non-fossil fuel from 30 percent today to 40 percent by 2030 does not seem to be ambitious. But nobody is complaining as the 2022 target is extremely ambitious, given that the world\' s entire installed solar power capacity was 181 GW in 2014.India increased its solar power generation capacity by nearly 5 times from 2,650 MW on 26 May 2014 to 12,288.83 MW on 31 March 2017. The country added 5,525.98 MW in the year 2016-17 alone, the highest of any year. While the 100GW is a high target by any standard, the achievement of 201617 has raised the hope that the target is achievable. The Indian target of 100GW of solar installed capacity in 2022 may not be achieved, but what India has achieved was unimaginable even a couple of years ago. Solar power generation cost in India is now competitive with cost of coal-based power generation. In terms of cost of generation, at Rs 2.44 (without storage), solar power is now competing with coal-based power and many stakeholders feel that days of coal-based power are numbered. This is a transformative change as even a few years back nobody could imagine that solar power will be able to compete with coal in near future.But this success can also bring with it some challenges. India is already surplus in electricity which is predominantly coal-based. However, creation of solar capacity would also mean that it will still need coal-based power to deal with its peak-demand that occurs at night when solar power is not available. This is likely as solar capacity is going up but no progress is seen in creation of storage capacity. Once capacity is created, solar power capacity can be offered at very low cost if the market is competitive as the variable cost of solar power generation is very low.Solar operates at a nominal cost as no fuel cost is involved and maintenance cost is the only operational cost.To boost electricity demand as well as reducing emission intensity of the transport sector and reduce local pollution, India is emphasising on electric mobility. While this will not reduce emission intensity of the transportation as long as the electric grid remains coal dependent, it will make the transport sector ready for emission reduction as and when the grid is able to reduce its coal dependence. While it is not very clear as to how the demand peak will be impacted due to adoption of electric vehicles, in the absence of public charging facilities, charging load may also peak at night, at least in the short run. This might make India\' s peak demand even higher, which in the absence of storage capacity will make India\' s grid management particularly difficult.Much before India could think of a major initiative for solar power, it was wind power that generated the renewable energy hope in India. The Indian wind energy sector has an installed capacity of 32,380.18 MW (as on March 31, 2017). Currently, India is a major player in the global wind energy market, and it is ranked 5th in the world, in terms of installed capacity. The government has set a target of 60MW generation capacity by 2022. Considering the past achievements, reaching this target seems to be easier than reaching the solar target. Moreover, the levelized tariff of wind power reached a record low of 2.43 (3.7\£2 US) per kWh (without any direct or indirect subsidies) during auctions for wind projects in December 2017. Even a few months back, there was a feeling that wind power may not be able to compete with solar power, and hence, might take a backseat in India\' s quest for renewable energy. But this has given a new hope that wind power is here to stay.Overall, the achievements in wind power may be considered to have made transformative impacts. While wind power does not regularity in variability in the sense that air will flow necessarily more at night or something like that, further adoption of wind power will add to variability.While coal has been providing the base load of the power sector in India, in the changed scenario, the base load might have come from renewable and coalbased power might require adjusting to the situation. But a huge disruption in the power market of India can be expected. Since the variable cost of solar and wind power is low, they might undercut price when the supply is more which is expected to be in day time. So if the neighboring countries are prepared to buy power from India during day time, they can buy at substantial discount. Undoubtedly, what they buy might partly come from coal power but it will also encourage India to investment more in renewable which might make the regional power mix less emission intensive.The high cost of the storage system, mostly to be a battery-based setup, would raise the solar electricity cost to the consumer say to Rs 10 per kwh. In such a case, coal-fired power plants will be more competitive with the green-energy. This will push India's coal-plant electricity to compete with solar during the off-peak period in the day, say, at Re 1.But as the night sets in, it would raise prices to as high as Rs 10, as solar without storage would no longer be in competition, or with storage system be offered at around Rs 10. Comparatively, coal-fired power plants cost is Rs 2 and above and it faces rising coal prices as well as environmental issues.India's coal-fired plants also lack the flexibility of shutting during the off-peak period.They are old and designed to operate 24/7, which compels the operators to run at full capacity and compete on prices in marketplace. While some flexibilization has already taken place, building a coal-fired plant with flexibility to shut and restart will take a long time, and it is an option not in l"
"COP24","Bangladesh","COP24_Bangladesh47","Climate change is a problem of politics, not science","December 18, 2018 Tuesday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Dec. 18 -- How will our children and grandchildren, looking back on this period in history, judge our response to climate change, the defining challenge of our time? Will they consider us ignorant of the threat despite all the evidence or just technologically ill-equipped to meet it?Or will they look back from a future where our economy has been transformed and the climate stabilised, and instead express bafflement that our political institutions and representatives were so unequal to the task at hand?To us, as climate scientists, it is baffling and frustrating that after decades of warnings, growing evidence, and concrete proposals for addressing greenhouse gas emissions, government policy still lags far behind what is necessary to avert potentially catastrophic global warming.In October, the landmark 1.5degC report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - which we both contributed to - summarised everything the scientific community knows about how climate change is affecting our world. Warming beyond 1.5C will unleash a frightening set of consequences and only a global transformation, beginning now, will avoid it, according to the latest report from scientists at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). But even as the report was being read and digested, the real world impacts of climate change were impossible to ignore. Europe battled with the aftermath of a summer of intense heatwaves that caused massive crop failures and deadly wildfires across the continent. Scientists found the heatwaves were made at least twice as likely in some places by climate change. On the other side of the world, China, too, was scorched by heat this summer and battered by flooding. Such extreme weather events will only become more common, with parts of the country potentially becoming uninhabitable by the end of the century, as well as facing hundreds of billions of dollars of costs from flooding well before then. Once rare extreme events like the 2017 record heatwaves in central and eastern China are now one-in-five-year events due to climate change.The IPCC 1.5degC report made it clear that in the fight against climate change, every fraction of a degree matters. A world that is 2degC warmer is very, very different to a 1.5degC world. It would see more violent heatwaves and extreme weather events, worse droughts and more sea level rise. Fortunately, we not only have the knowledge but we also have the means to meet the challenge. The IPCC's 1.5degC report was clear that the solutions to hold global temperatures to this level do exist. There is no doubt that the scale, ambition and speed of the emissions reductions necessary are challenging. But there is also no doubt that we have the technological answers - at hand, at scale and, in many cases, at comparable costs to their carbon-intensive equivalents.Just last week the global shipping company Maersk made an ambitious leap to side itself with ambitious technology and declare that it will be carbon neutral by 2030. Their bold move should serve as an example to our political leaders. The challenge is not so much one of technological difficulties, but of will.There is clearly growing public concern about the implications of a changing climate - a recent survey found that large majorities of people in Europe and China are concerned or alarmed about climate change. We know that millions of people are already channelling this concern into action in their own lives, but it is also clear that governments and decision-makers must step up. They should be leading the way and inspire further action from businesses, investors, cities and regions.Particularly striking is the emergence of the 'Generation Anthropocene', with many young people eager to dedicate their skills to deploy solutions now. At the ongoing COP24 climate conference in Poland, one of the strongest voices holding governments into account has been 15-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, who previously made headl"

The report, co-authored by Corporate Accountability, uncovers a litany of ways in which fossil fuel companies have gained high-level access to negotiations and manipulated outcomes. It also questions the role of the world's biggest polluters in sponsoring the meetings in return for access to high-level events. The global partnership Climate Transparency, found 82% of energy in these countries still being provided by coal, oil and gas, a factor which has relied on an increase of about 50% in subsidies over the past 10 years to compete with increasingly cheap wind, solar and other renewable energy sources. The G20 nations spent $147bn (&#38;#163;114bn) on subsidies in 2016, although they pledged to phase them out more than 10 years ago. Governments have said they will change, but on current commitments the world is on course for a 3.2C rise in average global temperatures, more than double the lower Paris threshold of 1.5C, which scientists have said represents the last chance to save coral reefs, the Arctic ecosystem and the wellbeing of hundreds of millions of people at risk of increased drought, flooding and forest fires.

The stage still may be far from ready for the big show adoption of the Paris Agreement Work Program (PAWP).To move the negotiations closer to the package deal to be adopted in Poland in December 2018, the parties after two weeks of talks have been compelled to decide holding an emergency session ahead of the climate summit.Just as the  Talanoas invited participants to consider global efforts to address climate change through guiding questions, the Dialogue\' s three central questions\- Where are we?@ Where do we want to go?@ How do we get there?@\- are also useful for understanding the progress achieved in Bonn and what remains to be resolved on the road to Katowice.Where are we?@Parties\' task in Bonn was to move openended discussions on key elements of the PAWP closer to draft negotiating text. Delegates picked up where they had left off in December 2017, resuming discussion of long and often unwieldy  informal notes prepared by co-facilitators across the different agenda items.Given the PAWP\' s complexity and parties\' desire not to remove or consolidate any elements from the notes at this stage, many considered the Executive Secretary\' s assessment of a  satisfactory outcome in Bonn a fair evaluation.But while parties may leave Bonn satisfied, their decision to allocate additional time for negotiation in Bangkok in September illustrates an underlying sense of urgency. Veteran negotiators believe parties will need to emerge from Bangkok with a draft negotiating text if they are to remain on track for adoption of a package in Katowice.Part of the challenge in moving the work on the PAWP forward is the need for fair progress across its many components. Throughout the opening plenaries parties echoed calls to deliver a  balanced and comprehensive package to COP 24, but views differed on what this actually means in practice. For developing countries, who fear that mitigation has taken precedence over adaptation and finance,  no item left behind emerged as a common refrain.Developed countries, conversely, argued that more technically complex issues, such as the transparency framework, naturally require more time, with the Environmental Integrity Group warning against pursuing a  mechanical parity between clauses. In addition to needing to strike a balance between parties\' differing priorities, negotiators in Bangkok will also need to find a balance between technical detail and room for political maneuvering across items.The interlinked nature of PAWP items represents another challenge.

"COP24","Bangladesh","COP24_Bangladesh50","Weaker climate consensus portends elevated climate change","December 19, 2018 Wednesday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Dec. 19 -- As representatives from more than 100 countries debated climate change in the COP24 - the 24th UN climate change conference - held in Katowice, Poland, the outcome could only be divisive.In the past, collective consensus by major economic powers - US, the European Union (EU), Japan and China - fuelled success. Now the planned withdrawal of the US from the Paris Accord resulted in a hollow consensus, supported by big-oil opposition.Like the recent G20 Summit, which welcomed trade but did not reject protectionism that undermines trade, Katowice agreed on a ""compromise,"" which welcomed the alarming climate UN (IPCC) report, but not its actual findings. The price could be the virtual extinction of small island states as seas rise, followed by soaring costs of climate change in emerging and developing economies.Katowice's ""administrative"" compromise virtually ensures that the extreme urgency required by the ""rule book,"" which would allow countries to implement the Paris Agreement, will be ignored.PLANNED TRUMP EXIT FROM PARIS ACCORD: Risks have escalated since June 01, 2017, when President Trump announced his decision to withdraw the US from the Paris Climate Agreement - an international pact intended to reduce the effects of climate change by maintaining global temperatures ""well below 2dC above pre-industrial levels.""The Accord was negotiated by almost 200 parties and adopted by consensus in December 2015. Based on the UN convention on climate change, it focuses on greenhouse gas emissions mitigation, adaptation and finance starting in 2020.However, Trump calls the pact a ""bad deal"" for the US and sees the withdrawal as a key piece of the ""America First"" stance. The White House began to pave the exit path in March 2017, when Trump signed an executive order to start the formal process of repealing President Obama's climate agenda.The withdrawal split the White House, the Congress, and the nation. A few powerful lobbying groups, energy giants and billionaires effectively hijacked the fight against climate-change, which most Americans and US cities support.More recently, the White House ignored a new government report, which concluded that, in the absence of significant steps to subdue global warming, US economy will take severe hits and cause the death of thousands of Americans by 2100.It is within the US president's constitutional authority to withdraw from the Paris deal without first receiving congressional or senatorial approval. But legal questions linger as to how the Trump White House can execute the withdrawal and what role the US can play in future international climate meetings.THE ROLE OF CHINA, EMERGING AND DEVELOPING ECONOMIES: Since the early 2010s, it has often been said that China is the ""world's greatest polluter."" That's true but only in aggregate terms. By default, big nations pollute more than small ones.Moreover, emerging economies that are still industrialising generate relatively more pollution than advanced nations, which industrialised over a century ago.The simple fact remains that, on per capita basis, the US and major European economies remain the greatest polluters by far, however.According to research, China contributes barely 10-12 per cent of human influence on climate change. That figure has remained fairly steady over the industrial period. It is lower than might be expected for the world's largest aggregate emitter.As the major advanced economies, including the US and Europe, have been emitting far longer, their net contribution on climate change remains relatively far higher. Climate change is not just cumulative but accumulative.If the US exit will materialise, global climate risks will intensify dramatically, particularly in emerging and developing economies.THE 10 COUNTRIES MOST AFFECTED BY CLIMATE RISK: Between 1998 and 2017, Puerto Rico, Honduras and Myanmar ranked highest among the countries that have been most affected by climate change. Less developed countries are generally more affected than industrialised countries. Yet, even, high income countries feel climate impacts more clearly than ever before.Regarding future climate change, the new Global Climate Risk Index can serve as a red flag for already existing vulnerability that may further increase in regions where extreme events will become more frequent or more severe due to climate change. The 10 countries most affected in the past two decades feature mainly poorer economies in Asia (Myanmar, Philippines, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Vietnam and Thailand) and Americas (Honduras, Haiti, Nicaragua and Guatemala) (Figure).Annual averages, 1998-2017: Climate Risk Index 2019, GermanWatch; Difference GroupThe Index measures long-term global risk as a function of death toll, deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, absolute losses in US$ millions, losses per unit GDP (gross domestic product) in percentage and total number of climate events from 1998 to 2017. In this regard, there are differences among the most affected countries.In the case of Puerto Rico, the top rank was driven by a very high death toll and costly economic losses, but the number of events was low relative to other countries. In Myanmar, the high death toll explains the score. In Dominica, Puerto Rico and Haiti, the losses per unit GDP drove high rankings.In international comparison, the Philippines death toll has been relatively high in the past two decades, while its economic losses were among the highest. But it is the number of total events in the Philippines (over 300) that was the highest among the top-10 countries.Only Vietnam and Bangladesh come close, but even they had just two-thirds of the climate events in the Philippines. And in the top-ranking Puerto Rico and Honduras, total events were less than a 10th and 5th of those in the Philippines.TOWARD ACCELERATED CLIMATE CHANGE: Since the 1980s typhoons that strike East and Southeast Asia have intensified by 12-15 per cent, with the proportion of storms of categories 4 and 5 having doubled, even tripled. Under increasing greenhouse gas forcing, the projected ocean surface warming pattern suggests that typhoons striking Asia will intensify further.Ironically, global climate change will penalize particularly those economies where living standards remain low and that are most vulnerable to collateral damage. The more poor economies will lose lives, the more that will bespeak about the effective indifference of advanced nations toward real human rights.Timing matters. Under the agreement, the earliest date of the US withdrawal is November 2020 - the last month of the Trump presidency, in the absence of a prior impeachment. That's when Americans have to decide whether they really prefer energy profits, at the expense of future generations in the US and elsewhere.Furthermore, time is running out. According to estimates, current climate policies virtually ensure that the increase in global temperatures is on pace for somewhere around 3.3 degrees Celsius. That does not bode well for the future.Dr Dan Steinbock is the founder of Difference Group and has served at the India, China and America Institute (USA), Shanghai Institutes for International Studies (China) and EU Center (Singapore).

"COP24","Bangladesh","COP24_Bangladesh51","THE CRUX: Climate apocalypse stares mankind in the face","December 14, 2018 Friday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Dec. 14 -- Amid repeated predictions about the disastrous impact of the global climate change came yet another prophecy of doom. The dreadful warning of David Attenborough, the British naturalist, 92, at the opening of the ongoing (December 03-14) climate summit, or COP24, in Poland appears to be the most horrifying of those uttered in the last couple of decades. He was point blank in his words. The nonagenarian climate observer has said, ""Collapse of our civilisations and extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon, if no urgent action is taken against global warming."" Attenborough blamed humans for the disaster of 'global scale', our greatest threat in thousands of years. Given the unabated aggravation of the world climate by human imprudence, the experienced naturalist had little scope for toning down his forecast's ominous air. Climatologists have already found the greenhouse gas emission set to hit a level which the Earth experienced 3 (three) million years ago. During that time the seas rose by 10 metres.In the 21st century, humans have been fated to a terrible goal. Since the erratic behaviour of the global climate is now nakedly visible worldwide, they are aware of what awaits them in the near future. Regardless of their socio-economic status, nations are feeling the heat in their typical ways. The island-based or 'low-lying' nations like Fiji, Nauru, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka or Maldives etc are bracing for devastating sea-level rises. They are increasingly being made to turn to the richer polluting nations for compensating funds, euphemistically called the 'climate fund'. These industrialised countries are unequivocally blamed for all environmental pollutions that have led to the present threatening form of the global climate. The prominent of these environment-hostile acts include greenhouse gas emission, which has been occurring mostly in some countries over the decades. This widespread injustice making the poorer nations --- geologically located in a vulnerable state, helplessly meet their doom, witnessed the creation of a climate fund in 2015. The venue was Paris. The French capital that year hosted one of the largest and the most critical climate meet in the 21st century. Heads of state and government and representatives of different countries and environmental activists participated in the conference. A major outcome of the meet came in the form of the rich nations' pledge to mitigate the worries and sufferings of the climatically vulnerable countries. The modus operandi of the way out was not daunting. Finance emerged as the dominant issue. Almost all of the rich nations agreed to put in their contributions to the fund. This 'historic' step came up as a new lease of life of sorts for the climate-victim nations. Following days of deliberations, the financial pool came into being visibly on assurance of the affluent nations.Three years into the event, the ambitious mission is veritably in limbo. Foot-dragging and offering one or another ruse, as well as blunt refusal, dominates the scene. The climate summit in Poland, in a sense, is being held to ensure that the rich nations that participated in the Paris event do not renege on their lofty pledges. But the signs are grim. In the run-up to the Poland summit, US President Donald Trump has flatly denied the existence of any climate abnormalities in his country or elsewhere in the world. In the meantime, super-storms, heat waves, droughts and deadly floods continue to ravage the world, the US and the mainland Europe not spared. However, as has been seen in the recent past, the less advanced nations in South, Southeast Asia and the Pacific emerge as the worst victims.The commotion and misgivings which have created a fraught situation prior to the Poland meet are not abrupt. They have been long in the making. In the climate treaty signed at the Paris conference in 2015 the ceiling for global temperature rise was fixed at below 2-degree Celsius. The capping, however, was described by scientists as some goal that risked spiralling out of human grasp inviting calamities in a row. The likelihood depended on the extent of wisdom on the part of humans in handling the global warming factors. That mankind had performed miserably in the test became clear in the startling finding of a research made public recently. As the scientists have predicted, emission of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning is feared to rise 2.7 per cent in 2018. Last year carbon pollution increased by 1.6 per cent. The scientists have aptly echoed the warning of UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres who a few days earlier had sounded an alarm by saying the present world was on ""way off course"" in facing the climate crisis. In their recent study, scientists portrayed the present world as ""completely off course"" in the fight against climate-spawned disasters. The worldwide rise in CO2 emission puts the goals spelled out in the 2015 Paris Agreement in jeopardy, a scientist involved with the research says.The initial uproar over climate change began to make rounds among the experts level in the 1970s. In those days, the nature-spurred phenomenon remained generally limited to global warming, the sea level rise, polar ice and Himalayan glacial melting etc. Upon in-depth studies, those were followed by other climate-change fallout. Those chiefly included ozone depletion, displacement of sea-level rise victims, floods and droughts. As decades wear on, climate change occupies a wider focus in the environment-related summits and conferences, the most notable of them being the event marking the signing of the Kyoto Protocol in Japan in 1997. This was an international treaty setting mandatory limits on the industrialised nations on emission of greenhouse gases.To a lot of people, the Polish climate conference might appear to be another addition to the largely non-binding agreements now in force. Many doubt its efficacy in stemming the ferocity of the full-scale strike of a climate catastrophe. But despite a few chauvinistic and arrogant governments' stance, the global efforts to avert an apocalyptic event are set to get going. As part of these initiatives, the World Bank has promised $200 billion in 2021-25 climate funds. The onslaughts of climate change have long started being felt worldwide. The spectre of sea level rise has already prompted poorer and vulnerable nations to go on for arranging climate funds. As a flipside, proper utilisation of the fund money and keeping it free of the clutches of vested interests are emerging as added national imperatives for the eligible countries.No matter how ritualistically the Polish conference draws to a close, it will at least remind the nations of the global-scale calamities haunting mankind. Moreover, without conferences like it, today's consumerist societies cannot be expected to sensitise themselves to the imminent climate-induced doom. It's a truth few people with the virtue of prudence can afford to keep aside. The crux is that climate disasters stare mankind in the face. There is little time for rhetoric, tall promises and pseudo-serious negotiations --- or being in the role of a sitting duck. As a heroic and disaster-resilient nation, Bangladesh might be the last nation to remain idle and keep enduring the assaults of climate change.

"COP24","Bangladesh","COP24_Bangladesh52","Climate change: Greenhouse gas levels at record high","December 4, 2018 Tuesday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Dec. 4 -- The levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which are regarded as the main driver of climate change, have hit a new high. A warning from the United Nations (UN) on November 22, 2018 said that the time to act was running out fast. The top UN officials are trying to ring the alarm bells, ahead of the COP 24 climate summit in Poland this month. Governments from across the world are expected to join the summit to pledge efforts through which warming can be limited to less than two degrees celsius. The two degrees celsius limit was enshrined in the 2015 Paris accord.As per the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), without rapid cuts in CO2 and other greenhouse gases, climate change will have increasingly destructive and irreversible impacts on life on earth. The window of opportunity for action is almost closed. The Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, the United Nations weather agency's annual flagship report that has been tracking the content of dangerous gases in the atmosphere since 1750, covered data for 2017 this year. The report put the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere at 405.5 parts per million (ppm). That is up from 403.3 ppm in 2016 and 400.1 ppm in 2015. The last time the earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was three to five million years ago, when the temperature was warmer by 2 to 3 degrees celsius.Researchers have reliable estimates of C02 concentrations rates going back 800,000 years using air bubbles preserved in ice in Greenland and Antarctica. But by studying fossilised material, the WMO also has rough CO2 estimates going back up to five million years. In addition to CO2, the UN agency also highlighted rising levels of methane, nitrous oxide and another powerful ozone depleting gas known as CFC-11 (Chlorofluorocarbon - 11). Emissions are the main factors that determine the amount of greenhouse gas levels. But concentration rates are a measure of what remains after a series of complex interactions between atmosphere, biosphere, lithosphere, cryosphere and the oceans. Roughly 25 per cent of all emissions are currently absorbed by the oceans and biosphere-a term that accounts for all ecosystems on Earth.The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has said that in order to keep warming below 1.5 degrees celsius, net CO2 emissions must be at net zero level. This means that the amount of CO2 being pumped into the atmosphere must equal the amount being removed. This can be done either through natural absorption or technological innovation. WMO noted that CO2 remains in the atmosphere and oceans for hundreds of years. There is currently no magic wand to remove all the excess CO2 from the atmosphere.Every fraction of a degree of global warming matters, and so does every part per million (ppm) of greenhouse gases. As per the United Nations, 17 of the 18 hottest years on record have occurred since 2001. And the cost of climate related disasters in 2017 topped US $500 billion (439 billion Euros). It is urgent now to tame the pace of climate change at the earliest.It remains to be seen if these warning signs will be enough to move the world leaders towards taking definitive actions against climate change by cutting down on carbon dioxide emissions.Sarwar Md.

Simultaneously, the decisions of the Cop 24, namely Paris Rulebook, must be adhered to by all the stakeholders,' he said.Bangladesh is one of the 10 most climate vulnerable countries in the world and the impacts of climate change will put severe stress on Bangladesh's limited land.The State Minister said they look forward to the September Climate Summit to having more focused actions particularly on climate finance and climate justice which are essential for meeting the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda.He mentioned the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is contingent upon their success in halting global climate change and reduce disaster risks.'It is high time that we renew our efforts to implement the Paris Agreement and the Sendai Framework to their true letter and spirit,' said the State Minister.Shahriar said rapid meltdown of the glaciers will dry up our rivers which are basically the catchments of the Himalayan glaciers. 'This will impact the fertility of our land leading to desertification.'He said climate change and sea level rise induced salinity and other disasters are harming our rice and other crop production significantly.Just 1-degree centigrade increase of global temperature and further sea level rise will result into inundation of a large area of Bangladesh and thus displacement of 40 million people by the end of this century, he said adding that 2 percent of GDP is regularly lost due to natural calamities and environmental degradation.Hence, the State Minister said, climate change poses an existential threat to over 160 million people in Bangladesh, although it had hardly contributed to the deterioration of the environment.'Our Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina reiterated her Government's commitment to the Paris Agreement at different international fora with the utterance that, Bangladesh will never exceed the average per capita emission of the developing world,' he said.Tackling climate change is directly linked with sustainable development and resilience building.In l"

"COP24","Bangladesh","COP24_Bangladesh58","Bearing witness on behalf of humanity","October 5, 2018 Friday","Dhaka Courier","Dhaka, Oct. 5 -- Bangladesh's participation in this year's General Assembly of the United Nations (UNGA), including the fringe events that take place in and around the high level General Debate, was of particular importance in light of the year that had lapsed since the outbreak of the Rohingya refugee crisis - perhaps the most intense of a number of such crises driven by war and inhumanity around the world today, that are playing havoc with the world order and fuelling the rise of populist hard right movements in a number of Western polities.In 2017, the Rohingya crisis in its latest and most intense iteration (it has been ongoing for nearly four decades now, what C.R. Abrar has described as a ""slowburn genocide"") was still too early and too little was understood about it for world leaders to take a resolute stand one way or the other. Indeed, even historically we would find that the plight of the Rohingya has received very little international attention, part of what drove Amnesty International to once christen them ""the world's most persecuted people"". The inadequate attention it has received at the UN's annual shindig in the past merely reflected this gap in the world's consciousness.This time however was a different story, with nearly the full scale of the horror that was inflicted upon the hapless Rohingya by the Myanmar army under the guise of a cleanup operation against extremist elements that commenced in August 2017, having emerged - and gone viral - in full view of the world over the course of the past one year. Witness the plethora of leaders and celebrities who have visited the refugee camps scattered across Cox's Bazaar mostly throughout 2018, as if in a hurry to make up for the history of neglect.World media too has not missed the opportunity for putting all the misery - the salt among all the ingredients that make up the news on a daily basis - on display, while advocacy groups like Amnesty and Human Rights Watch have also tackled the issue with a gusto not seen before over the past one year. All of this meant an unprecedented groundswell of interest around the Rohingya issue as world leaders started gathering in the Turtle Bay area of New York that hosts the UN premises.Prior to this year's meeting, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for Myanmar to be held accountable for ""one of the world's worst humanitarian and human rights crises"" following the publication of a UN investigation into alleged atrocities against the Rohingya.The report recommended that the country's military leadership be prosecuted for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes committed in Rakhine State last year, where around 700,000 Rohingya were forced to flee their homes.US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley called for strong and immediate action against the Myanmar leadership, while Chinese ambassador Wu Haitao urged a softer approach based on ""constructive assistance"".As a result one of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's first engagements upon arrival in New York saw her placing three recommendations to solve the protracted Rohingya crisis from its root, at a high-level side event on the 'Global Compact on Refugees: A Model for Greater Solidarity and Cooperation' held at the UN headquarters with the secretary-general in the chair.In 2016 the UN refugee agency began developing a new framework for responding to large movements of refugees. The Global Compact on Refugees was delivered to the UN general assembly through this event.Thick end of a crisisThe prime minister's first recommendation was to abolish discriminatory laws, policies and practices by Myanmar against Rohingyas. Her second recommendation was that Myanmar must create conducive environment by building trust and guaranteeing protection, rights and pathway to citizenship for all Rohingyas. If needed, create a 'safe zone' inside Myanmar to protect all civilians. The third recommendation was to prevent atrocious crimes against Rohingyas in Myanmar by bringing accountability and justice, particularly in light of the recommendations of the Fact-Finding Mission of the UN Human Rights Council.""In Bangladesh, now we're faced with the largest forced movement of over 1.1 million traumatised Rohingya sat the shortest time. They've been forcibly displaced from their homes in Rakhine State of Myanmar where they had been living for centuries,"" she told her audience.The prime minister went on saying, ""While we're providing them with basic necessities, the magnitude of the problem has posed serious challenges for us. We've allocated over 6,000 acres of land."" Hasina, however, said the diversion of human and other resources for Rohingyas has taken a toll on the environment, economy and society. She mentioned that the international partners, especially the UN agencies, have been helping the Rohingyas.""Regrettably, the current UN joint response plan of 2018 which requires USD 950 million has remained severely underfunded with only 33 percent funding secured. Humanitarian and development support of the international community for the Rohingyas and other affected communities must be predictable and in the spirit of international responsibility sharing,"" the PM said.Hasina reiterated that the Rohingya crisis originated in Myanmar and the solution has to be found there.""As a responsible government, we've opened our border and provided shelter to the forcibly displaced Rohingyas. By doing so, we've not only saved lives, but also stabilised the entire region by containing the crisis within our border.""She said Bangladesh would like to see the Rohingyas returning to the homes in safety, security and dignity.""Pending their return, we are trying to address their basic needs.""Given the scarcity of land and other socio-cultural and environmental impacts, Hasina said they were going to relocate them to a newly developed island, Bhashan Char, where they will have better living conditions and livelihood opportunities. In the absence of any policy of local integration in Bangladesh, she said, Rohingyas need to secure their future in their own country Myanmar. The prime minister urged international community to help Bangladesh achieve that.Hasina said the 'Compact on Refugees' was up for adoption at a time when the world is faced with swelling refugee crisis. Innocent people from the various conflict-torn countries are leaving their homes for safety and security while many countries like Bangladesh are giving them shelter, protection and hope.She mentioned that most of these refugee-hosting countries are developing countries with their own set of challenges. ""Yet, they respond to the call of humanity.""The world must recognize their contributions and help those countries shoulder the burden. The world leaders must come forward with political will and commitment, she added. The prime minister said the world must not forget that every refugee desires a safe return to his or her homeland. The displaced people from Myanmar have to return to their homes in safety, security and dignity.""Safe and sustainable return to the country of origin is particularly important to resolve protracted refugee crisis. Greater attention needs to be paid to remove the root causes that drive people refugee, and those root causes lie in the countries of origin,"" she said.The prime minister said the realisation of the Compact should exhibit stronger commitment towards addressing those root causes; rather than focusing on response to an emerging situation only.The Global Compact on refugees was conceived in September 2016, when the UN General Assembly adopted the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, which is ""a set of commitments to enhance the protection of refugees and migrants."" The New York Declaration called upon the UNHCR to create a ""global compact on refugees"" to be presented in the 2018 annual report to the UN General Assembly.The Compact aims to strengthen cooperation between UN member states in responding to large movements of refugees. It consists of the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework, which are the key elements for a thorough response to any large movement of refugees. The Global Compact will also provide a blueprint to ""ensure refugees have better access to health, education and livelihood opportunities.""When one nation is confronted with a large movement of refugees, the global compact aims to alleviate that burden so that a country does not become overwhelmed. There should be systems in place so governments can share responsibility in a crisis, which is based on the rationale that the members of the international community work better together, than alone. The compact is expected to be endorsed by the General Assembly before the end of 2018.On the same day, September 24, UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and French Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs Jean-Yves Le Drian co-hosted a High-Level Event on the Rohingya Crisis. Ministers from Burma/Myanmar and Bangladesh were joined by high level attendees from Australia, Canada, Indonesia, Japan, Kuwait, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Russia, Singapore, Sweden, Turkey and the US. UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi, Special Envoy Christine Schraner Burgener and UN Development Programme Administrator Achim Steiner also participated.The Co-Chairs (France and the UK) agreed that the plight of the Rohingya was one of the largest refugee crises in recent history and one of the most pressing human rights and humanitarian crises facing the international community today. They noted with deep concern the conclusions of the report of the UN Fact-Finding Mission, which allege the Burmese military's responsibility for serious human rights violations, possibly amounting to crimes against humanity and which conclude that there is sufficient information to warrant the investigation and prosecution of senior officials in the Burmese army so that a competent court can determine their liability for genocide in relation to the situation in Rakhine state.France and the UK noted that over the past year the Burmese government had taken some steps to address the crisis, including the signing of the MoU between Burma/Myanmar and UNDP and UNHCR and the establishment of a Commission of Inquiry (CoI). The Co-Chairs acknowledged the ruling of the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber that the Court may exercise jurisdiction over the alleged deportation of the Rohingya people from Myanmar to Bangladesh as well as over the alleged crime against humanity.They recalled their support to the efforts of the Human Rights Council to implement the conclusions of the Fact-Finding mission and to push for accountability, including through an independent Mechanism to collect, consolidate, preserve and analyse evidence of the most serious international crimes and violations of international law committed in Burma/Myanmar.The meeting also called for the immediate release of the two Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Ooo as well as for the respect for their fundamental rights.They also thanked the government and people of Bangladesh for hosting more than a million refugees. They encouraged the international community to continue and intensify support for the refugees and Bangladeshi host communities, including through increasing financial support to the UN Joint Response Plan.At the UNGA HallBefore delivering her speech at the General Debate, the prime minister also took part in the high-level ""Leaders' Dialogue on Climate Change: Implementation of the Paris Agreement Towards COP24 and Beyond"" held at the UN Headquarters, where she urged the developed countries and world leaders to come forward with support for climate change adaptation and wider 'capacity building'.""We need support for climate change adaptation and wider 'capacity building' and also for technology development and transfer in areas like agriculture, public health and disaster management,"" she said.At the General Debate, the prime minister demanded immediate and effective implementation of the agreement signed between Myanmar and the UN on the solution of the Rohingya crisis.""We also wish to see immediate and effective implementation of the agreement concluded between Myanmar and the UN,"" she said while delivering her address at the General Debate of the 73rd UN General Assembly on September 28. She delivered her speech in Bangla as in previous years.She said Bangladesh was appalled by what it has seen in UN reports about atrocities against the Rohingyas who have now taken shelter in Bangladesh, which are tantamount to genocide and crimes against humanity. ""We expect the international community, particularly the UN, to give due importance to the atrocities and injustice suffered by the Rohingya population in Myanmar,"" she said. The prime minister said Bangladesh can neither ignore nor remain silent about the plight of the Rohingya, their 'fellow human beings'.""I, therefore, presented a five-point proposal at the UN General Assembly last year with a view to finding a durable and peaceful solution to the sufferings of the forcibly displaced and hapless Rohingya. We're disappointed that despite our earnest efforts, we haven't been able to begin Rohingya repatriation in a permanent and sustainable manner,"" she said.Mentioning that Myanmar is one of Bangladesh's neighbours, she said from the outset, it has been trying to find a peaceful solution to the Rohingya crisis through bilateral consultations. ""So far, three bilateral arrangements have been concluded between Bangladesh and Myanmar for Rohingya repatriation,"" she said, adding that despite their verbal commitment to take back the Rohingya, in reality, the Myanmar authorities are yet to accept them back.Hasina said the 1.1 million Rohingyas (700,000 nin the latest exodus, to go with 400,000 since 1978) hosted in Bangladesh are living in an uncertain situation. To the best of its ability, Bangladesh has made arrangements for their food, clothing, healthcare, child-care and security, she said. She noted how many countries and organisations, including the UN, the Commonwealth, and the OIC, have shown solidarity with the Rohingyas and extended support and assistance for them.The prime minister said Bangladesh has started working on a new housing facility with all arrangements for their education, healthcare and other needs so that they are able to live in a good and healthy condition. She called upon international organisations to join hands with Bangladesh in this initiative.She said the Myanmar situation repeatedly reminds her of the genocide committed by the Pakistan occupation forces against Bangalis in 1971 - thereby opening the door to a possible future campaign to have those atrocities recognised as genocide.Talking about terrorism, she said Bangladesh stands firm against terrorism and all organised crimes. ""We shall not allow our territory to be used for any terrorist acts against or any activity detrimental to the interest of our neighbours. Our 'zero tolerance' policy in countering terrorism will continue undiminished,"" she said.Sheikh Hasina said Bangladesh has commenced its journey toward the status of a developing country from an LDC. In the backdrop of Bangladesh's current economic growth, she said, there are now immense and large-scale business opportunities in Bangladesh.She also mentioned that Bangladesh remains committed to implementing the Paris Agreement and is spending over 1 percent of its GDP in addressing climate change impacts. ""We're also promoting climate-resilient agriculture. Initiatives have been taken to increase tree coverage from 22 percent to 24 percent in the next five years,"" she said.She said Bangladesh was shocked by the continued violation of the rights of the brotherly people of Palestine. ""This must come to an end. As the Chair of the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers, we shall continue to work with the international community for resolution of the Palestine question.""Sheikh Hasina said there are three elements that play the most critical part in advancing human civilization -- peace, humanity and development. ""For the well-being of human societies, we must continue to strive for humanity. Our main objective must be to serve people and ensure their well-being. It is humanity and goodwill that would take us forward on the pathway to sustainable development.""Noting that Bangladesh once was known to the world as the land plagued by disasters, floods, droughts and hunger, she said it has done wonders in maintaining international peace, managing disasters, empowering women and consolidating development gains. ""Bangladesh has now surpassed its neighbours in South Asia on a number of indicators.""""But our journey has not reached its end. Our journey will continue till the day we can build a Bangladesh free of hunger, poverty, illiteracy and exploitation,'' the prime minister concluded, on a suitable note of optimism and hope to inspire all people.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Dhaka Courier.

The role of the private sector in financing is to be expanded.At the UN Climate Change Conference COP26 in November 2021, industrialized countries pledged to double adaptation funding for developing countries by 2025 and to balance international climate finance between adaptation and mitigation. At the Lahti Adaptation Finance Ministerial, hosted by Minister for Development Cooperation and Foreign Trade Ville Skinnar , the actors will look for solutions to fulfill the commitments and point the way to COP27 in November.The need for adaptation is critical. We need a common plan to which public and private donors, funds and developing countries commit themselves. In Lahti, the main players are at the same table and ready to act, says Minister Skinnari.Adaptation financing prepares for the effects of climate change that can no longer be prevented by mitigating emissions. These include, for example, extreme weather events such as droughts, floods or hurricanes, which affect the poorest countries the most.

I consider the COP26 goals of achieving the Net Zero target not as a challenge, but as an opportunity. By 2030, India has set the target of extracting 50 per cent of its energy from non-fossil fuels. It is our opportunity to shift to more sustainable practices,"" Modi said while addressing a budget webinar.Emphasising the need to focus on stepping up energy efficiency, the Prime Minister said the Union Budget 2022-23 has drawn a special focus on the battery swapping policy that can scale India's energy efficiency capabilities.Modi said the government had scaled up the production of LED bulbs that had resulted in prices of such bulbs coming down. Besides, under the UJALA scheme, the common man has also been able to save over Rs 20,000 crore in electricity bills, he noted.""Four pilot projects for coal gasification and conversion of coal into chemicals required for the industry will be set up to evolve technical and financial viability. With the coming years, India's energy demands will increase, therefore, we must transition to renewable energy,"" the Prime Minister stressed.Suggesting coming out with innovative methods to increase awareness on solar power, Modi said every household should develop its own solar tree that can contribute to saving up to 15 per cent electricity. It will not only be unique, but also environment-friendly.""The intent of this seminar is to focus on the implementation of the new budget schemes, and to chalk out ways by which we can begin execution that is effective and concrete.

Current activity indicates a global rise in temperature of 3.3C as of 31 December 2021, down from 3.4C recorded at the end of June 2020 and the lowest reading since the dashboard was launched by Schroders. Indeed, in Q1 2017, the dashboard was tracking a 4.2C temperature rise above pre-industrial levels.The positive momentum since the last update was supported by the volume of climate commitments made in the run up to and during COP 26. In addition, and more significantly, oil and gas sectors globally have continued curtailing their investment in new capacity, while carbon prices in Europe continue to reach new records.Graph omitted (The document can be viewed at: HYPERLINK https://www.schroders.com/en/media-relations/newsroom/all_news_releases/schroders-climate-progress-dashboard-slow-progress-despite-cop26-commitments/https://www.schroders.com/en/media-relations/newsroom/all_news_releases/schroders-climate-progress-dashboard-slow-progress-despite- HYPERLINK https://www.schroders.com/en/media-relations/newsroom/all_news_releases/schroders-climate-progress-dashboard-slow-progress-despite-cop26-commitments/cop26 -commitments/)Andy Howard, Schroders Global Head of Sustainable Investments, commented:""The 26th Conference of the Parties - the annual global climate event bringing together pollical leaders to set a roadmap for global climate action - provided neither the step forward we had hoped for, nor the setback we'd feared. India in particular has established a net zero target, albeit its pace is contingent on developed economies providing capital to emerging counterparts to ease and facilitate that transition.""Overall, political targets and aspirations are relatively aggressive but policies to deliver those targets are less developed and less audacious.""Most encouragingly however, industry-wide investment in new oil and gas capacity has continued to slide. Fossil fuel producers are in the cross hairs of climate campaigners and policymakers, as are the financial services companies that provide capital to them. That constraint has been the major driver of the lower long-run temperature rise implied by climate action since our last update.""All in all, there is much further to go to align the actions we see across all of the stakeholders, industries and social groups that will play key roles in driving decarbonisation. Progress toward the goals agreed in Paris in 2015 continues, albeit slowly.""Launched in 2017, the Climate Progress Dashboard provides Schroders analysts, fund managers and clients with an insight into the progress governments and industries across the world are making towards meeting the 2C temperature rise limit set by the Paris Agreement.Schroders Climate Progress Dashboard:Graph omitted (The document can be viewed at: HYPERLINK https://www.schroders.com/en/media-relations/newsroom/all_news_releases/schroders-climate-progress-dashboard-slow-progress-despite-cop26-commitments/https://www.schroders.com/en/media-relations/newsroom/all_news_releases/schroders-climate-progress-dashboard-slow-progress-despite- HYPERLINK https://www.schroders.com/en/media-relations/newsroom/all_news_releases/schroders-climate-progress-dashboard-slow-progress-despite-cop26-commitments/cop26 -commitments/)Source: Schroder Investment Management Limited\l"

FDI inflow into Vietnam continued in January this year, with $2.1 billion, up by 4.2 per cent year on year.A recent survey by the Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) showed that 55.3 per cent of the Japanese firms in Vietnam interviewed said they plan to expand their operations in the next one - two years.But to boost economic growth and attract FDI sustainably and effectively, the country should pay more attention to digital transformation and green technology application to production and business activities, which will help manage climate change impacts and adapt to this global phenomenon, World Bank country director for Vietnam Carolyn Turk suggested.\l"

The conclusions set out that the EU and its member states, in a joint Team Europe approach, will engage with partners around the world to address the challenges linked to such implementation, and will actively work on the various COP26 sectoral initiatives and calls.In its conclusions the Council recognises that the direct and indirect effects of climate change, biodiversity loss and environmental degradation represent risks to the realisation of human rights, human and state security, undermining global peace and stability and often accelerating or deepening existing vulnerabilities and instability. In this light, the Council welcomes the increased focus by the UN on the climate, peace and security nexus, but also reiterates the need for human rights to be integrated systematically into climate action and energy diplomacy.The Council also stresses that the lack of at-scale finance for resilient and just energy transitions in middle and low-income countries remains a barrier for green and sustainable development. Therefore, the EU will continue to provide a sustainable, green and positive offer to partners for the development of trusted climate resilient energy, transport and digital infrastructure.At the same time, the EU calls on other developed countries to meet the collective commitment to mobilise $100 billion per year in 2022, and on multilateral development banks and international finance institutions to play a catalytic role in mobilising the private sector and shifting the global financial flows towards sustainable and green investments.\l"

The country has additionally committed to a net zero carbon emission target by the year 2070, by when the per capita energy consumption would have surged multifold from current levels.Rohit Ahuja, Head of Research and Outreach, ICRA says, ""Ambitious targets for COP26 opens massive investment opportunities across segments stemming from 500 GW renewables by 2030, higher EV penetration (~10% by 2025), 20% ethanol blending for petrol (~3x increase from current levels), improvement in energy efficiencies (battery storage, smart cities, etc.) and improvement in carbon capture from enhancing green cover and use of advanced technologies. This would be a daunting task, and would need massive policy interventions to ensure investments across aforementioned sectors remain profitable enough to sustain well beyond 2030.""At the COP26The ICRA research report notes that as per Panchamrit, an incremental addition of 5x in non-fossil fuels power generation capacity by 2030 is required for which India would need about USD 450-500 bn investments including investment towards transmission infrastructure and storage capabilities. Higher reliance on renewables for energy sourcing will increase dependence on it over the years. The targeted emission intensity which is a multiple of GHG emission to per unit of GDP, will need lower pace of GHG emission growth compared to GDP.The study further notes that a developing nation like India, with one of the highest economic growth globally, cannot afford to have nil carbon emissions. Evidently, pollution in cities is increasing alarmingly and three Indian metro cities Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata feature in the list of top 10 most polluted cities in the world.Achieving net zero by 2070 needs carbon sequestration ( a natural or artificial process, by which carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere and held in solid or liquid form)) at same level of GHG emission. This means, post 2030 projections, a steady pace of sequestration (1-3% range) would be needed to reach the net zero levels in 2070. This calls out for a huge investment, which is estimated at annually Rs. 115-135 bn (per Niti Aayog report for carbon sequestration).""Being one of the fastest growing economies in the world, India needs to find a fine balance between reduction in carbon emission, and surging energy needs. As the country enters the developed economy tag over the next few years, the per capita energy consumption is set to surge multifold (with China being ~4x and US being 10x of India),"" says Ahuja.""The government policies need to ensure no compromise in its ever expanding energy needs that could hamper its growth ambitions, while simultaneously work towards removing tag of one of the most polluting nations in the world,"" he suggests.\l"

A farmer-led scheme called TIST has spread to over 150,000 subsistence farmers in East Africa, because it supports farmers to share these practices and learn from one another.""International voluntary carbon markets have enabled TIST members to collectively access payments for carbon sequestered in trees on their land, building in a further reinforcing feedback.""The researchers say positive tipping points can help to counter widespread feelings of disempowerment in the face of global challenges, and they stress that everyone can play a part in triggering positive tipping points.""These changes often start with small groups of people with a big idea,"" said Professor Lenton.""These can become networks of change that grow into large movements with a major impact.The paper notes the importance of equity when seeking to trigger tipping points. The authors write: ""It is vital to consider what social safety nets can help ensure a just transformation.""The researchers say their framework for finding and triggering tipping points needs ""testing and refining,"" adding: ""There is no better way forward than to learn by doing.""Continuing to delay action to accelerate a just transformation towards global sustainability will only accentuate the need to find and trigger even more dramatic positive tipping points in the future.""The paper, written by a team including researchers from Hamburg University and University College London and published in the journalGlobal Sustainability, is entitled: ""Operationalising Positive Tipping Points towards Global Sustainability.""\l"

India presented the way for a constructive debate and equitable and just solutions at the forum.""Consensus, however, remained elusive at COP26. India has maintained that the current climate crisis has been precipitated by unsustainable lifestyles and wasteful consumption patterns mainly in the developed countries. The world needs to awaken to this reality,"" Yadav wrote on his blog on Sunday.The minister, who has been maintaining a blog 'COP 26 Diary', wrote that India, under Prime MinisterNarendra Modi, has proactively taken the lead in creating theInternational Solar Alliance, Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) and the One Sun, One World, OneSun Gridinitiatives as examples of international collaboration to combat climate change.""Having done its part, India at the summit, asked the developed world concrete actions in this decisive decade and translation of commitments to actions,"" he said.India has been criticised by several countries for the change promoted by it to phase down, rather than phase out coal power, the single biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions.Yadav said that fossil fuels and their use have enabled parts of the world to attain high levels of growth.""Even now, developed countries have not completely phased out coal. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) refers to mitigation of GHG emissions from all sources. UNFCCC is not directed at any particular source.

"COP26","India","COP26_India25","COP26: Forward march!","November 30, 2021 Tuesday","The Financial Express","By Anirban GhoshCOP26 has concluded, and nearly 200 countries have signed the Glasgow Pact. It shows that the ratchet mechanism in the Paris Accord is working, the loose ends of the Accord have been tied up, nations have moved beyond Paris and a solution orientation has emerged. Here are some examples of how these four themes have manifested themselves.More than 150 countries, including India, have articulated enhanced ambition for emission reduction. As a result, the projected temperature increase at the end of the century is 2.4-degree C. This is 0.3-degree C better than the impact of promises made at Paris. We remain far away from the goal of 1.5-degree C, but signatories of the Glasgow Pact have agreed to return with more aggressive goals at COP27. The ratchet mechanism in the Paris Accord is working!Adaptation is another area where action was ratcheted up.The Adaptation Fund received new pledges for $356 million-three times its mobilisation target for 2022. Developed countries agreed to double the adaptation funding goal to developing countries by 2025, taking the annual figure to $40 billion. Donors pledged $413 million to the Least Developed Countries Fund, the only climate resilience fund that exclusively targets least developed countries. A separate international system for issuing offsets has been conceived, on which a 5% tax will go to adaptation and a two-year Glasgow-Sharm el-Sheikh Work Programme on the Global Goal or Adaptation has been set up. These are good developments, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating.Two key loose ends in the Paris rulebook that have been tied-up are market mechanisms and transparency of climate action. Article 6, dealing with market mechanisms, is no longer unfinished business. A mechanism to prevent double counting of credits has been articulated. Carbon credits generated and sold will need to be recorded and added to the selling country's NDC target. We can now expect the carbon tax, offset and trading ecosystems to develop and drive decarbonisation.All countries are expected to report emissions, progress on climate pledges, contributions to climate finance, climate impact and adaptation biennially, at least. Countries must submit their first ""biennial transparency report"" and ""national inventory report"" by the end of 2024, with small island developing states and least developed countries allowed to do so ""at their discretion"". Since whatever gets measured, gets done, this transparency mechanism should see greater achievement of national pledges.There are four significant ways in which COP26 moved beyond Paris. First, methane, a greenhouse gas that causes 80 times more warming than carbon dioxide, finally found its place in the Global Methane Pledge signed by 105 countries. It is a commitment to reduce overall methane emissions by 30% by 2030. Second, the two largest emitters of the world, China and the US, signed a pact to work with each other to accelerate climate action.This includes the US's goal to reach 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035 and China's phase-down of coal consumption during its 15th Five Year Plan. Third, the coal conversation is on the table. It will accelerate transition to cleaner energy sources like solar, wind, hydrogen and biomass. Fourth, 130 nations possessing 90% of the world's forests agreed to halt and then reverse deforestation by 2030. Each of these steps will accelerate the decarbonisation agenda.While the rate of decarbonisation must be ratcheted up, climate-friendly solutions that have emerged must be adopted and scaled rapidly. The Glasgow EV Pledge by governments, manufacturers, businesses, investors and fleet owners to transition completely to zero emission cars and vans in the 2030s is a step in the right direction. The Glasgow Breakthrough Agenda will play a similar role for other forms of cleaner, affordable technology.There is a pithy saying that ""the stone age didn't end for lack of stone."" Similarly, the transition from coal and fossil fuels requires alternative technologies and the advent of a solution orientation at COP26 can make this happen.A COP is never all roses and no thorns. COP26 did not broaden the clean transportation conversation beyond cars to public transportation and two-wheelers. The inability of developed nations to come good on their funding promises continued to disappoint. There was also the dampener of moving from ""phase-out"" to ""phase-down"" of coal. But in the absence of an associated timel"

Climate Change Conference of the Parties must assist developing countries From 31 October to 12 November, world leaders are meeting in Glasgow for the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report is unequivocal: human activities have warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. Extractive methods and the use of fossil fuels are causing extensive damage affecting every region across the globe. The resulting crisis spells climate injustice for millions. According to Share International, human actions are responsible for eighty percent of global warming. As long as infinite economic growth is a priority, we will continue to exploit and pollute the natural world for profit. The key to tackling climate change is to share the necessary financial and technological resources worldwide. The equitable redistribution of resources on a global scale puts cooperation at the centre of international affairs, removing the need for competitive exploitation of the planet. As early as 2007, an article by a Master of Wisdom recorded by the late British author Benjamin Creme and published in Share International magazine, gave this eighty percent figure and stated that we have a pivotal choice to make: to reap the beneficial results of immediate action, or face the destruction that would ensue from doing nothing, or too little. The article went on to say that the World Teacher for this age, Maitreya, who is gradually emerging into public view, will advocate a simpler form of living, one more in keeping with the planets situation. When enough people are convinced that this is necessary there will be a growing movement to simplify throughout the planet. It further predicted that faced with the dilemma of necessary change, man will come to realize the inevitability of accepting the principle of sharing. Only sharing will make these changes practical and possible. The IPCC report affirms there is still time to slow, stop, or even reverse some changes by reducing CO2 emissions to at least net zero. But to accomplish this globally, the wealthier countries will not only have to curb their own emissions but also must share resources and technology with developing nations, to ensure that all can make the necessary transition as rapidly as possible to sustainable energy sources. Clearly, politicians have not yet responded to the climate crisis at levels commensurate with the danger, but COP26 offers a pivotal opportunity. To succeed at their stated goal of Uniting the World to Tackle Climate Change, COP26 participants will need to go beyond inequitable loan financing and fast-track unconditional sharing of the financial and technological resources necessary to bring all countries on board.

In an extensive campaign directed towards the COP26-participants in Glasgow, Danfoss highlights that energy efficiency is the most cost-effective way to achieve economic growth, decarbonize economies and meet the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement.In a campaign aimed at the participants of COP26 in Glasgow, UK, Danfoss, a leading provider of solutions enabling the green transition, says energy efficiency delivers more than 40 percent of the reduction in energy-related emissions the world needs to fully achieve international climate and energy goals.Danfoss is participating at COP26 to meet with political leaders and NGOs, to help amplify the message that climate action is needed now. The campaign includes an extensive digital campaign as well as a wrap around the printed edition of the Financial Times newspaper with a main message to participants at the COP that the greenest energy is the energy we dont use.According to Martin Rossen, Senior Vice President, Group Communications and Sustainability at Danfoss, the campaign is focused on energy efficiency as annual global improvements hit a decade low in 2020. Numbers from the International Energy Agency show that energy intensity improved by only 0.8 percent in 2020, roughly half the rates, corrected for weather, for 2019 (1.6 percent) and 2018 (1.5 percent).It is imperative that decision makers at COP26 prioritize energy-efficiency. It is the most important single component in reaching the Paris goals, it is extremely cost effective, and it can boost economies and create jobs, says Martin Rossen. Martin Rossen, who is former Chief of Staff to Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, sees the current energy crisis as a potential eye opener for decision makers.In an op-ed recently published in politics.co.uk, Rossen writes that soaring prices should remind decision-makers that the greenest energy is the energy we dont use.Most energy is used in our cities and buildings, factories, and transportation. And we use much more energy than we need, which is not only bad for the climate but also for the economy. If nothing else, the increase in energy prices should be the lever for climate action at COP26, says Martin Rossen, underlining that there is no time to waste.\l"

The YouGov findings echo feedback from secondary school pupils who took part in ScottishPower Renewables' COP26 'Let's Talk Energy' event, where green jobs and more investment to create clean energy were identified as what's needed to deliver a low-carbon future.Lindsay McQuade, CEO of ScottishPower Renewables, said: ""As a Principal Partner for COP26 and lead for the conference's youth theme, ScottishPower recognises the importance of listening to young people. Every action taken today will impact their future and it's vital that they therefore have their say on what they want for a cleaner and greener future.""This survey shows that children and young people understand the climate emergency and recognise that renewable energy has a crucial part to play as we move forward, electrify our lives and reduce our carbon footprint. We fully support the call for more renewable energy and we're doing everything we can to make it happen - investing almost 4 billion to double our current renewables capacity by 2025, with plans to treble it by 2030.""Importantly, the survey also shows that young people know we all have the power to make a real difference to the environment by making changes in how we live our lives. Whether that's in how we travel around, the food we eat or the clothes we wear - it all matters - and it's great that COP is inspiring such positive action from young people.""With human behaviour responsible for many of the changes to our planet, the only way we'll be successful in tackling the climate emergency is by everyone joining in and doing their bit. Young people understand that - it's something we can all learn from and something that can give us all hope for a clean energy future.""As part of its COP26 education programme, ScottishPower Renewables is also working with Glasgow Science Centre on a Renewables Challenge for 124 primary schools and 10 secondary schools.

"COP26","India","COP26_India47","Fund green India","April 12, 2022 Tuesday","The Telegraph (India)","India's decarbonization targets as laid out at COP26 may require enhanced fundingThe Union finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, made energy transition and climate action focal points in this year's budget. The ministry of environment, forest and climate change secured an allocation of Rs 3,030 crore. Yet, the question as to whether the financing would be adequate to ensure a timely transition to a sustainable environment stands.At COP26The crucial task of budgeting by placing the environment as the centrepiece is appreciated. But India's decarbonization targets as laid out at COP26 may require enhanced funding. The budget's allocation for a production linked incentive scheme that will facilitate domestic manufacturing for solar power would only meet the progressive goal of 280 GW of installed solar capacity, falling short of India's commitment of a 500 GW non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030. Additionally, India would need cumulative investments of $10.1 trillion to decarbonize its economy by 2070, as estimated by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water. The budget only highlights the huge investment shortfall, which India is keen to meet through finance from developed economies. While the National Hydrogen Mission announced in August 2021 may supplement India's efforts, the initiative is in a nascent stage. Further, no insight into the NHM has been provided by the budget.Reducing the economy's carbon intensity requires a transformative approach encompassing various sectors of the economy including,but not limited to, the energy sector. It also requires along-term and comprehensive financial plan covering energy, transport, construction and taxation to name a few sectors, such as the European Green Deal, whichprovides for long-term financing. Given that the returns on investments in climate action are not immediate, India should move towards long-term financial planning to meet its goals. Such sectoral interconnectedness would also become vital when considering the objective of creating a 'circular economy'.Although the proposal of issuance of sovereign green bonds for mobilizing resources for a green infrastructure is commendable, the government should have also considered other 'coming-of-age' financing instruments such as social impact bonds. This could increase the infusion of private equity into the public sector and align with the governmental focus on blended financing.TheEconomic Surveyacknowledges that India's climate actions are largely financed domestically. India demanded climate finance worth one trillion dollars at COP26. Even if it hopes to receive some contributions from the developed worldand multilateral funds to meet its targets, it would still need a financial road map of its own to meet its declared goals.Sustainability and climate goals have been a focus in this budget. The PLI scheme as well as green bonds could encourage investments to green Indian industry. However, the question of the adequacy of these measures looms large in light of India's ambitious climate goals.Tanvee Kanaujia ispursuing Development Studies in Geneva.Jyotsana Singh is acorporate lawyer\l"

Many climate-vulnerable countries are leading the way in reducing emissions. I congratulate Honduras for submitting early this year its updated NDC. Until 2030, Honduras is committed to carrying out adaptation and mitigation actions in the face of climate change. The country will aim to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 16%, restoring 1.3 million hectares of forests and reducing firewood consumption by 39%.Therefore, I congratulate the Honduran delegation, led by President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who is in Glasgow to join forces on all these issues.

The vulnerable nations need be helped to cope with the deadly impacts of global warming. The countries should submit long-term strategies for reaching net-zero by the end of 2022. Some flayed the draft pact for being soft while others welcomed its focus on the 1.5degC target. The draft released by COP26 President Alok Sharma will be negotiated and agreed by participating countries but the ""near final texts"" will be published soon to ""set the future for our children and grandchildren"".Scientists have warned that to arrest temperature rises to 1.5degC global emissions must be cut by 45% by 2030 and to zero overall by 2050. The COP26 draft urges countries to ""revisit and strengthen"" the targets for 2030 in their national plans to align them with the Paris Agreement goal of well below 2degC or 1.5degC by the end of 2022.Pledge for LDCs: To support countries most vulnerable to climate change, 12 donor governments pledged $413 million during the in new funding for the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF). Hosted by the Global Environment Facility, the LDCF is the only dedicated source of climate resilience funds for the 46 Least Developed Countries, which have contributed the least to carbon emissions but face the highest risks from climate change.Adaptation Fund: At COP26 annual Contributor Dialogue of the Adaptation Fund was held. It received a record-shattering US$ 351.6 million in new support from contributing national and regional governments. A record 15 donors including first-time contributors the U.S. and Canada announced new pledges shattering previous fundraising record to more than triple the amount.New Announcements on Adaptation: The COP26 is committed to shift towards adaptation through over 70 endorsements to the Principles for Locally Led Adaptation. Over $450m was mobilised for initiatives and programmes and $232 million was committed to the Adaptation Fund. This is the highest single mobilisation to the Fund and more than doubled the previous highest collective mobilisation.New climate providers have committed to balance through the Champions Group on Adaptation finance. Adaptation Communications or National Adaptation Plans now covers 88 countries against 38 in 2020. Zero Emission Vehicle Pledges: The COP26 also touched sustainable transport. As a Glasgow Breakthrough, 30 countries agreed to make zero emission vehicles accessible and affordable.The COP26The Zero Emission Vehicle Transition Council (ZEVTC) met with experts of the Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs), to discuss international collaboration. The ZEVTC launched its first annual Action Plan to accelerate the transition during 2022. The US joined the UK as a co-chair of the ZEVTC. The establishment of 'green shipping corridors' - zero-emission shipping routes between two ports - was supported by 19 governments to deploy zero-emission vessel technologies and to put alternative fuel and charging infrastructure in place in ports to allow for zero emission shipping on key routes across the globe.Seventeen countries shared updates on climate action over the two-day Multilateral Assessment (MA) and Facilitative Sharing of Views (FSV) events; 7 developing countries participated in the 11th workshop of the FSV and noted their commitment to transition towards the enhanced transparency framework.Multilateral Assessment (MA): Ten developed country underwent MA while several countries stressed the need to reduce energy-related emissions - especially in the transport sector - and boost energy independence. Pivotal progress was made on Sustainable Forest Management and Conservation with financial pledges, technical progress, and a declaration on 'Forests and Land Use'.Will COP26The answer is yes, but that begs another question: How much? The COP26 has raised public awareness to a new level and made people acutely aware of global warming. The latest IPCC report and the increased occurrence of extreme weather events and climatic disasters of last two years has intensified our grief. It is important to understand and remember that there is no Planet B. This hidden blue gem is our only home, and we need to save and protect it. No other species but humans bear the onus to develop means and measures to stop pollution and global warming before it is too late.Alok Sharma, the COP26 President also remarked, and I quote: ""This is our collective moment in history, this is our chance to forge a cleaner, healthier and more prosperous world, and this is our time to deliver on the high ambition set by our leaders at the start of the summit, we must rise to the occasion"".The pressure is increasing for taking concrete measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already pledged for zero emission by 2070 in Glasgow. The US and China have entered into an agreement to boost cooperation for climate change even after series of differences. World leaders are under fire for not taking urgent and stringent actions and decisions. Forest fires, increase in global temperature, melting of ice caps and glaciers are signs we cannot ignore. Although, nations have committed more funding to fight global warming, the ground action is still pending by large. We must harness Electric Energy, Solar Energy, Wind Energy, Geothermal Energy, etc., and reduce the consumption of fossil fuels by at least 80 percent if we want to save the Earth, our only home.

Of special importance is the affirmation of the 1.5C goal of the Paris Agreement, and the determination to keep that goal alive by reviewing the so-called Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in 2022.One of the main tasks of COP26 (the 26th annual conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)) was to receive and review updated NDCs from Parties to the Paris Agreement. The NDCs that countries submitted in Paris in 2015 would have resulted in global warming of over 3C, which is incompatible with the goal of the Paris Agreement of keeping warming well within 2C while pursuing efforts to keep warming within 1.5C. Many countries, including Iceland, updated their NDCs before COP26 and upgraded their ambition level. Still, the current NDCs are likely to result in 2.4C warming, according to the UN Environment Programme (UNEP).Iceland upgraded its ambition level from 40% cuts in greenhouse gas emissions to 2030 compared to 1990, to 55% cuts.

APWLD member and SERUNI Indonesia's Triana Wardani is one of the very few women representing grassroots communities from the global south who successfully arrived in Glasgow for the COP26. However, Triana noted that the discriminatory Covid-19 travel restrictions by the UK government made the process extremely difficult and alienating. The first week of COP26 ended on Saturday while on the UN premises powerful nations play politics of business as usual. The UK government has initially imposed strict restrictions on Covid-19 vaccines accepted by its government, which blatantly ignored vaccine inequity and capitalism orchestrated by the rich countries. When the UK government decided to remote its tighter restrictions, it was already too late for many feminist organisations. Triana added despite being physically present, feminists, grassroots women, along with other civil society organisations, have remained excluded at the COP26. Hours of queue every day, extremely inadequate ticketing system among many more logistical complications made it almost impossible for women from the Global South to take part in COP26. For Yasso Kanti Bhattachan of the National Indigenous Women Forum of Nepal, the world leaders cannot make decisions without meaningful participation of the rural and indigenous women of the Global South who are at the forefront of the war against climate emergency. ""Our voices are missing. World leaders have just declared their commitment to halt deforestation and land degradation with A\'bf14 billion by 2030. The fund is not only too small for a span of nine years, but there is also no meaningful consultation with Indigenous Peoples prior to the declaration.

An inter-ministerial meeting was held recently wherein all stakeholder departments across all sectors \- \- coal, steel, cement, transport, shipping, power, railways, civil aviation, urban development and more \- \- were asked to draw up action plans to help achieve the Cop26 goals at the earliest, ET has learnt. The impact of renewable energy (RE) scale-up on thermal power plants is under examination. Top of the list is the target to achieve 500GW of non-fossil fuel based energy capacity by 2030. Various panels have already begun meeting to detail every aspect of the scale-up \- \- from year-wise action plans for the increase in renewable energy, to ensuring a transmission system, storage options and purchase by discoms. On December 30, 2021, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy set up a committee for preparing a roadmap for 'Mission 500GW' co chaired by secretaries to the ministry of power and MNRE. It is tasked with defining state-wise and year-wise share of solar, wind and other renewab- le energy sources to achieve the target by 2030. The mission will look at ways to incentivise and make the storage concern affordable. A separate Group of Officers has been created by the power ministry in November 2021, days after the COP26 declaration, to formulate a policy framework to promote energy storage in the power sector. Four sub groups \- \- on policy and regulation, financial and taxation issues, technology and demand management \- \- have helped put toget- her a draft policy on energy storage which is under discussion, sources told ET. A third committee is looking at the other major issue that arises out of scaling up RE in Indiatransmission planning. Set up in December 2021 under cha- irperson of the Central Electricity Authority, this committee is to draw up plans for the requisite 'inter state transmission system'.  For enabling growth of RE capacity, areas which have high solar/ wind energy potential, as identified by MNRE, need to be connected to the Inter State Transmission System, so that the RE capacity can come up there and the target of having 500GW non fossil fuel capacity by 2030 can be achieved , a power ministry order on the panel reads. Another panel, under the co chairmanship of secretaries of Power and MNRE, has been set up last month to recommend Renewable Purchase Obligations beyond 2022. It will prepare a year-wise resource adequacy plan and plan an 'optimum generation mix' keeping in mind the present installed capacity and the requirement of additional power from various sources to meet the projected demand. The committee will also bear in mind the international consensus on environment and sustainable development goals besides 'balancing environmental and economic considerations', its terms of reference say. The panel will assess possibility of maximum and feasible RE capacity addition in the country, plan addition that is sufficient to 'fulfil international commitments' and avoid excess generation from any source to keep the cost of power purchase low and save discoms from financial distress.\l"

While there seems to be no agreement in the offing on the core issues, there are some positives on the periphery. For example, the US and China, the world's two largest emitters, have issued a joint statement. Though there is nothing new in the statement itself, which is more platitudinous than anything else, the coming together of the two countries, ""rather than pointing fingers at each other"" as Singh notes, is seen as a positive.

It will also feature more panels on climate science and environment ministers from a raft of countries will take the stage.Delegates from poor nations will ramp up pressure on their wealthy counterparts to compensate them for climate-linked losses and damage, such as coastal damage due to sea level rise or destruction caused by climate-charged wildfires.The demand stems from the agreed concept of ""common but differentiated responsibilities,"" enshrined in the original U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change brokered at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992.The idea is that developed countries must do more to help poorer nations, because rich countries are responsible for most historical emissions.Cautious optimism has emerged that COP26 in Glasgow can clinch a global carbon market deal unlocking trillions of dollars of green investment. There is fear, however, that bad rules could amount to greenwashing, the appearance of action with little practical impact on global emissions.Also on Tuesday, the think tank\~Climate Action Tracker will publish its analysis of how much warming the world is heading for,\~accounting for the\~emissions-cutting pledges made at COP26.Last week, the IEA said had also crunched those numbers, with the result showing the temperature rise could be held to within 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels - as long as all of the promises were fulfilled quickly and in full.\l"

Although met indifferently from many quarters, we think it is a big deal. Even in a Global Net Zero 2050 pathway (Wood Mackenzie's AET-1.5 scenario), India's net zero would arrive around 2070 - not all nations can move at the same pace.""The bone of contention though, is the variation between near-term 2030 reductions, and net zero pledges in the 2050-70 window. While the US, UK, EU-27, Japan and South Korea aim to nearly halve emissions by 2030, growing economies such as China and India do not have such a reduction target for 2030.""Prakash Sharma, Asia Pacific head of markets and transitions, added: ""China and India insisted the wording of the final text was amended to 'phase down' rather than 'phase out' coal-fired power. ""Last minute changes reflect current realities of individual energy markets where countries aim to prioritise supply security over environmental goals, at least through the medium term until other clean baseload supply options are commercially available at the scale that's needed to replace coal in power generation.""In Wood Mackenzie's AET-1.5 scenario (Global Net Zero 2050), coal's share in power generation falls to less than 5% by 2050 from 35% in 2020. Abatement pathways include retiring inefficient plants, co-firing low carbon fuels such as ammonia or hydrogen and retrofitting CCS.""Join our thought leaders - Simon Flowers, Ed Crooks and Gavin Thompson - at our COP26 webinar on November 18, as they discuss key takeaways of the conference and what it means for the industry.Source: Wood Mackenzie\l"

He will also be giving a talk at an Asthma UK and British Lung Foundation event where he will explain the council's initiatives to tackle air pollution. You can follow him as he shares his journey to Glasgow on social media.Councillor Waseem Zaffar said:I am excited to have the opportunity to visit Glasgow for and talk about the innovative work that Birmingham City Council is doing to tackle the climate emergency. Through our Route to Zero programme and the Birmingham Transport Plan we have set out ambitious plans that will transform our city for the better, reducing emissions, improving public transport and lowering the congestion that blights our citys roads.I welcome the progress made at COP26, and I hope that our Government will support local authorities as we make the transition to a green economy in the coming years.Councillor Zaffar is sharing today's experience with followers on Birmingham City Council's social media:7:15am Cllr Zaffar sets off at Birmingham New Street Station and tweets:Its Thursday morning just gone 7am and I am here at Birmingham New Street station, travelling up by train to COP26 and Im really excited that I will be participating in a couple of exciting events.I will be visiting the University of Birminghams Hydroflex train which is an exciting development and I will also be speaking at a clean air event and talking about our the Clean Air Zone and the wider work that we are doing across the city of Birmingham.9:25am Councillor Zaffar changes trains at Preston station where he tweets:Now Im getting on the second train of the morning going from Preston to Glasgow for COP26.The distance from Birmingham to Glasgow is 290 miles and the journey will take four hours and 20 minutes.In France the train from Paris to Lyon is also 290 miles in distance but takes just two hours; thats half the time from Birmingham to Glasgow; its a little cheaper too.If we are serious about tackling climate crisis her in the UK, we need faster, cheaper and more reliable trains that will encourage more people to leave their cars at home and take the train instead.Here in the UK our train system is struggling, our infrastructure is old and we lack the capacity to get people around the country quickly.The reality is that I could have flown to Glasgow from Birmingham today: it would have been cheaper and would have got me there much faster but at a much bigger environmental cost.We need the Government to back HS2 in its entirety if we are to cut our emissions, connect our cities and boost out countrys economy.12:15 to 2pm Councillor Zaffar experiences a ride on the UKs first hydrogen train and joins a panel discussion.18 people will board the UKs first hydrogen train in Glasgow for a ride before partaking in a panel discussion about innovative technology at the University of Birmingham round table, chaired by Lord Bilimoria, the Chancellor of the University of Birmingham and President of the CBI.

When she asks what happened at COP26, I will narrate five stories and let her draw her own conclusions.The drunk driver: A man was being prosecuted for drunk driving. Realising how dangerous this was, he promised to stop. The prosecutor protested that the defendant was a repeat offender. A few years earlier, he and some of his friends had stopped abiding by the rules altogether. The driver pleaded, ""There are other drivers out there who might drive drunk in future; they should also stop driving."" How did the judge rule?At COP26The broken pots: In a faraway land, village folk collected water in clay pots. It was arduous labour. One day, they hoped to enjoy the simple luxury of running water. On a nearby hill, rich people lived in big houses and had no water shortage. Their wealth came from quarrying stone in the valley. Occasionally, the dynamited rocks would fly into the village and smash into the clay water pots. Initially, the quarry owners denied responsibility. Later, they agreed to pay for the losses but no payment came. The quarrying intensified. Smashed pots lay strewn in the village. Stored water seeped away. The villagers packed up and left. Did the quarry owners pay?At COP26The merchant: Once upon a time, a merchant came to a bazaar with fine silk and quickly sold her wares. Realising the demand, the merchant agreed to come every year in return for guaranteed orders from the retailers. Next year, the merchant's caravan carried more stock, and got bigger orders. One day, the shopkeepers questioned the silk's quality, refusing to pay. While some bales were questionable, the inventory was mostly superior grade. For years they argued. Then the shopkeepers announced they would open a bigger bazaar. Did the merchant supply more fine silk?At COP26The rocket without fuel: One day, schoolchildren got notice of a competition to build a rocket. The rules said that middle school students from poor neighbourhoods must compete with high school students from fancy suburbs. The younger students would get rocket fuel. On competition day, there was no fuel. The dismayed children were assured they would get fuel the following year. The rockets got taller but the upscale high schoolers consumed the fuel. A new promise was made: Fuel after five years as long as the poorer kids built a bigger rocket each year. What did the middle schoolers do?At COP26The land grabbers: A wealthy man's ancestors worked fallow land, gradually becoming big landowners. When he came upon the inheritance, others complained that there was no land left. They compromised. The man would not take possession of any more land; others would try to grow more crops on less land. With each passing year, however, the man fenced in a little more of what remained, telling his frustrated neighbours to stop farming. Did they find other ways to get rich or did they grab land too?At COP26All stories have one lesson: The climate crisis will not be resolved until we can hold each other accountable. In Glasgow, initiatives were announced to cut methane emissions, end deforestation, shift to sustainable transport, or clean up heavy industry. Will the enhanced transparency framework shine a light on defaulters?All stories have one moral: Do unto others as you would like them to do unto you. There was a relative absolutism in climate negotiations: Hard push on the interests of rich countries with soft wording for the concerns of vulnerable countries. The call for climate justice was partially heeded and unsubstantially answered.My nine-year-old likes to write stories. When she writes historical fiction about climate negotiations, there will be few heroes.

It is the duty of the ministry of education to enrich the already present studies with the information most needed in the current times.According to activist groups, a collective effort from all governments will ensure that climate education is treated as an elementary necessity for the students, and is implemented with the newest scientific research and a modern approach in mind.The Declaration for Climate Education, if signed by the parties of the UN Climate Change Conference, will bring climate education to the political agenda.In the past week at COP26, young climate leaders came together in Glasgow with negotiators, officials and ministers from across the world, making their voices heard and demanding the action needed to prevent catastrophic climate change in our lifetimes.Events across COP26 focused on harnessing the expertise of young people and putting their views directly to the negotiators and officials working to agree global action on climate change.YOUNGO, the official Children's and Youth constituency of the UNFCCC which opened with a session called Unifying for Change: Global Youth voice, also presented the COY16 Global Youth Position statement, representing the views of over 40,000 young climate leaders from across the world.The statement presented their priorities directly to ministers, including action on climate finance, mobility and transportation, through to wildlife protection conservation.COP26 President Alok Sharma said: ""Wherever I have been in the world, I have been struck by the passion and the commitment of young people to climate action. The voices of young people must be heard and reflected in these negotiations here at COP.""I am also aware of the fear and anxiety many of them feel about the future of the planet, including my own children. That is why we must act on the COY16 Global Youth Position Statement from COY16 and the manifesto from the Milan Youth4Climate Summit.""Recognising climate change as an existential threat to humanity, an optimistic Indian schoolgirl from Tamil Nadu has impressed world leaders with an impressive address at COP26, saying she's not just from India but from Earth.The finalist of Prince William's Earthshot Prize, 15-year-old Vinisha Umashankar, amidst the presence of heads of state and government delegations said: ""I'm not just a girl from India. I'm a girl from earth and I'm proud to be so.""""I'm also a student, innovator, environmentalist and entrepreneur but most importantly, I'm an optimist,"" she said emphatically in her brief address that got a rousing applause from the audience, comprising Prince William, who stood on stage and proudly listened to her speech.The UK, hosting COP26, on November 5 announced its draft Sustainability and Climate Change strategy to equip and empower young people with the skills they need to drive the future of climate action.This includes the introduction of a Primary Science Model Curriculum, to include an emphasis on nature and the recognition of species, supporting the youngest pupils to develop conservation skills.Education Ministers from around the world also pledged to do the same with nations such as, South Korea, Albania and Sierra leone pledging to put climate change at the heart of their curriculums.COP26 follows a huge range of youth events and conferences across the world, including the Youth4Climate Summit Milan in September and the 16th UN Conference of Youth (COY16) in Glasgow last week.The UK and Italy, in partnership with UNESCO, Youth4Climate and Mock COP coordinated new global action to equip future generations with the knowledge and skills to create a net-zero world.As education ministers and young people gathered together, over 23 countries put forward impressive national climate education pledges, ranging from decarbonising the school sector to developing school resources.The UK also announced a new 85,000 pounds research grant to support the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre to produce better information on the education needs of refugee children and enable a more effective international response.The November 5 event coincided with negotiations on Action for Climate Empowerment, a UNFCCC agenda item aimed at setting the direction on climate education and public empowerment, and facilitating coordination between countries and non-state actors.\l"

We cannot erase the fact that certain countries - the United States, European Union-27, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Japan and Russia and joined now by China - have consumed roughly 70 per cent of the carbon budget, the space in the atmosphere that is available to keep the world below the 1.5degC temperature rise.

This was also the message he took to the world stage at COP26, where he described his policy of ""technology not taxes"" to be the core of ""the Australian way"".Most countries have a pavilion at the climate negotiations, where they host events and showcase their efforts to negotiators and observers. The Morrison government appeared to mistake COP26 for a fossil fuel expo - its pavilion was branded as ""Positive energy the Australian way"", which touted fossil fuels and carbon capture and storage.At Glasgow, the Morrison government also stuck with its paltry 2030 target, set in 2015 by the Abbott government, making it an extreme outlier among developed countries. It also refused to join the pledge to reduce methane emissions and another to phase out coal.Morrison set the tone at the G20 meeting in Rome, just days before Glasgow, when Australia joined China and India in blocking a proposed coal phase-out. Minister for Resources Keith Pitt has since made the government's position clear: Australia will continue to export coal for decades.Australia already had a bad reputationAustralia already had a reputation for ""gaming"" the processes of carbon accounting. But Morrison took creative carbon accounting to a new level at US President Joe Biden's climate summit in April.Seasoned climate analysts were shocked at the metrics used, such as excluding emissions associated with extracting fossil fuels for export. This breaks with the official methodology for measuring all emissions produced within a country's territory.

According to Donor Tracker, in recent years, Australia's climate-related aid has had ""cross-cutting objectives"" and none of it went to projects that address climate change as a ""principal goal"".'Aiming low'The annual climate COPs are, among other things, a global ""show and tell"". The problem for Australia is that it had nothing to show, and no amount of telling can cover this lack. As Lord John Deben, the UK's chief climate advisor told the ABC this week, ""it was just a whole series of words"", with no understanding of ""the urgency of what we have to do"".Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama tried a different tactic. At COP26, after urging Morrison to halve Australia's emissions by 2030, he handed him a copy of Fiji's Climate Change Act ""as a guide - it is our uniquely Fijian way of following the science to keep faith with future generations"".Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama is among world leaders who are unimpressed by Australia's climate approach. Czarek Sokolowski/AP/AAP The rise of ""scorecard diplomacy"" based on ratings and rankings of national climate performance has also made marketing cover-ups impossible.Key examples include Climate Action Tracker, which has rated Australia's overall performance as ""highly insufficient"", and the Climate Performance Index, which ranked Australia seventh last overall - and behind Russia - in the most recent assessment announced at COP26 this week.The ""Fossil of the Day"" awards go to those parties ""doing the most to achieve the least"" at the annual climate negotiations. Organised by Climate Action Network International, made up of over 1,500 environmental groups from around 140 countries, they are a talking point among negotiators.

The bone of contention is the change of language from 'phase out coal' to 'phase down coal' in the COP26 According to experts, focusing only on coal and not including oil and gas would disproportionately impact certain developing countries like China and India. India rightly said in negotiations that all fossil fuels must be phased down in an equitable manner. An equitable fossil fuel phase-out would place most of the burden squarely on the US and the other developed countries. The COP26 Notably, it was the US and China who first embraced the term ""phase down"" in their bilateral climate agreement, which was adopted with great fanfare in the middle of COP26. Meanwhile, India is the only country amongst G20 countries which is on track of achieving the goals fixed under Paris Agreement. India has not only complied with its own commitments but also protected the interest of least developed countries and strongly negotiated the interest of G77 countries to secure climate finance which COP26 has agreed to work upon for enhancing the same. While several developed countries are taking more than 50 years (and some even 70 years) for achieving Net Zero targets after their peaking year, India would achieve the same within 30 years or so.

"COP26","India","COP26_India103","COP26: Kerry's global methane pact lacks emissions targets","January 20, 2022","Indian Oil and gas news","January 20 -- As the U.S. and European Union sought to recruit nations in a first-ever pact to slash the world's methane emissions, America's climate envoy John Kerry kept his sales pitch simple.Signing the pledge, being released at the COP26 climate summit Tuesday, would amount to shared recognition of the problem posed by the potent greenhouse gas - not a ""burden"" to cut individual emissions, Kerry said.""You're not pledging that you're going to get X percentage - 10, 20, 30%, 40%,"" Kerry told countries during a ministerial on the effort last month. ""You're pledging that you're going to be part of a global effort to have a global reduction of 30%.""The result is a pledge that isn't binding on the nations that sign it. They are under no obligation to cut their own methane emissions by a set amount, just to ""commit to a collective goal of reducing global methane emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030"" and to pursue the best available approaches to quantify the problem, according to an EU-U.S. release.That's lowered the bar for more than 90 nations - including cattle-rich Brazil - to sign on. Though the country is joining the methane agreement, the latest document detailing its environmental measures doesn't include any policies on limiting releases of the gas.The approach, like the Paris Agreement, tacitly recognizes that one-size-fits-all targets aren't suitable for countries at different levels of development.Large oil and gas producers, such as the U.S. and Canada, can deploy effective, relatively inexpensive technology to plug industry leaks today. But for France, Brazil and other countries whose methane emissions are largely tied to livestock and harder to cull, reductions would be slower. ""Countries have widely varying methane emissions profiles and reduction potential, but all can contribute to achieving the collective global goal through additional domestic methane reduction and international cooperative actions,"" the EU and U.S. said in a joint statement.The pledge represents the first international political commitment to take on methane, which pound-for-pound has 84 times the heat-trapping power of carbon dioxide in the first 20 years after it's released. If the target is fulfilled, it would prevent 0.2 degrees Celsius of warming. Still, it's only a first step. To be compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels, the reduction level has to be closer to 45%, according to a United Nations report.EU and U.S. officials who worked on the initiative expect it to develop more teeth and accountability, with annual efforts to take stock of reductions toward the 2030 reduction target.Mark Brownstein, senior vice president of energy at the Environmental Defense Fund, said methane measurements by private groups and the UN's new International Methane Emissions Observatory will be critical to holding signers accountable. That ""will provide us with the data we need to assess whether commitments and plans result in actual emissions reductions,"" he said.The initial work was getting countries to sign up and ensuring ""we have the strongest possible launch of this global methane pledge at ,"" said Rick Duke, White House liaison for the special presidential envoy for climate change.

The focus during COP26 has very much been around electric vehicles, and of course they have a role to play but we dont always have to reinvent the wheel, electric or otherwise, to respond to the climate emergency. The bike is one of the most important tools we have in building better, healthier communities, cutting emissions and saving the planet.We need to reduce car use and make it easier for people to choose walking, wheeling, cycling and public transport.

And under the document, funding could still flow to oil, gas and coal ventures in limited and clearly defined circumstances, as long as they are consistent with keeping warming to 1.5-degrees Celsius.Countries signing the statement ""aligning international public finance with a clean energy transition"" are set to include Canada, the U.S. and Denmark, while Sweden is not expected to join, said the people. Deliberations were still ongoing as of late Wednesday, one of the people said. Several financial institutions are on board, one person said.Although several governments, including the UK, U.S. and European Union have previously advanced plans to forswear fossil fuel finance, the new statement would force many to go further to block funding from regional development banks such as the U.S. Export-Import Bank and U.S. International Development Finance Corp., one person said.International public finance is now lopsided in favor of fossil projects. In 2020, the Group of 20 nations alone contributed nearly $600 billion to oil, gas and coal projects, according to BloombergNEF estimates -- a sum six times the amount of climate finance due to be delivered by developing countries last year.The UK business department had no immediate comment.\l"

Some encouraging progress was made as agreement was finally reached on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which relates to carbon market mechanisms, paving the way for effective implementation of the Paris deal to cut emissions through market-based approaches. Negotiators also agreed to phase down coal, the dominant source of carbon dioxide emissions in the process of electricity generation. It is the first explicit mention of fossil fuels in a COP agreement. During COP26, more than 100 countries have promised to end deforestation by 2030. In the final days of the conference, China and the United States issued a joint declaration on enhancing climate change actions in the 2020s, which is widely welcomed and believed can galvanize global collective actions. The two countries agreed to establish a working group on enhancing climate action this decade to promote cooperation on climate change between the two countries as well as multilateral processes. The Glasgow Climate Pact will help kick-start a new journey of global efforts to tackle climate change, Zhao Yingmin, head of the Chinese delegation to COP26, told Xinhua. The new global deal, especially the close of the rulebook of Paris Agreement, bears great significance for defending multilateralism and the implementation of the Paris Agreement, said Zhao, who is Chinas vice minister of ecology and environment. However, some stubborn issues, notably climate funding, remain uncertain. There were commitments to significantly increase financial support through the Adaptation Fund as developed countries were urged to double their support to developing countries by 2025. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen whether developed countries, whose industrialization is responsible for most of todays climate change impacts, will follow the set timeframe. In 2009, wealthy countries pledged 100 billion U.S. dollars a year to help lower-income nations by 2020. However, they still have not made good on the pledge and recent reports indicate that this goal could slip to 2023. There is some progress. However, it still falls short of expectations. There are still lots of regrets. The developed nations have failed to well address the core concerns of developing countries over such issues as adaptation, finance and technological support, Zhao said. It is hoped that the developed countries can make further efforts to honor their commitments, enhance support for developing countries, instead of merely urging other parties to raise their ambitions, he added. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also urged developed countries to honor their climate finance commitment to restore political trust. No more IOUs, he said. COP26, which kicked off on Oct. 31, is the first climate change conference after the five-year review cycle under the Paris Agreement inked in 2015.

Work on having a definite plan to compensate disasterhit countries will now be shifted to COP27 in Egypt next year.Some nations criticised India's insistence on a softer reference to fossil fuels, but Indian officials said the country has voluntarily set aggressive green energy targets and there is need for an overall view on issues, including finance to developing nations.The pact also moves on finalising the last piece of the unfinished agenda  a mechanism for a carbon market (Article 6) and transparency  of the Paris Agreement rulebook. The declaration also promises to deliver greater amounts of finance to developing countries by deciding to double the quantum for adaptation by 2025 and take steps to help vulnerable countries deal with losses and damages from climate impacts. The overall pact was finally adopted when the COP26 presidency accommodated India's objections to phase-out of coal and fossil fuel subsidies.The change from  phaseout to  phase-down with respect to coal power use in the final text was agreed during the last-minute amendments to build the consensus.Just before convening the final plenary, UK COP26 president Alok Sharma and his team members were seen trying to convince India's environment minister Bhupender Yadav over the text as the latter strongly objected to it on the reference of coal and fossil fuel while intervening during the stock taking. Both leaders were even seen looking at the amended version which Yadav finally proposed and the plenary accepted.

President Janos Ader has highlighted how this weeks United Nations COP26 conference in Glasgow did not yield enough specific commitments aimed at combating climate change.Speaking to public broadcaster Kossuth Rdi, President der said the fact that the worlds top emitters had failed to make substantial progress at the G20 summit in Rome over the weekend had already been a bad sign ahead of the conference. Meanwhile, China, Brazil, Russia and Turkey were not even present in Glasgow, he added.The president noted that six years ago countries joined the Paris climate accord on a voluntary basis. They agreed to review their progress on the commitments agreed on in the pact in five years time. These, President der noted, included a reduction in CO2 emissions and keeping global warming below 2C as against pre-industrial levels. But, he added, it had already been clear in Paris that the world would not even succeed in limiting global warming to the minimum target, let alone 1.5C. And the only reason why this target made it into the agreement was because the small island countries wouldnt have signed it without it, as theyre the ones most threatened by climate change if they are flooded by the rising waters, he said.President der said more and more was being made of the 1.5C target even though the worlds chances were fading to meet even the 2 degree target. If this keeps up, global temperatures will rise by 2.7C, he said. The president said many had expected the Glasgow conference to produce an agreement on phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, a ban on the construction of new coal-fired power plants, or a deal on developed countries mobilizing 100 billion dollars per year in climate finance to developing countries. So far, some 80 billion dollars has been mobilised for this purpose, with the EU27 having contributed their share, he said. As regards the positive takeaways from the conference, President der welcomed Indias commitment to achieve climate neutrality by 2070 and to have 50% of its electricity come from renewable energy by 2030. The commitment by 100 countries to halt and reverse forest loss by 2030 can also be considered a step in the right direction, he added.\l"

The bone of contention is the change of language, from 'phase out coal' to 'phase down coal'.Here are the facts:This is the first COP decision to mention coal, so there is definite progress.Experts say that by focusing only on coal and not including oil and gas, this text would disproportionately impact certain developing countries like China and India. India said in negotiations that all fossil fuels must be phased down, in an equitable manner.But an equitable fossil fuel phaseout would place most of the burden squarely on the US and rich countries. Instead, the # existing language has heavy implications for developing countries like India and tons of loopholes for the continuation of US fossil fuel activities.When India called out this inequity, they were portrayed as obstructionists blocking the first-ever mention of fossil fuels.It was the U.S. and China who first embraced the term ""phase-down"" in their bilateral climate agreement, which was adopted with great fanfare in the middle of COP26. Before the dramatic final plenary, the U.S. even signalled acceptance of the ""phase-down"" language that had been used in the joint statement with China, according to a person familiar with the U.S. position who asked not to be named.""You have to phase down coal before you can - quote - end coal,"" John Kerry, the U.S. climate envoy, said at a press conference after the final text had been adopted.Two people familiar with late discussions on the side l"

It shows that under the short-term goals set by countries on emissions reduction, the temperature will rise up to 2.4C by the end of this century. Another assessment made by Climate Action Tracker (CAT), the worlds most respected source of climate analysis, indicates the same result air temperature will rise by 2.4C by the end of this century.Prior to this, other estimations had been published during COP26 which had assumed that under the latest commitments and the long-term goals set by participating states, including India aiming to become carbon neutral by 2070, the temperature would have risen to 1.8C or 1.9C. If this was achievable then the increase could still be kept within the Paris Agreements upper limit of 2C. CAT also found that under current commitments, in 2030 emissions will be twice as high as they should be if we are to remain at around 1.5C.What is more, CAT discovered that there is inconsistency between the countries pledges concerning emission reductions and the actual policies they carry out to achieve this. Based on the current measures that are being undertaken to curb climate changes, the temperature will rise up to 2.7C by the end of century and if we want to maintain the global temperature at around 1.5C, we need to cut global emissions by 45% within this decade alone.We are concerned that some countries are trying to portray COP26 as if the 1.5C limit is nearly in the bag.

Throughout the hectic week the weather was an odd combination of dark clouds, pouring rain and blue skies that switched over short periods of time, and ended up with a few rainbows -- an appropriate greeting from Mother Nature, marking its own special day at COP26.COP26 venue, while delegations made a few new commitments to invest in nature-based solutions and greener farming practices. COP26, with a gathering of around 200 governments, is being held in uncertain times of weather-related disasters have increased five-fold in the past 50 years alone. Humanity and especially vulnerable communities are adapting to a new reality of weather extremes. The most important highlights from the first week at COP26 were global methane pledge, global forest pledge, carbon pricing, etc. Climate negotiators told IANS on Sunday the commitments and initiatives seen in the first week of COP26, if fully delivered, would amount to 40 per cent of the emissions cuts needed by 2030 to keep 1.5C alive. The International Energy Agency (IEA) believes the commitments made in the first week could put world on track for 1.8C warming, which means they were short-term actions and credible policies still lacking. According to the UN, there was no clear indication of where talks will lead or how ambitious countries will be in tackling the climate emergency. Ministers arriving early this week will seek to resolve points of contention, with COP26 President Alok Sharma calling this ""where the rubber hits the road"". The aim is to conclude with agreement on greater emission cuts, stronger efforts on adaptation and resilience, and more climate finance. Many issues must still be worked out. With progress so far being insufficient to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, there is a strong call for countries to update nation climate plans more regularly, even annually. Many countries are pushing for eliminating fossil fuel subsidies and phasing out coal-fired power plants. Negotiations are proceeding on boosting measures for climate adaptation and resilience as well as ""loss and damage"" compensation for those harmed by climate change. Also under negotiation are contentious provisions on finance, trade and transparency. In the past week, the COP26 Presidency announced that 45 governments, led by the UK, will ramp up efforts to protect nature and shift to more sustainable farming. Over $4 billion in new public sector investment was pledged for agricultural innovation, including climate-resilient crops and regenerative solutions to improve soil health. This would help make such techniques affordable for hundreds of millions of farmers. Canada announced C$1 billion in international support for nature-based solutions, a fifth of its climate finance. It supports an international target to protect 30 per cent of lands and oceans by 2030, and earlier announced it would back a fund for coral reefs. The youth press for action. Presenting a position paper endorsed by 40,000 people, youth representatives urged world leaders to consider young people's demands in climate talks. The paper calls for ensuring the representation of underrepresented groups, recognizing the role of cities in achieving a just transition, and respecting, protecting, fulfilling and promote all human rights in climate action. World leaders have left Glasgow. Attention at COP26 turned to the specifics of moving the climate action agenda, with a focus on how to finance the transition to a greener future. The issue of finance is all encompassing. There is much concern over the failure of developed countries to meet their promise to provide $100 billion a year to help developing countries finance climate mitigation and adaptation. At the same time, there is a broader effort to mobilize vast amounts of private investment globally behind low-carbon and eventually no-carbon growth. In the COP26COP26 World Leaders' Summit got underway. ""We face a moment of truth,"" UN Secretary-General AntAnio Guterres pointedly told the 120 leaders who came to Glasgow. ""We are fast approaching tipping points that will trigger escalating feedback loops of global heating."" Frustration at the slow pace of climate action was a common theme. Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the UK, which is hosting the conference, said, ""I was there in Paris six years ago when we agreed to net zero and to try to restrain the rise in the temperature of the planet to 1.5 degrees, and all those promises will be nothing but blah blah blah -- to coin a phrase -- and the anger and impatience of the world will be uncontainable unless we make this COP26 in Glasgow the moment when we get real about climate change -- and we can."" Many leaders said Glasgow represents a last chance to make a difference. Many said it needed to be a pivotal moment to set the world on a sustainable trend. The Glasgow Climate Conference officially got underway on October 31 with palpable tension as it has to deliver real progress on climate action with the science showing that time is running out. But collective global ambition and trust remain woefully insufficient. ""We are not where we need to be,"" UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa said at a press conference. November 6 was also Global Day of Action for Climate Justice. In Glasgow an estimated 50,000 people made their way through the city. Climate marches also took place in many other cities around the world. ""What do we want? Climate justice! When do we want it? Now!"" echoed throughout Glasgow on Friday as thousands of protesters took the streets during the dedicated Youth Day at COP26. Although the march was initially organized by Fridays for Future, the youth-driven movement inspired by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, people of all ages gathered at George Square to demand climate action. Responding to weeklong developments, Mohamed Adow, Director of Nairobi based think tank Power Shift Africa, shared his concerns with IANS that COP26 is undermining the principles which underpin the UNFCCC. He said: ""This week has seen a blitz of announcements from the UK government with pledges and alliances committing to various positive sounding initiatives such as ending deforestation, stopping overseas fossil fuel financing and the absurd claim from Mark Carney that he has mobilised $130 trillion of private finance to tackle climate change.

Now, a group of 47 countries have committed to develop climate-resilient and low-carbon health systems at the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (CoP26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).The commitment was made part of CoP26 Health Programme, which is supported by the United Kingdom government as the Presidency of COP26, the World Health Organization (WHO), Health Care Without Harm (HCWH) and the UNFCCC Climate Champions.The programme comprises 47 countries - including Bangladesh, Bhutan, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. At least 42 have also committed to transform their health systems to make them more sustainable and low-carbon; 12 said they will reach Net Zero carbon emissions on or before 2050.Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general, WHO, said:The future of health must be built on health systems that are resilient to the impacts of epidemics, pandemics and other emergencies, but also to the impacts of climate change, including extreme weather events and the increasing burden of various diseases related to air pollution and our warming planet.The move comes in the backdrop of WHO health and climate change global survey report, 2021, which found that only three-quarters of surveyed countries have developed or are currently developing national health and climate change plans or strategies.Some 85 per cent countries have a designated focal point responsible for health and climate change in their ministries of health. In 54 per cent countries, the ministry of health has established a stakeholder mechanism (such as a task force or committee) on health and climate change, the report said.The message from WHO and health professionals around the globe is clear: Climate change is a huge health challenge and we need to act now, said Wendy Morton, minister for Europe and Americas, in the United Kingdom's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.He added that strong leadership from the health sector is vital to make sure we protect our populations from the impacts of climate change by enhancing the climate resilience of health systems, and by reducing emissions from the health sector.cop26 Climate change and health climate-resilient .

"COP26","India","COP26_India143","Independent environmental audits may benefit companies reporting sustainability goals; The Indian government gained a global appreciation for announcing the net....","April 22, 2022 Friday","The Financial Express","The world, as we know it today, needs to take radical steps to prevent environmental degradation. It has become necessary to put processes in place that can ensure sustainable growth.The Indian government gained a global appreciation for announcing the net-zero goals at COP26 concluded in Glasgow, Scotland, last year. Since then, the government has been taking several steps to reduce the country's carbon emissions. It is also encouraging industries to increase their contribution toward helping India become a carbon-neutral country. As a step towards encouraging sustainable business practices, it brought in the new environment, social and governance (ESG) reporting provision for 1000 companies that top the list in terms of market capitalisation.This may be a good move to get more companies to embrace sustainability goals to reduce their carbon footprint. However, most companies still fall short of meeting global standards that allow the public and investors to evaluate how sustainable the company may be. What companies need is a robust set of sustainability-related reporting standards to enable investment.This is where environmental sustainability (ES) audits may prove beneficial.How an ES audit can help overcome challenges in ESG reportingAn environmental sustainability audit can provide an unbiased third-party validation for an organisation's current policies, processes, and practices. Companies can use the audit to examine in-depth their entire environmental management system and associated processes. This includes all sustainability policies, processes, and practices. Sustainability audits can help businesses assess their capacity to sustain in the future while preparing them to take the requisite steps to adapt to potential changes.One of the challenges faced by Indian companies in sustainability reporting is the lack of independent verification and assurance of reports.According to a study, only a fraction of the reports are independently assured. Independent verification goes a long way in providing comfort to stakeholders, management, and the board in mitigating the risks posed by sustainability issues.Another challenge is that the performance of Indian corporate reporting is not up to the mark when compared with companies from the European Union, China, and Japan.The same study points out that although Indian companies are proactive towards sustainable issues, there are still many areas that are not properly addressed. These include inclusive employment,education, employment creation, health, corporate-government collaboration, land and displacement, natural resource management, climate change, corporate governance, solid waste, and water management.Most of the time Indian companies fail to come out with innovative approaches to addressing sustainable issues.Benefits of an ES AuditAn ES audit can help companies put in a structured route toward continual improvement and best practice standards. They can use the audit to put in processes that help monitor current and changing environmental legislation.Companies can expect improved environmental management systems and resource efficiency.Assessment of current systems will allow companies to plan on how to meet standards. Overall companies can use such audits to demonstrate commitment to customers, employees, suppliers, shareholders, and the local community.Audits help organisations get insights on developments within the organisation while checking systems and procedures. Environmental auditing can unveil weaknesses of an organisation's strategy, therefore reducing the risk of unexpected events. A structured environmental sustainability audit will bring real benefits to an organisation committed to acting on the results.Implementing ES audits requires commitment at all levelsAn environmental sustainability audit can be undertaken by any organisation, irrespective of its size. However, implementation can be a challenge for companies undertaking such an exercise for the first time.For companies planning their first steps in implementing environmental management, the audit can be used as a road map for both short- and long-term plans for environmental performance improvement. However, for an audit to be successful it will require participation at all levels within the organization.Typically, an audit involves an on-site review of relevant documentation followed by interviews and discussions with relevant stakeholders (including top management).It helps to benchmark and validate ongoing initiatives in sustainability.The assessment may be based on a host of areas including assessing ESG risks, planning control measures, allocating roles and responsibilities, implementing and maintaining controls, communication and training, monitoring effectiveness, and reviewing and revising arrangements. This will require coordination and support from various departments within an organization.With the changing outlook on sustainability reporting, companies would need to go beyond traditional environmental management systems such as ISO 14001.An independent environmental sustainability audit can help demonstrate environmental credentials to customers, supply chain, and other stakeholders. It can also be beneficial by being more resource-efficient and cost-effective.(The author isCountry Head, British Safety Council, India.Views expressed are personal and do not reflect the official position or policy of the FinancialExpress.com.)\l"

GCC is MENA region's first voluntary carbon offsetting program that is expected to issue more than 20 million carbon credits by 2022.Representing GCC programs senior leadership, a delegation from the programs operations team joined the event with technical presentations, seminars and panel discussions about carbon offsetting and carbon finance among other topics addressing climate change.Leading the team at the event was GCC Programs President, Dr. Yousef Alhorr. Introducing the program to a multidisciplinary audience from international organizations attending COP26, Dr. Alhorr said, In the beginning around 2016, the idea and purpose behind GCCs inception was to assist MENA region through capacity building, developing project level MRV and bringing the ecosystem to MENA to operate carbon market instruments on ground. Now with CORSIA and ICROA accreditation of the GCC program, we have launched it globally. GCC program is rapidly growing and we aim to contribute at much higher scale by delivering high-quality and integrity projects in the coming years.GCCs Contribution at COP26At COP26, UNFCCC ActionHub highlights global initiatives that have made remarkable contribution through climate change mitigation initiatives. Among these select initiatives was GCC. The program was selected by UNFCCC to showcase its efforts in catalyzing sustainable development projects in MENA region.As part of IETA BusinessHub, GCCs operations team presented on the programs upcoming innovative green finance initiative which is developed to support project owners in their endeavor to contribute to the efforts of GHG emissions reduction. GCCs proposed finance facility, highlighted at IETA BusinessHub, can catalyze innovation in sustainable technologies.Expanding the reach of the GCC program, its operations team also engaged in a panel discussion at the Turkey Pavilion where members discussed how the program is assisting international organizations to offset their unavoidable carbon emissions while also supporting the development of emission reduction projects and catalyzing climate actions.At Qatar Pavilion, GCC representatives underscored ways in which the program can support Qatar National Climate Change Action Plan 2030 in meeting the nations target to reduce 25% greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.With more than 55 GHG reduction projects submitted so far, GCC program is expected to reach up to 120 projects in the first quarter of 2022.

The campaign will highlight how a pathway to net zero and greater energy resilience is possible by harnessing sustainable hydropower as a complement to variable renewables such as wind and solar.The campaign comes after world leaders at COP26, the United Nations climate change conference, committed to phase down coal and accelerate the shift towards renewables. While the Glasgow Climate Pact is welcome, governments have not made sufficient progress in planning for the transition.Commitments now need to be translated into policies, investments and tangible action ahead of COP27 in Egypt this November. The new campaign will shine a light on hydropowers benefits and advance solutions for building a sustainable and secure energy future.We can rapidly reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and bring stability and securityEddie Rich, Chief Executive for IHA, said: We cannot afford any more delays in taking action to shift away from fossil fuels like coal. With hydropower, we have a proven, clean technology that can supercharge the deployment of renewable energy systems and set us on the pathway towards net zero.By combining the strengths of wind, solar and hydropower, we can rapidly reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and bring stability and security to energy grids. Wind and solar energy can be stored in water, and then released quickly whenever needed.Hydropower generates electricity all year round and has low running costs, providing affordable energy for communities over the long term. But projects can take up to a decade to build and require significant upfront investment. If we do not act now, then we will miss our opportunity to set a realistic course for net zero by 2050.We are at risk of stalling on the progress made at COP26Leading voices joining the call for action include former Prime Minister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull, former Prime Minister of New Zealand Helen Clark, Swiss Secretary of State for Energy Benot Revaz, and sustainability pioneer Dr Ashok Khosla.Malcolm Turnbull, a Board member for IHA, said: We are at risk of stalling on the progress made at COP26Now is the time for policymakers everywhere to make the argument for hydropower, alongside wind and solar power.

They have turned their backs on indigenous communities, small-scale farmers, women and girls who desperately need support to recover and rebuild after climate disasters. This is a matter of great injustice.She said: While there has been important progress over the past two weeks there is a sense as Mary Robinson said that some world leaders were not in crisis mode. We are in an emergency, and we needed world leaders to act like we are in an emergency. The clock is ticking. People are experiencing devastating consequences of climate inaction right now.Ms Curran said while the commitment to urgently deliver $100bn for climate finance is welcome, it is still a fraction of the amount that will be needed in the face of the climate emergency.Trocaire CEO, Caoimhe de Barra, said: A huge amount of work has been done in the last two weeks and a positive element was that the eyes of the world were focused on the critical issues resulting from the climate crisis.

"COP26","India","COP26_India151","Delivering climate action: The road ahead for India after CoP26","December 16, 2021 Thursday","Down To Earth","India, Dec. 16 -- We need many more important and concrete measures to drastically reduce emissions.One of the most striking images from the 26th Conference of Parties (CoP26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was Simon Kofe, Tuvalu's foreign minister, standing knee-deep in the sea to deliver his speech. We don't need any more scientific evidence of the dreadful consequences of climate change - the world is experiencing it. Not only is it happening, but it is speeding up.The Glasgow Climate Pact has strengthened our commitment to combat climate change, but the goal of restricting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels is still some distance away., 'it is time to go into emergency mode - or our chance of reaching net zero will itself be zero'.At CoP26, India pledged to become a 'net zero' carbon emitter by 2070, and announced enhanced targets for renewable energy deployment and reduction in carbon emissions.Achieving these targets will require focus on three important areas: Increasing renewable energy capacity, decarbonising emission intensive sectors and creating more carbon sinks.The share of renewable energy in India's energy mix has more than doubled from 11.8 per cent in March 2015 to 25.2 per cent in July 2021, and we need to maintain this momentum. A NITI Aayog report estimates that the sector requires $4.5 trillion to meet the infrastructure gap and increase the share of renewable energy to 50 per cent by 2030.The Climate Finance Leadership Initiative launched by India and the United Kingdom in September to generate more resources for climate and green energy projects is a positive step in this direction. We need to ensure policies and investments shift from the grey to green economy, giving up fossil fuel and making societies and people more resilient to climate shocks. They must catalyse creation of green jobs and secure just transition for workers currently engaged with fossil fuel-based industries.India has been a dependable partner in addressing the energy needs of neighbouring countries. Recently, Indian Energy Exchange, a domestic power trading platform, started cross-border electricity trade aiming to create an integrated regional power market in South Asia.Such platforms must adopt a 'renewable first' approach as they scale up. For instance, they can build upon initiatives like One Sun, One World, One Grid (OSOWOG), launched by India at CoP26. Led by the International Solar Alliance (ISA), an international organisation created after CoP21, where India was a founder-member, the first phase of OSOWOG plans to create a South Asian network for energy exchange.India's huge transmission network and synchronised grids transmitting power from one corner of the country to another would provide a lot of learning to connect energy grids across borders for renewable energy adoption under OSOWOG.We have enough institutions and policies to achieve our renewable energy goals. The need of the hour is to build on such synergies and ensure impact.Second, we need to decarbonise emission-intensive sectors. India has made significant progress in reducing emission intensity.India has successfully reduced its emission intensity of gross domestic product by 24 per cent. However, more efforts are required to reduce emissions in heavy industries like iron and steel, chemicals and cement. These are also some of the highest emitters and demand for their products is also growing due to rapid urbanisation and economic growth.An 'ecosystem-based' approach, which looks at greening both 'supply' and 'demand', is the way ahead. For example, the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles scheme offers incentives to both the automotive sector and consumers to boost electric vehicle sales.This is being complemented with developing domestic capacities for manufacturing lithium-ion batteries and creating charging infrastructure. Similar approaches are needed in other industries.Third, we need more 'carbon sinks' - areas that store carbon, like forests, oceans and wetlands. Our efforts to reduce emissions must be complemented with creation of more carbon sinks. This is where the role of local communities is vital, many of whom live in close harmony with nature and depend on natural resources for subsistence and livelihoods.I recently witnessed this during my visits to Ladakh and Odisha. While both landscapes and cultures were very different, the one thing common was the respect local people gave to nature and their commitment towards safeguarding it.Unfortunately, these communities are also at the frontl"

They reflect the interests, the conditions, the contradictions and the state of political will in the world today. They take important steps. But unfortunately, the collective political will was not enough to overcome some deep contradictions,"" Guterres was quoted as saying by Xinhua news agency on the conclusion of COP26 on Saturday.""Science tells us that the absolute priority must be rapid, deep and sustained emissions reductions in this decade, specifically, a 45-percent cut by 2030 compared to 2010 levels. But the present set of Nationally Determined Contributions, even if fully implemented, will still increase emissions this decade on a pathway that will clearly lead us to well above 2 degrees by the end of the century compared to pre-industrial levels,"" he said.He welcomed the agreement between the US and China in Glasgow that pledges to accelerate action to reduce emissions in the 2020s.To help lower emissions in many other emerging economies, there is a need to build coalitions of support including developed countries, financial institutions, those with the technical know-how. This is crucial to help each of those emerging countries speed the transition from coal and accelerate the greening of their economies, he said.""I want to make a particular appeal for our future work in relation to adaptation and the issue of loss and damage,"" said Guterres.\~""Adaptation isn't a technocratic issue, it is life or death. Protecting countries from climate disaster is not charity. It is solidarity and enlightened self-interest.""""We have another climate crisis today. A climate of mistrust is enveloping our globe. Climate action can help rebuild trust and restore credibility. That means finally delivering on the 100-billion-dollar climate finance commitment to developing countries. No more IOUs. It means measuring progress, updating climate plans every year and raising ambition ... And it means, beyond the mechanisms already set out in the Paris Agreement, establishing clear standards to measure and analyse net-zero commitments from non-state actors.""He said COP26 created some building blocks for progress: commitments to end deforestation, to drastically reduce methane emissions, to mobilize private finance around net-zero emissions.And the texts today reaffirm resolve toward the 1.5-degree goal, boost climate finance for adaptation, recognize the need to strengthen support for vulnerable countries suffering from irreparable climate damage. And for the first time they encourage international financial institutions to consider climate vulnerabilities in concessional financial and other forms of support, including Special Drawing Rights.

Key issues included the global warming limit of 1.5 degrees, robust rules for counting and reporting international transfers of emissions reductions, and dealing with loss and damage caused by climate change. Countries agreed on rules that exclude the double counting of emissions reductions achieved abroad, thereby resolving the outstanding technical issues of the Paris Agreement. Switzerland campaigned strongly at COP26 to prevent such double counting, having previously committed to strict emissions trading rules in several bilateral agreements.The 26th UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow ended on 13 November. Under the Paris Agreement, nations must take concrete steps from 2020 to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions with a view to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. At COP26, Switzerland advocated for strong rules to ensure that the Paris Agreement is implemented effectively. ""It became clear in Glasgow that the world is saying goodbye to oil, coal and gas,"" said Federal Councillor Simonetta Sommaruga before the press as the climate talks came to an end. She noted that, while progress had been made on certain points, ""we cannot be truly satisfied with the outcome of this COP.""National climate targetsCountries were called upon at COP26 to strengthen their emissions targets for 2030 by the end of 2022. In the final text adopted, parties also agreed for the first time to reduce 'unabated' coal power, i.e. where emissions are not technically reduced, as well as inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels like oil and gas. While Switzerland welcomes this development, it had advocated at the conference for the complete dismantling of all fossil fuel subsidies and a phase-out of all use of coal.Emissions reductions achieved abroadA solution was reached on international transfers of emissions reductions, with delegates agreeing on rules that prevent double counting between the countries involved. The agreement also avoids double counting of emissions reductions between nations and the CORSIA emissions trading system for aviation. Private individuals may participate in this market through voluntary climate-reducing activities without double counting, although such reductions cannot be counted towards their countries' climate targets. This represents a success for Switzerland, which campaigned at the conference against double counting and has demonstrated through bilateral climate protection agreements that such arrangements are possible.Switzerland remains committed to ensuring robust climate protection rules in the future, as reflected in the various bilateral climate agreements signed with partner countries since 2020. During the conference Switzerland entered into two more such agreements, with Vanuatu and Dominica.Transparency in emissions reportingAnother key element of the Paris Agreement is the transparency with which countries monitor and report their progress in reducing emissions. The parties reached agreement at COP26 on how to report their emissions reductions and any support for or from other countries in achieving them. A simplified reporting standard is to apply for countries that can demonstrate insufficient capacities to report such data. This is a positive outcome for Switzerland as transparency rules are crucial for building trust between the parties.New post-2025 finance goalSwitzerland campaigned at COP26 for increased climate protection investments worldwide and called on all countries in a position to provide support to do so. A new climate finance goal from 2025 is to be set by 2024 and include both public and private investment.During the conference, Switzerland pledged over CHF 50 million in finance for the UN Adaptation Fund, the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, the Least Developed Countries Fund, the Climate Investment Fund and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's High Impact Partnership on Climate Action. Through these contributions, Switzerland underscores its resolve to pay its fair share towards international climate financing.Climate-related loss and damageAnother key issue was how to deal with loss and damage incurred by countries vulnerable to climate change, e.g. through flooding or crop failures. Here it was agreed that, by 2025, industrialised countries are to double their 2019 level of climate finance provided for adaptation measures. The parties decided not to create any new mechanism for funding technical assistance following climate-related loss and damage. Switzerland had advocated at the conference for strengthening the existing instruments and institutions available for climate change loss and damage. The new pact also agrees to simplify and enhance developing countries' access to such finance.\l"

Managing emissions from deforestation, agriculture and related supply chains, including growing soy for livestock feed, will be crucial to keep the goals of limiting global temperature warming to 1.5 degrees.Mr Sharma discussed in meetings with the Vice President, Hamilton Mouro, Ministers of Energy, Bento Albuquerque, of Justice, Anderson Torres, and vice minister of Agriculture, Marcos Montes as well as with the President of Senate Rodrigo Pacheco, the pledges already made, including tackling deforestation, and the advantages a transition to a low carbon economy would bring to the country.At the launch of the Glasgow Finance Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) campaign in Brazil, Mr Sharma set out the vital role finance has in the transition to net zero emissions by the middle of the century. Financial institutions and asset managers came together to commit to net zero at this event, with Mr Sharma urging even more Brazilian Private Finance Institutions to join the campaign.Momentum is building in Brazil for an economy-wide shift towards net zero. In a meeting with Brazilian states, municipalities and businesses, Mr Sharma thanked the leadership of these actors so far and encouraged those who have not yet done so to join the Race to Zero campaign. Mr Sharma also spoke with businesses including CEOs from Klabin and Suzano, and members of civil society to discuss the benefits that a net zero future offers.On his second day of the visit, Mr Sharma spoke in Brasilia at the Brazil Energy Prosperity Programme, with Brazilian Mines and Energy Minister Bento de Albuquerque. The Programme is a crucial example of UK-Brazil cooperation and Mr Sharma said that it is a vital part of Brazils transition to clean energy, supporting work on offshore wind, waste to energy, biofuels and others.COP President Alok Sharma said:I have been pleased to be back in Brazil to speak with Ministers on the delivery of their COP26 commitments, which include halving emissions by 2030 on the path to net zero by 2050 and annual targets to reduce deforestation.2022 is the year to turn commitments made in Glasgow into action and Brazil has an important role in delivering these commitments, as custodians of large parts of the Amazon rainforest and as a member of the G20. Setting out a long term strategy and implementation plan to get to net zero will be important on the road to COP27.The transition to clean, resilient net zero economies is accelerating around the world and private sector innovation, expertise and finance is critical to help us plug the gap to meet this challenge.It is encouraging to see the increasing number of net zero pledges being made by Brazilian businesses and I urge all companies in Brazil, and around the world, to join the Race to Zero campaign and the Glasgow Finance Alliance for Net Zero to demonstrate their commitment to green growth.\l"

Upon his departure from Rome, UN Secretary-General Antnio Guterres said in a tweet that while he welcomed the G20s recommitment to global solutions, he was leaving the summit with his hopes unfulfilled. But at least they are not buried, he said, and added: Onward to Glasgow and COP26 to keep the goal of 1.5 degrees alive and to implement promises on finance and adaptation for people and the planet. Mr. Guterres is addressing the COP26 World Leaders Summit, which brings together Heads of State and Government, civil society and business leaders, who have been invited to set out the ambitious actions they are taking to reduce emissions, scale-up adaptation and mobilize finance, and to signal their commitment to ensuring that COP26 keeps 1.5C in reach. A hard truth Addressing the Conferences preliminary opening on Sunday, Abdulla Shahid, the President of the UN General Assembly called for an honest look at where things stand: We have had decades to argue the facts about climate change, about the power of renewables, about the fine details of monitoring or cost-sharing. Yet, we have still failed to act with the conviction and determination required. That may be a hard truth, but it is the truth. And yet, another truth: we are entirely capable of turning this around, if we so choose, Mr. Shahid stated, declaring: We have the science. We have the resources. We agree on the urgency. We have run out of excuses. It is time to do the right thing. Let us work togetherand get this done. Greater ambition now Meanwhile, Patricia Espinosa, the Executive Secretary of UN Climate Change (UNFCCC), said the world was on track for a global temperature rise of 2.7C far from the agreed 1.5C goal.

We are the worlds fourth largest energy exporter, after Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States.Since 2005, we have reduced emissions faster than any other major commodity exporting nation in the world. Our emissions are now more than 20 per cent below 2005 levels and have fallen faster than many similar developed countries, including Canada, Japan, New Zealand and the United States, and faster than the OECD average.Ahead of and during COP26, Australia worked closely with our Pacific family to raise the important role of our oceans in addressing the impacts of climate change, to secure outcomes on climate financing and support for building climate resilience, particularly for vulnerable countries in our Pacific region, and to ensure they have access to low emissions technologies to support their development and future prosperity.At COP26Australias 2030 target is fixed and we are committed to meeting and beating it, as we did with our Kyoto-era targets.The Government particularly welcomes outcomes on international carbon markets (Article 6) and a standardised transparency framework, which was a major focus for Australia.Transparency is the key to accountability and to translating ambition into achievement. This goes to the heart of the Paris Agreement, which relies on all countries delivering on their commitments to achieve a global net zero outcome.Australias emissions reporting and transparency is the gold standard and we expect all major emitters to display similar levels of transparency.Through the $104 million Indo-Pacific Carbon Offsets Scheme, we are working with our regional partners to build the capability of their emissions accounting and reporting capabilities.Strong transparency and integrity standards are vital to ensuring carbon markets deliver real and verifiable emissions reductions.Australia has doubled its climate finance commitment to $2 billion over the next five years. More than 70 per cent of our support is focused on climate resilience and adaptation.At COP26Australia joined the Glasgow Breakthroughs Initiative, which sets global goals to make clean technologies the most affordable and accessible option before 2030. This initiative is a strong international endorsement of our practical, technology-led approach.A focus on reducing the cost of low emissions technologies to parity with existing approaches is the only way to make net zero practically achievable for all countries. To that end, the Australian Government will invest more than $21 billion in the next generation of low emissions technologies, to drive up to $120 billion of total public and private investment in Australia by 2030.Under our Plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, we will act in a practical, responsible way to reduce emissions and build on our track record of achievement reducing emissions while growing our economy, maintaining affordable, reliable energy and ensuring our regions remain strong. Thats the Australian way.\l"
"COP26","India","COP26_India161","Why investors should graduate risk-return expectations from widely assumed ESG","April 28, 2022 Thursday","The Economic Times","Environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) investing started small in the US. long back in 1971 but steadily gained traction with the UN in 2015 adopting the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Unfortunately, India is still far behind and currently (as of 2021) still ranks 120 out of 165 nations in terms of progress towards achieving all SDGs per the UN. However, India has set itself aggressive targets at the latest COP26 (Conference of the Parties) summit in Glasgow in 2021. These enhanced COP26 commitments and New Energy efforts are significant: net carbon zero by 2070, renewable energy target raised to 500 GW by 2030 from 450 GW, PLI - pump-priming - for solar modules, advanced battery storage and green hydrogen generation. Several developments are already unfolding in India since 2008, when S&P launched its ESG India index. In 2021 a welcome standardization of ESG reporting was brought forth by SEBI. It launched the BRSR (business responsibility and sustainability reporting) framework, mandatory for Top 1000 listed companies from FY23 onwards. BRSR will be the one-stop shop for all sustainability-linked or non-financial information for Indian companies replacing the existing BRR (Business Responsibility Report). BRR required companies to respond to a list of standardized questions that do not accurately measure the progress taken towards sustainability goals. Apart from more transparent reporting, ESG Integration is another overarching trend in this space. Notably, it affects how an investor approaches ESG investing. Typically, the most predominant style of investing is based on negative screening. Another kind involves ""best-in-class"" or a ""norms-based investing"". Instead of plain bottom-up negative screening, companies are compared to their sectoral peers regarding their business practices stacked against international norms like those set by the UN (SDGs) etc. An investor could also allocate her wealth to a relevant ESG fund though currently, in India, this market is small and is only ~0.3-0.5% of the MF industry AUM (2021). ESG integration is an indirect yet holistic approach that ingrains ESG parameters across all investment analyses and decisions and not only at the research stage of picking companies. The approach focuses on value creation via investment selection (fundamentals and valuations), portfolio management, risk management and shareholder advocacy. For instance, within portfolio management, in Tactical Asset Allocation decisions, ESG objectives are factored in and analyzed to mitigate short-term ESG risks. In addition, in the valuation stage of company selection, adjustments are made for discount rates, perpetuity growth rate, terminal value etc., for the expected impact of ESG factors. Investors could adopt a method for this fastly evolving ESG based investing style. Initially, to identify ESG-leaders using a suitable framework and to capture ESG-favourable regulatory trends. Ongoing tracking of FII ownership in companies would help align allocations to rating changes. Last but not least, investors should graduate risk-return expectations from widely assumed ESG to be a return-compromiser to a return-enhancer. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com\l"

"COP26","India","COP26_India163","India to push for climate justice at COP26: Environment minister","October 30, 2021 Saturday","The Times of India (TOI)","India will strongly highlight the need for ""climate justice"" at COP26 in Glasgow as the solution to global warming can't be addressed in a piecemeal manner, environment minister Bhupender Yadav told TOI. While not commenting directly on whether 450GW renewable energy will be made part of India's NDCs, Yadav said the target is a serious commitment. Amid pressure from affluent nations to get a 'net zero' commitment from all countries, environment minister Yadav added while India will take a call on carbon neutrality at an appropriate time, developed nations must remember their unfulfilled pre-2020 promises as commitments and action on climate justice is the need of the hour. Excerpts of a conversation with TOI:Will India commit to a 'net zero' goal at the upcoming UN climate change conference (COP26)?COP26? Discussions must be around fulfilling existing commitments by developed countries. We believe first there must be discussion on all issues which had already been committed by countries as the old pledges - be it cutting down emissions in pre-2020 period and extending financial support to developing countries as promised in 2009. All issues should be discussed, keeping in view principles of UN climate convention (UNFCCC) and Paris Agreements - be it 'equity' and 'common but differentiated responsibilities' and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC). There are four key issues in the negotiations. First, the entire world is worried that the global temperature is rising quite fast. Second, the world is conscious of mitigation measures needed to check this temperature rise. Third, the entire world is not at a level-playing field (in terms of capacities to take mitigation and adaptation measures) and therefore there should be robust financial support and technology transfer mechanisms. Fourth, is the issue of 'loss and damage' on account of disasters, and so there is a question of how to evolve a system to support vulnerable countries. India wants to discuss all these issues with an open mind. This global problem must be dealt with comprehensively, not partly. Will the country's new ambitious target of renewable energy (450 GW by 2030) and overachievement on climate actions be factored in under revised pledges?The NDC is a voluntary declaration, but it's not just a declaration. It is a commitment. We have not only set ambitious targets but also achieved our goals and fulfilled our pledges much before time. The big fight is around commitments of those who have not fulfilled it. Developed countries had promised in 2009 to mobilise climate finance of US$ 100 billion per year by 2020 to support developing countries for adaptation measures so that they could face the challenges of climate change. It has not been fulfilled. Climate finance delivery plan, released this week, shows that the affluent nations would be able to mobilise finance only by 2023 - three years later than what they promised. Will the delay impact the negotiations at COP26?We will put it on the negotiation table. There is also an issue of public finance and private finance. We must remind the developed countries that the promise was made to extend help to developing countries through public finance - government to government. I must, however, remind everyone that India has fulfilled its promises through its own money and budgetary provisions. You had meetings with the US presidential climate envoy John Kerry and COP26 president designate Alok Sharma. Have you told them about India's and developing countries' concerns over these issues? Besides them, we had bilateral and multilateral meetings with around 30 countries ahead of COP26. Everyone accepts the seriousness... But the question here is about action and effect. Consensus is being built up in this direction. These issues will also be discussed during COP26 (October 31-November 12 in Glasgow, UK). We will urge all countries to get actively involved in three institutions/initiatives - International Solar Alliance (ISA), Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) and Leadership Group for Industry Transition (LeadIT) - which are being spearheaded by India and other countries such as France and Sweden. Both India and China have always been on the same page as part of 'like-minded developing countries' (LMDC) and BASIC climate negotiation groups despite differences elsewhere. Will this continue at COP26?I believe there should not be any difference with anyone for making the world a better place to live in. Our conduct should be one when our objective is one. We'll, in fact, try to build consensus with every country at COP26. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com\l"

The Paris Agreement of 2015 seeks to keep the global rise in average temperatures to within 2C from pre-industrial times.But apart from the fact that the world is unlikely to meet that goal with currently-planned actions, the 2C is not even considered good enough any longer, considering the rapidly worsening impacts of climate change that are already evident. There is a growing chorus to move towards a 1.5C target, and the Glasgow meeting was meant to do just that.The conference attracted the highest participation ever, with more than 30,000 people attending. Over 100 heads of states and governments made their way to the event. Some big-ticket announcements were also made. But the final outcome of the meeting hardly matched the expectations. Some important progress was made but nothing that would alter the global emission pathway in any significant manner.On the other hand, the continued failure of the developed countries to fulfill their long-standing commitments on finance and technology is expected to make even the current transitions a lot more difficult.As countries continue to defer more ambitious actions to a later date, the window on the 1.5C target is fast closing. Are all hopes, therefore, lost, or is a dramatic scale-up in ambition of climate action still possible in the coming years? Do the COP26 outcomes keep alive the hopes for a 1.5C target? Are countries relying too much on unproven technologies to bail them out? And what is the road ahead for India? Can it, on its own, secure itself against the worst impacts of climate change?R R Rashmi, former head of India's climate change negotiating team, will discuss these and many other related questions at the Explained Live event on Friday evening.During his long stint in the Environment Ministry, Rashmi, a retired IAS officer of 1983 batch, has closely watched, and been responsible for, the evolution in India's climate policy over the last one decade.

Pursuant to the COP26 climate summit, scientists from Wageningen University & Research and other knowledge institutes wrote an article providing an overview of this impact. Based on case studies from the Netherlands, New Zeeland, Colombia and Kenya, they describe how the impact of livestock farming on climate change and biodiversity may be mitigated. Simon Oosting, a scientist with the Animal Production Systems group, is to present the article at the COP26 on 10 November.Livestock farming contributes to the emission of greenhouse gasses, for example, through the methane released by cows and the CO2 released when forests are cut down to make room for animal feed production. The case studies in the four countries show different ways to reduce the effects of livestock farming on the environment. Some examples show that policy-makers are able to achieve big improvements through small steps, while in other cases, drastic systems changes are required.Trees in Colombia, cheese from SchiermonnikoogNew Zeeland used subsidies to reduce the population of sheep and the amount of land used for sheep farming. In spite of the lower population of sheep, the total production increased slightly as a result of increased focus on health, good food and animal genetics. In Kenya, the government introduced a monitoring system to better measure emissions. This enables the government and farming consultants to intervene and assist farmers in lowering their greenhouse gas emissions without loss of production.WUR-researchers Simon Oosting and Andr Bannink list three examples from the Netherlands in their research.

"COP26","India","COP26_India175","COP26: A pivotal moment to stop runaway climate change","October 25, 2021 Monday","Assam Tribune (India)","Guwahati, Oct. 25 -- In less than a week, the eyes and ears of the world will be on the United Nations Climate Change Conference which gets under way at Glasgow on the 31st of October. The annual meeting of the 197 parties to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will be under unprecedented scrutiny following a series of alarming reports and climatic disasters around the world. The 26th Conference of Parties (COP26) is increasingly perceived as humanity's best chance to avoid the catastrophic consequences of unabated climate change.The importance of COP26 is enshrined in the Paris Agreement, which was inked at COP21 in 2015. It was agreed that countries would come back with updated nationally-determined contributions every five years to reflect the best commitments for reducing emissions possible. The urgency of the Glasgow conference has been magnified by its Covid-19-induced postponement from 2020, and the publication of the latest 'Code Red for Humanity' report published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).At the Paris Agreement, the parties agreed to limit warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius and strive for 1.5 degrees Celsius. Studies published since then, including the IPCC 'Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 degree C' in 2018 have provided a comparative analysis of the dangers of passing the lesser threshold. The first part of the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), the latest from the IPCC, warned that we are on track to exceed warming of 1.5 degree Celsius within the next two decades and 2 degreeC during the 21st century without huge and immediate reductions in emissions.The targets announced in Paris would result in warming well above 3 degrees by 2100 compared to the pre-industrial levels. Even more incriminating is the 2021 Production Gap Report which has revealed that despite increased climate ambitions and net-zero commitments, governments still plan to produce more than double the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than what would be consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5 degreeC.The COP26'Adapt to protect communities and natural habitats' is the second goal, accepting the fact that the climate is already changing, and it will continue to change even as we reduce emissions, with devastating effects for communities who have done the least to cause it. It is a call for the international community to unite and support people who are most vulnerable to the impacts of the changing climate. Advocating more action to avert, minimize and address the loss and damage that is already occurring from climate change, the COP26 presidency will focus on plans and finances to improve early warning systems, flood defences, resilient infrastructure, and agriculture to avoid further loss of life, livelihoods, and natural habitats.The third goal is to 'mobilize finance' and it is critical to deliver on the first two goals. Echoing the fact that developing countries in particular need support, the presidency has urged developed countries to make good on their promise to mobilize at least $100 bn in climate finance per year by 2020. Negotiators at COP26 will also work with international financial institutions towards unleashing private and public sector finance required to secure global net zero. The stated goal called upon companies to be transparent about the risks and opportunities from climate change and called upon banks and regulators to ensure that financial systems support the transition to net zero.'Work together to deliver,' the fourth goal recognizes the importance of working together to address the challenges of the climate crisis. A focus for the negotiations is finalizing the 'Paris Rulebook' which will have the tools to make the Paris Agreement operational. The presidency reiterates that the UN negotiations are consensus-based and inclusive, and everyone's voice will be heard during COP26. It also resolved to accelerate action to tackle the climate crisis through collaboration between governments, businesses and civil society.COP26 will be a carbon-neutral conference, with sustainability at its core, that will leave a positive legacy and the first COP to achieve validation using PAS2060 international standard on carbon neutrality.

The commitment comes ahead of the Summit to try and influence other key nations to take action.Speaking at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester earlier this month, the Prime Minister said this could be achieved through advances in wind power and other renewable sources. The shift will play a huge role in the UK hitting it's 78% cut to carbon emissions by 2035.However, green groups and industry have warned that the UK is currently behind schedule to meet this target due to issues with the planning system, infrastructure and finances.Greenpeace Cambo ProtestCampaigners chained themselves to an oil-splattered statue of Boris Johnson outside Downing Street to protest against the controversial drilling site in early October.

"COP26","India","COP26_India179","Why COP26 Failed Young People Like Me","November 25, 2021 Thursday","Youth Ki Awaaz","India, Nov. 25 -- After two weeks of discussion, the COP26 finally ended with an agreement between more than 200 countries in Glasgow. Although the discussion continued longer than expected, the results were still disappointing.What is COP26The Conference of Parties (COP) is a decision making body of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change initially formed to stabilise the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The first COP meeting was held back in 1995 in Berlin, and since then, the members have been meeting every year to discuss the pressing issue of climate change.While previous COP meetings have swung between success and failure, the historic COP21 meeting, held in 2015 in Paris, led to the 'Paris Agreement'. This agreement deliberated on several strategies, including submitting country-specific National Determined Contributions (NDCs) containing country-specific pledges for emissions reduction and adaptation to climate change.As a collective global action, the Paris agreement pledged to keep global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius compared to the pre-industrial level and an ambitious target to keep the warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius.COP26 completed five years of the Paris agreement, and according to the 'ratchet mechanism', the countries met in Glasgow to revisit and revisit their climate pledges made under the Paris agreement to keep global warming on track of 1.5 degrees Celsius.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change launched a few months ago, warned that global warming is likely to reach 1.5 degrees Celsius between 2030 and 2052 with the current emissions rate. The report had also suggested the need to decrease the emissions by 45% by 2030, compared to 2010 levels to reach a net-zero emission rate by 2050 in order to stay on the 1.5-degree trajectory.What Was Achieved At COP26?While COP 26 took several important decisions during the two-week course of the discussion, it failed miserably in achieving a concrete action, experts said.1. The Adaptation Story: The final agreement recognised the need for adaptation to climate change and further agreed upon the ""scaling up action and support, including finance, capacity-building and technology transfer, to enhance the adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability"". While recognition of the need for climate adaptation was a welcome move, the same momentousness seemed missing during the finance allocation.The developed countries in Copenhagen (2009) had promised to mobilise USD 100 billion for the developing countries to adapt to climate change. However, this promise has not been met even till now; the OECD highlights that in 2019 only around USD 80 billion in finance was mobilised by the developing countries.While the finance mobilised was significantly increased from the subsequent years, it has been far lesser than what actually was promised. Nonetheless, the adaptation finance represented only one-third of the total finance.At COP 26, developing countries including India had called for rich nations to come forward and deliver on the promised financial help. They sought a trillion dollar a year fund from 2025 - after the previous pledge to provide $100bn (&#163;72bn) a year by 2020 was missed.2. Phasing 'Out' or 'Down': The initial draft of the Glasgow pact mentioned a complete phase-out of the coal by 2030, however, because of last-minute intervention by India, the term 'out' was replaced by 'down'. Even though India voiced its opinion, it will not be the only country that would benefit from this terminology change. Countries like China, Australia, Indonesia, Mexico, among others who produce and consume coal are also likely to benefit from this terminology change.3. The emphasis on nature and ecosystems: Glasgow emphasised harnessing the benefit of nature to sequester excess greenhouse gases and protect biodiversity. While the initial draft was published utilising 'Nature-based solutions', it remained missing in the final draft amid the uncertainty and hazy motivation around the inclusion of the word.4. Reducing the emission of Methane: The Glasgow pact invites the countries to reduce the emissions of other greenhouse gases, emphasising methane.5. The notorious Net-Zero: Even before the starting of , there was an increased emphasis on the declaration of Net-Zero. The global north countries lobbied and persuaded the global south countries to declare the year to achieve net-zero. While India was initially one of the few countries that remained content on the declaration of net-zero, the Prime Minister in his Glasgow speech mentioned 2070 as the year of the country to achieve net-zero. While the achievement of net-zero clearly states of long term action, the question of short term action still remained unclear.The Statecraft Of The Global NorthHistorically emissions by developed countries have led to inequitable use of the available carbon space leading to a minimal carbon space available for the developing nations. However, despite being the culprit, the global north has failed to take the leadership position during the negotiations. They have very strategically benefited from the lack of a united front of the global south countries. Glasgow in that sense witnessed galore promises without much weight from the global north.On the bright side, the global south countries, despite limited finances, outshone in the negotiations. Ambitious targets by countries like India, Nepal and several others were loud in stating the seriousness of the global south in taking climate action.The COP Action CycleAs mentioned in the earlier section, some of the deliberations at Glasgow were already proposed during earlier COP meetings. For example, the emphasis on nature and ecosystems isn't new - the initial conversation to reduce deforestation and augment restoration was introduced during COP 11 in Papua Guinea, where countries introduced reducing emissions from deforestation (RED). Two years later, the concept was transformed in REDD+ to include sustainable forest management and conservation.Similarly, several other proposed solutions have already been presented on the table before, and the presidency proposed nothing new except largely restating unfulfilled promises.Why Did COP Fail The Youth Including Me?I had many expectations from COP26, and as the draft kept getting watered down, so did our hopes of seeing concrete climate commitments from policymakers.The negotiations, in my opinion, were akin to a street fight where neither of the involved parties agreed to give up. And even as the vulnerable population in developing countries continued to suffer, the developed world kept asking them to take action without providing them with enough finance or technology.The Glasgow summit was favourable for businesses and corporations. The presentation of the half-baked idea of nature-based solutions (initially published draft) is an example.The presidency must take cognizance of the fact that climate policy isn't just about knowing that 'trees cannot fix everything and nature does not reflect trees only'.As an environmentalist, it was hurtful to see how nature was used as a commodity Adding fuel to fire, the final draft mentioned how nature was 'recognized by some cultures as Mother Earth' - a lame attempt to not just anthropomorphize nature.Attempts to greenwash outcomes were visible throughout the summit, making the outcomes less than what was anticipated turning the summit into a disappointment, especially for young people like me.

With an aim to address climate change, the tool targets decarbonization by focusing on environmental impacts and GHG emissions of mega events, conferences, meetings, exhibitions and trade fairs, etc. From transportation and lodging to paper trails, catering and energy use, GET provides an all-encompassing approach that identifies ways to host ecofriendly events with minimal carbon footprint. GET can help to evaluate and try to reduce the carbon footprint of any event.Leading GORDs delegation at COP26 is the organizations Founding Chairman, Dr. Yousef Alhorr. Speaking about the importance of Green Events Tool, Dr. Alhorr said, In terms of carbon emissions, whats on an events agenda represents only the tip of the iceberg. The upstream and downstream components of an event associated with travel, accommodation, logistics etc. account for massive amounts of GHG emissions and environmental footprints.Sustainability is increasingly being absorbed as a core part of social corporate responsibility. As an entity driving climate actions, GORD embarked on a mission to help organizations reach their GHG reduction targets by greening their events. To this end, Green Events Tool was conceived to quantify the carbon emissions of events, while also providing organizers with ways to improve their events environmental performance by embracing sustainability practices, offsetting the unavoidable emissions and, where applicable, adopting green building standards for venues, he added.Incorporating a mix of qualitative and quantitative methodologies, GET has been developed following the specifications by UN Environment Programme and the UNFCCC secretariat. Event activities recorded for GHG calculations by GET include carbon emissions associated with venue, flight, ground transportation, communication, audio-visual systems, production and exhibition, accommodation and catering.Organizations using GET can calculate their overall score and declare it as a testament of their commitment to environmental sustainability. For wider awareness, the report can be submitted to the certification team for a third-party verification. Once the verification is complete, GET can generate the certification through the platform and publish. Depending on the overall achievement of the event, three different ratings (Bronze, Silver and Gold) can be achieved by organizations through GET. Depending upon the level of offsetting carried out from recognized GHG programs, the event can receive the 'carbon efficient' or 'carbon neutral' certification.With its launch at COP26 in Glasgow, GET is now available for organizations to help them reduce their events carbon footprint. GORD is among the leading organizations representing Qatar at UN Climate Change Conference (COP26). Represented by a multidisciplinary delegation, GORDs senior leadership is participating in UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) from November 8 to 12.\l"

Since the conference began, the world has seen and heard much of the United States government's return to climate leadership. We have heard from President Biden, former President Obama, Cabinet members, Governors, Senators, Congresspeople, Tribal leaders, Mayors, CEOS, community leaders, and in fact, every sector of American society. They have come to Glasgow to say America Is All In. Now is the moment for the United States to show it. The United States must seize this moment and push these negotiations to an ambitious conclusion.""The text recognizes the immense challenge ahead of us, and acknowledges that we need to enhance the ambition of global commitments by 2022 to limit warming to 1.5 degrees. We welcome the text's reference to the role of nature-based solutions for climate mitigation and adaptation and are pleased to see a first mention to the relevance of phasing out fossil fuel subsidies.""These are all necessary elements of a successful outcome to COP26, but alone, they are not sufficient. The negotiators must provide a plan for measuring short term action, not just long-term commitments. The text must shorten the period in which nations report updated NDCs, ensure the delivery of international finance, and strengthen the stock taking of commitments actually realized.

Besides, the Pact also promised to deliver greater amounts of finance to developing countries by deciding to double it up for adaptation by 2025 and take steps to help vulnerable countries deal with losses and damages from climate impacts. The decision on 'loss and damage', however, lacked a clear plan for funding facility, much to the disappointment of climate vulnerable countries. Work on having a definite plan to compensate disaster-hit countries will now be shifted to COP27 in Egypt next year. The overall pact was finally adopted by the countries when the COP26 presidency accommodated India's concerns where the country objected to phase-out of coal and fossil fuel subsidies. The change from 'phase-out' to 'phase-down' with respect to coal power use in the final text was agreed during the last minute amendments to build the consensus. Just before convening the final plenary, UK COP26 president Alok Sharma and his team members were seen trying to convince India's environment minister Bhupender Yadav over the text as the latter strongly objected to it on the reference of coal and fossil fuel while intervening during the stocktake. Both the leaders were even seen looking at amended version which Yadav finally proposed and the plenary accepted.

A central expectation of COP26 is for governments to accelerate their decarbonisation measures for the decade to 2030.Malcolm Turnbull joins IHA delegation in GlasgowIHA will represent its members at this historic event as an observer organisation, with Malcolm Turnbull, former Australian Prime Minister and Co-Chair of the International Forum on Pumped Storage Hydropower, joining the IHA delegation in Glasgow.Eddie Rich, CEO of the International Hydropower Association (IHA) said its members want to see recognition by policymakers of hydropower's importance to the successful integration of more variable renewables on national electricity grids.IHA is calling on leaders at COP26 to heed the call of the International Energy Agency (IEA), which has declared that ""reaching net zero emissions by 2050 worldwide calls for a huge increase in hydropower ambitions"" and a potential doubling of installed capacity by 2050.Mr Rich said: ""Decarbonising electricity grids involves a shift to more renewable energy, such as wind and solar power. But this creates a significant new challenge. As we rely more and more on these intermittent resources, not enough governments have made provision for backing them up with reliable, green storage. It is the crisis within the crisis. Just as we should be accelerating, we might stall.""The only proven decarbonised renewable technology able to support solar and wind at scale is hydropower. As sustainable hydropower plants such as off-river pumped storage often take a decade to build, urgent investment decisions need to be taken now or, as far as the 2050 net zero target is concerned, the train will have left the station.""Declaration on Sustainable HydropowerIn addition, IHA is taking a new industry-wide commitment to more sustainable hydropower practices - the San Jose Declaration on Sustainable Hydropower - to COP26 to support IHA's call for more hydropower. The declaration was agreed at the 2021 World Hydropower Congress in September 2021 and handed to COP26 President Alok Sharma.The San Jose Declaration sets out how hydropower will help to deliver on the clean energy transition needed to limit global warming and meet the commitments of the 2015 Paris Agreement.Alok Sharma said: ""This Declaration is a first vital step in increasing the global deployment of hydropower, with solid principles to guide the developments of projects, and sound recommendations for governments and policy-makers developed in consultation with businesses, financial institutions and civil society.

Fossil fuels and their use have enabled path for the world (developed countries) to attend high level of wealth and well being. The UNFCCC refers to mitigation of GHG emissions from all sources.

Developing countries have rights to their fair share of global carbon budget and are entitled to the responsible use of fossil fuels within this scope .Underlining that the developing countries have to deal with their national development agenda and poverty eradication, the minister said the fossil fuel subsidies  provides much needed social security and support towards this end and he cited India's example where the government under 'Ujjwala' scheme provides subsidised gas cylinders to poor households.He said,  We are giving subsidies to use LPG to lowincome households. This subsidies have been a great help in almost eliminating biomass burning for cooking and improved health from reduction in indoor air pollution. The minister's remarks comes in view of a full particular para on coal and fossil fuels in the text which European Union and many other countries have been pitching for being included in the final decision.Though Yadav appreciated the COP26 presidency for making his efforts to build consensus, he said,  I am afraid the consensus, however, remains elusive.

The group, which was created by Denmark and Costa Rica in the lead-up to the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, now has 11 signatories, according to a statement on Thursday. They include Sweden, Ireland, Greenland, Quebec, Wales, Portugal, California and New Zealand.Though unique in its supply focus, current signatories to the alliance represent a negligible proportion of global fossil-fuel stocks. That's raised questions about BOGA's clout and of how likely it is to get major producers on board. The UK, which is hosting this year's COP summit, says it won't back the alliance because ending fossil fuel production could cause a cliff edge in energy supply.""No other significant oil- and gas-producing nation has gone as far as the UK in supporting the sector's gradual transition to a low-carbon future,"" a spokesperson said in a statement earlier this week.BOGA co-founder Denmark, once the European Union's biggest producer of oil and gas, has more than halved production since the 2015 Paris accord, investing heavily in wind power instead. California, which like New Zealand is an associate member of the alliance, produced almost five times as much crude oil last year as Denmark, though its output has also been slashed in recent years. France is home to TotalEnergies SE, Europe's biggest oil company after Royal Dutch Shell Plc.The world won't be able to limit global warming to the critical threshold of 1.5C without cutting fossil fuel production every year through 2030, BOGA said. At the current rate of commitments, however, production is set to continue rising this decade. The only way to decarbonize the planet and prevent catastrophic temperature gains is to ensure that more oil and gas resources are ""left in the ground,"" BOGA said.Core members of BOGA must commit to set a fixed date to end oil and gas production that's aligned with reaching the goals set out in the Paris Agreement.

Ecuador also committed to prioritising the most vulnerable women and children and developing them as agents of change in climate change adaptation efforts; to increase analysis on the impact of climate change decisions on women; and to integrate violence prevention into climate action.Germany announced a new Gender Strategy under its International Climate Initiative (IKI) which will promote gender-transformative approaches in international climate and biodiversity cooperation.Sweden announced new measures to firmly embed gender equality within all their climate action, including a work plan to integrate a gender perspective in all the core operations of the Swedish Environment Protection Agency (EPA).The UK set out how $223 million in funding will address the dual challenges of gender inequality and climate change. The COP26 Presidency also funded six female negotiators representing less-developed countries to participate and attend COP26 through the Women Delegates Fund.The US promotes gender equity and equality in mitigating and responding to climate change as a strategic priority of the US Government National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality; investing at least $14 million of the Gender Equity and Equality Action Fund toward gender-responsive climate programming.Progress was welcomed by Sabra Noordeen, Special Envoy for Climate Change of the Maldives, who spoke at the event.The Maldives co-leads the Feminist Action for Climate Justice coalition, alongside Costa Rica. These announcements help build momentum internationally to drive implementation of the Gender Action Plan agreed at COP25, ahead of the sixty-sixth session of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW66) in March 2022 which will focus on gender equality in the context of climate change, the environment and disaster risk reduction.Indigenous leader Tarcila Rivera Zea said: ""Mother Earth is only one when all of humanity has equal rights.

One of the main attractions was the presentation, by President Celso Moretti, of soil organic carbon maps, with emphasis on the example of biological nitrogen fixation, both developed by Embrapa.According to Moretti, before the beginning of the event, there was already expectations regarding the results of the Brazilian research, considered a reference. ""The president of COP26 himself, Alok Sharma, visiting Embrapa Cerrados last August, drew attention to the importance of sharing the experience of our science with other countries,"" he recalled. ""Agriculture is part of the solution and not of the problems that cause climate change"", said the researcher, referring to the potential of science to guarantee sustainability, foreseeing challenges and anticipating solutions for the world.Embrapa was part of a special panel on sustainable livestock and topics such as crop-livestock-forest integration (ILPF), low carbon agriculture, carbon neutral meat and the technologies in development of carbon neutral milk and low carbon calf and leather. The event was also attended by the deputy secretary for Climate and International Relations of the Ministry of the Environment, Marcelo Freire, and the CEO of JBS, Gilberto Tomazoni.Moretti also mediated the panel coordinated by BRF, a Brazilian multinational and one of the largest global food companies, on the sustainability of the pork and poultry production chain in the country.

Almost 200 nations at the UNFCCC COP26 in Glasgow accepted a compromise deal on Saturday, aimed at keeping the key global warming target alive, but it contained a last-minute change that watered down crucial language about coal. Several countries, including small island states, said they were deeply disappointed by the change promoted by India to phase down, rather than phase out coal power, the single biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions. While the world expressed disappointment, climate experts in India felt that the first-ever mention of phase down of coal by the country in an international climate agreement is an important indication of the energy transformation underway, and criticised the developed nations for once again failing to deliver the promised climate finance. Also read | New climate pledges barely affect global heating: UN ""The COP26 ""Blocking the establishment of even a modest fund to help vulnerable communities around the world with the massive loss and damage they are experiencing at the hands of the climate crisis is a serious blow. As with Covid, those with the least resources have been left to fend for themselves. However, the first-ever mention of coal phase down in an international climate agreement is an important indication of the energy transformation underway and a clear signal to markets and industry. COP26 is real progress but much more is still to be done,"" said Aarti Khosla, Director, Climate Trends. Sharing a similar view, Kamal Narayan, CEO Integrated Health and Well Being Council (IHW), said, ""With the kind of commitment and leadership India has shown in building renewable energy infrastructure and its aim to draw more of its energy requirements from such sources, the use of 'phasing down' coal instead of 'phasing out' alone shall not be seen as diversion from its commitment towards this global emergency."" He said while activists would hardly be pleased with the COP26 outcomes and may criticise it for being too slow, the global realities and growth challenges for major populations like India too need to be considered. Manjeev Puri, Distinguished Fellow, The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), said, ""There is nothing much. There is no real commitment on part of developed countries to move ahead with serious and urgent domestic action, let alone in terms of global collaboration and truly significant climate finance for tackling climate change."" According to Suyash Gupta, Director General, Indian Auto LPG Coalition, it is ""unfair"" for the west to ignore India's energy imperatives. Also read | 'Adaptation fund' from developed countries continues to be a sticking point ""It is unfair for the west to ignore India's energy imperatives - home to almost a fifth of the world's population. 'Been there, done that' - those being critical of India's unambiguous and pronounced stand at COP26, cannot live in denial - after getting the world to the present situation. ""In fact, on a per capita basis, the west itself needs to do much more. Considering India's impeccable non-proliferation record, the west must rather play the role of an enabler and expedite India's entry into the Nuclear Supplier Group (NSG). Despite traversing well on the renewable roadmap, India just cannot wish away the energy needs of its 1.3 billion people - with two-thirds of its needs being currently met by coal,"" Mr. Gupta said. He said that unless a more conducive global ecosystem is in place to fast-track the transition, India cannot be stifling its growth and sustenance needs. The Glasgow Climate Pact states that the use of unabated coal should be phased down, as should subsidies for fossil fuels. The wording is weaker than the initial proposals, with the final text calling for only a ""phase down"" and not a ""phase out"" of coal, due to a last-second intervention by India, and of inefficient subsidies. But this is the first time fossil fuels have been mentioned in a UN climate talks declaration.

He was speaking at The Partnership Summit organised by Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) in association with Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), Ministry of Commerce and Industry, India at a session on Climate Action: The Road Beyond COP26 Glasgow.Citing COP26COP26, we now have 90% of the global economy covered by net zero commitments, and this compares to less than 30% when we took on the role of organizing COP26 2 years ago.'Stating that governments need to know that business is behind a net-zero world, he urged industries across the board to join the Race to Zero campaign, commit to short term targets based on science and take action across the supply chain, utilise purchasing power and encourage suppliers to set their own 2050 net zero targets.Mr. Rameshwar Prasad Gupta, Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change, Government of India said that while global discussions like those at COP26 are important, a more tangible arena for climate action now lies at national and sub national levels and across businesses and the industry. The revised NDC pledges and net-zero commitments by countries have reposed trust in the idea of national and sectoral action for a resilient future.Bringing to light the importance of addressing concerns on a cross-sectoral scale, he further said that the road ahead is to expand clean energy options while making them affordable, accessible, and attractive across all sectors by 2030. Focus must shift to steel, power, road transport, hydrogen, and agriculture-which together account for more than half of global emissions.Lord Karan Bilimoria, President, Confederation of British Industry (UK) said that the big change with COP26 in Glasgow, compared to Paris, was that the commitments made by countries are actually translating into actions now.Lord Nicholas Stern, Chair, Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, London School of Economics (UK) noted that we must raise investment rates around the world, particularly in the emerging markets of developing economies to facilitate climate-conducive measures. Calling net zero commitment as the growth story of the 21st century, Prof. Stern said that India has a great opportunity with respect to infrastructure, as it is yet to be built by 2050.Highlighting OECD's contributions to realising climate ambitions, Mr. Mathias Cormann, Secretary General, OECD on Climate Action, said that OECD has been tracking progress and has been urging developed countries to step up and deliver on their USD 100 billion annual climate finance commitments to developing countries.Commenting on the distinction between the road from and road to COP26, Mr. Jacob Werksman, Principal Adviser to Directorate-General for Climate Action, European Commission and Head of Delegation, European Union to the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Belgium explained that the focus must shift to addressing the challenge of adaptation, loss and damage and the need to deliver commitments on finance.Mr. Angelo Ramalho, Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO, EFACEC, Portugal opined that low-cost finance will be critical to move forward and to move fast. 'We need to work collectively to create unique opportunities to meet our climate targets,' he added.Highlighting India's action on net zero commitments, Mr. Tulsi Tanti, Chairman, Suzlon, India said that COP 26 has been particularly important for India and has set a clear direction for its 1.3 billion people. With many initiatives underway and a mature supply chain, the 4th largest renewable energy hub is well on track to achieve aspirational targets.Mr. Anil Sardana, MD & CEO, Adani Transmission, Adani Group, India, while sharing the business perspective added that working towards climate commitments must ensure that hydrogen and its derivatives replace carbon fuel in various sectors and in applications where coal can be displaced through its derivatives.Mr. Malo Le Masson, Head Strategy & Global Product Planning, Hero MotoCorp said that both individual and corporate responsibility play an important role as part of long-term planning for sustainability initiatives.13 December 2021 For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at mailto:contentservices@htlive.com\l"
"COP26","India","COP26_India204","CoP26: Not on official agenda but Loss & Damage comeback gives hope, say experts","December 1, 2021 Wednesday","Down To Earth","India, Dec. 1 -- 14 of the 97 pointers in the final draft of Glasgow Pact were dedicated to Loss & DamageThe provisions included the establishment of ""the Glasgow Dialogue between Parties, relevant organisations and stakeholders to discuss the arrangements for the funding of activities to avert, minimise and address loss and damage associated with the adverse impacts of climate change"".The decision acknowledged that ""climate change has already caused and will increasingly cause loss and damage"".In the earlier drafts released by the CoP presidency, there was a provision of creating a facility with funding support to address the loss and damage. But most developed countries had shot down the proposal; and finally, a compromise was reached on organising a global dialogue on the agenda.Developing and underdeveloped countries, though unhappy with the scrapping of the facility proposal, feel that the dialogue will open up possibilities of taking more direct actions in the coming years.In earlier years, developed countries tried to club the loss and damage with adaptation issues. In effect, this diluted the climate liability component. In the Glasgow pact, however, loss and damage has been dealt separately under section VI of the draft.Harjeet Singh, a senior advisor of civil society network Climate Action Network International, said:Definitely loss and damage has made a comeback in Glasgow. The issue of loss and damage reached the highest political level in negotiation, despite not being on the official agenda. Developed countries forced the elimination of the loss and damage facility in the final CoP26 decision text and instead offered a 'dialogue' over the next few years. While the concrete proposal by developing countries representing six billion people around the world was pushed back, the need to address the climate impacts urgently has been recognised by all.Saleemul Huq, a scientist and negotiation analyst, explained that the increasing ability of science in attributing the specific responsibility of climate change in any extreme weather event as well as rapid surge of such events worldwide, has facilitated the comeback of loss and damage issue in mainstream negotiation.""In CoP, the role of presidency is very important in addressing any agenda. Unfortunately, the CoP26Hence, here the strategy of the vulnerable developing and underdeveloped was to keep open the windows on loss and damage as far as possible, he added. ""This was done so that the discussions and stronger outputs may be obtained in the next CoP at Egypt, which is already being identified as a developing countries CoP.""Loss and damage, as an agenda, first came into prominence at the Warsaw climate summit in 2013. The 'Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage Associated with Climate Change Impacts' was set up to address the issue in a holistic manner.Subsequently in 2019, the Santiago Network was created to catalyse the support for developing countries already impacted with climate change impacts.""Some small but important wins for developing countries were gained after much wrangling with developed countries, including in the area of the global goal on adaptation and institutionalising the functions of the Santiago Network on loss and damage"" explained an observer associated with Third World Network.Mima Holt, a research associate with the World Resource Institute (WRI), told this reporter that the fact that the ""final decision had the functions plus provisions on funding for activities of the Santiago Network, was a win for developing countries"".Language on the finance facility wasn't added until the second week and ultimately countries landed on creating a new dialogue dedicated to discussing possible arrangements for loss and damage funding, the expert added.From the beginning of the summit, developing countries were pushing for the institutionalisation of loss and damage in the UNFCCC regime. They have been arguing that the adverse effects of climate change impact developing countries much more than developed countries and in a manner that goes beyond the adaptive capacities of the developing countries.At CoP26CoP26 facility to address loss and damage finance as well as operationalising and strengthening the Santiago Network, particularly its financing.Though the initial draft talked about the facility, ultimately developing countries lost out on having a loss and damage finance facility due to very strong opposition from developed countries, especially the United States. They only managed to secure ""the Glasgow Dialogue"" in the final draft.In response to the draft text that was issued on November 3, 2021, paragraph 12 recognised ""the urgent need for scaling-up of action and support, as appropriate, including finance, technology and capacity-building."" in regards to loss and damage from the adverse effects of climate change, the developing countries claimed that such recognition of financing for loss and damage needs to be strengthened. They claimed that the draft ""does not contain any operational aspects or how loss and damage finance can be scaled up and accessed.""In response, negotiators from developed countries refused to accept the financial and other aspects related to loss and damage and maintained that the issue should be considered only at the ministerial level negotiation during the second week of CoP26.CoP26During the ministerial consultations, G77 highlighted the need to include loss and damage finance as part of the broader climate finance discussions, while the developed countries wanted to strictly wrap the loss and damage finance discussion regarding the operationalisation of the Santiago Network. The group claimed that the wider agenda of loss and damage finance is not under the ambit of discussion at CoP26.The European Union (EU) stressed its commitment to work together to find a common ground; recognised the need for technical assistance to implement loss and damage approaches.Developing countries broadly supported the G77 position, while the developed countries continued to state unequivocally that they do not have a mandate to agree on a loss and damage facility.Finally, both sides found the 'dialogue' to be the compromising formula, though G 77 expressed its ""extreme disappointment"" over the dilution from facility to dialogue.At the closing plenary on November 13, the G77 chair stated ""the group expresses its extreme disappointment with paragraphs 73 and 74 of draft decision .on a dialogue related to loss and damage. This is very far from the concrete call for a loss and damage facility that the group came together to make and seek an answer for here in Glasgow"".The dialogue and debate will now be taken up at CoP27, though loss and damage at least got a fresh lease of life.Climate Adaptation cop26 Loss and Damage Developing Countries Glasgow glasgow declaration Developed Countries Climate Change WorldPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Down to Earth.

""One calculation which I think we had in our mind was that the transition [ away from coal] ... will be enabled my natural gas,"" Ms. Sitharaman said in Washington DC, at a roundtable organised by the Atlantic Council, a think-tank. However, the price of crude has gone up due to the situation in Europe, as has the price of natural gas - a ""transition fuel"" for India - in addition to it being in short supply, said Ms. Sitharaman, who is in Washington D.C. for the World Bank International Monetary Fund (IMF) spring meetings. Almost all of the world's energy needs are met by coal, oil and natural gas, but coal releases almost twice the amount of carbon dioxide relative to natural gas, on a kilogram to kilogram basis. India has come under pressure from the U.S. to not increase import of energy from Russia, which has been sanctioned by Europe and the U.S. for its invasion of Ukraine. Approximately 1-2% of India's energy imports come from Russia, as per official U.S. data, and the government has begun buying oil from Moscow at a discounted price. ""The dependence on coal, and the speed with which we want to get out of it, will now be challenged,"" she said, adding that, however, India's commitment with regard to renewable energy would be met. At the UN Climate Change Conference (the 26th Conference of Parties-COP26), held in Glasgow last November, countries agreed, after pressure from India and China, to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" the use of coal. India also increased its focus on a lack of climate finance from developed countries and asked for $1 trillion in climate financing over the current decade, in order to meet its climate commitments. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced on November 2 that India would have a renewable energy target of 500 GW by 2030 and meet 50% of its energy needs from renewable sources, by then. It would also achieve net zero emissions by 2070, as per Mr Modi. ""Our commitments to refashion our energy basket remains intact,"" Ms Sitharaman said, adding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's commitments at COP26 are being ""taken seriously"" by India, which is moving forward on them. India's non-fossil energy capacity would reach 500 GW by 2030; it will meet 50% of its electricity requirements with renewable energy by 2030; reducing its total projected carbon emissions by a billion tonnes by 2030; it will reduce the carbon intensity of its economy to less than 45% and achieve net zero by 2070.\l"

Hoping to slow global warming and manage climate change, this is what the 200 participating nations came up with:Cop 26 Takeaways1. The US and China agreed to work together to limit global warming this decade. Together they contribute 40% of global annual carbon emissions2. India committed to Net Zero by 20704. Denmark and Costa Rica agreed to phase out oil and gas. They are accompanied by France, Greenland, Iceland, Quebec, Sweden and Wales as part of the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA)5. Saturday, for the first time in the conference's history fossil fuels were mentioned as a leading cause of climate change. To hit the 1.5C goal, 40% of existing coal-fired power plants must be closed and no new ones can be built.How We're HelpingCOP26 came to a close in Glasgow November 13th. It is clear that fossil fuels play a major role in global warming. Significantly cutting coal, gas and oil usage along with methane and carbon dioxide emissions will keep global warming below 1.5C.To replace the energy produced by fossil fuels, renewable energy production needs to increase. Wind energy is currently among the cleanest fossil fuel alternatives. Wind turbine energy production limits air pollution and CO emissions because it does not use fossil fuels. Wind farms also save water because they do not use it to cool their systems down, unlike coal-fired power plants.Maximizing green energy production, WindESCo's solutions access untapped potential at existing wind sites, offsetting the need for fossil fuels. WindESCo uses high speed data to determine if wind turbines are operating below potential. Then, we fix the underperformance. This results in a 1-2% AEP increase. Improving output just a few percentage points is equal to installing an additional turbine for every 20 turbines within an existing fleet over five years. Further, WindESCo often achieves results like this for customers without needing to step foot on-site or make physical upgrades to equipment.To continue increasing wind power, WindESCo recently announced its latest innovation, WindESCo Swarm. Swarm takes maximizing AEP of existing assets to a new level through collective control, increasing AEP by 3-5% site-wide. This allows turbines to learn from and adapt to their neighboring turbines, creating a cooperative turbine control system. Swarm creates retrofit and repowering opportunities that will substantially improve production worldwide at wind sites without the need to build new turbines. Swarm will also ensure that every last MW is captured at new sites.With accessible wind energy, we can all rely less on fossil fuels during the energy transition.

The Adaptation Fund can play a key role and that is why I am pleased to announce for the first time that the European Commission is committing 100 million to the Fund, to support developing countries.This additional 100 million contribution from the EU budget is by far the biggest pledge for the Adaptation Fund made by donors at . It comes on top of significant contributions already announced by Member States, and also confirms the EU's supporting role to the informal Champions Group on Adaptation Finance. The contribution will be made in a way that is compatible with EU financial rules. It underscores our determination to scale up finance to support climate adaptation objectives, and to strike a better balance between mitigation and adaptation, particularly in the most vulnerable countries and for the benefit of their most vulnerable populations. This applies first and foremost to Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States.International public climate finance plays an important role in helping developing countries to implement the 2015 Paris climate change agreement. Adaptation finance is one of the central topics of discussion at COP26 in Glasgow, and it is a high priority for the European Commission. The EU is already the largest provider of international climate finance. In 2020, the EU and its 27 Member States committed 23.39 billion in climate finance to support developing countries in reducing their greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to the impacts of climate change.\l"

Ultimately, Nature Day witnessed the endorsement of the 'Sustainable Agriculture Policy Action Agenda for the Transition to Sustainable Agriculture and Global Action Agenda for Innovation in Agriculture' (Policy Action Agenda, in short) by 45 countries.The signatories include Switzerland, Nigeria, Spain and the United Arab Emirates; altogether, they account for 10 per cent of total GHG emissions from agriculture. The Policy Action Agenda pledges to:protect natural environments and combat emissions from agriculture.The United Kingdom government declared that the signatories have agreed to ""urgent action and investment to protect nature and shift to more sustainable ways of farming.""Twenty-six countries set out new commitments to change their agricultural policies to become more sustainable and less polluting and to invest in the science needed for sustainable agriculture and for protecting food supplies against climate change.Its press statement also informed about a commitment of $4 billion (nearly Rs 30,000 crore) public sector investment into agricultural innovation. ""The commitments being made show that nature and land use is being recognised as essential to meeting the Paris Agreement goals, and will contribute to addressing the twin crises of climate change and biodiversity loss,"" said COP26 President Alok Sharma.Ahead of the UN Food Systems Summit September 23 this year, its agencies called for a sweeping review of global support to farmers that are making the planet warmer and also keeping it away from attaining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030.""Most of the support is in emission-intensive and environment-unfriendly sectors. For instance, the beef sector gets massive support and is also highly GHG-intensive. Bring down the support here. Basically, repurpose the support system,"" Joseph Glauber, senior research fellow with the International Food Policy Research Institute, said.High-income countries, for instance, needed to shift away massive support to their outsized meat and dairy industries - accounting 14.5 per cent global GHG emissions - to meet the Paris Agreement goals.There were expectations of countries taking effective pledges to bring in transformative changes in the food systems. Instead, consumption as an issue in agriculture system got a deliberate burial.The signed pledge didn't mention the words ""meat consumption"". In an interview to The Guardian daily, Thomas Vilsack, the United States secretary of agriculture, said: ""I do not think we have to reduce the amount of meat or livestock produced in the US.

"COP26","India","COP26_India219","'Message in a bottle' for COP26 leaders","November 11, 2021 Thursday","IANS-English","Glasgow, Nov 11 (IANS) On the penultimate day of COP26, scientists have deployed plastic pollution tracking devices into the ocean around Scotland. The devices will help scientists understand how plastic bottles move in the ocean and their interaction with climate change impacts, wildlife and weather patterns. The 'Message in a Bottle' tracking project is being run by -- Arribada Initiative, The University of Exeter, The University of Plymouth and the Zoological Society of London with support from #OneLess and OneOcean. In stage two, the four new tracking devices could pass over deep ocean trenches, across major migratory routes for marine mammals and birds, possibly beaching on distant shores. A recent study released by ZSL (Zoological Society London) and Bangor University revealed links between the global climate crisis and plastic pollution, including the impact of extreme weather worsening the distribution of microplastics into pristine and remote areas. With all eyes on the UN Climate Change Conference COP26 nearing its completion in Glasgow, the four devices have been named ""Heat"", ""Acidity"" ""Deoxygenation"" and 'Pollution' to draw attention to the need to adequately address these ocean crises in tandem and to ensure that a recurring ocean climate dialogue is fundamental to future COPs. Heather Koldewey of the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and University of Exeter, lead scientist on the project and Director of the #OneLess campaign said, ""Through our research we've seen that plastic and climate change are fundamentally and intrinsically linked. ""Plastic is made from fossil fuels, generating greenhouse gasses at every step of its life cycle and the impact of both plastic pollution and climate change are both prevalent around the world. These crises are truly interconnected. ""There is only one ocean and by tracking the flow of plastics we are trying to demonstrate the connectedness and the wide-reaching impact that humans are having on our planet. There is an urgency to acknowledge that the climate crisis is the ocean crisis."" Mirella von Lindenfels, Director of the International Programme on the State of the Ocean (IPSO), said: ""The ocean regulates our climate and buffers us from the full force of climate change by absorbing our excess heat and over a third of our CO2 emissions. Any irreversible and significant changes to the ocean could have profound economic and ecological consequences."" Over 359 million tonnes of plastic is produced annually and production has been predicted to double in the next 20 years. With more than 40 per cent of this amount allocated for single-use applications some groups, such as London's #OneLess campaign, have decided to start tackling the plastic pollution problem close to home. Over the past six years #OneLess has catalysed a change in the way Londoners drink water, from single-use plastic water bottles to refilling and reusing. The launch of the latest group of devices also coincides with COP26's Cities Day. The group hopes that this latest data on the movement of ocean plastic will inspire other cities across the globe to take steps to curb single-use plastic pollution for the sake of our ocean.

P. Gupta, the Environment Ministry's top permanent official.According to the ministry's figures, each Indian produces about 1.9 tonnes of carbon per year, against 7.1 tonnes for the average European Union citizen, 8.4 tonnes for a Chinese, and 18 tonnes for the average American.Minister Yadav said assessing and financing the world's campaign to limit temperature rises will be one of the most crucial tasks at Glasgow.""India will fill the role of the voice of developing nations,"" Mr Yadav told a small group of journalists on the eve of his departure for COP26. ""India will be a path to a solution with climate justice.""The country of 1.3 billion people, and one of the world's fastest growing economies, has long insisted that countries who profited from past industrialisation - Europe and North America - should pay the lion's share of the climate crisis bill.Mr Yadav noted the concern of poorer nations that richer ones have failed to live up to promises made at earlier climate summits to provide hundreds of billions of dollars in financial aid and technology.India has one of the world's leading solar power programmes, and United States climate envoy John Kerry said that the country was ""red hot"" for solar investment.But it currently counts on coal for about 70 per cent of generated electricity and will have to spend more than US$40 billion (S$54 billion) to dismantle just 14 per cent of its oldest and dirtiest coal power stations, according to the Climate Policy Initiative think tank.Mr Gupta said that without finance for poorer nations, ""it becomes extremely difficult to have green development at our own cost"".\l"

On Monday, the Indian delegation warned that global action on the climate crisis is contingent on timely and adequate financing from developed countries. Instead of finalising a road map, India added, the rich world is trying to renegotiate who or which countries will provide resources for climate change mitigation, and how often nationally determined contributions will be updated, violating principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities. India has also flagged that ""trust in multilateralism"" is at stake due to the failure of the rich world to deliver the $100 billion-a-year fund. Many developing countries seconded India's view.India and the other developing countries have every reason to feel shortchanged. In 2009, rich nations promised to give developing countries $100 billion a year by 2020 to help them adapt to the climate crisis. But now they are resisting demands for a new finance goal for the post-2025 period, financial compensation for loss and damage, and an independent review of the promised $100 billion-a-year financing. Then is also the issue of whether more countries (such as China and Saudi Arabia, even India) should be added to the list of donors. Discussions are also underway on whether private capital can be included in the finance goal. India has said clearly (and correctly) that it doesn't consider commercial finance to be climate finance, which has to be concessional and grant-based.In the run-up to COP26, there was pressure on the developing world, including India, to enhance their climate ambition, even though they are in no way responsible for the climate crisis and have their development goals to meet. Yet, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a set of climate plans that most experts have called ""substantive"". As things stand now, the real problem seems to be that the developed world doesn't want to hold up its end of the bargain. The basic principle of climate justice and equity will be violated if they do not respond to the enhanced commitments with finance. The success of Glasgow will not be judged by how many countries sign up for net-zero targets, but how much money the rich world, the historical polluter, is willing to put up to enable this transition.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

This finance is for the transition project itself that was announced between several developed countries and our President Cyril Ramaphosa at the beginning of COP26. But let me clarify, this is an offer from the developed countries, it is not a deal.IFP MP Elphas Buthelezi had asked what the plans were for the climate change financing that was recently announced in Glascow during climate change negotiations.Gordhan said one of the issues at that were quite sharply debated was who would finance the transition to lower carbon energy.He said in South Africas case, 41% of the countrys emissions actually come from electricity production and therefore, on the one hand, we have got to prepare for the transitioning of Eskom and other such equipment or facilities that we have at a national level to a more climate friendly and decarbonised state.He said South Africa put forward three projects for consideration for those who would be interested in financing the transition, which in the main, has to be the developed countries, through or with multilateral financial and other institutions.And those three projects were the Eskom just energy transition project, secondly the green hydrogen project and thirdly, transitioning SAs automobile industry to the production of electric vehicles, he said.Gordhan said the just energy transition is a project that Eskom has developed at the Komati power station and once it gets the appropriate backing - financially speaking - it would have an important impact in terms of repurposing the power station, retraining workers who are currently employed at the power station and preparing new workers into the new energy situation that we would be moving to while mitigating the impact on communities that are in some relationship with the power station or the coalmines themselves.He said negotiations will now take place at a technical level to appreciate whether these offers will be compatible with SAs financial requirements and capabilities.The Eskom debt issue as we know has been very much with us. But let me emphasise that this financing has nothing to do with Eskom debt.Secondly, the Eskom debt was accumulated because a decision was made by previous governments to finance the development of Medupi and Kusile through the tariff applications to Nersa and not by any equity injections. Thirdly, there are various proposals that we will consider together with the National Treasury and other stakeholders how the Eskom debt should be dealt with and clearly, among the role-players that have to take part in this process will be government itself, the PICWhat we will have soon is a pro-forma balance sheet of a new Eskom with a different distribution of debt with the acceptance and buy in of the lenders that have lent money to Eskom.\l"

The 18-year-old Swede said the international summit is no longer a climate conference and snubbed it as a 'greenwash festival'. While Thunberg chose to walk out of a panel discussion at COP26, a 15-year-old Indian girl made the heads of government sit down and take note of the climate concerns. ""Many of my generation are angry and frustrated at leaders who've made empty promises and failed to deliver. And we have every reason to be angry. But I've no time for anger.

In a power-packed speech, Umashankar appealed to her audience, which included the US President Joe Biden, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and host of other global leaders, to 'stop talking and start doing'. 'Award winning innovator' Umashankar was one of the finalists of Prince William's Earthshot Prize, dubbed as Eco Oscars. The Class 10 student at SKP Vanitha International School in Tiruvannamalai, was shortlisted in October under 'Clean our air' category for innovating a solar-powered ironing cart. The innovation was aimed at replacing the 300-year-old practice of using charcoal-based iron boxes used by vendors, to press clothes, in India and in most developing countries. According to Umashankar, there are over 10 million such carts in India, each burning 5 kilos of charcoal every day. . Her innovation won her several laurels including the prestigious Children's Climate Prize in November 2021, which is considered to be the most significant awards for young innovators. While Delhi-based agri recycling project 'Takachar' won the Earthshot Prize under 'clean our air' category, it was Umashankar's powerful speech that won many hearts at COP26. Leaders cheer ""Feeling optimistic as I head home from #COP26 having met our @EarthshotPrize Winners & Finalists and discussed their solutions to repair our planet.

"COP26","India","COP26_India235","COP26: Time runs out, issues unresolved, no agreement yet","November 13, 2021 Saturday","Indian Express","THE COP26 meeting in Glasgow had an unusually productive start, with several countries, including India, promising new climate actions to strengthen the global fight against climate change. The ending, however, was likely to happen in a familiar fashion.As has happened with most of the earlier climate change conferences, the 26th session of Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP26 for short, was unable to deliver an agreement on time, and negotiations were set to spill over to Saturday.Several issues that were supposed to be wrapped up here, including those related to finance and rules for the establishment of a new carbon market, remain unresolved, and the excitement generated by the big-ticket announcements of the first week are likely to get dampened by the weak agreement that is set to come out now. There isn't enough time to wrap up the discussions on all the pending issues, and it is possible that some of them may be kicked to the next year's meeting.COP26 was billed as the meeting that would give the world a meaningful chance to hold the rise in global temperatures within 1.5 degree Celsius from the pre-industrial times, against the 2 degree Celsius that is the main goal of the Paris Agreement. Assessments of the climate actions being taken by the countries suggest that the world, in fact, was headed towards a 2.7 degree Celsius temperature rise by the end of the century. COP26 was supposed to deliver an agreement that would have spurred stronger action from countries in a bid to put the world towards a 1.5 degree pathway.That seems like a tall ask now, as familiar issues like availability of climate finance, continuing to remain intractable.""We need to deliver a strong message regarding our collective resolve for accelerated mitigation and adaptation actions to combat climate change in this decade. This message will have credibility only if accompanied by an equally strong resolve of developed country parties to mobilise and provide enhanced climate finance to developing country parties,"" India's lead negotiator Richa Sharma, an additional secretary in the Environment Ministry, said at one of the meetings on Friday. ""We express our disappointment at the lack of significant progress in climate finance related agenda items,"" she said.Opinion|What India must do to follow through on COP26 commitmentsOn the last official day of the conference on Friday, negotiators were able to produce a new draft agreement, the second so far, which was considered an improvement on the previous one but not good enough.In fact, unhappy with the weak outcomes being proposed, civil society groups, which form a strong community of participants at the COPs, held a parallel 'people's plenary' at the venue, and then organised a march outside to press for stronger agreement.The new drafts were not drastically different from the first one, but many of the seemingly small changes in language, or emphasis, have consequences and legal implications, and represented hours of negotiations. For example, while the first text noted ""with regret"" the failure of the developed countries to deliver on the promised US$ 100 billion by 2020, the latest one has noted it ""with deep regret"".A group of developing countries, which included India and China, had expressed dissatisfaction with the first draft, especially the section relating to mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, and had demanded that it be overhauled completely. The new draft, however, is not very different from the earlier one, though the principle of common and differentiated responsibility (CBDR), which recognises that developing countries have a relatively minor burden in the fight against climate change, has been accorded greater emphasis.Crucially, a mention on phase-out of coal and fossil fuels has survived, though an important qualification has been added, apparently on the insistence of countries which still depend on coal power plants for generating electricity. This is the first time in over 20 years that coal or fossil-fuels usage has found a mention in any document or decision of the climate change meetings, and was being considered a significant forward movement. The first draft called upon the countries to ""accelerate the phase-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels"". In the second draft released on Friday morning, this has been tweaked to a call for accelerating the phase-out of ""unabated coal power"" and ""insufficient subsidies"" on fossil fuels.The second draft also retains the call for doubling of finance for adaptation, an important demand of the developing countries which have been lamenting the extremely inadequate availability of money for adaptation. It has also been made more specific. Developed countries are being asked to double climate finance from present levels by the year 2025. The specifics were missing in the earlier draft.\l"

Many of them joined an array of new partnerships and alliances struck in the first week. As I write, negotiators are locked in tense talks to try and land the final COP26 agreement. But whether the summit succeeds or fails doesn't depend solely on the decisions reached this week.From the outset, COP26 was seen not as an end point, but a kickstart to a decade of truly transformative action. Only in coming years will we know if the event was a real game-changer for the planet, or just empty promises and spin.COP26COP26: a journey, not a destinationThe UK government, as the conference hosts, knew early on that most countries would bring new climate ambition - known in COP-speak as ""nationally determined contributions"". But it also knew these pledges would never be be enough.For COP26First were a series of side deals to kick things along. These came in the form of a new global pledge to reduce emissions of methane - a highly potent greenhouse gas - as well as deals on coal phase-out, deforestation, climate finance and more.Second, countries would have to further ratchet up their commitments in coming years. That means the final negotiated outcome of , due on Friday Glasgow time, must require nations to make immediate further increases in emission-reduction ambition.As I write, that outcome is uncertain at best. Read more: Take heart at what's unfolded at COP26 in Glasgow - the world can still hold global heating to 1.5Perhaps unsurprisingly, Australia is among a group of nations working to have that part of the text softened, or removed from the final agreement entirely. That is a worrying sign, though there will be many other countries fighting hard to ensure it stays in.Negotiators have spent countless hours arguing over the minutiae of the final text, and there's still a way to go yet. But if the final agreement is too weak, the 1.5 goal is at serious risk.The draft wording is weaker than that sought by a group of 50 of the world's most climate-vulnerable countries, which want national commitments to be reviewed and strengthened each year between now and 2025. However, the wording is still stronger than many observers anticipated.And while COP26COP26 failed to deliver adequate finance to developing nations to help them deal with climate change.. Dita Alangkara/AP Australia outdid itselfBeing an Australian at international climate talks is rarely a comfortable experience. Australia long ago cemented its reputation as a drag on global climate cooperation - known for its weak targets, obstructive approach and demands for special treatment.However, even seasoned observers have been taken aback by Australia's actions before and during COP26Australia went to Glasgow as just about the only developed country without a new and significantly stronger 2030 emissions reduction target.The Morrison government then proceeded to use the Australia pavilion inside the COP venue to promote the interests of fossil fuel companies such as Santos.Australia also refused to sign up to two signature deals at COP26 - the global pledge to cut methane emissions, and one to phase out coal-fired power. Read more: The fate of our planet depends on the next few days of complex diplomacy in Glasgow. Here's what needs to go rightDespite Australia's recalcitrance, the coal pledge, in particular, is a big step forward in global terms.In years past, nations agreeing to a coal phase-out were not particularly reliant on coal. This time, signatories included big coal-using nations such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Poland, the Ukraine and South Korea.This development, among others, makes one thing abundantly clear: the world is moving fast while Australia stands still. Sooner rather than later, Australia will feel the cost of its inaction - not just in the hit to our international reputation, but in foregone economic opportunities in the clean industries of the future.'Try harder. Try harder'International climate talks can feel far removed from the urgent reality of the climate crisis. But at every COP, someone invariably manages to cut through the noise with a brutally honest and rousing contribution.This year it was Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley, who at the outset of the conference excoriated leaders for failing on the promises of the Paris Agreement.Mottley's commanding eight-minute speech was a show-stopping moment. As world leaders including US President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson looked on, Mottley declared a 2 increase in global temperatures would be a ""death sentence"" for small developing island nations.She went on:For those who have eyes to see. For those who have ears to listen. And for those who have a heart to feel ... We do not want that dreaded death sentence, and we have come here today to say 'Try harder. Try harder'.COP26.So did the world try harder in Glasgow? The progress we've so far seen during the conference, and in the lead up, would have been unimaginable only a few years ago. The surprise pact between the US and China - in which the two nations recognised climate change as an ""existential threat"" - is a case in point.But the summit's final outcome is still likely to fall massively short of what the science demands. The real test of is whether pledges are honoured, and if the talks have triggered a virtuous cycle of increased ambition and action over the next decade.Climate Council research director Simon Bradshaw, who travelled with Tim Flannery to COP26, assisted with the drafting of this article.Tim Flannery works for the Climate Council and the not-for-profit Ocean Forests Foundation.

"COP26","India","COP26_India239","The ultimate guide to why the COP26 summit ended in failure and disappointment (despite bright spots)","November 15, 2021 Monday 6:30 AM EST","EveningReport.nz","ANALYSIS:By Robert Hales, Griffith University and Brendan Mackey, Griffith UniversityAfter two hard-fought weeks of negotiations, the Glasgow climate change summit is, at last, over. All 197 participating countries adopted the so-called Glasgow Climate Pact, despite an 11th hour intervention by India in which the final agreement was watered down from ""phasing out"" coal to ""phasing down"".In an emotional final speech, COP26 president Alok Sharma apologised for this last-minute change.His apology goes to the heart of the goals of COP26 in Glasgow: the hope it would deliver outcomes matching the urgent ""code red"" action needed to achieve the Paris Agreement target.COP26 GLASGOW 2021At the summit's outset, UN Secretary-General Antnio Guterres urged countries to ""keep the goal of 1.5 alive"", to accelerate the decarbonisation of the global economy, and to phase out coal.So, was COP26But among the failures, there were important decisions and notable bright spots. So let's take a look at the summit's defining issues.We've made serious breakthroughs @COP26.We've kept 1.5 alive and made huge progress on coal, cars, cash and trees.And while there is still so much that needs to be done to save our planet, we'll look back at COP26- Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) November 13, 2021Weak 2030 targets The goal of the Paris Agreement is to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 this century, and to pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5. Catastrophic impacts will be unleashed beyond this point, such as sea level rise and more intense and frequent natural disasters.But new projections from Climate Action Tracker show even if all COP26 pledges are met, the planet is on track to warm by 2.1 - or 2.4 if only 2030 targets are met.Despite the Australian government's recent climate announcements, this nation's 2030 target remains the same as in 2015. If all countries adopted such meagre near-term targets, global temperature rise would be on track for up to 3.Technically, the 1.5 limit is still within reach because, under the Glasgow pact, countries are asked to update their 2030 targets in a year's time. However, as Sharma said, ""the pulse of 1.5 is weak"".And as Australia's experience shows, domestic politics rather than international pressure is often the force driving climate policy. So there are no guarantees Australia or other nations will deliver greater ambition in 2022.""Many of our small, low-lying islands may disappear by the end of this century. That means the country will be lost.""Palau's Environment Minister Steven Victor tells #Newsnight decisions made tonight at #COP26 are also about ""deciding whether we keep a culture alive"" pic.twitter.com/Qnr0X219om- BBC Newsnight (@BBCNewsnight) November 11, 2021 India's intervention to change the final wording to ""phase down"" coal rather than ""phase out"" dampens the urgency to shift away from coal.India is the world's third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, after China and the United States. The country relies heavily on coal, and coal-powered generation is expected to grow by 4.6 percent each year to 2024.India was the most prominent objector to the ""phase out"" wording, but also had support from China.And US climate envoy John Kerry argued that carbon capture and storage technology could be developed further, to trap emissions at the source and store them underground.Carbon capture and storage is a controversial proposition for climate action. It is not proven at scale, and we don't yet know if captured emissions stored underground will eventually return to the atmosphere. And around the world, relatively few large-scale underground storage locations exist.It is hard to see this expensive technology ever being cost-competitive with cheap renewable energy.In a crucial outcome, COP26 also finalised rules for global carbon trading, known as Article 6 under the Paris Agreement. However under the rules, the fossil fuel industry will be allowed to ""offset"" its carbon emissions and carry on polluting. Combined with the ""phasing down"" change, this will see fossil fuel emissions continue.It wasn't all bad Despite the shortcomings, COP26 led to a number of important positive outcomes.The world has taken an unambiguous turn away from fossil fuel as a source of energy. And the 1.5 global warming target has taken centre stage, with the recognition that reaching this target will require rapid, deep and sustained emissions reductions of 45 percent by 2030, relative to 2010 levels.What's more, the pact emphasises the importance to mitigation of nature and ecosystems, including protecting forests and biodiversity. This comes on top of a side deal struck by Australia and 123 other countries promising to end deforestation by 2030.The pact also urges countries to fully deliver on an outstanding promise to deliver US$100 billion a year for five years to developing countries vulnerable to climate damage. It also emphasises the importance of transparency in implementing the pledges.Nations are also invited to revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022. In support of this, it was agreed to hold a high-level ministerial roundtable meeting each year focused on raising ambition out to 2030.The US and China climate agreement is also cause for cautious optimism.Despite the world not being on track for the 1.5 goal, momentum is headed in the right direction. And the mere fact that a reduction in coal use was directly addressed in the final text signals change may be possible.But whether it comes in the small window we have left to stop catastrophic climate change remains to be seen.Dr Robert Hales, director of the Centre for Sustainable Enterprise, Griffith University and Dr Brendan Mackey, director of the Griffith Climate Change Response Programme, Griffith University.

My verdict is a resounding ""no"".I say this not only because the commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions are way below the required level, but also because has once again highlighted the deep distrust between the already rich and the emerging world. It did little to acknowledge that combatting climate change requires cooperation at a scale never seen before.But as all of us are looking to clutch onto some signs of hope, let me also spell out what we have gained at Glasgow. The fact is the world came together after a gap of two years and back-breaking lockdowns and economic losses - due to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) - to acknowledge that the threat of climate change is real and that urgent transformational actions are needed.We are seeing the onslaught of weird and extreme weather events and increased energy prices across the world. It is clear that there is no going back - Planet Earth needs drastic emission reductions now, by the end of this decade, not later.However, the Glasgow Climate Pact's fundamental and fatal flaw is engraved in its very first page. ""It notes"", rather dismissively, ""the importance for some of the concept of climate justice"". From this point, the entire architecture of ambitious and effective action collapses. Why do I say this?Climate change is about the past, the present and about the future. We cannot erase the fact that certain countries (the US, EU-27, UK, Canada, Australia, Japan and Russia, and now China) have consumed roughly 70 per cent of the carbon budget - the space in the atmosphere that is available to limit the temperature rise to 1.5degC.But some 70 per cent of the world's people still need the right to development. As these countries grow, they will add emissions and take the world to catastrophic levels of temperature rise. It is for this reason climate justice is not an add-on concept for some , but the pre-requisite for an effective and ambitious agreement.This lack of understanding is at the core of the problem. It is for this reason that the closing plenary working overtime to reach a deal saw the delegate from the EU- which incidentally has still not phased out coal - chastise the recalcitrant ""natives"" about the imperative of climate change.This is when the world of the ""natives"" is reeling under devastation caused by the cumulative emissions of the already developed nations, including the EU. It is also nothing less than shameful that the world has reneged on the fact that it needed to act on ""loss and damage"", and it needs to do this, not with lofty words and promises of new committees and discussions, but with hard money for reparation.It is the same with the need for adaptation - countries have to find ways to deal with the growing ravages of extreme weather. The Glasgow Climate Pact's only achievement - if you can call it so - is that it acknowledges and reiterates the need for financial support for adaptation. But it does nothing more than this.There is no seriousness or intent shown by the already rich countries to pay for these costs, including the cost of mitigation in the still developing world. The Glasgow Climate Pact ""notes with deep regret"" that the goal of developed countries to mobilise US $100 billion by 2020, has not been realised. Climate finance is still considered to be part of the narrative on ""charity"" and the rich world is frankly no longer interested to make the payments.But the fact is this finance is for climate justice - the same that has been dismissed in the text as important for some . It is needed because the global pact on climate change demands that the countries that have created the problem - countries that are the cause of the cumulative carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere - must reduce the emissions drastically based on their contribution.The rest of the world, which has not added emissions, must get the right to development; to ensure that this growth is low-carbon, finance and technology will be provided. It is part of the cooperative agreement of this interdependent world.But post CoP26We cannot move the burden of the energy transition to developing countries that are also the most vulnerable to climate change impacts. Climate change is an existential threat and what CoP26 should teach us is that it needs more than kindergarten diplomacy to keep the world safe. Glasgow cop 26 glasgow glasgow breakthroughs.

The Glasgow climate change summit is the 26th session of the conference. COP26 summit comes just months after the United Nations report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) showed that the world was warming faster than previously thought. With climate change keeping the world leaders, scientists and environmentalists concerned, expectations are higher from the COP this year. This COP also marks five years of COP21 when a landmark climate change treaty, called the Paris Agreement was signed. The anniversary is even more significant as countries evaluate progress made to deal with the challenges of climate change every five years. During COP21 in 2015, countries signed treaties pledging to work hard towards keeping warming under 1.5\'baC. With less than six weeks to go for the United Nations Climate Change Conference, here is everything you need to know. WHAT IS COP26? COP or the Conference of the Parties refers to the meeting of the 197 member-countries who have ratified the COP under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Every year, the talks are hosted by a different country where delegates from every government take part to advance global efforts to ward off the adverse impact of climate change. The COP negotiations are centred on the legal mechanisms for governments to hold each other accountable. The summit sees politicians, business leaders, campaigners and journalists engaging in discourse on what climate action means in the real world. WHEN IS COP26? COP26 was originally scheduled to be held last year but it had to be postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. After a gap of two years, the conference will begin from October 31 this year and go on till November 12. WHO IS HOSTING? The COP 26 UN Climate Change Conference will be hosted by the UK in partnership with Italy. The climate conference is being held at the Scottish Event Campus (SEC) in Glasgow. WHY GLASGOW? The UK, the president of COP, is hosting the conference this year and while London is its capital, Glasgow has been chosen to host the pivotal UN conference on climate change. Glasgow, the largest city of Scotland, seems to be a perfect choice for hosting a summit on climate change. It was recently awarded the status of Global Green City and has a target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2030. Besides, it has been one of the foremost locations for cultural events. According to Glasgow City Council, ""Glasgow was chosen by the UK to host COP26 due to its experience in hosting world-class events, commitment to sustainability and first-rate facilities"". WHO WILL BE ATTENDING? The COP26 summit will bring together the signatories of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), a treaty inked in 1994. The climate conference is expected to be attended by as many as 30,000 people this year including world leaders, NGOs, businesses, journalists, negotiators, and protestors. Leaders of all the signatories to the UNFCCC are expected to attend the summit. There are a total of 197 signatory parties.ALSO READ | HYPERLINK https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/unga-climate-change-funds-cop-26-summit-antonio-guterres-1855152-2021-09-21$100000000000: That's how much UN needs to fight climate change every year, but it doesn't haveBIG NAMES Among the high-profile attendees are Queen Elizabeth of Britain, Pope Francis, broadcaster and author David Attenborough and climate activist Greta Thunberg.

The meeting was expected to ""finalise the rulebook of the Paris Agreement"" but was ""unable to reach consensus in many areas"". Back then, the UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres expressed his disappointment with the result and said, ""The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis."" The UK government is hopeful that COP26 will have a better outcome than COP25. WHAT ARE THE GOALS OF COP26? This year's climate conference will focus on moving the climate change process forward and delivering the 2015 Paris Agreement goals. During the summit, leaders will monitor the progress by evaluating what has and hasn't been achieved since 2015. They will also set plans to reach the Paris Agreement targets. All 197 countries had collectively agreed in 2015 to strive to cut emissions to limit global temperature rise ""well below 2C"" and strive for 1.5C. As per nationally determined contributions (NDCs), every country was asked to set out targets for contributing emissions reductions by 2025 or 2030. Cop26 President Alok Sharma called the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report a ""wake-up call"" for the world.

It also says the quality of climate finance needs improving, with more grants and fewer loans.The draft mentions the contentious issue of compensation. It asks rich countries - whose historical greenhouse gas emissions are largely responsible for global warming - to provide more support to address the damage climate change is already doing, but steers clear of saying how much or laying out firm rules on raising the money.Small island states says they will push in the final COP26 talks for a stronger finance deal.FOSSIL FUELSThe draft text takes aim at the burning of coal, oil and gas, telling countries to ""accelerate the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels"".That would mark the first time fossil fuels are named and shamed in the conclusions of a UN climate summit - a contentious move that some countries are expected to resist, even though the proposal did not set a fixed date for phasing out the fuels.The document also spells out exactly how fast the world needs to cut CO2 emissions to cap global warming to 1.5C - by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and to net zero by 2050 - effectively setting the benchmark that countries' future climate pledges will be measured against.\l"

"COP26","India","COP26_India255","Why carbon markets are set to explode after COP26","November 29, 2021 Monday","Business Line","What are carbon credits/offsets? Carbon credits or carbon offsets are 'points' issued to an entity for undertaking an activity that has the effect of either avoiding emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere or absorbing some of the CO2 back from the atmosphere. One credit is given for a one-tonne reduction in CO2. What does one do with the credit? Sell and make money. That's the reward for avoiding or sequestering CO2 and thereby helping to limit the rise of global warming. To the buyer, it is the penalty paid for not being able to avoid spewing or sequestering CO2. So, the buyer of the carbon credit pays someone else - the seller - for doing the right thing, which is to reduce CO2 in the atmosphere. Who are the typical buyers and sellers? The sellers could be anybody who saves CO2. A company recently formed with the intention of giving away cookstoves worth  1,600 apiece, free of cost, to poor villagers, in exchange for carbon credits that are worth more - because the cookstoves save fuelwood. The buyers are typically companies, governments, municipalities or any other organisations. For example, companies like Google, Amazon and Apple have vowed to go 'net zero' by a certain date, which means their operations will put into the atmosphere no more greenhouse gases than they can absorb back. Since it is neither possible to fully stop greenhouse gas emissions or absorb all of them back, they just keep their promise by buying carbon credits. And now, governments, which have international emission reduction commitments, will also buy the credits. Is there going to be an active market in carbon credits? There is already one in place, where the buyers are the companies that plan to go carbon neutral. Now, with the rules for the functioning of the markets having been agreed upon in the recent COP26 Glasgow climate talks, you can expect a deepening of the market. What factors prevented the carbon markets from evolving? Did COP26 Fortunately, all these three issues have been settled at COP26. On the old carbon credits, it has been agreed that all those credits (CERs) issued between January 1, 2013 and December 30, 2020, would be good to be sold in the market. There was an agreement that there would be no double counting. It has been left to the respective government to decide which activity (project) would go towards extinguishing its own commitment and which would be for tradable carbon credits. On 'share of proceeds', it was agreed that 5 per cent of the proceeds of market transactions would be levied and put into a fund. There is no fee for bilateral transactions, but countries are ""encouraged"" to voluntarily give. Switzerland has agreed to put $25million into the Adaptation Fund.\l"

Developed countries are also keen to expand the list of donor countries, possibly including China to provide climate finance.

India's economy is expected to face even harder days ahead. Hard data shows Indian economy has been shrinking since the last five years and any rebound will be slow.Attracting climate finance to fund India's pledges will require big leaps in how the country adopts and implements its ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) commitments. Except for a few big corporates, adopting ESG in India continues to be a huge challenge.Social and governance indicators appear to be worsening due to the pandemic, except the stock market which surprisingly, has been doing well. Investor activism and regulator push is improving corporate governance standards. The same cannot be said of the environment, clean air, water and the waste sectors. India has the worst indicators in all these.The big potential of turning waste to wealth has started attracting entrepreneurial interest. Immense value can be unlocked from food, construction, electronic, farm and automobile waste. Ramky Infrastructure and Wastelink are leading this charge. This is good both for the economy and the environment. The central and state governments can consider encouraging this sector with attractive incentives.India's Promise at COP26 India will get its non-fossil energy capacity to 500 giga watt by 2030 India will meet 50 per cent of its energy requirements till 2030 with renewable energy India will reduce its projected carbon emission by one billion tonnes by 2030 India will reduce the carbon intensity of its economy by 45 per cent by 2030 India will achieve net zero by 2070 Indian Railways to be net zero by 2030Given the market's volatility-driven economic realities, this could be a good time for India to work harder on the S and the G part of ESG while showing genuine intent on the E part.In their new book Outlast - How ESG Can Benefit Your Business, authors Mukund Rajan and Col. Rajeev Kumar quote a Climate Policy Initiative study showing a massive mismatch between the amount of climate finance needed and what India has managed to raise in recent years. India's green finance flows in 2017 and 2018 averaged around $19 billion compared to $170 billion required per year to meet its NDCs (nationally determined contribution) under the Paris Climate Pact. Foreign direct investment could propel investment in green projects, but will it be enough?India now has the fourth highest installed renewable energy capacity. However, it is finding it challenging to economically and efficiently utilize this power. Grid management, legacy thermal plant issues, poor financial health of state electricity bodies are dragging the immense promise of the renewal energy sector. With India investing big in hydrogen, are investors in renewable energy feel jittery?For now, a slowing economic growth and consumption is good news for the climate but not to the economy.

""And our minister was quite clear when he read it out that this is not India's national position, and that this is what everybody had agreed to, but it got drowned out in the din of it,"" said sources in the know of the deliberations at the Glasgow climate summit.""The compromise text by everyone there was articulated by our minister. India did not ask for 'phase down' to be introduced; it was a proposal that came to us, and we agreed to the final text. We were trying to achieve a consensus, to find a language that would ensure an outcome for the COP26,"" the sources added.In fact, the sources said, the term ""phase down"" is part of the US-China Joint Glasgow Declaration issued on November 10, which says ""China will phase down coal consumption during the 15th Five Year Plan"", which the climate negotiators used in the final text.On the issue of phasing out of coal and fossil fuel subsidies, the sources emphasized that India is dependent on coal for its energy needs. ""We do have concerns regarding coal, but you can't tell us to shut down our main energy source. Countries (developed ones) that are done with using coal are now using natural gas, and oil, which too are fossil fuels,"" the sources pointed out.""If you (developed countries) tell us phase out coal, phase out fossil fuels, we have a problem with that. We are dependent on coal. We will have to enhance the goals, we don't have an immediate solution to it.""The LPG subsidy is helping people move away from biomass to cleaner fuel, but developed countries want India to phase it out without targeted support, the sources said.India is okay with removing fossil fuels, ""but there needs to be equity in that"". India's energy requirement is going to go up in per capita basis and aggregate basis, but developed countries are ""picking and choosing what they want to phase out"". ""For coal they say phase it out, but for other fossil fuels, like gas and oil, they say yes, because they are using it en-mass"".India said that if the final text has to include the term ""phase out"" then it should be subject to the inclusion of phrases like ""National circumstances"", ""poor and vulnerable"". ""That was the kind of language we wanted to put in"".According to the sources ""Whenever there are disagreements over text, they go back to the last agreed text, and in this case it was the US and China's Glasgow Declaration, which used phase down. So phase down came out of that.""But the Small Island Developing States wanted phase out for the inefficient fossil fuel subsidy, ""and we were okay with that"".""So it was not India's proposal, but it was a way to close the after one day of delay,"" the sources said.But towards the end ""it turned out to be a blame India game"".India had mentioned its concerns about phasing out coal right through the deliberations, the sources said.

"COP26","India","COP26_India281","Climate finance, carbon mkts to top India's agenda at COP26","October 31, 2021 Sunday","Hindustan Times Chandigarh","New Delhi, Oct. 31 -- The United Nations climate summit that begins in Glasgow on Sunday could be the last chance for humanity to tackle the catastrophic changes due to unrestrained global warming, scientists and activists have said.Under current national climate commitments, the world is on track for a temperature increase of 2.7 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, the United Nations Environment Programme warned on October 25, which is much above the goal of the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement to keep it below 2 degrees compared with the beginning of the industrial era.Unless countries agree to steeply cut carbon emissions, global temperatures will rise beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius in the next 10 to 20 years compared with pre-industrial times, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world's largest group of climate experts, had said in its scientific assessment in August.Scientists, activists and environmentalists believe that the Glasgow summit, also known as COP26, could be the last opportunity to keep global warming to agreed upon limits.Over 25,000 delegates are expected to gather in Glasgow for the climate talks. While one of the main agenda is keeping the 1.5 degrees goal alive, countries will have to negotiate and agree on several critical issues like carbon markets, loss and damage and long-term climate finance.In the previous conference held in Madrid in 2019, countries were unable to reach an agreement on new market mechanisms. Several other issues were left unresolved as well, including common time frames for implementation of voluntary national pledges, long-term climate finance and transparency on climate action, all of which will have to be resolved at COP26. begins with the World Leaders' Summit on November 1 and 2, which will be attended by over 120 world leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. Usually, the leaders' summit is held in the second week of the annual talks. The world leaders are this time expected to set the tone for COP26 and declare their intent of containing global warming even before negotiations start.At the Rome summit of the G20 nations, the climate crisis featured high on the agenda. G20 leaders, including Modi, are expected to reach a consensus on how to deal with the crisis and transition to a low-carbon economy.""This time, world leaders will set the agenda for COP26, which is a positive development,"" Sunita Narain, director general of advocacy group Centre for Science and Environment, said at a media briefing. ""Over the past few decades, climate negotiations were going nowhere. COP26 must reclaim its leadership and the trust of people from across the world, both rich and poor. It must not be lost to the usual prevarication in negotiations and the tantrums and posturings of pusillanimous leaders.""For India, the two critical issues are climate finance and carbon markets. India seeks a level playing field for all countries by pushing for climate finance and technology transfer, environment minister Bhupender Yadav, who is the leader of India's delegation, had told HT in an interview on October 29.Carbon markets are critical for India because trading can lead to both a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions and can generate climate finance, he said.Carbon markets are touted to be one of the most efficient tools to keep mean global temperature rise to under 2 degrees by capping global emissions globally after 2020. Simply put, when a country limits carbon emissions through a project, it creates carbon credits, which can be sold to another nation that fails to meet its target.Under the Paris Agreement, nations will have to come out with a new market mechanism, but there are logjams over various issues.For example, India wants unused carbon credits from the Kyoto Protocol era to be recognised and traded, while experts from the developed world have raised concerns that these credits could flood and ruin the new market even before it starts.Climate finance is the other contentious issue expected to feature prominently in the summit.According to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change's standing committee on Finance, developing countries need almost $6 trillion up to 2030 to implement their national commitments.The highly anticipated climate finance delivery plan released last week said developed countries will likely be able to mobilise the promised $100 billion a year only in 2023, a delay of three years from the 2020 deadl"

The data also provides confidence that developed countries can mobilise more than $100 billion per year thereafter through to 2025.Climate finance plays a critical role in helping developing countries fight climate change and adapt to its impacts. In 2009, developed countries agreed to mobilise $100 billion in climate finance per year by 2020, and in 2015 agreed to extend this goal through to 2025. While developed countries have significantly scaled-up their support over the last decade, new analysis shows the $100 billion goal was unlikely to have been met in 2020 and is likely to also fall short in 2021 and 2022.Ahead of COP26Building on assessments of progress on the $100 billion goal to date, the Delivery Plan sets out an estimated trajectory of climate finance from 2021 through to 2025 - taking into account new climate finance pledges from individual developed countries and multilateral development banks. It also sets out principles on how to improve the delivery of climate finance.Whilst it is disappointing that the goal has not been met so far, the redoubling or significantly increased efforts from a large number of developed countries - including the UK, Canada, Germany and others means we are now much closer to the target and are delivering funds to support countries on actions against climate change.Private climate finance has also underperformed against expectations, the plan makes clear that more needs to be done in this respect, but does not rely on a significant improvement in this for the goal to be met by 2023.Furthermore, based on consultations undertaken by Minister Wilkinson and State Secretary Flasbarth, additional pledges from developed countries may be expected this year but are not yet ready to be included in the analysis at the time of publishing. These are likely to further increase the projections outl"

'Let's Talk Energy' saw 80 young people from 10 secondary schools come together to create their own Net Zero Energy Policy for Scotland - setting out the changes the country needs to make to achieve the Scottish Government's target of Net Zero by 2045.Their top three priorities were: Supporting skills development, including training options for young people in the renewables industry, to deliver green jobs and a positive long-term future Improving processes to make renewable energy available faster than ever before and making it easier to switch to a low-carbon lifestyle.Making it simpler to switch to greener forms of transport - whether electric vehicles you can charge at home or electrifying trains and buses - and providing funding to help communities make the transition to Net Zero also scored highly.Lindsay McQuade, CEO of ScottishPower Renewables, said: ""Young people's voices are being heard loud and clear at and it was inspiring and encouraging to hear their views on what we have to do now if we're going to achieve Net Zero by 2045. They recognise fully that we need do more, and do it faster, if we're going to address the climate emergency and they got straight to the point. As they set out, Scotland has enormous potential, but we will only achieve Net Zero with the right investment, skills development and processes in place. They have a bold vision for a cleaner and greener country, and it's a vision that can become a reality if we all take climate action now.""ScottishPower is the UK's only integrated energy company and generates 100% green electricity from offshore and onshore wind. It is developing an energy model that will help the UK reach world-leading climate change targets and is investing 10billion in the UK over five years - 6 million every working day - to double its renewable generation capacity and drive forward decarbonisation to support net zero emissions. It is also a Principal Partner for COP26 and leads on the youth theme for the climate change conference.Kate Turner, ScottishPower Renewables' Director of Policy & Regulation, added: ""We're very proud to support young people from across the country in making their voices heard at this crucial climate change conference, and see such considered and thoughtful feedback. This is a great opportunity for the youth of today to influence the policies of tomorrow and play a vital role in shaping the legacy of COP26.

"COP26","India","COP26_India295","COP26: Small Steps Forward for Green Technologies","November 18, 2021 Thursday 6:30 AM EST","Urja Daily","BOSTON - Climate change is one of humanity's most pressing challenges. In an effort to accelerate global action in limiting temperature rises, international lawmakers, business leaders, scientists, and activists convened in Glasgow (U.K.) for the past two weeks in the UN's Climate Change Conference (COP26).Carbon Capture, Utilization, and StorageThe importance of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS), including direct air capture (DAC) technologies to move the world closer to a 1.5C path was widely recognized during COP26. More than 30 events related to CCUS took place at COP26, covering policy, business, and social and technical challenges to its upscale. The United States and China, the world's top greenhouse gas emitters, announced an agreement to cooperate on fighting climate change and one of the major commitments was to work together on the ""deployment and application of technology such as CCUS and DAC"". Can these technologies deliver real environmental changes?To find out more about CCUS, including direct air capture, see the IDTechEx report ""Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage 2021-2040"" ( HYPERLINK www.IDTechEx.com/CCUSDAC: negative emission machinesThe very concept of net-zero emissions relies on the balance between the amount of greenhouse gas produced and the amount removed from the atmosphere. Through photosynthesis and geochemistry, nature removes half the carbon dioxide that humans put into the atmosphere, making plants, soil, and oceans massive carbon sinks. But these processes have limited capacity to offset our emissions and the security of the carbon sequestration is uncertain (e.g., when forests catch fire or trees decompose, the locked carbon is released back into the atmosphere).This is where technological solutions like DAC could turn the tide. The machines that suck up carbon dioxide from the air are more efficient than trees - they use 100 times less land and 200 times less water than biological CO 2 removal solutions. The flexibility of DAC allows plants to be installed in non-arable land and in any climate, enabling more countries to participate in helping to solve global warming.The problem is cost, as the technology is still in its infancy. Current costs range from $100-$800 per metric ton of CO 2 abated, whilst afforestation and reforestation can be as low as $5-50/tCO 2 . If DAC follows a similar development pathway to solar photovoltaics, it will become low-cost in 2077 - far too late for the world's climate targets. The rules for a new global carbon market put into place during the summit are expected to boost investments into solutions such as DAC, which remove CO 2 from the atmosphere and generate trading carbon credits.From burden to bricks: can CO 2 use help us meet our climate goalsIt's an exciting time to be a green-tech start-up. Prizes, grants, investments are pouring in as the world looks for solutions to an imminent climate crisis. Amongst 29 finalists developing all sorts of green technology solutions, a carbon utilization company - the Australian Mineral Carbonation International - won the COP26 Clean Energy Start-up Pitch Battle, proposing a technology that converts industrial CO 2 emissions into building materials.Solutions to help decarbonize the construction industry are in high demand as the sector accounts for 37% of energy-related global greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, storing CO 2 emissions essentially forever into billions of tons of building materials, whilst profiting from it, seems like a win-win.IDTechEx has been following the growing market for CO 2 use in building materials such as cement, concrete, and aggregates, where CO 2 from smokestacks or from the air is mineralized into these materials. As these technologies often improve the performance of the final products while locking CO 2 emissions away, they have the potential to reduce the costs of abating emissions or removing CO 2 from the atmosphere. However, they need to scale (from almost nothing) to the giga-tons of CO 2 use to make a meaningful impact in curbing the world's emissions - a non-trivial task.Decarbonizing TransportCOP26 presented an important opportunity for the decarbonization of on-road transport - a major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, with passenger cars and road freight transport contributing over 6Gt of CO 2 emissions each year (IEA).The outcome of the summit was commitments to zero tailpipe emissions by 2040, signed off by 30 countries and 11 automakers, with a new inclusion of vans (AKA light commercial vehicles) - something which hasn't been widely committed to before - as well as passenger cars.IDTechEx currently predicts that the battery-electric, plug-in hybrid and fuel-cell electric cars will rise to a 70% global market share by 2040 - for more information on IDTechEx forecasts for passenger vehicles and vans, see ""Electric Vehicles: Land, Sea, Air 2021-2041"" ( HYPERLINK http://www.IDTechEx.com/EVwww.IDTechEx.com/EVThe commitments are not perfect. For one, like many of the current fossil fuel bans, they don't have legal backing. Their usefulness is in the statement they make to other countries and the industry. They also reinforce commitments that were made anyway. The largest automakers involved - Ford, Volvo, GM - had already announced plans to phase out internal-combustion engines (2030 Europe-only, 2030, 2035, respectively). VW and Toyota did not sign.The world's largest automaker Toyota is the one to convince. But it has long had its own vision: hybrids in the short to mid-term, fuel cells in the long-term, which it is struggling to let go of. At their worst, hybrids are an environmental con that confuses consumers. In the past, the Norwegian government outright banned misleading 'self-charging' hybrid ads, and the UK reduced then removed incentives for plug-in hybrids because drivers weren't plugging them in (behavior not just isolated to the UK).At their best, hybrids are a short-term transitional step towards zero-emission powertrains. An old narrative, but one now in full swing, and one which accounts for the hybrid sales surges we've seen this and last year. Hybrids have a limited role past the late 2020s.For fuel cell electric vehicles, their range and refueling advantage means that heavy-duty applications, such as long-haul trucking or high mileage bus operations, have long offered a potential use for the technology, and progress has been building in 2021.As the Tesla Semi is increasingly delayed prioritizing batteries for more profitable electric cars, in September 2021 Hyundai announced it would develop fuel cell variants for all its commercial vehicles by 2028.To learn more, the IDTechEx report ""Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles 2022-2042"" ( HYPERLINK http://www.IDTechEx.com/Fuelwww.IDTechEx.com/FuelPerhaps most critically of all, COP26 commitments are undermined by a lack of support from the largest car markets, the US and China (which together account for ~44% of global auto sales), as well as Germany, a factor that reportedly influenced non-signing automakers.Non-signatories point to the technicalities of globally blanket-banning on-road internal combustion engine vehicles. For example, there is still potential for alternative low-carbon fuels, which would need to be burned in modified internal combustion engines, and there are still car markets that would be very difficult to electrify, such as Africa. But these areas represent a very small part of the solution (and problem) for reducing road emissions.While it is disappointing in major ways, the commitments are still an unprecedented step that begins to lay the foundation for the future of a decarbonized transport sector.Plastic RecyclingThere were many challenges addressed at COP26, but one of the more underwhelming areas was that of plastic recycling.

"COP26","India","COP26_India296","The ultimate guide to why the COP26 summit ended in failure and disappointment (despite a few bright spots)","November 15, 2021 Monday 6:30 AM EST","EveningReport.nz","Source: The Conversation (Au and NZ) - By Robert Hales, Director Centre for Sustainable Enterprise, Griffith University APAfter two hard-fought weeks of negotiations, the Glasgow climate change summit is, at last, over. All 197 participating countries adopted the so-called Glasgow Climate Pact, despite an 11th hour intervention by India in which the final agreement was watered down from ""phasing out"" coal to ""phasing down"".In an emotional final speech, COP26 president Alok Sharma apologised for this last-minute change. His apology goes to the heart of the goals of COP26 in Glasgow: the hope it would deliver outcomes matching the urgent ""code red"" action needed to achieve the Paris Agreement target.So, was COP26 a failure? If we evaluate this using the summits original stated goals, the answer is yes, it fell short. Two big ticket items weren't realised: renewing targets for 2030 that align with limiting warming to 1.5, and an agreement on accelerating the phase-out of coal. But among the failures, there were important decisions and notable bright spots. So let's take a look at the summit's defining issues.Weak 2030 targetsThe goal of the Paris Agreement is to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 this century, and to pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5. Catastrophic impacts will be unleashed beyond this point, such as sea level rise and more intense and frequent natural disasters.But new projections from Climate Action Tracker show even if all COP26 pledges are met, the planet is on track to warm by 2.1 - or 2.4 if only 2030 targets are met. Read more: COP26: experts react to the UN climate summit and Glasgow PactDespite the Australian government's recent climate announcements, this nation's 2030 target remains the same as in 2015. If all countries adopted such meagre near-term targets, global temperature rise would be on track for up to 3.Technically, the 1.5 limit is still within reach because, under the Glasgow pact, countries are asked to update their 2030 targets in a year's time. However, as Sharma said, ""the pulse of 1.5 is weak"".And as Australia's experience shows, domestic politics rather than international pressure is often the force driving climate policy. So there are no guarantees Australia or other nations will deliver greater ambition in 2022.Phase down, not outIndia's intervention to change the final wording to ""phase down"" coal rather than ""phase out"" dampens the urgency to shift away from coal.India is the world's third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, after China and the United States. The country relies heavily on coal, and coal-powered generation is expected to grow by 4.6% each year to 2024. India was the most prominent objector to the ""phase out"" wording, but also had support from China. Read more: COP26 leaves too many loopholes for the fossil fuel industry. Here are 5 of themAnd US climate envoy John Kerry argued that carbon capture and storage technology could be developed further, to trap emissions at the source and store them underground.Carbon capture and storage is a controversial proposition for climate action. It is not proven at scale, and we don't yet know if captured emissions stored underground will eventually return to the atmosphere. And around the world, relatively few large-scale underground storage locations exist.And it's hard to see this expensive technology ever being cost-competitive with cheap renewable energy.In a crucial outcome, COP26 also finalised rules for global carbon trading, known as Article 6 under the Paris Agreement. However under the rules, the fossil fuel industry will be allowed to ""offset"" its carbon emissions and carry on polluting. Combined with the ""phasing down"" change, this will see fossil fuel emissions continue.It wasn't all badDespite the shortcomings, COP26 led to a number of important positive outcomes.What's more, Article 21 of the Glasgow Climate Pact nature and ecosystems, including protecting forests and biodiversity. This comes on top of a side deal struck by Australia and 123 other countries promising to end deforestation by 2030.The pact also urges countries to fully deliver on an outstanding promise to deliver US$100 billion per year for five years to developing countries vulnerable to climate damage. It also emphasises the importance of transparency in implementing the pledges.Nations are also invited to revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022. In support of this, it was agreed to hold a high-level ministerial roundtable meeting each year focused on raising ambition out to 2030.The US and China climate agreement is also cause for cautious optimism.Despite the world not being on track for the 1.5 goal, momentum is headed in the right direction. And the mere fact that a reduction in coal use was directly addressed in the final text signals change may be possible. But whether it comes in the small window we have left to stop catastrophic climate change remains to be seen.Brendan Mackey has previously received research grants from the Federal government, stage governments and charitable trusts that have focussed on problems related to climate change, forests, mitigation and ecosystem services including biodiversity conservation.

"COP26","India","COP26_India297","Eyes on Cop26: UN report cites humanity ""way off track"" with emissions","November 8, 2021 Monday","New Delhi Times","New Delhi, Nov. 8 -- Climatic disastersThe world is experiencing extreme weather events like heat waves, floods and forest fires across all the climatic regions due to climate change. Heat radiating from the Earth is stopped by greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2) from escaping into space; heat trapped in atmosphere causes global warming. The past decade was the warmest on record. The world is now 1.2degC warmer than it was in the 19th Century as atmospheric carbon dioxide has risen by 50%. Natural disasters like drought, intense heat, hurricanes and flash floodings across North American, Europe and Asia this summer have brought unspeakable destructions and devastations. The UN report rightly cites humanity ""way off track"" with emissions. This way the world may not exist for long.The ConferenceThe 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference was organized under the co-Presidency of the United Kingdom and Italy during October 31-November 12, 2021, at SEC Centre, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.At the June 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was signed by 154 nations as a treaty to rein in ""dangerous human interference with the climate system,"" by stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. In 1994, the UNFCCC signatories attended the Conference of the Parties (COP). Kyoto Protocol (CMP16) signed in Kyoto, Japan, in December 1997, became the first significant agreement between parties (COP2). It sets strict emission reduction targets on six gases for 37 industrialised nations and the European Union, but excluded the US, China and India. Glasgow conference was the 26th reiteration of the COP, hence is called the COP26.The Paris Agreement (COP21) was a big, wide-ranging international agreement drafted in December 2015, and signed in April 2016, as a successor to Kyoto protocol. It applied to all the 195 signatories, not just the developed nations alone. Decisions were: securing global net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and keeping global temperature increase ""well below"" 2degC and down to 1.5degC; adapting to protect communities and natural habitats on the frontl"

Our addiction to fossil fuels is pushing humanity to the brink ""Guterres reminded us that sea-level rise is double the rate it was 30 years ago, that oceans are hotter than ever, and parts of the Amazon rainforest now emit more carbon than they absorb.The situation is disturbing in the Himalayan region as well because glaciers are receding and plastic waste continues to be dumped unscientifically in forests and water bodies. This was also viewed seriously at the COP26 summit. In-fact ,this has been going on for a while now, especially the unscientific waste management and deforestation happening in Kashmir under the garb of development.Glasgow Pact COP which means Conference of Parties is the annual UN climate change conference that has been held for the last 26 years. This summit is attended by the countries that signed theUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) treaty that came into force in 1994. This year's conference i.e COP26 summit came to an end at Glasgow Scotland only a few days back. The conference that was held between 1st to 13th November was hosted in partnership between the UK and Italy. The conference was held a year later than planned due to delays caused by the COVID 19 pandemic.The Glasgow Climate Pact is the first ever climate deal to explicitly plan to reduce coal, considered to be the worst fossil fuel for greenhouse gases. The deal also presses for more urgent emission cuts and promises more money for developing or under-developing countries to help them adapt to climate impacts. But the pledges don't go far enough to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degree Celsius.A commitment to phase out coal that was included in earlier negotiation drafts led to a dramatic finish after India and China led opposition to it. India's Environment Forests and Climate Change Minister Bhupender Yadav asked how developing countries could promise to phase out coal and fossil fuel subsidies when they still have to deal with their development agendas and poverty eradication. In the end, countries agreed to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal, amid expressions of disappointment by some. COP26 President Alok Sharma said he was ""deeply sorry"" for how events had unfolded.Who is Alok Sharma?Alok Sharma was hardly a household name in Britain, let alone the rest of the world, when appointed to lead the UN climate talks in Glasgow. Born in 1967 at Agra Uttar Pradesh , Alok Sharma is a British politician who served as President for COP 26. He moved to London with his father when he was only 5. Sharma is also the Minister of State in the British Cabinet office. He has been an MP from Conservative party representing the Reading West constituency since 2010. In PM Theresa's May's Govt Sharma was the Minister of State for Housing from 2017 to 2018 and then Minister of State for Employment from 2018 to 2019. In 2020 he was appointed to the Cabinet, by PM Boris Jhonson as Secretary of State for International Development. He was promoted to Secretary of State for Business , Energy , and Industrial Strategy in the 2020 cabinet reshuffle. Alok Sharma's father Prem Sharma was also into politics who was involved in Conservative politics in Reading and became chairman of theBerkshire area of Conservatives.India and COP 26 summitAt the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow earlier this month, Prime Minister Modi said India will achieve net-zero emissions by 2070. This was one of the five major commitments or paanch amrit he made on behalf of India, to mitigate climate change. The rest commitments are as under: India will bring its non-fossil energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030 India will bring its economy's carbon intensity down to 45 per cent by 2030 India will fulfil 50 per cent of its energy requirement through renewable energy by 2030 India will reduce 1 billion tonnes of carbon emissions from the total projected emissions by 2030By not signing a treaty on stopping use of the coal, halting and reversing forest loss and land degradation by 2030 the climate activists and environmentalists in India have been disappointed a lot which put a question mark on the Modi Govt's climate change policies.What Nations can do ?United Nations has set several targets to counter climate change which includes strengthening resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters. Every country in the world needs to integrate measures into national policies, strategies and planning. They need toimprove education and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning. The Himalayan nations like India , Pakistan, Bhutan or Nepal need to implement the commitments made under the UN convention on climate change (UNCC). The developed countries need to ensure mobilizing funds from all sources to address the needs of developing countries in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation and fully operationalize the Green Climate Fund (GCF)through its capitalization as soon as possible. The developed or even the developing countries need to promote mechanisms for raising capacity for effective climate change-related planning and management in least developed countries and small island developing states, including focusing on women, youth and marginalized communities.Declaration on forests & land useDuring the COP 26 summit an ambitious declaration was initiated by the United Kingdom to halt deforestationand land degradation by 2030. This is being referred to as the Glasgow Leaders Declarationon Forests and Land Use.India did not signthis, as it objected to trade being interlinked toclimate change and forest issues in the agreement.The declaration recognises that to meet our land use, climate, biodiversity and sustainable development goals, both globally and nationally, will requiretransformative further action in the interconnected-areas. It was resolved that sustainable production and consumption be ensured and to support small farmers Indigenous People and local communities, who depend on forests for their livelihoods and have a key role in their stewardship.This has in-fact already been recognized by Govt of India under the Forest Rights Act (FRA 2006 ) but unfortunately the FRA is still not being implemented in letter and spirit in India, as less than 10 % of tribals and other traditional forest dwellers have benefited from this legislation in the last 15 years across Indian states. The law was extended to J&K post article 370 abrogation and it seems to be an ardent task to see its implementation in this Himalayan region of Jammu & Kashmir.The Glasgow declaration on forests and land use helps to achieve abalance between anthropogenic greenhouse gasemissions and to adapt to climate change, and to maintain other ecosystem services.The declaration was signed by 141 nations including the UK, US, Russia and China. These nations have committed 12 billion US dollars in public funds from 2021-25.Major Highlights of the Declaration:Conservation: Conserve forests and other terrestrial ecosystems and accelerate their restoration.Sustainable Development:Facilitate trade and development policies, internationally and domestically, that promote sustainable developmentand sustainable commodity production and consumption.Building Resilience:Reduce vulnerability, build resilience and enhance rural livelihoods, including through empowering local communities.Recognising Indigenous Rights: The development of profitable, sustainable agriculture, and recognition of the multiple values of forests, while recognising the rights of Indigenous. India, Argentina, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and South Africaare the only 5 20 nations that did not sign the declaration.ConclusionFinally, a new global climate deal has been signed at the COP26 climate summit. But at the conclusion of the summit, President of the conference Alok Sharma seemed to 'fight back tears' as the leader apologised for a last-minute change on the wording over coal. At a time when emphasis is put on conservation of forests and strengthening the land use policy, the decisions taken by amending or repealing Jammu & Kashmir's land laws violates the Indian's National Land Use Policy 2013. Transferring 24000 kanals (3000 acres) of forest or agricultural land for industrial growth violates sustainable development goals/SDGs (SDG-13). This indeed tantamounts to digging our own graves.Views expressed in the article are the author's own and do not necessarily represent the editorial stance of Kashmir Observer\l"

Here's a snapshot of what went on at the event November 8, 2021: A non-paper by the United Kingdom CoP Presidency was published as a draft of what could be the final statement from Glasgow. It received initial criticism for not including the term 'fossil fuels'. Reports also suggested that the Saudi Arabian delegation blocked efforts to write in greater climate ambition in the document. At the informal stocktaking plenary on Monday morning, Alok Sharma presented a report on the work done over the past week. It included the following: Chairs of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice and Subsidiary Body for Implementation presented the items completed and those pending. The latter was forwarded to the CoP26 Presidency to discuss this week. Article 6 appears to be a major pending item forwarded to the second week. Others include the enhanced transparency framework, common time frames and adaptation. Sharma invited pairs of ministers to lead 'informal consultations' on pending issues: Article 6 - Norway, Singapore Common timeframes - Rwanda, Switzerland Enhanced transparency framework - New Zealand, Antigua & Barbuda Adaptation - Maldives, Spain Mitigation - Grenada, Denmark Loss and damage - Luxembourg, Jamaica Finance - Egypt, Sweden Linkages - Costa Rica, UK Bhutan spoke on behalf of the Least Developed Countries group, emphasising that the trust broken by non-delivery of the $100 billion finance goal must be rebuilt.

Former United States President Barack Obama addressed CoP 26 at an event, emphasising that the world is still ""collectively and individually"" falling short on fighting climate change. He also singled out Russia and China for the absence of their leaders at CoP 26 and unambitious nationally determined contributions.

"COP26","India","COP26_India308","COP26: Nature-based solutions win on ground too","November 18, 2021 Thursday","Indian Media news","November 18 -- Weather-related disasters have increased fivefold in the past 50 years alone, but humanity, and especially vulnerable communities, is only starting to adapt to the new reality of weather extremes.As the global community discusses different adaptation options at COP26 in Glasgow, the United Nations University -- Institute for Environment and Human Security (UNU-EHS) and World Food Programme (WFP) on Tuesday called for a better integration of nature-based solutions into adaptation planning.The recently-launched UNU-EHS flagship report ""Interconnected Disaster Risks"" illustrates the interconnectivity of disasters around the world, making it clear that interconnected solutions, such as nature-based solutions, deserve more attention.""Science is clear on the fact that nature-based solutions not only address climate change, they also reduce disaster risk, biodiversity loss and food insecurity in an integrated way,"" said Jack O'Connor, Senior Scientist at UNU-EHS.For example, in Bangladesh, one of the most cyclone-affected countries in the world, numerous projects are underway to protect and restore coastal ecosystems, primarily mangrove forests.Ecosystems like mangrove forests not only strengthen coastal protection against cyclones and rising sea levels, but they also store atmospheric carbon and contribute to local livelihoods as they are home to fish, crabs, and clams.Nature-based solutions are also proving their value in the humanitarian context.From 2014 to 2019, the World Food Programme has worked with vulnerable communities to rehabilitate 1.5 million hectares of degraded land and forests, and has established 54,000 ponds, wells and communal reservoirs.""Nature itself is often the best way to protect both people and the planet. Rehabilitating ecosystems helps to reduce people's vulnerability to climate shocks and stresses while also protecting biodiversity and promoting social cohesion,"" said Gernot laganda, Chief of Climate and Disaster Risk Reduction Programmes at WFP.Despite there now being widespread consensus that nature-based solutions need to be considered in adaptation planning, their potential is still largely untapped.""Nature-based solutions efforts today focus disproportionately on forest ecosystems and specifically on tree planting. The Glasgow leaders' Declaration on Forests and land Use, which was adopted at COP26 to end and reverse deforestation by 2030, is an example of that,"" Zita Sebesvari, Deputy Director at UNU-EHS, said.""While the declaration is a much-welcomed step, we need to go beyond forests and look also for example at grasslands, peatlands, marshes and marine ecosystems, all of which build on the rich diversity of ecosystems for adaptation, disaster risk reduction and biodiversity.""While nature-based solutions win both in science and on the ground, they can only fully develop their full potential if they are designed as integrated solutions and in combination with other safety nets -- for example, climate risk insurance or forecast-based financing.Over the long-term, planting or protecting forests can only be an effective climate adaptation measure if this gets complemented by actions that also relieve the environmental and social pressures which led to their destruction in the first place.Communities which face hunger and poverty may be forced to cut down trees to clear land for agricultural use or to generate income from the wood. To be truly effective, an integrated resilience programme would therefore combine nature-based solutions with social and financial protection schemes.Initiatives such as WFP's R4 Rural Resilience Initiative take an integrated approach by combining landscape restoration with access to micro insurance and financial services, while UNU-EHS works with partners to develop and introduce climate risk insurance products for individuals and communities in the Caribbean and Pacific regions.These kinds of integrated approaches increase the likelihood of success for climate adaptation strategies by reducing vulnerability to the increasing impacts of climate change.As world leaders at COP26 discuss ways to build back better from the Covid-19 pandemic and are focused on pulling back from the brink of a climate disaster, integrating nature-based solutions into the overall adaptation strategy must be at the centre of the discussion.\l"

After initial objections, opposing countries ultimately conceded.\~Earlier, Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav, who had disagreed with the language on fossil fuel, said developing countries are ""entitled"" to use fossil fuels.Glasgow also failed to deliver on the loss and damage facility for the most vulnerable and on paying the cost of emissions and historic responsibility of climate change created by developed countries. In other words, there was not much progress on issues related to finance and loss and damage financing.\~Despite progress on future emissions reductions, COP26 failed those most impacted by the climate crisis now. The EU and US refused to create a fund that the poorest countries could draw on for crisis response, outraging small islands and vulnerable nations, observers said.\~An unprecedented fossil fuels phase-out pledge that was weakened by China, the US, the EU, and India is still there. The change in language was condemned by small island states, Switzerland, Mexico, and ironically the EU, which decided to support the shift despite slamming it as a ""bad economic choice"", they said.Supporters, however, argued that the text ""has sought to narrow the gap to the 1.5C goal and put in place processes for it to continue to narrow, and narrow faster in future"".\~Despite the watered-down phrase on coal, the cause of the climate crisis has for the first time since the Kyoto Protocol been called out by the 198 signatories of the Paris Agreement.The first-ever mention of coal phase down in an international climate agreement is an important indication of the energy transformation underway. India, with its RE expansion is well placed to deliver on the scale of change needed, they said. \~\~\~In his emotional address, UK COP26 President Alok Sharma said he was ""deeply sorry"" for the way the process had unfolded. ""I understand the deep disappointment. It's also vital we protect this package,"" Sharma was quoted as saying. The EU and the US also failed to deliver the promised $100 billion or nail down to $600 billion in climate finance between 2021-25. In other words, developed countries have slipped back to a commitment of $100 billion a year, now in place since 2009 and as yet undelivered, but remains urgent and central to ambitious climate action.\~\~""There is nothing much. There is no real commitment on part of developed countries to move ahead with serious and urgent domestic action, let alone in terms of global collaboration and truly significant climate finance for tackling climate change,"" says Manjeev Puri, from Teri.The EU and US blocked the establishment of even a modest fund to help vulnerable communities around the world with the massive loss and damage they are experiencing at the hands of the climate crisis. As with COVID, those with the least resources have been left to fend for themselves.\~The closure of the Paris rules on carbon markets is a move forward, but loopholes still need to be addressed, observers said, adding that ""COP26 is real progress, but much more is still to be done"".This COP was about keeping 1.5 degrees alive. It has, to an extent, reflected the findings of the IPCC SR1.5 and IEA net zero report, mandating an acceleration in action and new plans by 2022 in the context of the voluntary, non-binding UN regime. All major emitters will be compelled to return in 12 months and explain at the UN how their economy-wide policies and plans are aligned to the Paris temperature goals, they said.However, the test of COP26 will be the delivery of promises. The next 18 months are crucial in determining whether countries take action aligned to 1.5C-that means cutting emissions by 45% by 2030.Ulka Kelkar, Climate Programme Director, WRI India said now that COP-26 has finalised the rules of carbon trading, India will be able to sell more than a million carbon credits from previous years, and can also create a domestic market for carbon trading.""India will be affected by COP26 asking countries to phase out polluting coal power and withdraw inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. India will also have to join other countries to escalate emission reduction actions more frequently. This will not be easy for a lower- and middle-income country that is trying to lift millions of people out of poverty.""India's battle against climate change will be led by scaling up renewable energy, which will be the foundation of our net zero future; by industry, who will fight to stay competitive in the global economy; and by states and cities, who will need to urbanize with respect for nature,"" Kelkar added.ProgressClosing the Paris rulebook means that by 2024 all countries will have to report detailed data on emissions forming the basel"

This includes 23 countries committing for the first time to phase out and not build or invest in new coal power, including Indonesia, South Korea, Poland, Vietnam, and Chile, marking a milestone moment at COP26 in the global clean energy transition.This statement, launched today, commits nations across the world to:end all investment in new coal power generation domestically and internationallyrapidly scale up deployment of clean power generationphase out coal power in economies in the 2030s for major economies and 2040s for the rest of the worldmake a just transition away from coal power in a way that benefits workers and communitiesThis is on top of China,?Japan?and Korea, the 3 largest public financiers of coal, committing to end overseas finance for coal generation by the end of 2021, announced in the last year during the UKs incoming COP26 Presidency. Agreements at the G7, G20 and OECD to end public international coal finance send a strong signal that the world economy is shifting to renewables. This could end over 40GW of coal across 20 countries, equivalent to over half of the UKs electricity generating capacity.Business & Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said:Spearheaded by the UKs COP26 Presidency, todays ambitious commitments made by our international partners demonstrate that the end of coal is in sight. The world is moving in the right direction, standing ready to seal coals fate and embrace the environmental and economic benefits of building a future that is powered by clean energy.To meet the goals of the Paris Agreement to limit global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees, the global transition to clean power needs to progress 4 to 6 times faster than at present. With coal being the single largest contributor to climate change, phasing it out and delivering a rapid, inclusive transition to clean energy is essential if we are to keep 1.5 degrees alive.Twenty-eight new members have today signed up to the worlds largest alliance on phasing out coal, the Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA) launched and co-chaired by the UK. Chile, Singapore and Durban have today joined over 150 countries, sub-nationals and businesses, including finance partners NatWest, Lloyds Banking, HSBC and Export Development Canada. This accounts for over $17 trillion assets now committed to PPCA coal phase out goals.There has also been a 76% cut in the number of new coal plants planned globally over the last 6 years which means the cancellation of 1000GW of new coal plants since the Paris Agreement, roughly equivalent to around 10 times the UKs total peak generating capacity.\l"

These are emissions not only created when buildings are constructed, but through the operational energy use over their lifetime.Ng Kinga Anamata, meaning homes of the future will see five, three-level public housing buildings developed in Aucklands Glendowie, constructed entirely from modern sustainability materials and systems to achieve both Passive House standard and net zero energy.Ng Kinga Anamata is leading the way, validating assumptions and demonstrating to the industry that future carbon emission targets can be achieved through construction materials and systems available today.The houses will demonstrate that a low carbon environment can be achieved through different construction technologies, and the project will provide valuable insights to the industry on what is possible.What is even more significant about this Kinga Ora pilot is that these healthy and energy-efficient buildings will deliver a real solution to the cost of power bills for our most vulnerable people. The warm, dry and comfortable state homes designed through Ng Kinga Anamata will make the most of sustainability technology such as solar panels and passive heating and cooling systems to greatly reduce energy bills for the people living in them.Led by Kinga Ora in collaboration with the construction industry, Ng Kinga Anamata will gather significant insights that will shape the way we construct buildings and communities in the future, says Megan Woods.More information here on Ng Kinga Anamata.MIL OSI\l"

Photo: Jayanta BasuThe second week of the 26th Conference of Parties (CoP26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at Glasgow, Scotland will be focussed on discussing 'loss and damage'.The term 'loss and damage' is used within the UNFCCC process to refer to the harms caused by anthropogenic climate change. Establishing liability and compensation for loss and damage has been a long-standing goal for vulnerbale and developing countries such as small island states. But this has been resisted by developed countries.Down To Earth spoke to Sunil Acharya, regional advisor, climate and resilience at the charity organisation Practical Action about the second week at Glasgow. Edited excerpts:Down To Earth: Where do the dialogues stand now in this CoP?Sunil Acharya: The discussion on loss and damage in the first week of CoP26 concentrated on the technical issues related to the functions of the Santiago Network. (The Network was created at CoP25 in Madrid to further the work of the loss and damage mechanism).Developed countries still want to keep the issue of loss and damage under climate adaptation, which is clearly not the case. Loss and damage should be treated as the third pillar of the 2015 Paris Agreement, as recognised in Article 8 of the Agreement.DTE: What should be done? Is the fund flow adequate?SA: There is an urgent need to fully operationalise the Santiago Network on Loss and Damage with robust functions agreed at CoP26. These functions relate to facilitating the identification of loss and damage assessment needs and implementation of actions on the ground to address it.Developed countries have failed to deliver the $100 billion they pledged many years ago and in the Paris Agreement. There is a severe shortage of funds and hurdles for accessing them for adaptation. With escalating loss and damage, new and additional funding should be mobilised through a stand alone loss and damage finance facility.DTE: Why are developed countries shying away from commitments?SA: Developed countries want to continue the business-as-usual scenario of protecting the fossil fuel industry by continuing to provide subsidies to them.

Use of land and marine resources are among the key areas where the council advise that further, urgent action is particularly important.The First Minister met the council which she co-chairs with Professor Sir Ian Boyd, former Chief Scientific Adviser to the UK Government on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. They were joined in person by ten other members of the council including Gordon Buchanan MBE, award-winning wildlife camera-man and presenter, and Dr Dilys Roe, Chair of International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED).The report is published as the Scottish Government launches a new website for tracking progress towards achieving its environmental ambitions. Based on Scotlands Environment Strategy, the site is designed to ensure clear and accessible information on Scotlands environmental performance is available to the public.The First Minister said:As the host country of COP26, Scotland has a unique opportunity to show leadership on the international stage. Thats why we appointed independent environmental experts from around the world to advise on how we best tackle this unprecedented challenge.The group balances experience, a strong international perspective, the youth voice, and topical awareness, at the highest, global level. Its first report sets out areas of immediate priority which will help inform the actions we are taking now to tackle the crisis, and our future policy direction.Our Environment Strategy already sets out our long-term, guiding vision for Scotlands environment and our role in tackling the twin climate and nature crises. We know where our efforts must be focussed if we are to make that a reality including improving the sustainability of Scotlands economy, society and global footprint.By measuring our progress, and drawing on the expertise of the environmental council, we can make sure we continually improve our approach. I welcome the councils first report and look forward to working closely with its members beyond COP26 as we progress to becoming a net zero country, while restoring nature.Francesca Osowska, NatureScot Chief Executive, said:The link between nature and climate cant be understated with nature-based solutions delivering 30% of the carbon reductions needed globally. Ongoing efforts to restore peatlands, increase woodlands and protected natural areas and develop natural capital initiatives are all highlighted in the panels first report.As the report says, there is much more work needed to restore Scotlands fragile nature. We look forward to this panel continuing to help direct our efforts, as we step up work to restore Scotlands nature, adapt to unavoidable climate change, and achieve net zero by 2045.\l"

"COP26","India","COP26_India327","Explainer: Why carbon markets are set to explode after COP26?","November 29, 2021 Monday","Business Line","Carbon credits are 'points' issued to an entity to undertake activity that has the effect of either avoiding emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere or absorbing some of them back from the atmosphere. What are carbon credits/offsets? Carbon credits or carbon offsets are 'points' issued to an entity for undertaking an activity that has the effect of either avoiding emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere or absorbing some of the CO2 back from the atmosphere. One credit is given for a one-tonne reduction in CO2. (Now, when we say CO2, we mean either CO2 or any of the other six greenhouse gases.) What does one do with the credit? Sell and make money. That's the reward for avoiding or sequestering CO2 and thereby helping to limit the rise of global warming. To the buyer, it is the penalty they for not avoiding spewing or sequestering CO2. So, the buyer of the carbon credit pays someone else-the seller-for doing the right thing, reducing CO2 in the atmosphere. Who are the typical buyers and sellers? The sellers could be anybody who saves CO2. A company has recently formed to give away cookstoves worth  1,600 apiece, free of cost, to poor villagers, in exchange for carbon credits worth more-because the cookstoves save fuelwood. The buyers are typically companies, governments, municipalities or any other organisations. For example, companies like Google, Amazon and Apple have vowed to go 'net zero' by a certain date, which means their operations will put no more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than they can absorb back. Since it is impossible to fully stop greenhouse gas emissions or absorb them back, they keep their promise by buying carbon credits. And now, governments, which have international emission reduction commitments, will also buy the credits. Is there going to be an active market in carbon credits? There is already one in place, where the buyers are the companies that have come forward to go carbon neutral. Now, with the rules for the functioning of the markets having been agreed upon in the recent COP26 Glasgow climate talks, you can expect a deepening of the market. What factors prevented the carbon markets from evolving? Did COP26 Fortunately, all these three issues have been settled at COP26. On the old carbon credits, it has been agreed that all those credits (CERs) issued between January 1, 2013 and December 30, 2020, would be good to be sold in the market. On double-counting, they all agreed that there would be no double counting. It has been left to the respective government to decide which activity (project) would extinguish its commitment and which would be for tradable carbon credits. On 'share of proceeds', it was agreed that 5 per cent of the proceeds of market transactions would be levied and put into a fund.

A similar sentiment was expressed by most countries.The final GCP read:Also recognises that limiting global warming to 1.5degC requires rapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions, including reducing global carbon dioxide emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 relative to the 2010 level and to net zero around mid-century, as well as deep reductions in other greenhouse gases.The world is not on track. Non-profit Climate Action Tracker (CAT) has released its latest assessment which forecasts that the promises made on emission reduction by countries now, will still lead to 2.4degC of global warming. That will be a catastrophic situation according to any scientific analysis.GCP accepted the slow progress on this:Notes with serious concern the findings of the synthesis report on nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement, according to which the aggregate greenhouse gas emission level, taking into account implementation of all submitted nationally determined contributions, is estimated to be 13.7 per cent above the 2010 level in 2030.The most contentious issue has been about 'loss and damage' being made a mainstream agenda under the UNFCCC. 'Loss and damage' has emerged as the 'third pillar' of climate action after adaptation and mitigation nearly 20 years after the Alliance of Small Island States demanded a mechanism within the global climate deal to compensate countries affected by sea level rise due to climate change.The term 'loss and damage' is used within the UNFCCC process to refer to the harms caused by anthropogenic climate change. Establishing liability and compensation for loss and damage has been a long-standing goal for vulnerable and developing countries such as small island states. But this has been resisted by developed countries.Loss and damage was not even on the formal agenda for CoP26 to begin with. Negotiators laid out a pathway for addressing the issue for the first time by establishing a dedicated agency in the second draft released at CoP26. Yet the draft stopped short of setting up a fund to compensate climate-linked losses and damage.The deal, from this stage, did make progress on this issue, even though developing countries made it clear that they were not happy with the draft's inclusions on loss and damage. They wanted commitment from developed countries to compensate them for the loss and damage caused by climate change.The G77 + China, representing 130 countries, wanted a 'loss and damage facility' to be established for funding under the UNFCCC.The agreed deal has this to say:Reiterates the urgency of scaling up action and support, as appropriate, including finance, technology transfer and capacity-building, for implementing approaches for averting, minimising and addressing loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change in developing country Parties that are particularly vulnerable to these effects.The agreed draft also put the onus on developed countries. It says:Urges developed country Parties, the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism, United Nations entities and intergovernmental organisations and other bilateral and multilateral institutions, including non-governmental organisations and private sources, to provide enhanced and additional support for activities addressing loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change.There would be a 'dialogue' process from now on. The deal has this to say:Decides to establish the [NAME] dialogue between parties, relevant organisations and stakeholders to discuss the arrangements for the funding of activities to avert, minimise and address loss and damage associated with the adverse impacts of climate change to take place at the first sessional period of the SBI, concluding at its 60th session.""If you had your house burned by fires or destroyed by sea level rise, the [proposal] the rich world wanted was only going to pay for the expert to assess the damage, but not to pay you to rebuild your house,"" Mohammed Adow of non-profit Climate Action Network International, said.There were hectic deliberations on a specific pathway for 'loss and damage' dialogue. There was an agreement that in the next CoP, a finance mechanism would be finalised and put in place.The other contentious point was on reducing or doing away with subsidies for fossil fuels and also moving away from coal. The third draft read:Calls upon Parties to accelerate the development, deployment and dissemination of technologies and the adoption of policies, to transition towards low emission energy systems, including by rapidly scaling up the deployment of clean power generation and energy efficiency measures, including accelerating efforts towards the phase-out of unabated coal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, recognising the need for support towards a just transition.The Paris Agreement in fact didn't mention any specific energy source like coal or gas.India opposed this reference of a specific energy source (coal) and also a deadl"

"COP26","India","COP26_India333","Food waste recycling and the possible impact of COP26 .","December 16, 2021","News on Fast moving consumer goods in India","December 16 -- According to recent statistics, the average family in the UK throws away more than \£3730 of perfectly edible food waste every year. Giving that sobering statistic a global perspective, approximately 40% of all food produced is either lost or wasted, with more than 10m tonnes per annum landfilled right here in the UK.The impact of this wasteful behaviour is two-fold. Firstly, the obvious financial implications to householders. Indeed, a recent report from WRAP calculates that the average family throws away more than 700kg of food every year. Secondly, the environmental impact of sending food waste to landfill is concerning, with every tonne thrown away creating greenhouse gases 21 times more environmentally-damaging than CO2.More importantly still, it's a travesty that food is wasted when food poverty continues to prove a growing issue nationwide. It simply doesn't make sense to be throwing away food needlessly at one end of society, while seeing an incremental rise in demand for food banks and community fridges in most cities at the other.So, what can householders do to reduce their food waste figures? Well, from meal planning and better portion control, to freezing, repurposing leftovers and redistributing surplus via community fridges, the list is almost endless. If we all made a few small changes, the resulting impact would be astonishing. Granted, national statistics show that food waste has fallen by 7% in the past three years, but there's still a lot more we can all do.The hidden cost of food wasteHowever, while minimising avoidable food waste is critical, what's often forgotten is the unavoidable fraction - the bones, shells, gristle and spoiled produce which is almost impossible to eradicate.Responsible for 20% of the UK's food waste mountain, it's imperative that we keep unavoidable food waste away from landfill. One simple way to do this is via food waste recycling. While COP26 in Glasgow is focusing on global carbon reduction, food waste is also on the agenda. It's hugely positive to see the city of Glasgow's restaurateurs and caterers getting behind the summit and actively embracing food waste recycling schemes.So far, key venues in the city (including The Gannet, Paseano Pizza, The Finnieston and The Gate) have all adopted food waste recycling processes. This is encouraging and we need to see this more enlightened approach gain more traction after the summit.Harnessing the anaerobic digestion (AD) process, food waste recycling captures methane gas released during the natural degradation of organic matter. This gas can either be combusted to generate renewable electricity or upgraded and injected directly into the national gas grid.Nothing goes to waste during the process, with even the resulting digestate repurposed as a sustainable bio-fertiliser.So, why is so much food waste still simply landfilled? Well, due to the perceived high costs of food waste recycling collections, most local authorities fail to provide kerbside collections to residents. Households therefore have no choice than to simply bin their waste - a real travesty.While details outl"

But the way we cool our homes and workplaces is a major driver of climate change. Today, around 10 per cent of the world's electricity is used for air conditioning. If left unchecked, emissions related to cooling are expected to double by 2030, driven by heat waves, population growth, urbanization and the demands of a growing middle class,"" said Inger Andersen, UNEP Executive Director.A transition to efficient and climate-friendly cooling, including natural solutions, could allow the expansion of cooling and avoid 4-8 years of global emissions. This includes work under the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol to replace climate-warming gases, known as hydrofluorocarbons, that are used as refrigerant gases.Peter Goldsmith of Richmond Park, Minister for Pacific and the Environment at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), said, ""I am delighted that we have announced GBP 12 million of Defra Official Development Assistance programming today to provide valuable assistance to developing countries, enabling them to make rapid progress on reducing hydrofluorocarbons and adopting energy efficient cooling solutions.""This funding will support vital work to address inefficient cooling technologies and help develop a resilient and sustainable food supply chain in Africa, delivering the first African centre of excellence for rural cooling and cold chain.""In support of these commitments, an unprecedented surge of implementation will fill 2022 and beyond. These implementation efforts will go a long way in turning commitments into emissions reduction and increase resilience.""Cooling is becoming increasingly critical to strengthen our resilience to a warming world.

According to him, floods have always been a part of their lives; however, their intensity and irregularity have increased recently.This is not just the story of Rajendra in Supaul, Bihar, but it is the same story for several Rajendra's across the globe who are dealing with various stresses which climate change isThe recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change highlights that the planet is collapsing. It states that even in the most optimistic scenarios, the temperature post-2080 is likely to be higher by 1.0 DEGREES C to 1.8 degrees C. Such a temperature rise would lead to massive destructions globally, with rising seawater levels, resulting in floods in various parts of the world, collapsing ecosystems and wreaking havoc on humankind in general.In such a state, what is the case for optimism?The Adaptation FinanceIt was in the city of Copenhagen (2009) when the leaders of developed nations committed to mobilising $100 billion per year to finance climate action in developing countries. The goal formalised in Cancun (2010) and later reiterated in Paris (2015) remains unfulfilled.A recent report by OECD highlights that in 2019, total climate finance mobilised by the developed countries was to the tune of $79.6 billion. An additional jump of 20 billion would be required to meet the $100 billion goals.Looking at the figure more closely, we see that mitigation and adaptation finance have risen significantly after adopting the Paris accord. However, despite this increase, adaptation finance still represents only one-third of the total climate finance.Also read: 'Studying' Climate: As Much A Social Issue, As Much As A 'Science' OneCOP26Pollution IndiaRepresentative Image.With roughly a few days left for the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties 26 (COP26), it is prudent to recognise that climate adaptation is no longer a future story. The climate impact stories we have been listening to for years are occurring in reality in various developed and developing countries.While the developed nations possess the critical technologies and finance to increase their adaptive capacities and reduce their vulnerabilities, developing countries often bear the most damage. In addition to the availability of accessible finance, it is critical to make the available finance more sustainable in terms of the implementation timeframe. While most of the finance in the form of grants are currently mobilised for 1-3 years, these need to be made more long-term and goal-oriented.Another critical factor for effective utilisation of adaptation finance is the correct usage of the funds. For effective adaptation, funds must be directed to the local communities that are the most vulnerable and are experiencing higher climate risks than others. Local communities, with individuals like Rajendra, who have limited access to resources, are often the ones that are given the least funds to cope with the risks of climate change.Thus, it is vital to understand how adaptation finance flows to the community level to ensure their needs are met.Even with the latest developments with respect to COP26, it is unstated but evident that climate mitigation, i.e. Net-Zero, is a ""sanguine"" option for many countries. The developing nations participating in COP26 must not blindly echo their voices with developed nations; instead, they must emphasise equitable billing of both the climate actions.The opinion of developing countries must reflect the stories of thousands like ""Rajendra"" who are suffering in silence because of climate change.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Youth ki Awaaz.

Alok Sharma, the conference chairman, banged down his gavel to signal that there were no decisive objections from the almost 200 national delegations present in Glasgow, ranging from coal- and gas-fuelled superpowers to oil producers and Pacific islands being swallowed by the rise in sea levels. The deal is the result of two weeks of tortuous negotiations in Glasgow that had to be extended for an extra day to balance the demands of climate-vulnerable nations, big industrial powers, and those whose consumption or exports of fossil fuels are vital to their economic development. ""Please don't ask yourself what more you can seek but ask instead what is enough,"" Sharma told delegates in the closing hours. ""Most importantly - please ask yourselves whether ultimately these texts deliver for all our people and our planet.""ALSO READ | HYPERLINK https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/cop26-glasgow-climate-change-finance-economy-gdp-1874775-2021-11-09COP26 : As climate damage mounts, poor nations press wealthy to pay upThe overarching aim set by conference host Britain was one that climate campaigners and vulnerable countries had found far too modest - namely, to keep within reach the 2015 Paris Agreement's target to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. A draft deal circulated early on Saturday in effect acknowledged that commitments made so far to cut emissions of planet-heating greenhouse gases are nowhere near enough, and asked nations to set tougher climate pledges next year, rather than every five years, as they are currently required to do. Scientists say that to go beyond a rise of 1.5C would unleash extreme sea level rise and catastrophes including crippling droughts, monstrous storms and wildfires far worse than those the world is already suffering. But national pledges made so far to cut greenhouse emissions - mostly carbon dioxide from burning coal, oil and gas - would only cap the average global temperature rise at 2.4 Celsius. However, Saturday's draft, published by the United Nations, did call for efforts to reduce coal use and also the huge subsidies that governments around the world give to the oil, coal and gas that power factories and heat homes - something that no previous climate conference had managed to agree on. India - whose energy needs are hugely dependent on coal - made last-minute objections to this part of the agreement. Developing countries argue that rich nations, whose historical emissions are largely responsible for heating up the planet, must pay more to help them adapt to its consequences as well as reducing their carbon footprints.ALSO READ | HYPERLINK https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/cop26-summit-greta-thunberg-climate-change-glasgow-emissions-1872411-2021-11-02'No more blah blah blah...': Politicians at HYPERLINK https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/cop26-summit-greta-thunberg-climate-change-glasgow-emissions-1872411-2021-11-02COP26 just pretending to take our future seriously, says Greta ThunbergCLIMATE FINANCE Britain tried to unblock the issue of climate finance, one of the thorniest, by proposing mechanisms to make sure the poorest nations finally get more of the financial help they have been promised. The draft urged rich countries to double finance for climate adaptation by 2025 from 2019 levels, offering funding that has been a key demand of small island nations at the conference. Adaptation funds primarily go to the very poorest countries and currently take up only a small fraction of climate funding. Britain also said a UN committee should report next year on progress towards delivering the $100 billion per year in overall annual climate funding that rich nations had promised by 2020 but failed to deliver. And it said governments should meet in 2022, 2024 and 2026 to discuss climate finance. Even $100 billion a year is far short of poorer countries' actual needs, which could hit $300 billion by 2030 in adaptation costs alone, according to the United Nations, in addition to economic losses from crop failure or climate-related disasters.WATCH | HYPERLINK https://www.indiatoday.in/india/video/five-commitments-pm-modi-made-cop26-summit-1872243-2021-11-02What are five commitments PM Modi made at HYPERLINK https://www.indiatoday.in/india/video/five-commitments-pm-modi-made-cop26-summit-1872243-2021-11-02COP26 Summit?

"COP26","India","COP26_India344","Agenda for CoP26","October 13, 2021 Wednesday","Down To Earth","India, Oct. 13 -- Embrace the future, don't erase the reality of climate injusticeIt's that time of the year again. After an absence of two years, world leaders and officials will meet at United Kingdom's Glasgow to negotiate what must be done on climate change. This meeting comes after dire warning from the United Nation's top scientific body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), that weather disasters will get worse, much worse.It is Code Red for the planet. It is also when the Nobel Peace Prize 2021 has not been awarded to youth leader Greta Thunberg, as was widely anticipated, but the voice of the youth remains strong. So, what should be the agenda at the 26th Conference of Parties (CoP26) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change?First, not to work to erase the reality of climate injustice, but to embrace it for the future. In 1992, at the Rio Conference, when the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change was agreed upon, it was built on the principle of common but differentiated responsibility.This simply meant that the already rich countries would reduce, create space for the emerging world to grow and the emerging world would grow differently with enabling funds and technology.But in the next 30 years, the single-biggest effort has been to undermine, and to finally erase, the principle of equity from climate negotiations. The 2015 Paris Agreement, which was lauded by all, removed the last vestige of historical responsibility from the text. Climate justice was relegated to a footnote.Slice, dice or dissect emissions data any which way, and you are left with the inconvenient truth that a few countries - the rich seven and China - have appropriated the carbon budget. Their accumulated emissions is the reason the world is hurtling towards catastrophe.The other inconvenient truth is that the remaining world - roughly 70 per cent of it - still needs the right to development. This part of the world cannot be wished away; it cannot be screamed at; and bullied into a low-carbon pathway. Their growth, without the emissions that will further jeopardise the world, needs huge funding and technology support.This is not about charity, but about fixing what has been broken, in the interests of all. There cannot be an effective or ambitious climate agreement without it being equitable and fair. It's a pre-requisite.In this long game, its intent is to gain ""equivalence"" with the rest of the big polluters by 2030. This means there is no space left for the rest of the world to grow. This is unacceptable. China today is yesterday's US and it is difficult to see how the world will call it out.The fourth agenda is finance - real, tangible and at the scale of the transformation needed. For long this promise has been lost in the imagery. This is what has led to the breakdown in trust between countries.CoP26. Currently the effort is to the find creative ways to ""buy"" cheap emission reductions from the developing world. It is a redo of the disastrous Clean Development Mechanism, but the intent is the same. This will only add to the crisis of climate change.The fact is today the world - including India and countries in Africa - need to act to reduce emissions. Instead of cheap carbon offset options, the market mechanism must formulate a way to fund transformational and expensive options in these countries. This means it needs to be designed, with a floor on the price of the cost of abatement that this mechanism will fund. This means not just talking the talk, but running the walk.The fifth agenda for CoP26 is the near-stuck discussion on ""loss and damage"". We are seeing huge devastations, caused by weird weather events. With each repeated disaster, people lose their ability to cope - to live in their repeatedly hit and devastated region; they get increasing impoverished; and increasingly desperate.This adds to their insecurity and to the insecurity of the world. Climate change is a great leveller. So, it is time for an effective agreement to underwrite the losses and damages and to hold the polluters responsible. It's time for polluters to pay.CoP26 must realise this is a time for courage, imagination and cooperation. People, particularly the young, are watching, not just in the privileged world but also in the voiceless and unconnected world. There is no time to waste. It's time to act.UNFCCC Global Warming Climate Change IndiaPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Down to Earth.

The sun is shining somewhere around the globe, even though it might have set someplace else, and the scale of GGI-OSOWOG will not only change clean energy access but could very well be the next biggest modern engineering marvel, he said.The partnerships, initiatives and discussions that the ISA will be leading at COP26 will provide the necessary impetus for delivering these transitions. The ISA invites nations, institutions and stakeholders with aligned interests and investment appetite to partner and accelerate global solar-led energy transition, he noted.This initiative will bring together an international coalition of national governments, financial organisations, and power system operators to accelerate the construction of new infrastructure needed to deliver a massive scale-up of secure, reliable and affordable power, such as modern, flexible grids, charging points, and electricity interconnectors, the UK's Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said, in reference to the joint project.ISA recently announced a partnership with Bloomberg Philanthropies to mobilise $1 trillion in global investments for solar energy across ISA's member countries. The two organisations plan to work with the World Resources Institute (WRI) to develop a Solar Investment Action Agenda and a Solar Investment Roadmap, which will also be launched at COP26.ISA, headed by Director General Mathur and with 98 countries supporting its framework, is aimed at facilitating energy transition at a global level, energy security at national levels, while also ensuring energy access at the local level.The alliance said it is working with development banks to bring the benefits of solar across the world. Apart from bringing down prices for solar water pumps, it is enabling technological transfer, storage solutions, financial assistance, along with skilling and enabling countries to adopt solar.It added: The ISA is an observer to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and has been an active participant at Conference ofParties (COPs). \l"

Executive Vice-President Frans Timmermans will lead the EU negotiating team. Commissioner Kadri Simson will also attend COP26, and the EU will host over 150 side events at the EU Pavilion.The Commission will be pushing all parties to meet their commitments under the Paris Agreement and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. We will also urge developed countries to increase their climate finance to meet the $100 billion target agreed in Paris, to which the EU already contributes over $25 billion and growing, and will work to finalise the Paris Rulebook'.Speaking ahead of COP26, President Ursula von der Leyen said, The world's race for net zero by mid-century is on. By working together we can all be winners. At COP26, we have the duty of protecting our planet for future generations. In Europe, we have everything in place to reach climate neutrality by 2050 and cut our emissions by at least 55% by 2030. In Glasgow I will be urging other world leaders to do the same; to innovate and to invest in a new more sustainable growth strategy. In short, to prosper and build healthier societies while ensuring a better future for our planet.Executive Vice-President for the European Green Deal, Frans Timmermans, said: It is essential that we draw upon the weight of science, popular support and the intense public scrutiny that the next two weeks will bring, to take bold steps forward for global climate action. Only by working together can we protect the future of humanity on this planet. In recent weeks I have been working with partners from every continent to pave the way for the talks ahead. We must all act now to finalise the Paris Agreement Rulebook, accelerate our emissions reductions, and deliver the climate finance that the world needs.Under the Paris Agreement, 195 countries agreed to submit Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) which represent their individual emissions reduction targets. Collectively, these NDCs should contribute to keeping average global temperature change below 2C and as close as possible to 1.5C by the end of the century. The latest UNFCCC Synthesis Report, published this month, shows that current NDCs do not meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, putting us on course for a dangerous 2.7C of global warming with extremely harmful effects that pose an existential challenge.Developed countries have committed to mobilise a total of $100 billion per year of international climate finance from 2020 until 2025 to help the most vulnerable countries and small island states in particular in their mitigation and adaptation efforts. The EU is the largest donor, contributing over a quarter of the target, and President von der Leyen recently announced an additional 4 billion from the EU budget until 2027. However, other partners now need to step up their efforts and meet the current shortfall of close to $20 billion. Climate finance is critical to support vulnerable communities protect themselves against the impacts of climate change and to grow a clean economy.Six years on from the adoption of the Paris Agreement, the EU will also be negotiating with other parties at COP26 to finalise the Paris Rulebook' of rules and procedures for implementing the Agreement. In particular, we are seeking an agreement that ensures the environmental integrity of global carbon markets, and on transparency and reporting obligations. A well-functioning international carbon market can generate additional investments in the green transition and speed up emission reductions in an economically efficient manner.EU side events at COP26During the conference, the EU will host over 150 side events at the EU Pavilion in Glasgow and onl"

The broad set of decisions, resolutions and declarations that constitute the outcome of COP26 is the fruit of intense negotiations over the last two weeks, of strenuous formal and informal work over many months, and of constant engagement both in person and virtually during almost two years. Today's package is a global commitment that reflects a delicate balance between the interests and aspirations of nearly 200 Parties to the core instruments on the international regime governing global efforts against climate change.Under the chairmanship of the United Kingdom and with the support of the UNFCCC Secretariat, delegates forged agreements that reinforce ambition in the three pillars of collective climate action. The adaptation was the subject of special attention during the deliberations. The Parties established a work program to define the global adaptation goal, which will identify collective needs and solutions to the climate crisis that already affects many countries. The Santiago Network was further strengthened by developing its country support functions to address and manage loss and damage. And the CP / RA approved the two registries for Nationally Determined Contributions (known as NDCs) and Communications on Adaptation, which serve as channels for information that flows into the global balance that should take place. every five years starting in 2023.Funding was extensively discussed throughout the session and there was consensus on the need to further increase support for developing countries. Parties welcomed the call to at least double funding for adaptation. The duty to fulfill the promise to contribute $ 100 billion annually from developed countries to developing countries was also reaffirmed. And a process was launched to define the new global financing objective.In terms of mitigation, the persistent gap in emissions has been clearly identified and the Parties collectively agreed to work to reduce that gap and ensure that the world continues to move forward during the current decade, so that the average temperature rise is limited to 1.5 degrees. Parties are encouraged to strengthen their emission reductions and align their national climate action commitments with the Paris Agreement.Furthermore, a key result is the conclusion of the so-called Paris regulation. Agreement has been reached on the fundamental rules related to Article 6 on carbon markets, which will make the Paris Agreement fully operational. This will give certainty and predictability to market and non-market approaches in support of mitigation and adaptation. And they also concluded negotiations on the Enhanced Transparency Framework, which provides agreed tables and formats for accounting and reporting on targets and emissions.Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of UN Climate Change, said: ""I thank the Presidency and all the ministers for their tireless efforts throughout the conference and I congratulate all parties for finalizing the regulations. It is an excellent achievement. It means that the Paris Agreement can now fully work for the benefit of all, now and in the future.

Now, there is a 50% chance, according to the Climate Resource paper, and 34% chance, according to the Science report, that warming could be kept under 2degC if the commitments are met.""For the first time in history, the aggregate effect of the combined pledges by 194 countries might bring the world to below 2degC warming with more than a 50% chance,"" said Climate Resource briefing paper.The jump in the chances is because of steps by two of the three biggest carbon emitters. ""The major changes that bring projected warming below the significant benchmark of 2degC are China's new NDC (nationally determined contributions) and India's new announcement at COP26, both featuring net zero emission targets by 2060 and 2070, respectively,"" the paper added. The projection in the Science paper was different, but still showed a drastic improvement: the chances of limiting global warming to under 2degC is now 34% and, if countries take a more ambitious path after 2030, those probabilities become even more likely, rising to 60% & 11% respectively.Both assessments use different models for projections, but both take into account the NDCs - which are pencilled in as commitments by countries - and preliminary announcements, such as the one made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday.PM Modi said India will become carbon neutral by 2070, the first time the country committed to a net zero emissions goal. He also made four more pledges, including sourcing 50% of energy from renewable resources by 2030, and, by the same year, to reduce total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonne.Officials part of India's climate negotiations team at Glasgow - where each side will fine tune their NDCs - told HT on Monday the commitment may be subject to climate financing negotiations and the steps by rich countries, which till now have not met their pledge of providing $100bn to developing nations by 2020. Modi called out this discrepancy, saying climate financing cannot lag climate action, and demanded that developed nations with historically high emissions make $1 trillion available to developing nations as soon as possible.A similar projection that the new pledges mean the 2degC goal is now more achievable was made by the International Energy Agency. "" climate pledges mean Glasgow is getting closer to Paris! New IEA analysis shows that fully achieving all net zero pledges to date and the Global Methane Pledge by those who signed it would limit global warming to 1.8 C. A big step forward, but much more needed!"" said IEA executive director Fatih Biro in a tweet on November 4.The US and EU signed the Global Methane Pledge at the COP26 on Tuesday, aiming to limit methane emissions by 30% compared to 2020 levels. Methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gases.The authors of the Climate Resource paper said a warming of 2degC by 2100 will still be catastrophic and countries must work toward limiting the rise to 1.5degC. ""The combined pledges of countries, both the conditional ones, and certainly the unconditional ones, are not yet sufficient to halt warming at around 1.5degC. Using probabilistic projections, the exceedance probability for 1.5degC is still around 90%, meaning wide scale increases of extreme climate events and the demise of the coral reefs, unless the pace of transition to net-zero emissions continues to accelerate rapidly,"" the paper said.""The good news is, in our study we show how some of the most extreme futures can be excluded if current pledges are followed. But these pledges are still not sufficient to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, and COP26 still has an important task in front of them. If we're serious about getting to 1.5 degrees, the pledges need to be further strengthened,"" Dr Joeri Rogelj, the co-author of the Science research study and the director of research for the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London said, according to a statement by the university.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from HT Chandigarh.

"COP26","India","COP26_India354","COP26: Developing countries dig in heels as talks reach final lap","November 11, 2021 Thursday","Hindustan Times","Glasgow, Nov. 11 -- Talks at the 26th edition of the climate change conference (COP26) in Glasgow entered the crucial final stages of negotiations, with a key grouping of developing countries, which includes India and China, raising objections against some segments of the draft proposal, decrying what they said would amount to ""carbon colonialism"" by rich nations.Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDC) said the draft document on the outcome of the summit - particularly its focus on the 1.5degC target for all countries -- is reinventing the terms of the 2015 Paris Agreement, which made a differentiation in climate action and ambition.""The Paris Agreement has a delicate balance which we cannot rewrite. There should be differentiation in climate action and ambition. There should also be recognition of the pre-2020 ambition gap. If we go ahead with the proposal of net-zero by 2050 for all countries, the developing world will be trapped. We do not have the technological and financial means to achieve such targets. This narrative will allow the developed world to control the world with carbon colonialism. Developing countries will be ethically and financially condemned for not complying,"" said Diego Pacheco, lead negotiator of Bolivia on behalf of LMDC.Pacheco added that 60% of the carbon space was occupied by developed countries with only 18% of the world population, and that the historical responsibility of these regions in causing the climate crisis cannot be ignored.They instead proposed to the COP26 presidency that there be recognition of this historical responsibility and the limited carbon space in the final deal, and that developed countries should achieve full decarbonisation with real and immediate reduction of emissions within this decade.Developed countries are classified as Annex I nations. It also states thatIndia, on behalf of BASIC - a bloc of four countries comprising Brazil, South Africa, India and China - said the draft material lacked balance and while the mitigation section - which deals with steps on reducing emissions offered a highly ""prescriptive"" approach. The proposals are strong on revising the NDCs, or nationally determined contributions, by 2022, in annual ministerial roundtables and updating long-term strategies, but such an approach is not reflected in judging how climate finance is made available.The BASIC group too emphasised that the cumulative stock of emissions have caused a temperature increase of 1.1degC compared to pre-industrial levels, a member of the Indian delegation said on condition of anonymity.""We cannot settle for the lowest common denominator. Keeping the 1.5 goal within reach means reducing emissions globally by 45% by 2030. But the present set of NDCs - even if fully implemented - will still increase emissions by 2030,"" he added.According to Third World Network, a non-profit international research and advocacy organisation focusing on North-South affairs, the developed countries were happy with the draft text on mitigation which mentioned the goal of 1.5degC.The United States did not want any reference to the principle of Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC) with regard to the 'carbon budget'.UK negotiator Archie Young said on Thursday evening that views remained very divergent on the COP26 cover decision -- so much so that one country representing a group of countries disagreed with entire section on mitigation and rejected it. ""We are not there yet. There is no consensus on many critical issues. Time is running out. We are trying to find solutions,"" the representative of the COP26 presidency said. He added that new cover decision and other texts will be released overnight.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

The vehicle has been used by SSE and its partners over the past fortnight on a tour of the UK, highlighting examples of net zero projects.The vehicle used on the 'Road to Renewables' tour is a BYD ADL Enviro400EV pure electric double decker built in Britain by BYD and Alexander Dennis with a range of 160 miles - meaning it could get from Glasgow to Aberdeen on a single charge.The youngsters visited the First Caledonia bus depot, where SSE - a principal partner of COP26 - is helping install charging infrastructure to power 150 clean green buses for Glasgow at what will be the biggest depot in the UK and provide cleaner air for the city.The installation of 11 advanced dual-headed rapid charging units at the Caledonia depot marks a significant step forward in First Bus's plans to have a zero-emission fleet by 2035. The depot has been designed to accommodate and charge up to 300 EV buses and has been funded through a 35 million investment by First Bus which has been supported by a further 28 from the Scottish Government through their Scottish Ultra Low Emission Bus Scheme.As Glasgow welcomes the leaders of the world, First Bus has teamed up with Octopus Energy and Hitachi Europe - another principal partner of COP26 - to deliver a free and rapid EV charging hub for delegates. The facility is part of a 'Together for our Planet' event which will use virtual reality to show how bus depots can be transformed into fleet charging hubs, accelerating the transition to zero emission fleets.Kieran Gilmurray, Finance Director of SSE's Energy Businesses, said:""SSE is very proud that our distributed energy team is installing the EV infrastructure here that will power 150 green buses for Glasgow by the end of the year, delivering cleaner public transport for its citizens. SSE is also a Principal Partner for COP26 and as the world's attention focuses on what Scotland is doing to decarbonise, we're here to showcase this site which will be the largest EV charging hub of its kind in the UK.""We're also delighted to conclude our SSE 'Road to Renewables' electric bus tour today. We started in London 11 days ago and we've been celebrating the efforts already underway by SSE, and others, to get to net zero as COP26 prepares to open for business here in my hometown of Glasgow on Monday.""Janette Bell, First Bus Managing Director, said:""First Bus are delighted to be playing host to such a prestigious event and it is an honour taking part in the COP26 Together for our Planet campaign.""The eyes of the world will be focused on Glasgow for the next few weeks and so it is great to be able to share our ambitions for the future of public transport and the role it has to play in meeting our collective climate challenge targets.""As leaders in sustainable mobility, First Bus are fully aligned with the Government's ambitions for a net-zero carbon transport system, including zero-emission bus fleets. We have already committed to achieving this by 2035 and we look forward to showcasing this to delegates over the course of the event.""Minister for Zero Carbon Buildings, Active Travel and Tenants' Rights Patrick Harvie said:""I'm pleased to see the partnership approach from First Bus, SSE, Octopus Energy and Hitachi, all coming together to welcome Glasgow and the world to the Caledonia Depot during COP26.""We need to end the negative contribution made by transport towards irreversible climate change. To support this, we're investing in the decarbonisation of public transport. We've provided 28 million through the Scottish Ultra Low Emission Bus Scheme to help transform the Caledonia Depot and to help fund the electric buses operating for delegates during the Conference, which will then become service buses for the people of Glasgow.""Choosing to travel by bus is already a climate positive choice compared to choosing to drive, and we're helping to support this by providing free bus travel for people aged under 22 starting next year. Zero emission electric buses offer even more benefits for our air quality and for our climate, and it's good to see the progress being made by First Bus and other partners here in Glasgow.""Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said:""In a matter of days, the eyes of the world will be upon Glasgow as world leaders gather for COP26. We are facing a world climate emergency, and it is vital that we take action across the globe. We all need to do our bit, and using more sustainable means of transport is something we can all do. I was very pleased to welcome the arrival of the SSE's 100% electric bus and see the First Bus EV charging facility, which will do a huge amount to make Glasgow's transport greener.""Alexander Dennis president and managing director Paul Davies said: ""Alexander Dennis is playing its part on the road to net zero by supporting thousands of skilled green jobs directly and across our supply chain. Our British-built zero emission buses are helping cut carbon emissions and local air pollution. As a global leader in the design and manufacture of double deck buses, we've been proud to support the Road to Renewables tour, and are delighted with the level of engagement and interest from customers and local authority stakeholders that this electric double deck bus has generated.""With the COP26 climate change conference about to start, the Road to Renewables partners have shown that they have the solutions needed for a sustainable future.""Mike Nugent, Head of EV, Hitachi Europe Ltd, said:""As a Principal Partner of , Hitachi is proud to support First Bus in delivering their rapid EV charging Hub. Our Zero Carbon initiative and partnership with First Bus is at the heart of our Environment Strategy and sets the benchmark for decarbonised transport in the UK.""Working with First Bus, we will deliver a bus decarbonisation programme and place the electric bus depot at the heart of the local community, through the delivery of charging and electrification services.""The EV charging hub is one example of how we are aiming to deliver new community services and regeneration opportunities through the electrification programme.""First Bus has recently taken delivery of 22 brand new electric buses with associated charging infrastructure, part-funded by Transport Scotland through the Scottish Ultra-Low Emission Bus scheme (SULEB). Another 126 electric vehicles are due to be delivered over the next 18 months, with further expansion of charging infrastructure to match.SSE, alongside the Go-Ahead Group, SWARCO Smart Charging, and bus builders Alexander Dennis and BYD, has used a pure electric bus tour to showcase examples of the national effort already underway to decarbonise.Source: FirstGroup\l"

Cooling will be essential to protect human health and productivity under such circumstances -- but 7 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions come from cooling already. ""The need for cooling in our daily lives -- to protect people against heat extremes -- will grow. But the way we cool our homes and workplaces is a major driver of climate change. Today, around 10 per cent of the world's electricity is used for air conditioning. If left unchecked, emissions related to cooling are expected to double by 2030, driven by heat waves, population growth, urbanization and the demands of a growing middle class,"" said Inger Andersen, UNEP Executive Director. A transition to efficient and climate-friendly cooling, including natural solutions, could allow the expansion of cooling and avoid 4-8 years of global emissions. This includes work under the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol to replace climate-warming gases, known as hydrofluorocarbons, that are used as refrigerant gases. Peter Goldsmith of Richmond Park, Minister for Pacific and the Environment at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), said, ""I am delighted that we have announced GBP 12 million of Defra Official Development Assistance programming today to provide valuable assistance to developing countries, enabling them to make rapid progress on reducing hydrofluorocarbons and adopting energy efficient cooling solutions. ""This funding will support vital work to address inefficient cooling technologies and help develop a resilient and sustainable food supply chain in Africa, delivering the first African centre of excellence for rural cooling and cold chain."" In support of these commitments, an unprecedented surge of implementation will fill 2022 and beyond. These implementation efforts will go a long way in turning commitments into emissions reduction and increase resilience.

Yesterday, 13 countries launched a new alliance to end gas and oil production within their borders, led by Denmark and Costa Rica.But most proposals suffer either from a lack of ambition or a lack of participation from key countries.Take the pledge to cut methane emissions. Some of the biggest methane emitters such as Russia, China and Australia failed to sign up. Similarly, the plan to phase out coal allows some signatories such as Indonesia to keep building coal-fired power plants. Read more: Australia's refusal to sign a global methane pledge exposes flaws in the term 'net-zero'What these proposals and, indeed, the whole COP process, suffer from is an inability to address the fact that if we're to avoid the worst of climate change, we simply can't keep extracting fossil fuels.While national governments and their negotiators remain willing to listen to the interests of fossil fuel lobbyists, the COP process will continue to be riddled with loopholes that will derail the achievement of real targets. Five big loopholes come to mind.1. Subsidies and financeMuch has been made of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), a global coalition of financial institutions which aims to accelerate the decarbonisation of the economy.But many of its efforts will be undermined while governments continue to subsidise the fossil fuel industry. With fossil fuel subsidies globally running at US$11 million (A$15 million) every minute, GFANZ is insufficient to halt emissions because subsidising the cost of production and sale of fossil fuels continues to make the industry feasible.Moreover GFANZ is voluntary, when we need commitments to be binding. It also includes banks who have recently provided US$575 billion (A$787 billion) in fossil fuel finance to some of the world's biggest polluters.2. New productionDespite the overwhelming evidence that most of the world's fossil fuel reserves must stay in the ground, governments are still approving new projects. The UK government has 40 fossil fuel projects in the pipel"

It has the capability of meeting the global surge in electricity demand expected in the coming decades.Professor Ian Chapman, UK Atomic Energy Authority CEO, said: Fusion energy is low carbon, safe, efficient, and the fuels exist in abundance. Its a gamechanger for our global energy future. Im in no doubt that fusion will be a complementary part of the energy mix for generations to come. Its one of the biggest scientific and engineering quests in history, up there with the Apollo programme, and the rewards for success will be huge for our planet.Fusion energy has been one of science and engineerings biggest challenges yet. Teams of scientists and engineers around the world are working intensely on research and development breakthroughs in fusion, and these endeavours are continuing to gain momentum. The Joint European Torus (JET) is at the forefront of this research as is the ITER project, a collaboration of 35 nations in the south of France.The ITER members, including the USA, China, India, Japan, Korea and Russia, along with the European Union, are constructing one of the worlds largest international science and engineering collaborations in history. ITER is now in full assembly phase, and soon to be completed.Dr Bernard Bigot, Director General of ITER and chair of the panel at COP26, said: Fusion scientists and engineers are closer than ever to getting this revolutionary clean, sustainable energy switched on. Here in Glasgow, we are inviting leaders to look towards a future in which fusion is a key part of the worldwide zero carbon energy mix.Alongside international collaborations, more than US$2 billion of private investment has been pumped into a rapidly expanding number of innovative fusion companies.This surge has led to fusion being classed as a critical piece of the future global energy puzzle, and complementary to other sustainable energy efforts.The COP26 HYPERLINK https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=v2WdlxZqLYM&feature=youtu.behttps://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=v2WdlxZqLYM&feature=youtu.be.

The funds will be used for assisting India in its measures to push back against climate change and related areas such as adding more renewable energy.Announcing the measures, German Ambassador to India Walter Lindner said support for the development and the fight against climate change are among key focus areas of relations between India and his country. He was speaking while attending a press meeting with a delegation of the German Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development that is currently visiting India.""Every fifth person on this planet is Indian. Without Indians, you cannot solve any big world problems, and one of the biggest is climate change,"" he said. He added that ""We try to work together with India and help with climate change, renewable energy and similar projects, which also helps in working towards our own goals we promised at COP26 in Glasgow,""Professor Claudia Warning, Director General from the German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development said the Indo-German cooperation is resting on four key megatrends: climate change, urbanisation, degradation of natural resources and pressure on democracy and society.Germany, which has come under increasing pressure to do more after its seemingly rush to shut down nuclear plants and even extend its plans for coal, has had a tough time of it of late, as it seeks to balance climate impact with its domestic compulsions. A massive auto sector for instance delayed the country's own plans to embrace EV's, even as being a pioneering market for solar and wind energy has hardly led to the kind of benefits it hoped for, instead being saddled with expensive power and a market dominated by China after all the initial effort by the Germans.\l"

As per the Paris Agreement, India aims to reduce the emission intensity by 33-35 per cent by 2030 as compared to 2005 levels.""We have a day on adaptation and loss and damage, with events held in partnership with the governments of India, Jamaica and Bangladesh,"" COP26 President Alok Sharma announced while sets out a series of events that will take place in the UK Presidency Pavilion over the vital two weeks of COP26.""And we have a whole day dedicated to finance, with numerous events focussing on both the public and private sectors, covering everything from overcoming barriers to investment in developing countries to building the foundations of a net zero financial system.""Civil society, private finance, and business, including our fantastic COP26 partners, are a strong feature throughout the programme, and we have a dedicated cities and regions day packed with exciting events,"" he said.At an event planned on World leaders' Summit on November 1, the UK and India will co-chair the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI), a group of 26 countries, and seven international organizations, aimed at promoting resilient infrastructure through cutting-edge research and innovations.At this event, Ministers from the UK, India and key CDRI members (Japan, the US, Australia, UN organisations, Small Island Developing States), and representatives from the private sector, will reiterate their commitment to making infrastructure more resilient to climate related disasters.The CDRI will present the case for renewed investment in resilient infrastructure, and the scope of its upcoming flagship report (due for publication in 2022).The world must adapt to the damaging effects of climate change and build more resilience to disasters. Two-thirds of economic losses from disasters are associated with infrastructure damage.Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled the CDRI at the 2019 UN Climate Action Summit in New York and it now includes 26 countries, the European Union and four international partners and two private sector organisations.Elaborating the programme sets out the exciting series of events that will take place in the UK Presidency Pavilion, curated to support the longstanding goals of the UK's COP26 presidency, Sharma said the first of these goals is to drive down global emissions to keep alive the crucial Paris Agreement aim of limiting global temperature rises to well below 2 degrees C, and as close as possible to 1.5C.This includes driving action on power, transport, deforestation and methane.""Secondly, we aim to protect people and nature from the impacts of climate change through adaptation.

Besides, 30 countries, including Canada, the UK, and Mexico, and six major automakers -- among them Ford, Mercedes-Benz, General Motors and Volvo -- pledged to work together to make zero-emission vehicles the new normal by making them accessible, affordable, and sustainable in all regions by 2030 or sooner. This marks a significant boost for vehicles that do not emit emissions harming the climate and public health. Also, at COP26 And the launch of a new World Bank trust fund that will mobilise $200 million over the next 10 years to decarbonise road transport in emerging markets and developing economies. This goal is guiding the Zero Emission Vehicle Transition Council (ZEVTC), which met with distinguished representatives, including experts on the transition in Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs), discussed how international collaboration can support a global transition. The ZEVTC will launch its first annual Action Plan, which sets out areas for sustained international cooperation to accelerate the transition during 2022. The US on Wednesday joined the UK as a co-chair of the ZEVTC. Responding to commitment to clean vehicles` surges, Jake Schmidt, senior strategic director for international climate at NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council), said, ""This welcome move signals that a growing number of countries, automakers and transportation providers are joining the global push for 100 per cent zero-emissions electric vehicles. ""Now, more key players, notably other countries with large numbers of vehicles on the road, should sign-on. By transitioning to all-electric vehicles, we can create jobs and sharply reduce the pollution adding to the climate crisis, turning the corner to a cleaner future."" As per the Glasgow Accord on Zero Emissions Vehicles, signed by more than 100 entities, including countries, global automakers, cities, regions and fleet owners, this is the beginning of the end of the road for petrol and diesel-powered vehicles, which will be phased out and replaced by zero-emission vehicles by 2035 in key markets. The consequences of the announcement are significant. These commitments mean signatories of the Accord account for almost 15 per cent of the global car market, or 11.5 million vehicles. Added to other countries and regions that have also announced ICE phase-out dates, most notably the EU, this share climbs to more than almost one in three of global car sales.

The event will see leaders from more than 190 countries, thousands of negotiators, researchers and citizens coming together to strengthen a global response to the threat of climate change. It is a pivotal movement for the world to come together and accelerate the climate action plan.This year marks the 26th Conference of Parties (thus the name COP26) and will be held in the Scottish Event Campus in Glasgow.The conference comes months after the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published its assessment report on Earth's climate, highlighting heat waves, droughts, extreme rainfall and sea-level rise in the coming decades.Formation of COPThe Conference of Parties comes under the United Nations Climate Change Framework Convention (UNFCCC) which was formed in 1994. The UNFCCC was established to work towards ""stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.""It laid out a list of responsibilities for the member states which included: Formulating measures to mitigate climate change Cooperating in preparing for adaptation to the impact of climate change Promoting education, training and public awareness related to climate changeCOP1 to COP25COP members have been meeting every year since 1995. The UNFCCC has 198 parties including India, China and the USA.The first conference (COP1) was held in 1995 in Berlin. At COP3 held in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997, the famous Kyoto Protocol was adopted. It commits the member states to pursue limitation or reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. It entered into force on 16 February 2005 and there are 192 Parties in the Kyoto Protocol.India hosted the eighth COP from October 23 to November 1, 2002 in New Delhi. The conference laid out seven measures including, 'strengthening of technology transfer... in all relevant sectors, including energy, transport...and the promotion of technological advances through research and development...and the strengthening of institutions for sustainable development.'One of the most important conferences, COP21 took place from November 30 to December 11, 2015, in Paris, France. Member countries agreed to work together to 'limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels.'COP26 goalsAccording to the UNFCCC, COP26 will work towards four goals:1. Secure global net-zero by mid-century and keep 1.5 degrees within reachAt the National Conference on COP26 Charter of Actions, held on October 13, Natalie Toms, Chief Economist, Climate and Development Counsellor at the British High Commission in India said: ""The UK has already committed to bringing 78% emission reductions by 2035 and is on the road to net-zero by 2050. India has also taken important steps with its 450 gigaWatt renewables target and national hydrogen mission. Different countries will have different pathways, and we recognise the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.""The UNFCCC recommends that countries £ccelerate the phase-out of coal, curtail deforestation, speed up the switch to electric vehicles and encourage investment in renewables' to meet this goal. At the National Conference on COP26 Charter of Actions, Navroz K. Dubash, Senior Fellow at Centre for Policy Research, detailed what India could do to reach its targets: It is time for India to update its Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs.

The conference's goals include facilitating net-zero global-warming emissions worldwide by mid-century, enacting policies to achieve the pressing target of keeping the Earth's average temperature at no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, and adapting to protect communities and natural habitats.The 13-day conference begins just three days after President Joe Biden's administration released a framework for the Build Back Better plan. That proposal will fund crucial environmental infrastructure in the United States and build on the successful climate action in many states since the Paris Agreement.Matt Casale, PIRG Environment Campaigns Director, issued the following statement:""As the world faces an increasingly destructive climate crisis, COP26 provides an important opportunity for global collaboration. Worldwide commitments from COP26 can help us all make progress toward a livable planet for generations to come. But as we saw when President Donald Trump tried to remove the United States from the Paris Agreement, our country needs internal accountability as well as external goals. We need to pass our own strong climate and clean energy legislation. The recently announced Build Back Better framework is a big step forward and lays the groundwork for an accelerated transition to clean energy. But state action has been -- and will continue to be -- key to achieving the emissions reductions we ultimately need.""Many states have become climate leaders by putting key policies in place, even as federal climate progress lags. Twenty-four states are committed to carbon emission reduction targets. States across the country are committing to transitioning to all-electric vehicles and buses. Both are crucial steps toward building a more sustainable future. As COP26 helps drive the global fight against climate change, we need states to continue their leadership in our backyards by encouraging electric vehicles, setting strong energy building codes and waste reduction goals, and much more. If all our state governments and the federal government join forces, they'll wield immense power to reduce pollution and stymie climate change.""Johanna Neumann, senior director of Environment America Campaign for 100% Renewable Energy, issued the following statement:""Our nation is at a pivotal moment. We have an opportunity to repower our lives with clean and renewable energy that doesn't pollute our air or water or threaten our climate. And, if we seize that opportunity, we can lead the world by example at COP26 and beyond.""The recently announced Build Back Better Framework is a great start. The framework includes clean energy tax incentive programs that will be crucial to tapping more of our vast renewable potential over the coming decade. But those programs won't be enough on their own. We'll also need states to continue leading the way toward a future powered by 100% clean and renewable energy. To date, nine states have already committed to 100% clean or renewable electricity, and dozens more have other renewable energy targets on the books. We know that those policies work. The U.S. produces almost four times as much renewable electricity from the sun and wind as it did in 2010, and about 50% of the remarkable growth we've seen in renewable power since 2000 has been attributed to state renewable energy requirements.""If we can get our state and federal leaders all rowing in the same direction with urgency, we can lock in another decade or more of rapid progress.""Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from NGO Daily News.

Give us a seat at the table so we can secure our future.""Since COP26 negotiations started two weeks ago, more than 5 million babies have been born into a world where they will face seven times as many heatwaves, 2.6 more droughts, and three times as many crop failures as their grandparents, the child rights organisation said[i]. These extreme weather events disproportionately impact children in lower income countries, as well as those already experiencing inequality and discrimination.Save the Children's Global Director of Child Poverty and Climate, Yolande Wright, said: ""It's encouraging to see a mention of children's rights and intergenerational equity in the final text of COP26. But over the past two weeks, leaders have held the whole world - and children's futures - in their hands. Children and young people have been calling on leaders to turn words into action, and this was their opportunity to see this through.""According to Save the Children's recent report with Vrije Universiteit Brussels, if warming is limited to 1.5 degrees C, the additional lifetime exposure of newborns to heatwaves will drop by 45%; by 39% for droughts; and by 28% for crop failures[ii]. Earlier this week, analysis warned that even with new pledges, including those made in Glasgow, global greenhouse gas emissions cuts are not ambitious enough to keep to the crucial 1.5C limit in sight[iii].Yolande Wright said: ""The importance of limiting global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels is mentioned in the text, but a clear set of tangible commitments and the process to get there is missing in action.""COP26 has failed to address the injustice of loss and damage, Save the Children added. High income countries and historical emitters urgently need to support the development of new and additional funds to address rapidly escalating loss and damage, as well as the creation of a new climate financFOR e mechanism for loss and damage by 2023.Yolande Wright said: ""As we write, the hunger crisis is worsening in many regions, including East Africa where another drought is bringing millions to the brink of starvation, and serious funding shortages mean we cannot take the action we know is needed to save lives and livelihoods. We aren't discussing distant climate impacts that might happen - we are talking about crises happening right now, where children are affected first and worst and many are tragically already losing their lives.""Other climate finance commitments have also fallen far too short, and failed to strike enough of a balance between mitigation and adaptation funding, according to Save the Children. For many countries, the human and financial costs of adapting are rising, and they cannot afford to wait any longer.Yolande Wright said: ""High-income countries that have economically benefitted from producing the most emissions must address their carbon debt by contributing their fair share of climate finance - particularly for the most vulnerable children. We need to see climate financing beyond the $100 billion commitment promised years ago and still not delivered - and we need to see a much stronger commitment to climate adaptation. This may sound challenging, but when we compare this to ongoing subsidies to the fossil fuel industry it really is affordable. As a child rights organisation, we are outraged that adults are failing to act in the best interests of children - as we promised to do in the Convention on the Rights of the Child.""All this comes against a backdrop of the most exclusive COP ever - despite assurances that it would be the most inclusive, Save the Children said.Dorothy Kazombo Mwale, a youth climate activist from Malawi, said: ""The fact that COP26 was not youth inclusive made it difficult for us to voice our thoughts and influence decisions that can actually bring about the outcome that we need.Yolande Wright said: ""Children and young people have told us themselves that their voices and experiences have not been heard in Glasgow.

The participating states have launched a number of new collaborations, for example to make low-carbon materials and industrial technologies affordable and to improve climate resilience in developing countries.An independent panel of experts from the International Energy Agency (IEA), the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and high-ranking UN climate officers will monitor progress in implementing the previously announced Breakthrough Agenda , make recommendations for measures and further cooperation and on an annual basis Create progress reports.The newly formed Mission Innovation initiative , a coalition of 22 governments and the European Commission, has announced four new ""innovation missions "" in which countries will work together to develop clean technologies for cities, industry, carbon capture and the production of renewable fuels, chemicals and accelerate materials. The ""innovation missions"" thus cover sectors that are responsible for more than 50 percent of global emissions.A new Adaptation Research Alliance (ARA), made up of a coalition of more than 90 organizations, aims to strengthen the resilience of the communities hardest hit by climate change.Together with Italy UK has launched a new global partnership to combine the scientific expertise from around the world to obstacles on the way to CO 2 to eliminate neutrality. New ways of citizen participation should also be taken into account.An overarching goal of the COP26 initiatives is to enable developing countries to bypass the fossil fuel development stage and switch directly to renewable energies. The challenges of expanding renewable energies in developing countries concern the necessary training of skilled workers on site and the poorly developed infrastructure and supply chains, which lead to higher installation costs. With the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet want several global foundations ( Rockefeller Foundation, IKEA Foundation, Bezos Earth Fund) and Public Development Banks, in collaboration with Great Britain, Italy and Denmark, support governments in designing strategies for implementation, expansion, subsidies and mobilizing investments.\l"

The guarantee of this commitment is in the documents delivered by the Parliamentary Front for Agriculture (FPA) and by the Confederation of Agriculture and Livestock of Brazil (CNA) to the Federal Government to be presented at the 26th United Nations Conference on Climate Change (COP26), which takes place in November 1-12 in Glasgow, Scotland.Measures adopted by the Brazilian government for the sector, with a focus on sustainable technologies, will also be on the agenda at the Climate Summit. Such as the Sectoral Plan for Mitigation and Adaptation to Climate Change for the Consolidation of a Low-Carbon Economy in Agriculture (Plan ABC), a policy that adopts technologies to reduce the environmental impact on agriculture. These include creating planted forests, recovering pastures, direct planting, Biological Nitrogen Fixation (FBN) in the soil, handling animal waste and integrating Crop-Livestock-Forestry (ILPF).In the period from 2010 to 2020, the goal was to apply the technology on 35.5 million hectares and reduce the emission of CO2 into the atmosphere between 132 and 162 million tons. However, predictions were exceeded. The ABC Plan technologies reached 52 million hectares, enabling the reduction of approximately 170 million tons of equivalent carbon dioxide.ChallengesEnvironment Minister Joaquim Leite guaranteed that he will defend national interests in climate negotiations and that the country has an ambitious goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 43% by 2030. According to the minister, in ten years, the agricultural sector will absorb 40% of these gases from the atmosphere and will guarantee world food security.""Brazil has a challenge, as written in Article 2 of the Climate Agreement, to reduce emissions, eradicate poverty, which is to generate employment and income, and guarantee food for the world. This is a challenge that few countries have. Brazil has these three challenges until 2050"", highlighted Joaquim Leite.To build Brazil's official position at the Climate Summit, the Federal Government sought contributions from various sectors, including 200 associations, trade associations, organizations and the business sector. ""With the effort of the Federal Government in an integrated way, of the private initiative acting with entrepreneurship, with innovation and with resources and economic incentives, we are going to get there. We will definitely have a green economy"", said the minister.CNA will participate in COP26 to present Brazilian agribusiness actions to promote sustainability.

The need to involve the private sector will be highlighted during COP26 as particularly important.EBRD President Odile Renaud-Basso, who will lead the Bank's delegation, said: ""We want to give our countries the confidence to be ambitious and brave in their net zero goals. The world needs climate action now. We have the capital, we know how to mobilise financing and we have the technical expertise to deliver crucial support. Countries that commit to the green transition - unparalleled in economic history for its speed and scale - will find the EBRD with them every step of the way.""The 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference is key to delivering climate action, with countries expected to raise the ambition of their emission reduction commitments, with the goal of limiting global warming to to 1.5C. Financiers, including multilateral development banks (MBDs) like the EBRD, are preparing to deliver more support to realise those plans.The EBRD is supporting these goals not only with investments in green energy, energy efficiency and energy savings. The Bank is also supporting especially exposed countries like Kazakhstan or Uzbekistan to develop roadmaps to low or zero carbon economies and it is addressing the need for a 'just transition' with recent investments, for instance in North Macedonia.""In the last 12 months climate action has really accelerated with a whole series of net zero commitments, notably from China, the US, the EU, the UK, Japan and others. We're especially pleased that in addition to our EU countries of operation, from the EBRD region Kazakhstan and Turkey have also made net zero commitments,"" said Harry Boyd-Carpenter, Managing Director for Green Economy and Climate Action. ""But at the same time emissions keep rising so there is a huge amount of work needed to turn those commitments into practical plans and real investments in low-carbon transition. That's what we're going to COP to focus on - turning that ambition into reality.""The EBRD brings two recent commitments of its own on enhancing its climate action. One, made in October 2020, is to increase the proportion of its green investments to more than 50 per cent of the total by 2025. The second, made in July 2021, is by 2023 to align all its operations with the goals of the Paris Agreement. These further enhance its work fostering the green transition in the 38 economies in Europe, Asia and Africa where it invests.On COP26A major challenge in emerging economies and developing countries is a shortage of bankable climate projects. Several factors limit the supply of such projects. The most fundamental is the lack of either an implicit or an explicit carbon price. Without a carbon price, many green investments are not commercially viable.The EBRD delegation at the conference will participate in more than 30 events covering a wide range of topics, including how to make direct and indirect finance align with the Paris Agreement, helping countries design roadmap and rules for a new low-carbon economy (Long-Term Strategies) and ensuring that workers in industries impacted by the low-carbon transition are not left behind (Just Transition). A joint MDB statement on securing biodiversity and nature-based solutions will go beyond the principle of ""do no harm"" to look for positive investments in the future.Source: EBRD\l"

No less relevant in the context of this agreement, they are also the two largest economies in the world. Between them they have the power to unlock vast financial flows from the public and private sectors that can speed the transition to a low carbon economy.""This announcement comes at a critical moment at COP26 and offers new hope that, with the support and backing of two of the world's most critical voices, we may be able to limit climate change to 1.5 degrees. But we must also be clear eyed about what is still required if the two countries are to deliver the emission reductions necessary in the next nine years. 1.5C-alignment will require a whole-of-economy response. For the United States, the next steps must be to push for the most ambitious possible outcome at COP26, for Congress to secure passage of the Build Back Better bill, and to align the full power of the entire U.S. federal government with the contributions of non-federal institutions across society. These tasks will set the stage as we pivot to implementing the Paris Agreement and we begin to look ahead at the potential of this partnership between these two countries to address the climate crisis with real, meaningful results during this critical decade.""MIL OSI\l"

"COP26","India","COP26_India410","Cop26 takeaway in the divided world","November 23, 2021 Tuesday","The Pioneer (India)","India, Nov. 23 -- In the recently concluded COP26 meet on climate change, the developed world as usual was harping on stopping use of coal and subsidies on fossil fuel ignoring the ground realities of the developing world that faces challenges of meeting the energy needs of developmental works and reduction of poverty. However, thanks to India and other developing nation the final agreement toned down the words and pledged to only reduce the use of coal and fossil fuel. As per the Paris agreement the developed world was supposed to provide $100 billion annually by the year 2020 to the developing countries to meet their targets of adaptation and mitigation. The new technologies and innovative attempts require finances and unless it is done it will be a pipe dream to achieve targets. The Glasgow declaration is weak on promises especially on loss and damages though the developed countries now agreed to provide the 100 billion dollars by 2023. In reality, if the net-zero emission targets are to be achieved by 2050 to 2070 at least $500 billion annually would be needed. Further, because of the intransigence of the developed world the scope for opening of adequate space for carbon trade is still an issue. The developed world had failed to recognize and accept their historical responsibility for emissions in the past and on the contrary in each COP they pressurise the developing world to opt for impractical conditions. Thus, the question of equity and differential responsibility always gets side l"

Floods have always been a part of Rajendra's life. However, their intensity and irregularity have increased in the recent past.This is not just the story of Rajendra in Supaul, Bihar, but that of several Rajendras across the globe who are dealing with various pressures that climate change is putting on us.The recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has highlighted that the planet is collapsing. It states that even in the most optimistic scenarios, the temperature post-2080 is likely to be higher by 1.0degC to 1.8degC.Such a temperature rise would lead to massive destruction globally, with rising seawater levels resulting in floods in various parts of the world, collapsing ecosystems and havoc wrought on humankind in general. In such a state, what is the case for optimism?Climate adaptation has emerged as a ray of hope for innumerable communities to fight climate change. Unfortunately though, climate adaptation is always seen as the second-best alternative when it comes to climate action.Adaptation financeIt was in the city of Copenhagen (2009) that leaders of developed countries committed to mobilising $100 billion per year to finance climate action in developing countries. The goal that was formalised in Cancun (2010) and later reiterated in Paris (2015), remains unfulfilled.A recent report by Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development highlights that in 2019, total climate finance mobilised by developed countries was to the tune of $79.6 billion.An additional jump of $20 billion would be required to meet the $100 billion goal. Looking at the figure more closely, we see that mitigation and adaptation finance have both risen significantly post the adoption of the Paris accord. However, despite this increase, adaptation finance still represents only a third of total climate finance.Quest for hopeThe 26th Conference of Parties (CoP26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change begins October 31, 2021. It is prudent to recognise that climate adaptation is no longer a future story.The climate impact stories we have been listening to for years are occurring in reality, in various developed and developing countries. While developed countries possess the critical technologies and finance to increase their adaptive capacities and reduce their vulnerabilities, developing countries often bear the most damage.In addition to the availability of accessible finance, it is critical to make the available finance more sustainable in terms of the implementation timeframe. Currently, most of the finance is mobilised for 1-3 years, these need to be made more long-term and goal-oriented.Another critical factor for effective utilisation of adaptation finance is the correct usage of funds. For effective adaptation, funds must be directed to the local communities that are the most vulnerable and are experiencing higher climate risks as compared to others.Local communities, with individuals like Rajendra, who have limited access to resources, are often the ones that are given the least funds to cope with the risks of climate change. Thus, it is vital to understand how adaptation finance flows to the community level to ensure that their needs are met.Even with the latest developments with respect to CoP26, it is unstated but evident that climate mitigation, ie net zero, is £ sanguine' option for many countries. The leaders from tdeveloping nations participating at CoP26 must not blindly echo their voices with developed nations.Instead, they must emphasise equitable billing of the climate actions of both. The opinion of developing countries must reflect the stories of thousands like 'Rajendra' who are suffering in silence because of climate change.Tarun is a researcher at ICRIERViews expressed are the author's own and don't necessarily reflect those of Down To EarthClimate Equity Intergovernmental . cop26 Glasgow Developed Countries Climate Change IndiaPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Down to Earth.

But, against the odds, the summit produced the goods on several important aspects of international climate policy.It resolved tricky outstanding issues for implementing the Paris Agreement. And most importantly, it reinforced the multilateral consensus that much stronger climate action is needed in both the short and long term.Here's a preliminary interpretation of some of the decisions at COP26 on climate change mitigation, and the implications for Australia.Some were unhappy with the COP26 outcome, but it created momentum for change. Alastair Grant/AP Coal power ""phase down""Global climate negotiations are usually a relentless grind, with occasional fireworks. One such firework moment came in the final session when India, supported by China, demanded the Glasgow Climate Pact's language on coal should be weakened from ""phase-out"" to ""phasedown"" of unabated coal power.To prevent the disagreement scuttling the entire deal, the revision was agreed to, despite bitter protests by many countries intent on stronger action.The wording of United Nations agreements is cumbersome, but deliberate. Here's the full reference to coal in the final COP26 text. It calls on the parties to the Paris Agreement to:accelerate the development, deployment and dissemination of technologies, and the adoption of policies, to transition towards low-emission energy systems, including by rapidly scaling up the deployment of clean power generation and energy efficiency measures, including accelerating efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal power and phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, while providing targeted support to the poorest and most vulnerable in l"

That is why India upped its commitment to the cause of saving the planet before demanding others to do their bitThe recently concluded 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (CoP26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Glasgow proved to be a success from India's standpoint.India emerged on the world stage as a global power, walking the talk on combating climate change, voicing concerns of the developing world and leading international initiatives to drive change in building an environmentally sustainable world.Prime Minister Narendra Modi reminded the world while delivering the National Statement at CoP26 that despite being 17 per cent of the world's population, India has been responsible for only five per cent of its emissions.The PM announced India's commitment to 'Panchamrit' from the CoP26 stage: India will bring its non-fossil energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030. India will bring its economy's carbon intensity down to 45 per cent by 2030. The country will fulfil 50 per cent of its energy requirement through renewable energy by 2030. India will reduce one billion tonnes of carbon emissions from the total projected emissions by 2030. India will achieve Net Zero by 2070.While India did its bit, the country also reminded the Global North of its unfulfilled commitments.India told the world while we all are raising our ambitions on climate action, the world's ambitions on climate finance cannot remain the same as they were at the time of the 2015 Paris Agreement. The PM, during his address at the World Leader's Summit said: ""India expects developed countries to provide climate finance of $1 trillion at the earliest.""PM Modi launched the Infrastructure for Resilient Island States (IRIS), which will work to achieve sustainable development through a systematic approach to promote resilient, sustainable and inclusive infrastructure in Small Island Developing States.A major boost for India-initiated International Solar Alliance (ISA) came when US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry announced at the UNFCCC COP26 that the United States has joined the ISA as a member country. The membership of ISA thus rose to 101.India also launched the Green Grids Initiative-One Sun One World One Grid (GGI-OSOWOG) along with the UK.GGI-OSOWOG will bring technical, financial and research cooperation to help facilitate cross-border renewable energy transfer projects, which will provide OSOWOG its global infrastructure.CoP26 was successful in alerting the world to the climate crisis and securing commitments from all towards 'keeping 1.5 degrees alive' and accelerated action towards mid-century global Net Zero.Developing countries have, for the first time, been able to bring in a language that 'notes with deep regret' the failure of the developed countries to deliver the promised climate finance.India made strong interventions throughout regarding climate finance in CoP26, including making written submissions and securing support from developing countries.As a result, the standing committee in finance has been mandated by CoP to work towards definitions of climate finance, so that the wide range of numbers in climate finance can be resolved.Under the Paris Agreement, we need a new collective quantified goal (NCQG). A structured process through a work programme has been launched for working on the NCQG that will complete its work by 2024.The work programme will consider the needs of developing countries, call for submissions from parties and experts, undertake technical work and then give its recommendations.This is a big step forward towards forcing the hand of developed countries to realise that there has to be a NCQG by 2025 and this goal must come through a structured process under CoP.India and other developing countries were also successful in keeping the agenda of long-term finance under the convention alive till the year 2027, while developed countries wanted to end this agenda under the convention.India was supportive of the enhanced transparency framework but remained firm that there must be assured and adequate climate finance provision for fulfilling enhanced reporting needs.India was successful in getting language inserted regarding support from GEF (Global Environment Facility) to developing countries for ETF (Enhanced Transparency Framework).On markets, Article 6 has been finally resolved in a balanced manner that takes into account the concerns of developing countries. Article 6 of the Paris Agreement provides for market and non-market approaches in achieving nationally determined contributions (NDC).Parties in Glasgow finally adopted the long pending Article 6 rulebook. There are always compromises in negotiations, but India, along with other developing countries, managed to convince developed countries to agree for a transition of pre-2020 projects / activities and units from the Clean Development Mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol.We were firm on our position to help our private sector that has invested in reduction of emissions and generated Certified Emission Reductions under the Clean Development Mechanism and ensured that the private sectors' trust in the UNFCCC processes is not diluted.The Article 6 market mechanisms will play a crucial role in driving investments from private and public enterprises into India and help us in achieving our mitigation and adaptation targets. Most countries have mentioned the use of such markets for achieving their NDC targets.Under Article 6.2, India set the terms for accounting of units outside the NDC. Our call for countries to have flexibility in defining what is inside and outside out the country's NDC was accepted. Corresponding adjustments based on the authorisation of projects helps us, as it gives us additional flexibility while maintaining the quality of units. The nationally determined nature of accounting remains and that is a positive outcome for India.In addition, the countries are strongly encouraged to commit to contribute resources for adaptation and to cancel Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes to deliver an overall mitigation in global emissions. These measures will further help in achieving emission reductions globally.Under Article 6.4, we were able to secure the transition of clean development mechanism projects, activities and units. Further, we also negotiated strongly to have these top-down markets aligned firmly with the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and equity.Under Article 6.8, the adoption of work programme for non-market approaches will help developing countries in relation to, inter alia, mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity-building.The conclusion of Article 6 lays the ground for participation of the private sector in the new carbon markets that will emerge under the Paris Agreement. On adaptation, a two-year work programme has been launched on the global goal, which was a big demand of developing countries.A collaborative and not competitive, approach alone can save our planet. The time for blame games has long ended. And that is why India upped its commitment to the cause of saving the planet before demanding others to do their bit.On the whole, CoP26 has had a positive outcome. Countries, as part of the agreement, have also agreed to meet next year in Cairo to discuss further carbon cuts so that the goal to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius can be reached. India looks forward to working with the world in finding sustainable and equitable solutions.The writer is Union Cabinet Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change; and Labour & Employment, Government of IndiaGlasgow cop 26 glasgow glasgow declaration glasgow breakthroughs. bhupender yadav Ministry of . narendra modi Climate Change IndiaPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Down to Earth.

IFAD will be there, calling for greater investments in climate adaptation and we will be giving the floor to rural small-scale producers to share their own experiences and solutions.These producers are the foundation of the worlds food systems and the custodians of its resources. They produce one third of global food while working to protect their lands and livelihoods against the changing climate. In developing countries, their role is even bigger. Yet they remain greatly underserved by climate finance, receiving only 1.7 per cent of global funding flows, and they seldom have a voice at international forums.At COP26Solutions exist for small-scale farmers to adapt to climate change, but substantial investments are urgently needed. Earlier this week, IFAD warned that staple crops in Africa are at risk from rising temperatures and that will fail to achieve a lasting impact if world leaders continue to neglect investments in climate adaptation.COP26 is our call to act, said Dr Jo Puri, Associate Vice-President of IFADs Strategy and Knowledge Management Department, who leads IFADs climate change work. It may be our last chance to control runaway climate change and to prepare for the effects of warming on billions of people. It is also happening as we rebuild from the COVID-19 pandemic just as were poised to rethink normal ways of working. This is our chance to work together for a global green recovery that takes into account the needs of marginalized people.COP26, also known as the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, will bring together world leaders in government, science, business and civil society to discuss the state of the changing climate and determine the actions needed to adapt and mitigate. Many countries are poised to re-commit to their Nationally Determined Contributions towards global climate finance, and the pressure to make large-scale positive change is at an all-time high.As the world turns its attention to the challenges before us, IFAD is ready to put rural small-scale producers where they belong: at the heart of these discussions. Supporting these producers against the many challenges they face has cascading benefits that will put us on the path to meeting both the humanitarian and environmental goals of the 2030 Agenda.\l"

At peak operation, the rail freight park has the capacity to save over 200,00 tonnes of carbon per year, supporting a transition to a zero-carbon economy.The naming ceremony formed part of the Lets Talk about Rail Freight day at the Low Carbon Logistics event, developed to support the UK and Scottish Governments vision for a zero-carbon supply chain at COP26 and was unveiled by Billy Stirlings daughter, Julie Corr. Low Carbon Logistics is a three-day event committed to raising the profile and awareness of low carbon transition in the rail and road freight sectors, providing the opportunity to celebrate innovation and promote the importance of Pulling Together for Net Zero.As the third generation of the 151-year-old family-owned operator, Peter D. Stirling Limited, Billy Stirling introduced rail involvement into the company. Following this success, the Peter D. Stirling operation moved to Mossend Railhead in 1981. Under Billys guidance, the operator continued to thrive, resulting in the MIPR of present day.Class 92s are the most powerful electric locomotives in the UK, with the ability to work all over the electrified network as well as through the Channel Tunnel in France. They have been specially converted for operation of Caledonian Sleeper vehicles.Tim Hartley, Business Development Director of GB Railfreight, said: Billy Stirling was a true pioneer of the modern rail freight market in Scotland and played a vital role in the UKs economic prosperity. Its great to see his legacy live on through the next generation of the Stirling family and the development of a major new low carbon, multi-modal rail freight facility in MIRP.David Stirling, Managing Director of Peter D. Stirling Limited, said: The whole Stirling family is very pleased that our father, Billy Stirlings hard work in building up the business has been recognised in such a magnificent way . His name is now attached to one of the strongest and greenest electric freight locomotives around something he would have been very proud of.\l"

Ive always been passionate about recycling and keeping things out of landfill, so I made a case to our facilities team about doing things a bit differently. SLC was really supportive, and I started a 10-year long project of sorting all the wallets we received into those we could reuse and those we could recycle. We have since donated 73 kilos of pristine plastic wallets to, among others, Darlington College and to our community hospice: reducing our impact on the environment and saving some money for these local organisations too.My colleagues in Darlington know all about my passion for reducing waste. I do not support mass-produced Christmas decorations which leave a big carbon footprint and fill up landfill sites.

"COP26","India","COP26_India434","COP26: Nature-based solutions win on ground too","November 9, 2021 Tuesday","IANS-English","Glasgow, Nov 9 (IANS) Weather-related disasters have increased fivefold in the past 50 years alone, but humanity, and especially vulnerable communities, is only starting to adapt to the new reality of weather extremes. As the global community discusses different adaptation options at COP26 in Glasgow, the United Nations University -- Institute for Environment and Human Security (UNU-EHS) and World Food Programme (WFP) on Tuesday called for a better integration of nature-based solutions into adaptation planning. The recently-launched UNU-EHS flagship report ""Interconnected Disaster Risks"" illustrates the interconnectivity of disasters around the world, making it clear that interconnected solutions, such as nature-based solutions, deserve more attention. ""Science is clear on the fact that nature-based solutions not only address climate change, they also reduce disaster risk, biodiversity loss and food insecurity in an integrated way,"" said Jack O'Connor, Senior Scientist at UNU-EHS. For example, in Bangladesh, one of the most cyclone-affected countries in the world, numerous projects are underway to protect and restore coastal ecosystems, primarily mangrove forests. Ecosystems like mangrove forests not only strengthen coastal protection against cyclones and rising sea levels, but they also store atmospheric carbon and contribute to local livelihoods as they are home to fish, crabs, and clams. Nature-based solutions are also proving their value in the humanitarian context. From 2014 to 2019, the World Food Programme has worked with vulnerable communities to rehabilitate 1.5 million hectares of degraded land and forests, and has established 54,000 ponds, wells and communal reservoirs. ""Nature itself is often the best way to protect both people and the planet. Rehabilitating ecosystems helps to reduce people's vulnerability to climate shocks and stresses while also protecting biodiversity and promoting social cohesion,"" said Gernot Laganda, Chief of Climate and Disaster Risk Reduction Programmes at WFP. Despite there now being widespread consensus that nature-based solutions need to be considered in adaptation planning, their potential is still largely untapped. ""Nature-based solutions efforts today focus disproportionately on forest ecosystems and specifically on tree planting. The Glasgow Leaders' Declaration on Forests and Land Use, which was adopted at COP26 to end and reverse deforestation by 2030, is an example of that,"" Zita Sebesvari, Deputy Director at UNU-EHS, said. ""While the declaration is a much-welcomed step, we need to go beyond forests and look also for example at grasslands, peatlands, marshes and marine ecosystems, all of which build on the rich diversity of ecosystems for adaptation, disaster risk reduction and biodiversity."" While nature-based solutions win both in science and on the ground, they can only fully develop their full potential if they are designed as integrated solutions and in combination with other safety nets -- for example, climate risk insurance or forecast-based financing. Over the long-term, planting or protecting forests can only be an effective climate adaptation measure if this gets complemented by actions that also relieve the environmental and social pressures which led to their destruction in the first place. Communities which face hunger and poverty may be forced to cut down trees to clear land for agricultural use or to generate income from the wood. To be truly effective, an integrated resilience programme would therefore combine nature-based solutions with social and financial protection schemes. Initiatives such as WFP's R4 Rural Resilience Initiative take an integrated approach by combining landscape restoration with access to micro insurance and financial services, while UNU-EHS works with partners to develop and introduce climate risk insurance products for individuals and communities in the Caribbean and Pacific regions. These kinds of integrated approaches increase the likelihood of success for climate adaptation strategies by reducing vulnerability to the increasing impacts of climate change. As world leaders at COP26 discuss ways to build back better from the Covid-19 pandemic and are focused on pulling back from the brink of a climate disaster, integrating nature-based solutions into the overall adaptation strategy must be at the centre of the discussion.

Last week we were asked to sign one such consent form. Speaking through the school administration, the Delhi government gave us a choice: Would you like to send your child to school? Do you consent - after 19 dark months - to school mornings, lunch boxes, running through corridors, wearing the prefect badge, whispers and gossip, some real learning? Do you consent to exposing your unvaccinated child out there into the city? If yes, then sign a consent form and let your child wear your consent on their sleeves every morning.We lost no time in saying yes. A fearful, what-if but resounding yes! Despite the raw wounds of the past year and half, we placed our trust in the system. My seven-year-old played scrabble with GOVERNMENT. I drew for her a flow chart of democracy and governance. Grade six chose to discuss the Indian Constitution and history of human rights.On the first day of school, turn out was less than 10 per cent. Timetables were disrupted since hybrid teaching must take into account long gaps between lessons. But the children, our dear faithfuls, played to their heart's content and birds sang once again.Far North, up at COP 26,world leaders played their games. Tall promises were made only to be broken the next day. We will phase down and not phase out. If you want an inch, first give us a mile. What about history? What about relative wealth? As they squabbled and Greta summed it up - blah, blah and blah, Delhi air turned poisonous. The AQI touched 600, 12 times the safe threshold. Mornings smelt like 1,000 cigarettes. As shopping malls thrived, factories around Delhi kept spewing their venom, swanky cars pulled out of showrooms, the Central Vista project stirred up a cloud of dust and felled trees with full impunity, to atone for the sins of Titans, the schools were ordered to shut down. Gardens fell silent again. Winter came early.With frozen hearts, our children are back in front of their screens and we wonder if we could make our elected leaders sign a consent form. How would it be worded? Do you consent to being liable for a life term or a penalty of several million dollars if you fail at the office? Do you consent to being court martialed? Do you consent that your time at the office will be as per our terms? At home we build a Lego tower called COP26, installing in it paper cut-outs of leaders who we called by name. There is learning and catharsis in bringing down that tower, block by block, in tearing apart the leaders and reminding ourselves collectively the history of injustice. Meanwhile, in Glasgow, yet another pact is signed and consentless we are doomed to the rising seas, heatwaves and a waterless wasteland. In 50 years where will our children be? Will they adapt and learn to remain indoors, sunless, boxed in? Will air be home delivered in Amazon boxes or arrive parcelled in JIO cables?According to Save the Children, in the two weeks that the COP26 negotiations were being held, more than 5 million babies were born into a world where they will face seven times as many heatwaves, 2.6 more droughts, and three times as many crop failures as their grandparents. Days after India pledged to Net Zero by 2070, we learnt that zero is not a number; it is a symbol of our moral superiority and oratorship. Experts and climate watchers have called the Glasgow deal Earth's suicide pact. This was our chance to reverse the dangerous slide, turn back from the tipping point and it was squandered away. Earth systems will now overshoot safe limits and pass on to a perpetually hostile state. To remind the world leaders that they are a greedy selfish lot, children were to have a seat at the table. UNICEF UK has said that they were ""repeatedly told by young people who attended COP26 that they were not getting into the rooms they needed to be in due to event access restrictions and accessibility. What was needed and deserved by children and young people was a seat at the table to inform the decisions being made that directly affect their lives and futures. Sadly... COP26 fell short of this"". Naked Emperors who want no stray questions popping their gosammer nudity, shut out the children.Be it the recent chapters of Fridays for Future, Steve Rocha's band of warriors who have been holding children's parliament for years, or school projects on the burning of Amazon forests, climate activism is the new bicycle. Children must learn to ride whether or not the city has a bicycle track. Awareness is not enough anymore. Nor a well-roused conscience. It is time for children to take action to pay for the price of our inaction. A climate action-based school curriculum could be the start, depending on who writes the curriculum.If we let our political leaders have their say, there will be multiple choice questions on fossil fuel and quizzes on the woolly mammoth. It certainly will not be a toolkit for reversal. One year into the pandemic, UNESCO had projected that close to half the world's students are still affected by partial or full school closures. Over 100 million additional children will fail to recover their learning loss or never return to school. Perhaps we are headed for a post-school age, one in which curriculums will emerge from droughts, floods and thunderstorms. Meanwhile, as schools remain shut to make the Naked Emperors look dapper, let the alleyways fill up with climate bicycles. Let us consent to not give consent.The author is a writer with a day job in global policy\l"
"COP26","India","COP26_India436","United Kingdom : Reflecting On COP26 From A Payments Perspective","November 19, 2021 Friday","TendersInfo","In this post, Matt Jones, MYPINPADs Head of Sales, EMEA reflects on this years annual United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP26 from a payments perspective.Looking back at the COP26 summitAs climate change continues to move up the agenda of not just policy makers, but also the wider public, many of us were glued to watching the events unfold at this years annual United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP26.On an almost daily basis we are presented with information on the day-to-day impact of climate change from various voices including those of young activists, to representatives from Pacific Islands, highlighting real life stories that show the detrimental effects associated with the shifts in temperatures and weather patterns across the globe.As such, during COP26, world leaders came together to discuss how collectively, we can all work together to meet the objective of preventing temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees` Celsius from pre-industrial levels. Whilst it is evident some progress has been made with several countries committing to decarbonise more quickly than previous years, as well as establishing a new agreement on ending deforestation by 2030, and new funding committed to help developing nations adapt to climate change overall there is much still to do.To achieve the global climate change objectives, every single person across the globe must play their part where they feasibly can. For instance, in the UK sales of electric cars have jumped by 186 per cent to 108,000 in 2020 (Exclusive: UK electric car market in top speed as sales jump 186 per cent during pandemic by MICHIEL WILLEMS, CITY A.M.), up from just 38,000 in 2019. This combined with changing attitudes towards flying internationally caused by lockdowns, means domestic, shorter flights have taken precedence which will have significant impact on the reduction of carbon emissions.The challenge of e-wasteAs it stands, electronic waste (e-waste) continues to grow year-on-year. United Nations data forecasts that e-waste will reach 74.7 million tons by 2030 (Global E-waste Monitor 2020, ITU), almost double the 2014 figure. Many electronic devices require rare earth minerals such as cobalt used in batteries to be mined; this has an adverse environmental impact, and additionally electronic devices may contain components such as mercury which are harmful to human health and the environment if not disposed of in an environmentally sound manner.So how does the global progress towards action against climate change link to the dynamic world of payments? Well, traditional card payments in a face-to-face environment requires every organisation from large retailers to market stall traders to buy specific hardware in order to take payments from members of the public. In a traditional brick-and-mortar environment POS (Point of Sale) machines have been integrated into POS systems as standard, and small traders have had either a standalone POS machine or an mPOS (mobile Point of Sale) device.Up to this point in time, face-to-face payments have been based on merchants purchasing hardware specifically to take payments; these payment devices often form part of a complex global supply chain, which may have a significant increase to carbon footprint. In addition, many feature printers that use thermal paper which can be hazardous to the environment.Cue SoftPOS (Software Point of Sale). The revolutionary software-based technology, sometimes known as Tap on Phone, that entirely does away with the need for additional specific hardware in order for a business to take payments and provide digital receipts further reducing unnecessary and harmful waste.Consumer devices as a payments terminalOver the past few years, new standards have been developed by the PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC). PCI SSC set the global security standards for card payments, and these new standards have allowed face-to-face payment capability to move from specialised payment devices to standard commercial devices.In 2022, we expect a new standard to be released to the market, known as the working title MPoC Mobile Payments on Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) device. The terminology off-the-shelf here indicates that the payment device is simply a regular smartphone or tablet, which can be purchased by any consumer or merchant and transformed into a payment POS device by downloading software from the relevant app store.The MPoC standard will allow for a greater breadth and depth of PCI Certifiable SoftPOS solutions to enter the market, and further grow the reach of these solutions. In the meantime, the existing CPoC standard (Contactless Payments on Commercial off-the-shelf device), is growing in popularity month on month as banks, merchants and payment integrators are looking to deploy solutions that do not require management of a large inventory of payment specific POS hardware.The road aheadOverall, if we are to meet our target of net zero emissions by 2050 (agreed to by many countries) and prevent temperatures rising by no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, action must be taken to transition to a world with more mobile POS acceptance than ever before. Traditional POS terminals will become less and less common, and merchants accepting payments via standard smartphones and tablets will become the norm in many sectors/use cases in the years ahead.As the payments industry continues to evolve at pace, the need for payment specific hardware will diminish, and we will potentially be able to contribute to reducing electronic waste. These days with most phone manufacturers having authorised formal recycling programmes, when we do upgrade our mobile COTS devices, everyone can do their part in recycling old unused devices appropriately and be proud of the positive environmental impact we can collectively make.\l"

Here's a snapshot of what went on at the event November 3, 2021. November 3 was CoP26 Finance Day - where financial firms with assets together worth over $130 trillion sought to align global assets with the Paris Agreement. But the announcements by private finance firms were criticised on the grounds of failing to stop investments in fossil fuels. The pledges were made through the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, or GFANZ, chaired by former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney. The United States and United Arab Emirates announced the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM4C) initiative to invest in ""climate smart agriculture"" through an investment of $4 billion. It welcomes tech giants to get involved in agriculture tech and agribusiness and critics have raised the alarm that it will exclude farmers. France and Poland pushed for the inclusion of fossil gas and nuclear in ""sustainable energy"" in the EU taxonomy [classification] on sustainable finance. The taxonomy will determine how at least &#8364;1 trillion ($1.1 trillion) of investment will be spent, to help reduce EU carbon emissions by 55 per cent by 2030. The International Emissions Trading Association (IETA) had representatives of Chevron, Shell and BP in their delegation despite earlier news that fossil fuel companies would not have representation at CoP26. In discussions on finance, developing countries underscored the importance of the predictability of finance, consideration of developing countries' needs and priorities and and a multilaterally agreed definition of climate finance. The new collective finance goal was also discussed.

The special Clean Nuclear Energy Day programme was made possible with ROSATOMs support. Taking place at the pavilion of the Russian Federation, the programme focused on the role of nuclear energy in the fight against climate change and in implementing the UNs sustainable development goals. In his video greeting, IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi noted the significant contribution of nuclear energy a clean and reliable source of energy to decarbonisation.The days key event was a panel discussion on the importance of nuclear energy in achieving both global and national carbon neutrality goals. The discussion was attended by representatives of leading nuclear energy companies and organisations, including ROSATOMs First Deputy Director General for Development and International Business Kirill Komarov, Director General of the World Nuclear Association Sama Bilbao-y-Leon, CEO of the Rolls-Royce-led SMR Consortium Tom Samson, and EDF Chief Sustainability Officer Carine de Boissezon.In his address, Kirill Komarov noted why countries are embracing the peaceful use of the atom: The majority of big economies in the world decided to develop nuclear. This is due to two reasons. One, nuclear is a source of energy with the lowest CO2 emissions even compared to renewable sources of energy. Second, nuclear is a very reliable and sustainable source of energy. Komarov also noted what a long way the nuclear industry has come over the past few years, saying: Its a very positive sign that were here at COP26 talking about nuclear. Just five years ago at COP22, in Morocco, it was very difficult to have any nuclear talks.Bilbao y Len emphasised the importance of addressing nuclear finance issues this year: It is absolutely vital to secure finance for the nuclear projects. We are trying to map all the different ESG finance initiatives to understand how nuclear technology fits in all these ESG and climate change efforts.Speaking at a session titled 'Inclusive Human Resources Strategies for the Nuclear Sector: Balanced Diversity,' ROSATOMs Deputy Director General for Human Resources Tatyana Terentyeva highlighted ROSATOMs efforts in developing its personnel, implementing international academic initiatives, attracting and supporting young specialists, and ensuring equal opportunities for all employees an integral part of achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The impact that nuclear technology has on the climate agenda allows us to attract the best workforce to the industry, which is crucial for young people. Now, at COP26, we can hear the voice of youth in global discussions. We, as an employer, try to support the interests of each employee. One of our most important corporate goals is, therefore, to provide equal opportunities for all and guarantee long-term professional growth for every single one of our employees, she said.Boris Arseev, ROSATOMs Director of the Department of International Business, partook in a discussion on the contribution of non-energy nuclear solutions to achieving the UNs sustainable development goals and to solving the global food problem. Every year, people throw away about 1.3 billion tonnes of food. Basically, it is one third of food production over the world. Food irradiation increases the shelf life of foodstuff two to tenfold by destroying up to 99% of malignant bacteria and viruses, he said.Clean Nuclear Energy Day participants were given a unique opportunity to visit the Leningrad and Beloyarsk nuclear power plants virtually and to see firsthand these important Russian nuclear facilities from the inside. As part of the tour of the Beloyarsk NPP, the audience had the opportunity to understand ROSATOMs approaches to closing the nuclear cycle.

"COP26","India","COP26_India449","COP26 and the road ahead","November 21, 2021 Sunday","Assam Tribune (India)","Guwahati, Nov. 21 -- The threat of ever-rising temperatures, melting of icecaps, drought, flooding and cyclones should jolt us out of our sleep and make us realize that these erratic changes in climatic patterns presage a very dangerous and unpredictable turn in the future. There is no denying the devastating consequences of climate change and the entire world is reeling under some of that impact from right now. Tamil Nadu, most particularly Chennai, has experienced one of the worst floodings in many years inundating major roads, disrupting connectivity and essentially bringing the entire city to a standstill. Delhi's air quality has deteriorated to the point that the Arvind Kejriwal-led Government is now considering imposing lockdowns to bring down pollution levels. Flooding has become a perennial problem in Kerala and Assam and these changes point to a much larger prospect of terrible days to come in the future. This year alone, several European countries bore the brunt of nature's wrath, with severe flooding causing massive destruction across much of Europe culminating in the loss of lives and livelihoods.With the threat of climate change looming ever larger and the world gradually reconciling to the need for an agreed-upon set of structures to reverse the trend, the G20 summit held at Rome has directed much of its attention towards chalking out strategies and building consensus to mount a unanimous shield against global warming. Prime Minister Narendra Modi interacted with world leaders and spoke at length about the long, arduous and continuing fight against Covid-19, the need to fight economic disparity, the importance of 'one earth, one health vision', and also inviting other world powers to involve India in economic recovery. India has endeavoured to orient its climate goals in tandem with the Paris climate pact, adopted at COP21 in Paris. India's dependence on coal and fossil fuels is huge and to phase out fossil fuel usage would require greater preparedness and a well-charted plan to soften the economic blowback. India's economy is gradually limping back to normalcy from the impact of Covid-19, further complicating an already delicate situation and putting India at cross-purposes with the precepts of a global consensus.The Climate Conference (COP26) hosted in Glasgow, Scotland offered an excellent platform to brainstorm on a range of issues allowing for a greater consensus over a plethora of problems sprinkled with creative solutions. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured that India will achieve net-zero emissions by 2070, bring non-fossil energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030, fulfil 50% of its energy requirement through renewable energy by 2030, reduce one billion tonnes of carbon emissions and bring its economy's carbon intensity down to 45% by 2030. However, it is going to be quite a challenge to meet the demand for energy creation as India is still largely dependent on coal and petroleum products and the transition to solar, nuclear and other renewable sources of energy would require huge investment, planning and also time. His emphasis on climate justice seeking the developed countries to contribute 1% of their GDP to finance green projects in developing countries offers him the bargaining chip in fulfilling his promised objectives. There couldn't have been any better timing to make a case for India's inclusion as a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group to facilitate access to raw material for nuclear supply. India has always been steadfast and open in terms of its nuclear power availability and usage, sufficient to earn global credibility and appropriate acknowledgement of its integrity. India's problems are unique and therefore demand well-thought-out strategies striking a balance between economic imperatives and climate-related challenges. One of India's major central flagship schemes, MGNREGA, has hit a major hurdle with funds drying up leading to delays in payments to the workers who have benefited from the scheme.The global hunger index, jointly prepared by Irish aid agency Concern Worldwide and German organization Welt Hunger Hilfe, has placed India way down the hierarchy at the 101st position, putting India even behind countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal. Given the litany of challenges India faces, its refusal to sign up to a Leaders' Declaration on ending deforestation by 2030 at the COP26 climate summit has to be viewed through a lens of utmost necessity. India's refusal to adhere to the reduction of methane gas emissions by 2030 also underscores India's dependence on a large livestock population providing employment to millions through trade in livestock. India should focus on upgrading its livestock through appropriate breeding policies and work on reducing the population of non-descript cattle that produce little in terms of milk yield and are sources of methane gas production. Nonetheless, India has been part of the 27 countries that have agreed to sign a sustainable agriculture action agenda in a bid to make farming less polluting and more sustainable. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has launched the India-led solar green grids initiative in partnership with the United States and the United Kingdom with the formation of a steering committee of Green Grids Initiative, 'One Sun, One World, One Grid' (GGIOSOWOG), also having roped in Australia and France, conceptualizing a vision of One Sun, One World, One Grid, with over 80 countries brought in its fold that is committed to creating more interconnected grids.The final draft of the Glasgow (COP26) decision in which India preferred to stick with 'phase down' instead of 'phase out' has drawn flak from a large number of developed countries questioning India's commitment to tackling climate change. However, the government sources maintain that 'phase down' of unabated coal was not India's language and was introduced by the US and China, calling it unfair to criticize India over the weakening of the wording. Also, the damage done by the pandemic in economic terms is unimaginable and current problems plaguing India such as unemployment and inflation need to be balanced with the structural changes and also some of the repercussions that go along with it.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Assam Tribune.

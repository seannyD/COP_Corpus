They will set the course for action on climate change by discussing the implementation plan for the HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/uk/topics/paris-agreement-23382 2015 Paris Agreement The COPs receive significant media attention and, sometimes, even HYPERLINK notable public interest In 2018 the negotiations kick off barely two months after a HYPERLINK http://www.ipcc.ch/report/sr15/ report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned that the international community only has a 12-year window to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Clearly, 24 years after the first COP there is a HYPERLINK https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/global-warming-gridlock/C3CA34B8CF61FAAB6929ABF98FDF965E deep disconnect between how urgently the world needs effective climate policy and the pace of discussing global mechanisms on how to abate greenhouse gas emissions. A history of failure The first COP meetings held in the 1990s led to the creation of the HYPERLINK Kyoto Protocol in 1997, which set binding emissions targets for developed countries over two ""commitment periods"" (2008-2012 and 2013-2020). However, the Kyoto agreement failed as the US did not ratify it and because several inconclusive conferences followed its implementation. COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009 also failed to yield any agreement on binding commitments for the second commitment period. A few major countries agreed to a short accord recognising the need to limit global temperature rises to 2\'b0C, but there were no substantial guidelines on how to do so. Similarly, COP19 in Warsaw four years later did not finalise any binding treaty. It only recognised ""a flexible ruling"" on differentiated responsibilities and loss and damage. In Warsaw, HYPERLINK http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2013/12/11/the-latest-un-climate-change-conference-in-warsaw-highlighted-the-role-that-smaller-states-can-play-in-negotiations/ the international community failed HYPERLINK http://climatetracker.org/cop24-katowice-expect-polands-4th-un-climate-summit/ cast some doubt on the capacity of the Polish government to successfully lead COP24 in 2018. Against this backdrop, COP21 in Paris in 2015 appeared to generate the most optimistic outcome in two decades of international climate negotiations. In Paris, the world leaders agreed on a general action plan that legally binds countries to have their progress tracked by technical experts. The countries who signed up also agreed on a ""global stocktake"" - a process for reviewing collective progress towards achieving the long-term goals of the agreement. However, lots of details about the Paris Agreement still have to be nailed down. This is precisely what the international community seeks to do this December in Poland. The focus of COP24 and the likely outcomes The major objective for COP24 is to agree upon the so-called Paris ""rulebook"" - the details of how nations should implement the Paris Agreement and report their progress. Three major areas of political discussion will receive most attention: finance, emission targets, and the role of ""big"" states. Finance In 2015, richer countries pledged HYPERLINK https://www.wri.org/news/2016/10/statement-developed-countries%25E2%2580%2599-roadmap-shows-path-100-billion-climate-finance-goal US$100 billion a year by 2020 https://www.ft.com/content/cbce4e2e-ee5b-11e8-89c8-d36339d835c0 US$20 billion short COP24 delegates will need to discuss in more detail on when the rest of the money will be generated before committing to the rulebook. Perhaps even more importantly, rules for where that money comes from, and particularly whether international loans are acceptable, still have to be agreed on. Because finance is closely linked to issues of justice and fairness in the international system, it is unlikely that this discussion will lead to more generous levels of climate aid - although there is space for improvement, and some past conferences have actually provided HYPERLINK http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2013/12/11/the-latest-un-climate-change-conference-in-warsaw-highlighted-the-role-that-smaller-states-can-play-in-negotiations/ small but significant advances Emission targets COP24 also needs to set some form of flexible yet comparable rules that will govern the Paris Agreement. One groundbreaking feature of the Paris Agreement is that all parties agreed to commit to national contributions to climate action. In other words, the agreement is based on a bottom-up process in which countries largely determine their own contributions, and then act upon them. This COP may settle on some basic strategies for verifying climate actions, but it is very unlikely that the international community will agree on any mechanisms for delivering sanctions to states that do not meet their targets, because of the high sensitivity towards HYPERLINK http://www.pnas.org/content/110/34/13763 financial costs for non-abatement The role of 'big' states Finally, while ""small"" countries will have an important role to play at the negotiations HYPERLINK as usual , there are several question marks around the large countries that need to bear a lot of the efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions. It will not help that President Donald Trump, who intends to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement, decided in 2017 to HYPERLINK cancel climate funding for poor nations . The US position at COP24 will also affect China and India, which are likely to continue \~ HYPERLINK http://www.climatechangenews.com/2017/11/08/china-wont-back-indian-calls-climate-talks-pressure-rich-countries/ disagreeing with rich countries on some fundamental issues.

Looking ahead from COP24 The urgency to reach key milestones in the Paris Agreement and deal with climate change puts a lot of high expectations on COP24 . Unfortunately, many challenges stand ahead of international climate cooperation. Approaching the negotiations with the right level of reason and determination will be critical to manage expectations and avoid any media ""hysteria"", as media coverage HYPERLINK can hurt the climate talks by shifting attention from the policy issues to unproductive discussions of whether climate change is influenced by humans. For a credible and valid rulebook, we need frank conversations about energy transition and compensating the ""losers"" of climate policies, such as HYPERLINK people working in high-emission sectors . There might be the opportunity to do so in Katowice, an industrial hub and coal-mining city. We will see if this COP will highlight the necessary transition from fossil fuel industry to renewable solutions as the negotiations unravel.

"COP24","Australia","COP24_Australia2","Investors urge more ambition on climate","December 10, 2018 Monday","Australian Financial Review","The response of some governments to the threat of catastrophic climate change has been described as ""zombie-like"" by a top executive from IFM Investors. IFM manages $81 billion on behalf of a range of industry super funds that are flexing their muscles in the wake of the damning findings of the banking royal commission. Former Labor climate change minister Greg Combet is its new chairman. It is one of a group of 441 global investors holding $US32 trillion ($44 trillion) - which also includes Australian Super, CBus and BT Investment Group - and urging governments around the world to match their deeds to their words on the Paris agreement on climate change. ""The reality is that the long-term nature of the challenge has, in our view, met a zombie-like response by many. This is a recipe for disaster as the impacts of climate change can be sudden, severe and catastrophic,"" said Chris Newton, head of responsible investment at IFM Investors. Mr Newton said in Katowice, Poland, where the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ) is taking place, that asset owners had to rise to the challenge because governments were not. ""We need our infrastructure assets to continue to provide essential services to communities and economies around the world. We have a duty to our investors to act for the long term when others are clearly side stepping the challenge,"" he said. Mr Newton's remarks come as environment minister Melissa Price heads to Poland this week for COP24 . Ms Price last week said the government had no intention of increasing its current goal of a 26-28 per cent reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 until 2025, even though emissions have increased to their highest quarterly rate in seven years under the Morrison government. Australia did not join nations such as the United States, Russia, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia in vetoing the adoption by COP24 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's 2018 report, which said a complete phase-out of coal power by 2050 would be needed to limit temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius and avoid irreversible damage such as the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef. But Australia's current emissions targets and policies - like those of many nations - are considered inadequate to meeting the goal. The signatories to the 2018 Global Investor Statement to Governments on Climate Change are concerned that current emissions reduction commitments by governments will not achieve the goal they signed up to in Paris in 2015. Signatories to the Paris pact agreed to do whatever they it took to limit global temperature increases to well below 2 degrees Celsius to prevent irreversible damage to the global economy and natural wonders such as the Great Barrier Reef. Without greater action, Schroders points to long-run temperature rises of around 4 degrees Celsius, with $US23 trillion of associated global economic losses over the next 80 years. This is permanent economic damage three or four times the scale of the impacts of the 2008 global financial crisis. Specific actions sought by the investors include accelerating private sector investment into low-carbon energy, improved climate-related financial reporting, phasing out fossil fuel subsidies and thermal coal power and putting a meaningful price on carbon. Global members of the Investor Group on Climate Change include Schroder, Mercer, Hermes and a string of giant US public sector pension funds from large US states including California and New York. Other Australian funds to sign the include HESTA, Local Government Super, VicSuper, Ausbil and Palisades. \"

The aim of the annual United Nations conference is to determine what collective action the world takes on climate change. More than 100 ministers and more than 1,000 negotiators from around the globe have been hammering out the so-called 'Paris Rulebook' with an eye to defining how pledges will be put into action. In the thick of it all has been the Australian delegation, which has been walking a tightrope between the Paris obligations and support for fossil fuels. In a defining moment at COP24 , protesters disrupted a pro-fossil fuel event on Monday that had been organised by the Trump administration. On stage, the only non-American panellist at the event was Australia's Ambassador for the Environment, Patrick Suckling. ""Fossil fuels are projected to be a source of energy for a significant time to come,"" Mr Suckling said. ""It's critical that new solutions for lower emissions are encouraged and employed."" The Director of the Climate & Energy Program at the Australia Institute, Richie Merzian, believes Australia jeopardised its influence in the COP process by appearing at the US event. ""Everyone picked up on the fact that Australia was on the panel with the Trump appointees,"" Mr Merzian said. ""I think it even made the New York Times and the Washington Post. ""It really damaged, I think, Australia's credibility here."" But the CEO of the Minerals Council of Australia, Tania Constable, disagreed with Mr Merzian's comments. ""Let me lend the Minerals Council's congratulations to the negotiating team,"" Ms Constable said. ""I don't think it has been provocative for Australia to participate with the US on that panel."" Climate policy expert Professor Frank Jotzo said it is not worth making too much of it. ""[It is] the largest coal producing and coal consuming country in Europe, and so the issues surrounding the transition from that industry are very present."" 'Prickly but productive' COP24 ""Australia generally has been innovative, assertive, prickly, but very positive on the whole and at the moment I think that continues, even though the headlines aren't showing it up,"" Mr Bamsey said. ""We've got to be there to influence the basis, the rules on which this new global economy is based, and that's what this COP is about."" COP24 comes in the wake of the landmark IPCC 1.5 degree Celsius report, which said the world needs to take drastic steps this decade to limit global warming to 1.5C. In the early days of COP24 , the United States, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait blocked the conference from officially ""welcoming"" the report, instead demanding it merely be ""noted"". Australia was conspicuously silent on the debate, but Mr Bamsey said entire agreements could hinge on subtle phrasing, and even punctuation. ""To most sensible people, that kind of stand-off over two words like that looks ridiculous,"" he said. ""But there is huge symbolic importance on those two different words, and eventually, the impact of decisions around those sorts of arcane questions will be felt in the real world."" As Australia's lead negotiator at a number of previous COPs, Mr Bamsey knows what it is like to go for days without sleep towards the end of a climate conference. ""People will wonder what's going on behind these rooms, no longer smoke filled, but they're still pretty smelly, because people have been there two or three days without sleeping,"" he said. ""This COP looks like another one of those where it will go down to the wire."" \"

This is an ambitious aim - global temperatures are HYPERLINK https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/news/releases/2018/decadal-forecast-2018 rapidly approaching the 1.5\'b0C target and the 2\'b0C limit is not far away. The path to 1.5\'b0C requires that the world achieve zero emissions before 2050. It is imperative, therefore, that we stop burning fossil fuels, known as mitigation. However, our present trajectory suggests we're not on track. COP24 can't take its eye off this ball -- there is no long-term plan that doesn't include zero fossil-carbon emissions. The scientific consensus is that we need to reach ""net zero"" CO? emissions by 2050. But to tack closer to a scenario of 1.5\'b0C warming, COP24 should set this target for 2035.

"COP24","Australia","COP24_Australia5","COP24 President defends participation of coal companies at climate talks","December 7, 2018 Friday 7:26 AM AEST","ABC Premium News (Australia)","COP24 President Michal Kurtyka has defended displays of coal soap and jewellery at key climate change talks in Poland, saying ""it's good to have everybody on board"". Conference attendees were confronted with coal displays in the foyer and greeted by a performance from the Polish Coal Miners Band during the talks designed to bring about global action on climate change. Polish President Andrzej Duda said using coal was not in conflict with climate protection, and with the climate change talks taking place in the city of Katowice - a coal mining stronghold - some observers said the setting undermined the purpose of the talks. Mr Kurtyka, who is also a secretary of state in the Ministry of Environment, denied that coal companies ""sponsored"" the event, which he said was publicly funded by Poland - but said there were several partners, including Ikea and energy companies. ""There are also energy companies of course engaging in a path of sustainable development,"" he told the ABC. The Corporate Europe Observatory published a list of energy companies providing services and ""bankrolling"" the COP24 , alleging they were wrecking the climate and engaging in deceptive ""greenwashing"" activities. When asked if the sale of coal jewellery and soap was a blatant affront to COP24 's aims, Mr Kurtyka said: ""I think it's good to have everybody on board."" ""I don't sense that there is a problem with anybody's participation, provided that we have the same goal,"" he said. ""We cannot do it without tackling the industry ... I think it's a good signal - we can, in dialogue, advance all together."" He added that Poland stood by its assertion that ""green pragmatism"" was key to ensuring no countries were left behind. Richie Merzian, director of the Australia Institute's Climate and Energy Program, said the coal-heavy setting left ""a sour taste in the mouths of those who are committed to climate action"". ""We're not here to celebrate coal, we're not here to adorn our bodies in coal jewellery, and so it sends the wrong message,"" he said. ""But at the same time it is symbolic of trying to deal with the vested interests and the long history of reliance on fossil fuels in many of these cities and countries."" Mr Merzian added that coal companies were not on the same page as delegates seeking an ambitious plan to combat climate change. ""Their core business is directly in contrast to ... the goal of the Paris Agreement, which is to transition completely away from reliance on fossil fuels,"" he said, adding that the influence of coal companies on governments ran deep. ""Stopping that outright, in-your-face sponsorship would definitely help in terms of optics, but a lot of the influence is just strongly embedded into the positions that the countries bring forward."" Desperation in the Pacific Mr Kurtyka said global warming was undeniable and extraordinary summers had ravaged the planet. He stressed Poland's shift to more renewable energies and said there was strong political will amid the intense discussions at the conference. The issue was vital to Pacific nations facing an ""existential threat"", he added. Yesterday New Zealand released a defence policy statement naming climate change as its biggest security threat and stressing the impact of climate change on the Pacific. ""It identifies climate change as one of the most significant security threats of our time, and one that is already having adverse impacts both at home and in New Zealand's neighbourhood,"" said Defence Minister Ron Mark in an emailed statement to Reuters. Australia, however, has turned its back on its Pacific neighbours in terms of climate change, Mr Merzian said. ""The Pacific are getting desperate, and instead of their friends helping, they're hurting,"" he said. ""Poland is the Australia of the EU - the largest coal user, the largest coal producer - but unlike Australia that can operate in its own bubble, Poland has to marry up its position with its EU colleagues as a bloc, and that's why they help drag Poland to be better than what it would otherwise be."" \"

They make no mention of how the UK government might achieve this, but link to other websites which offer potential routes for reaching this target. The sites suggested by the Extinction Rebellion promote ideas such as HYPERLINK https://thebreakthrough.org/index.php/voices/decoupling-debate green growth and a \~ HYPERLINK https://www.greennewdealgroup.org/ green new deal . These ideas are founded on the premise that we can achieve both continually high rates of economic growth and reduce our impact on the planet.

So what should groups like Extinction Rebellion do?

Another element of HYPERLINK https://ec.europa.eu/clima/sites/clima/files/news/20181211_statement_en.pdf the pledge is to bring in rapid change by broadening the ""coalitions between governments and non-party stakeholders"". But who are the stakeholders? Who appoints them? Who are they accountable to and can we be sure they are genuinely committed to fighting climate change? Undermining the voice of the people is a key element in the failure of top-down policies to bring successful, rapid, and sustainable positive climate actions.

And indeed, over the two weeks of COP24 meetings, we did hear the voice of women such as Joanna Sustento, a climate activist from the Philippines. Sustento lost many family members to Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, and is now fighting to hold 47 fossil fuel companies responsible for nearly a quarter of all greenhouse gases, accountable for deaths related to climate change. We saw at the meetings the commitments of major organisations and development banks to HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/fossil-fuels-divest-climate-change-global-warming-emissions-campaign-a8681931.html divest from fossil fuel We also heard the voice of Greta Thunberg, who created a global climate strike despite being herself at the margins of society because she is young, female and has Asperger syndrome.

The 24th Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) will last from December 3-14 and its primary aim is to reach agreement on how the Paris Agreement of 2015 will be implemented. In a year which saw HYPERLINK https://www.carbonbrief.org/climate-change-made-2018-european-heatwave-up-to-five-times-more-likely record weather extremes HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report 12 years to limit catastrophe To explain how the COP works and what it means for the fight against climate change, we asked our academic experts to share their views. What will COP24 The urgency to reach key milestones in the Paris Agreement and deal with climate change puts a lot of high expectations on COP24 - Federica Genovese, lecturer in government, University of Essex. Rulebook: this is the conference's main goal - to establish consensus on how nations should implement the Paris Agreement and report their progress. Emissions targets: COP24 is expected to resolve how emissions will be regulated, although it's unlikely that sanctions for countries failing to meet their targets will be agreed on. Finance: the rich countries need to find US$20 billion to fulfil their pledge of providing US$100 billion a year in funding to help poorer countries adapt to climate change by 2020. Agreeing when this will be paid is likely to be contentious. Role of ""big"" states: the international political climate casts a long shadow over the talks. Domestic politics in the US, the UK, Russia and Brazil threaten to undermine climate change leadership among larger emitters at COP24 . How did we get here? 2013: COP19 in Warsaw failed to finalise any binding treaty. Where are we on the road to catastrophic climate change? We aren't facing the end of the world as envisaged by many environmentalists in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but if we do nothing to mitigate climate change then billions of people will suffer - Mark Maslin, professor of Earth system science, University College London The world's poorest and most vulnerable people are most at risk from the effects of climate change, with many having to migrate from sea level rise, crop failure and pollution. Sahia - HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/climate-change-and-migration-in-bangladesh-one-womans-perspective-107131 a woman from Bangladesh As global temperatures near 1.5\'b0C above pre-industrial levels, the limit set in the 2015 Paris Agreement, scientists are increasingly anxious about how changes in the environment could work to accelerate the pace at which the rest of Earth is warming. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet and strange recent events here, such as HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/the-arctic-is-turning-brown-because-of-weird-weather-and-it-could-accelerate-climate-change-107590 heathland turning brown Methane released from Arctic permafrost and other rapid changes could take the matter of limiting greenhouse gas emissions out of our hands in the near future.

Whatever is agreed at COP24 will be what is politically possible, but experts urge us to bear in mind HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/cop24-heres-what-must-be-agreed-to-keep-warming-at-1-5-c-107968 what the science demands We're failing to cut down our emissions, the technologies for NETs [Negative Emissions Technologies] don't exist at any meaningful scale yet, and there are no political drivers in place to enforce their deployment. There is also a real risk of a dramatic rise in methane in the near future. COP24 will have to consider emergency plans - Hugh Hunt, reader in engineering, University of Cambridge. A more radical approach at COP24 could highlight the ample opportunity there is for slowing climate change by restoring habitats. For many countries, https://theconversation.com/cop24-rewilding-is-essential-to-the-uks-commitments-on-climate-change-107541https://theconversation.com/cop24-rewilding-is-essential-to-the-uks-commitments-on-climate-change-107541 reforestation is a more immediate way to slash emissions and make society happier and healthier in the process. However, while the climate has changed radically since global warming was first declared a man-made phenomenon https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/24/us/global-warming-has-begun-expert-tells-senate.html 30 years ago , international efforts to tackle it haven't. Many experts argue that the involvement of commercial interests at COP24 limits what is possible for mitigating climate change. Ten years after the financial crisis, COP24 should not legitimise large financial investors as the architects of a transition where sustainability rhymes with profitability - Tomaso Ferrando, lecturer in law, University of Bristol Finance sector sees this transition as an opportunity to generate profit. If climate change is fought according to the rules of Wall Street, says Ferrando, people and projects will be supported only on the basis of whether they will make money. If COP24 COP24 environmental movements have an opportunity to use their platform to highlight the relationship between economic growth and environmental impact, and even to discuss radical alternative futures that are not dependent on a growth-based economy - Christine Corlet Walker, PhD researcher in ecological economics, University of Surrey To bring about radical action on the environment, many academics believe we need an equally radical social movement. They argue that protesters should seize the initiative to attack the root causes of climate change, such as economic growth. Debunking the climate change denialists 2018 marks 30 years since climate change was HYPERLINK first declared a man-made phenomenon, during a congressional committee in Washington DC. The testimony of NASA climatologist James Hansen was met with both concern and scepticism at the time, but the science is in: anthropogenic climate change is incontrovertible. Climate change is happening and is being caused by humans. This is the academic consensus, backed by science. But for climate change deniers: The 97% 97.1% of relevant climate papers published over 21 years affirmed human-caused global warming (2013 study involving multiple institutions). 97% consensus in published climate research found to be robust and consistent with other surveys of climate scientists and peer-reviewed studies (2016 study involving multiple institutions). Why do some still not believe in human-caused climate change? The fossil fuel industry has spent many millions of dollars on confusing the public about climate change. But the role of vested interests in climate science denial is only half the picture. The other significant player is political ideology - John Cook, research fellow in climate change communication, George Mason University An HYPERLINK http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-013-1018-7 analysis by American professor Robert Brulle found that from 2003 to 2010, organisations promoting climate misinformation received more than US$900m of corporate funding a year. From 2008, funding through untraceable donor networks (so-called ""dark money ATM"") increased. This allowed corporations to fund climate science denial while hiding their support. In 2016, an HYPERLINK http://www.pnas.org/content/113/1/92.short analysis of more than 40,000 texts from contrarian sources by Justin Farrell, another American professor, found that organisations who received corporate funding published more climate misinformation. At an individual level, however, there is considerable evidence that shows that political ideology is the biggest predictor of climate science denial. People who fear the solutions to climate change, such as increased regulation of industry, are more likely to deny that there is a problem in the first place. Consequently, groups promoting political ideology that opposes market regulation have been prolific sources of misinformation about climate change, as three American academics HYPERLINK https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09644010802055576 found . Five Techniques used by climate change deniers to look out for: Fake experts: create the general impression of an ongoing debate by casting doubt on scientific consensus. Logical fallacies: logically false arguments that lead to an invalid conclusion. These usually appear in myths, in the form of science misrepresentation or oversimplification. Impossible expectations: demand unrealistic standards of proof before acting on the science. Any uncertainty is highlighted to question the consensus. Cherry-picking: best described as wilfully ignoring a mountain of inconvenient evidence in favour of a small molehill that serves a desired purpose.   Conspiracy theories: if the evidence is against you, then it has to be manipulated by mysterious forces in pursuit of a nefarious agenda. It is central to denial.

After divisive elections, both the US and Brazil are among the countries to have succumbed to the ""strongman"". The modern strongman is a leader who rules by force and bluster, and who shuns cooperation in favour of an isolationist and protectionist foreign policy. This attitude is usually reflected in a very dim view of climate action.

The US remains the world's largest economy, and is the largest consumer and one of the largest producers of fossil fuels. Brazil also has a huge population and its wealth of natural resources - including the world's largest rainforest, the Amazon - are under threat. In this context, with these leaders, what hope is there for the future of climate treaties and conferences?

It is important to remember that Paris \~ HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/english_paris_agreement.pdf had 197 signatories Countries, it seems, are still working together. A significant reason for this is money - and, as the old adage goes: ""money makes the world go round"". Many nations are still feeling the effects of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, and money remains in short supply. Any chance to create jobs and new investment will be welcomed by governments across the world, and investing in clean energy is one solution. Political leaders everywhere, including strongmen, are still motivated by money. For example, in many countries, public health has became a key climate change issue. Just look at China, where leader Xi Jinping shares some characteristics with classic strongmen yet his government has realised that HYPERLINK https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674927816300223 fossil fuel use comes at a growing cost to public health, tourism and labour productivity. \~ HYPERLINK https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(17)32345-0.pdf The Lancet estimates the welfare costs from pollution to be equivalent to 6.2% of global GDP - and these costs are rising.

The HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/english_paris_agreement.pdf Paris Agreement refers to Taking into account the imperatives of a Just Transition of the workforce and the creation of decent work and quality jobs in accordance with nationally defined development priorities. This issue of a just transition remained relatively dormant but has risen to prominence over the past year. It was highlighted in the communiqu\'e9 produced from the recent HYPERLINK http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2018/06/09/the-charlevoix-g7-summit-communique/ G7 talks in June this year.

But before we pin our hopes on finance to solve climate change, there are some things we need to ask ourselves. Difficult questions for COP24 negotiators How did we get to a point in history where it is taken for granted that public money alone can never be sufficient to finance our transition from fossil fuels? Is it an objective condition with no clear causation and responsibility, or something else? What about the fact that HYPERLINK https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/02/global-military-spend-rose-to-1-point-7-trillion-in-2017-arms-watchdog-says.html global military spending in 2017 reached US$1.7 trillion while poor countries promised funding for climate change adaptation and mitigation in 2015 \~ https://www.ft.com/content/cbce4e2e-ee5b-11e8-89c8-d36339d835c0 are still waiting Read more: COP24 : climate protesters must get radical and challenge economic growth What about the cost of bailouts to the financial sector, which in the UK alone has been estimated at HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/163850bn-official-cost-of-the-bank-bailout-1833830.html US$850 billion ? As Michael Lewis noted in his \~ HYPERLINK https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/27/books/boomerang-by-michael-lewis-review.html boomerang theory , states that have propped up financiers with public money are now asking those same financiers to step in and do the job that states should do. And this leads to the second consideration. Climate change is historically, politically and socially complex. Although sustainable finance is not presented as the sole solution, analysing its role produces a series of strategic short circuits. It oversimplifies and depoliticises the response to climate change. It legitimises the idea that sustainability can be achieved within HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/14/climate-change-and-the-continual-demand-for-economic-growth continuous growth and expansion It rewrites the way we think about our planet in the vocabulary of finance and its obsession for a return on investment. It marginalises any claim to address climate change based on present and historical injustices, redistribution and bottom-up projects organised by ordinary people. It accepts that the financial way of defining sustainability and its achievements are inherently aligned with the rights, interests and needs of people and the planet. Finance may be a partner in the fight against climate change, but it is certainly not a partner motivated by altruism. It's motivated by generating profit from the transition. It is therefore unsurprising that energy generation, railways, water management and other forms of climate mitigation have been identified as HYPERLINK http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/climatefinance/projects priorities for sustainable finance Fighting climate change on Wall Street's terms HYPERLINK https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/07/is-the-boom-in-megaprojects-sustainable/ large returns by investing in the transition to ""greener"" infrastructure, including the not-so-green \~ HYPERLINK https://www.cgdev.org/blog/chinas-green-belt-road-initiative-isnt-very-green Chinese green belt and road HYPERLINK https://www.pri.org/stories/2013-07-01/brazils-hydro-dams-could-make-its-greenhouse-gas-emissions-soar sustainable investment HYPERLINK https://www.climatebonds.net/get-involved/green-city-bond-campaign Green bonds can help cities finance projects to reduce their environmental impact or adapt to climate change. However, if money is the driver, we should not expect private investors to have any interest in projects that won't generate a sufficient return, but would benefit people or cities that cannot pay for the service or for the debt, or that would protect vulnerable people from climate change. If climate change is fought according to the rules of Wall Street, people and projects will be supported only on the basis of whether they will make money. Ten years ago, the world saw that finance had permeated every aspect of the global economy. Back then, it was clear that financial interests could not build a better and different world.

In the late 1990s environmental deterioration in China became critical, with vast areas resembling the dust bowl of the American Mid-west in the 1930s. Six large forest programmes were introduced during the late 1990s and early 2000s, targeting over 100m hectares of land for reforestation. HYPERLINK https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9783319115047-c2.pdf?SGWID=0-0-45-1491130-p176989718 Grain for Green is the largest and best known of these programmes. It reduced soil erosion and desertification and stabilised local rainfall patterns. The ongoing programme also helped to alleviate poverty, as payments are made directly to farmers who set aside their land for reforestation. It has also reduced China's grain surplus, which was depressing prices, and helped to rebalance the inequality between the eastern and western provinces. The Grain for Green programme shows that widespread reforestation can have a very positive affect on the economy as well as the environment. There is ample opportunity and land on which to reforest. Despite the rising population of the Earth, which is projected to hit 10 billion by 2050, there is a net migration from rural areas into urban areas.

Getting the world to recycle We do have some international laws that attempt to tackle plastic pollution. The HYPERLINK UN Convention on the Law of the Sea HYPERLINK Honolulu Strategy was agreed in 2011 to help tackle marine debris coming from land-based activities. If these commitments were to be fully met then our plastic problem would be vastly reduced. One issue is that these obligations depend on plastic being recognised as harmful to humans or marine life. Plastic has long been considered a wonder material, which makes modern life possible. Like other ""wonderful inventions"" such as the HYPERLINK https://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/articles/ozone-layer-antarctic-ozone-hole-may-be-completely-healed-within-50-years-un-report/116451 ozone-eating CFCs , it is only as plastic has started to accumulate in the world that we have realised it is a problem. A second issue is that each country has responded to this problem in different ways. HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/aug/28/kenya-brings-in-worlds-toughest-plastic-bag-ban-four-years-jail-or-40000-fine Kenya , for example, has adopted legislation banning single use plastic bags, while the \~ HYPERLINK https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/single-use-plastic-carrier-bags-why-were-introducing-the-charge/carrier-bags-why-theres-a-5p-charge UK has added a charge to their use. Current proposals to tackle plastics focus on increasing recycling. It is worth remembering though that only around https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2018/drowning-in-plastic?lang=cy 11% of plastic is currently recycled around the world . If we are to rely on recycling as a means to tackle plastic pollution we need to rapidly increase recycling in almost every country. An increase in recycling to the extent needed can't happen overnight. We'd need effective and accessible recycling facilities and public education. Both would need huge investments of time and resources across the world. A treaty may be one way of coordinating such action and sharing knowledge about how best to improve recycling. Countries already share knowledge about how they meet some treaty obligations through HYPERLINK https://www.cbd.int/reports/ reports to a governing body Tax and replace Another measure being used is taxation. The assumption is that if we make plastics more expensive then either less will be used or alternative materials will replace them. Deposit return schemes are also suggested as a way to ""nudge"" producer and consumer behaviour. These types of measures do not always, however, HYPERLINK http://www.oecd.org/development/extended-producer-responsibility-9789264256385-en.htm prompt the desired response Sometimes, for example, costs are simply passed on to consumers. It is also difficult to apply these measures in emerging economies which lack the same regulatory bodies and infrastructure to monitor these measures, so other approaches may be needed. Governments have faced the question of how to tackle a pervasive pollutant produced by all countries before and the answer was to adopt a treaty for a rapid and coordinated response. The best known example is the HYPERLINK http://ozone.unep.org/ Ozone Convention which was adopted in 1985 to reduce chemicals used in refrigeration and aerosols which damaged the ozone layer. Like subsequent treaties addressing other harmful chemicals, such as the HYPERLINK http://chm.pops.int/ POPs Convention , the Ozone Convention tackled the most harmful first and was designed to enable alternatives to be introduced. Alternatives to harmful plastics do already exist - current plastics are largely derived from oil and so do not easily degrade. Alternative plastics are being developed HYPERLINK https://www.cuantec.com/science from prawn shells and from \~ HYPERLINK https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/science-environment-45711720/plastics-watch-could-seaweed-replace-plastic-packaging plants such as seaweed Ban the unnecessary, phase out the rest World leaders have called for HYPERLINK http://web.unep.org/about/cpr/resolutions-adopted-un-environment-assembly-its-second-session action on plastics . It's time to follow through with a ""plastics convention"", containing binding commitments to phase out and prevent future plastic pollution. A plastics convention could ban oil-based plastics in a similar way to the ban on ozone-eating chemicals. Single use bags and straws could be phased out almost immediately under a global treaty, with other plastics addressed over a longer time frame. Those used in medical surgery may take decades to phase out, but support could be provided to industry to develop bioplastics, or other alternatives to plastics. A treaty could also address gaps in the current law. There is, for example, no provision for cleaning up the plastics already in the ocean. A new treaty could provide for a clean up fund to address these ""legacy"" plastics. The fund could be supported through contributions from importers and exporters of plastics, as already happens with importers and exporters of oil who pay into HYPERLINK a fund to address harm from oil spills, or through a tax on oil-based plastics products.

Commercial media competes for a small audience, and as a result is much more likely to touch on controversial points of view than to try to analyse them. There has also been little media coverage in Poland of the UN's IPCC reports on the HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/ipcc-1-5-report-heres-what-the-climate-science-says-104592 scientific consensus about climate change , and a complete absence of politicians promptly reacting to the reports. This lack of coverage can be partly explained by the relative scarcity of \~ HYPERLINK IPCC authors from Poland A powerful coal lobby Much of this can be traced back to the influence of the coal lobby, which has been powerful ever since communist times when exports were a vital source of convertible (foreign) currency. Poland is today the largest coal producer in the EU, and HYPERLINK https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17524032.2017.1394890 around 60% of the country's overall energy comes from coal. No wonder sentiment towards fossil fuel \~ HYPERLINK https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/WCAS-D-17-0120.1 remains strong . This is why most Polish politicians will nominally support taking action on climate change, regardless of political orientation - but only as long as it does not mean moving away from coal. They frequently speak of the importance of coal to the economy and energy security, yet they conveniently ignore or downplay the coal-climate link. There is a strong HYPERLINK https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/WCAS-D-17-0120.1 ""inconvenient truth"" Even past increases in the price of domestic coal have not helped renewable energies, but rather resulted in Poland HYPERLINK importing cheaper coal HYPERLINK https://www.reuters.com/article/poland-coal-idUSL8N13T2YO20151204 propping up its own industry Too great a cost?

For now, a switch from cheap coal to a more costly low-emission economy is politically unpalatable. Popular opinion and a wide range of politicians simply do not support the vision of leaving coal underground and paying more for energy. The country is still poorer than those in Western Europe, and the fear of energy price hikes is overwhelming. Don't expect Poland or its media to embrace climate action any time soon.

Closely mirroring the real-life world climate change negotiations that take place every six months, each affected player represents a different country and has to negotiate with everyone else about how they'll spend their national budget. The game is the brainchild of a collaboration between undergraduates and academics from Glasgow Caledonian University, Utrecht University and the Purdue Climate Change Research Centre in Indiana. It uses an https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-how-do-climate-models-work IPCC climate model to simulate the effects of each decision on carbon emissions, national GDP and the global temperature. Each turn skips forward five years, enabling players to ""live"" through the plausible future scenarios of 2033, 2038, 2043 and onwards out to 2118 to see how their decisions affect the world. Games and the real world The idea of using computer games, known as applied games, to help educate people goes back decades. Some might remember the ""edutainment wave"" of the 1990s, typified by games like HYPERLINK https://classicreload.com/win3x-math-blaster-in-search-of-spot.html Math Blaster (1994) Not only were such titles usually mediocre, the whole approach saw games as a kind of spoonful of sugar to make the nasty medicine of learning go down. It was bad teaching hiding inside bad games, and players were not usually fooled for long. Fortunately, modern applied games are designed with a much better understanding of what makes games special. One of the best is the space exploration simulator HYPERLINK Kerbal Space Program (2011) The game wasn't originally designed for educational purposes. But after NASA HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/22/kerbal-space-program-why-nasa-minecraft decided to back it , the developers created a version aimed at classrooms. Only by grappling with real-world trade offs between rocket components, life-support systems, fuel and weight, can players get the Kerbals to their nearest moon, the ""Mun"", and then back in one piece. Apparent reality Earth Remembers was designed with the same sense of jeopardy in mind. Should a country's budget be spent on researching new green technologies that could, for example, extract carbon from the atmosphere and sink it in the ground? Should it be spent reducing greenhouse-gas emissions with investments in green energy sources or on adapting to the impacts of climate change? When events trigger in the game, each player/nation is given an event card that describes what has happened to their country. In one game, for example, the US was told that Miami's coastline had seen significant flooding as a result of the ice sheet melt and that millions of residents were going to have to be moved further inland at great cost to the country. Meanwhile, other nations were coming to terms with news that certain industries had been dealt a massive blow. The whole point is to use narrative storytelling and imagination to make the human and economic cost of these events more concrete. As the Dutch psychologist Nico Frijda HYPERLINK convincingly argued The final part of our game shifts 100 years into the future, and players are presented with scenarios derived from the decisions they have made. The Fijian people no longer reside in Fiji, for instance, but in a part of Australia renamed by one participant ""Fijiland"". This prompted discussions about the challenges of identity loss, whether this community should be a separate nation, and who was responsible for this situation. Our trip to Katowice was the second time we'd simulated the game, having previously demonstrated it to negotiators at the HYPERLINK climate change talks Next for us is to demonstrate Earth Remembers for scientists and policy specialists in Washington, DC in a few days' time. We are also hoping to develop further enhancements to the game. This is where the potential of applied games lies: in mixing together the scientific and the artistic; the rational and the emotional.

The global movement that started with Ms Thunberg staging a strike from school each week gained support from students around the world, including Australia. On Friday children took to the streets in Australia, Europe, and across the American, Asian and African continents, supported by adults who want action, but who despair of politicians standing up for change. Leading Coalition Government moderate Christopher Pyne distinguished himself with a lawyer's response to the students' engagement with the political process about the future they're going to have to live in. ""Usually strikes are when employees withdraw their labour from an employee so I'm not sure why the students are withdrawing themselves from school.

Hunter MP Joel Fitzgibbon got the mood right and acknowledged students' need to express their mounting concerns in the public realm.

"COP24","Australia","COP24_Australia21","Coal town forum proving an utter waste of resources","December 11, 2018 Tuesday","The Australian","The conference in Katowice will achieve nothing""even as Paris continues to unravel Most of us had never heard of the city of Katowice in Poland until a few weeks ago. A city of around 300,000, it is a centre of coalmining and steelmaking. It is also very cold in winter. The average temperature in December is 2C. Was someone cracking a joke when this city was chosen to host COP24 , the 24th conference of the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change? The fact that a major coal company is part sponsor of the conference, as well as the fact there are chunks of coal adorning the conference venue, may well have been part of the punch line. The conference is being held in an inflatable dome erected over a public building. Diesel generators are operating around the clock to ensure the temperature is comfortable for the participants. There are almost 23,000 listed participants, although French President Emmanuel Macron is a late scratching. He is now more concerned about the yellow-vest protesters who have objected to additional taxes on petrol and diesel to prosecute Macron's ""ecological transformation"" of the French economy. He has now been forced to ditch these tax plans. We have sent 30 delegates to COP24 . This week, Environment Minister Melissa Price will be leading our team. The US has sent slightly more, 44, but seeing that the US has signalled its intention to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, there was not a strong case for sending any more. The country with the largest official delegation is Guinea, which has sent 406 delegates. Guinea has a population of just under 13 million. The Democratic Republic of the Congo, population 81 million, is second with 237. If you are wondering why these countries have such large delegations, remember the Green Climate Fund that was part and parcel of the Paris Agreement -finalised in 2015. The GCF is intended to ""limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries, and to help vulnerable societies adapt to the unavoidable impacts of climate change"". The notional commitment was that $100 billion would be added to this fund every year. The aim of the GCF was to entice developing countries to sign on to Paris. The fund hasn't got off to a good start: donations have been insufficient and there have been arguments about governance. But developing countries, Africa and Pacific islands in particular, have not yet given up. So what is the likely outcome of COP24 ? The short answer is that it will essentially end up like Copenhagen: with deep divisions, an uncertain path forward and a deeply misleading final communique. The US, Russia and Saudi Arabia have already used their numbers to quash any reference to COP24 welcoming the -Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's October report. You will recall the really scary one in which we were warned that unless we were all prepared to change our ways, there was no hope that the increase in global temperatures could be restricted to 1.5C. The main challenge for the organisers of COP24 will be to keep the developed and developing countries on the same page. In all likelihood, China will baulk at this and there will be many countries happy to follow that lead. Having said this, China will boast about its commitment to pursuing climate change initiatives and to providing global leadership. In the end, and bear in mind the Paris agreement is non-binding; each country will be able to establish its own rules for meeting the emissions reductions targets it sets and to determine how progress is assessed. Whatever impact the Paris climate agreement is having, it is failing in its core objective of reducing emissions. Let us return to France and the yellow-vest protests. Because of France's nuclear industry, it produces relatively little carbon di-oxide to generate electricity. For this reason, the deeply green Macron decided to tackle emissions from the transport sector by imposing higher taxes, particularly on diesel. (It is ironic that diesel was once promoted as a more environmentally responsible fuel than petrol.) The money raised would be ploughed back into general revenue. French citizens reliant on motor transport to make a living were unimpressed. There is evidence elsewhere that carbon taxes are unpopular. The Wall Street Journal has referred to this phenomenon as the global carbon tax revolt. Last month, the citizens of Washington state were asked to endorse a plan for a carbon tax of $US15 a tonne beginning in 2020, which would increase by $US2 each year until 2035, when the impost would reach $US55 a tonne. The tax was referred to as a fee on the ballot paper. The plan was voted down. The idea that the money raised would be used to fund wind and solar plants, climate change resilience projects, public transport and energy efficiency improvements to buildings was not sufficiently -attractive to convince people to accept the impost. The carbon tax plans of the Trudeau government in Canada also look to be in trouble. His plan is to impose a carbon tax of $C10 a tonne from this year, rising to $C50 in 2022, unless the provinces can establish their own equivalent plan. The idea is that the federal government will impose the tax on unco-operative ones. Initially, only some of the less populous provinces, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, objected. But more recently a change of government in the most populous province, Ontario, means Justin Trudeau faces stiff opposition to his proposal. Alberta has recently withdrawn its support. Of course, Australians all know about the unpopularity of (explicit) carbon taxes. While citizens may express their desire for governments to tackle climate change in theory, actions that impose real cost burdens seem to be another thing. The reality of these conferences to tackle climate change is that they are more farce than serious policymaking and international co-operation. Games are played, naked self-interest is portrayed as concern for the environment and loose commitments are made that will never be met. The US is out, for the time being; China and India are not required to cut emissions; and the other countries don't really count.If you believe the IPCC, there are now only 12 years until it is too late to do anything about climate change. (Previous tipping points have come and gone.) On this basis, we should expect COP36 to be the last. That will save a few airfares and associated emissions. \"

The commitment puts Labor in lock-step with the Berejiklian-led Coalition government, which announced a policy to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 three years ago and whose energy minister Don Harwin said ""we recognise that climate change is a scientific fact"" in December. Treasurer Dominic Perrottet also weighed in on Thursday and said the Coalition would ""focus on securing reliable, affordable energy for the people of NSW"". ""If you want to know what our future would look like under NSW Labor, look no further than South Australia, where the last Labor government presided over blackouts that cast the state into darkness,"" he said. Last week, during an address to the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia, Mr Daley said coal only had about a decade left in NSW and under a Daley-led government there would be no new investment in coal. The policy aligns itself with both the targets Australia committed itself to during the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris - the same 50 per cent reduction in emissions per capita - and those of NSW Labor's federal counterparts. Last November, opposition spokesman for energy Mark Butler committed Labor to ""pursue a bipartisan market mechanism, such as a National Energy Guarantee, that could deliver on our commitment of 50 per cent renewable energy by 2030"". The Labor-run governments in Queensland and the Northern Territory have the same emissions reduction plan as NSW while the ACT Labor government has outlined a plan to cut emissions by up to 75 per cent by 2030 - and reach net-zero emissions by 2045 - the Victorian Labor Party has yet to set its targets beyond 2020 and Western Australia does not have a formal target. Meanwhile the Liberal governments in Tasmania and South Australia are aiming for net-zero by 2050 and a 60 per cent reduction by 2050 respectively. The NSW Labor plan also includes a commitment to deliver 100 per cent renewable energy to all government agencies in the state by 2025, hold a climate change summit within its first year of office to develop a plan to achieve net-zero emissions, and to enshrine that plan in law. ""Climate change is real and the impacts of it can be seen right across the state. Only Labor is serious about tackling climate change and developing a clean energy future,"" NSW Labor deputy leader and opposition spokeswoman for the environment Penny Sharpe said. ""A Daley Labor government will put climate change at the centre of its decision making. One of my first acts as Labor Leader was creating a climate change portfolio because it is time governments acted decisively to deal with this pressing issue,"" Mr Daley said. \"

I cannot warm to this behaviour as it's simply taking advantage of the trend to strike for strike's sake.

KEN JOHNSTON ROCHEDALE SOUTH The Clem Jones Group is working with Dying With Dignity Queensland to pursue law reforms. We believe VAD law reform is urgent which is why we are concerned that the government seems intent on deferring any new legislation until after the next state election due in October 2020. Evidence from state coroners at the Victorian and West Australian inquiries into voluntary assisted dying underlined the need to take action sooner not later. In both states coroners handle about one case week where a person diagnosed with a terminal or debilitating physical condition has died as a result of an act of intentional self-harm. The horrendous methods often used by those taking their own lives in the absence of a legal and strongly regulated voluntary assisted dying regime have impacts on their families but also on first responders such as police, ambulance, and fire and emergency personnel. This is just one reason any law reforms need to be undertaken in this term of the Queensland Parliament, not the next. DAVID MUIR CHAIRMAN CLEM JONES TRUST COURIER-MAIL 29/11/2018 figures on exports to India has coal at $7.3 billion, far above second place vegetables/fruit. My question is why would any Queenslander vote for a Labor or Green member of the federal government who want to stop this? Plus why does the State Government have to be dragged kicking and screaming to approve any new mines? ROD WATSON SURFERS PARADISE SOME would be appalled that the Queensland government is offering interest-free loans to install a domestic solar system and battery. Interest-free loans mean that for lower or non-existent electricity bills, many wealthier Australians living in single detached dwellings have installed solar. They incur debt owed to the government to cover the cost of installing solar and eventually pay the money back. Meanwhile they also provide extra energy to the grid. New providers only get 8 cents a kilowatt hour for nett generation or whatever their energy retailer believes this extra energy is worth. It's certainly a way that high energy users can lower their energy usage which should logically make electricity prices for the low-income families cheaper because of lower demand. For low-income families it's win-win because they see lower electricity prices along with their lower income tax. So solar is a way to redistribute income from high to low income households. Unfortunately, we can't see the lowering of energy prices by solar against the trend of increasing energy prices due to the huge demand for fossil fuels when this resource is in decline. This is the real price of carbon. ED DONOVAN LABRADOR AUSTRALIA should cop out of COP24 climate change conference in Katowice, Poland and PM Morrison should make no new commitments to reduce emissions. Nothing of benefit to Australian consumers, taxpayers or business will come out of COP24 . It will just extend the UN's war on our cheap, reliable hydrocarbon fuels and the backbone industries that rely on them - primary industries, transport, processing and manufacturing. Australia is particularly vulnerable with no nuclear power, no geothermal power and limited hydropower. This war on reliable hydrocarbon fuels and the promotion of unreliable wind and solar power will increasingly deny our industries and consumers cheap reliable energy. There is no justification for the war on carbon dioxide - there is no proof that CO2 drives global temperature and it is a delusion to believe that Earth's climate can be tweaked by erecting windmills or putting taxes on carbon dioxide. COP24 will descend into a grab for cash, and Australia is one of the fat pullets they plan to pluck. l WAS desperately hoping to give all media a miss for a while, but the latest shenanigans over Julia Banks has brought me back to the News Corp fold in quick order.

But the serious takeouts from the meeting in the city of Katowice are that pressure is building on Australia and other laggard countries to adopt carbon policies that can demonstrably achieve their Paris targets and the much more ambitious targets that would be required to limit global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Allied to that is a more intense discussion about carbon abatement solutions that can apply to the economy as a whole - including heavy industry, heavy transport and industrial heating - and the likelihood that the target won't be achieved without a big role for hydrogen, carbon capture and storage and - in other countries - nuclear power. A lot of international delegates were shaking their heads at how Australia is now ""worse than Italy"", and consternation from Japanese delegates about how Australian energy prices have soared in recent years. Similar to the HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/news/politics/australias-revolving-door-of-prime-ministers-becomes-a-g20-oddity-20181202-h18lzf recent meeting of leaders of the Group of 20 top economies in Buenos Aires , there's a sense that we are a bit of a basket case when it comes to climate policy and the general instability of our politics, along with a hope we will pull out of it, Australian Industry Group policy director Tennant Reid said from Katowice. But the substantive discussions reveal a momentum towards more ambitious climate targets that increasingly leave countries like Australia that have back pedalled in recent years out of step. Australia is represented at COP24 (COP stands for conference of the parties) by Woodside Petroleum, BHP, environment minister Melissa Price and climate ambassador Patrick Suckling. Talk of 1.5 degrees 'normalised' Although the meeting has failed to agree - thanks to the US, Russia and Saudi Arabia - to language welcoming the HYPERLINK Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's September report urging the world to ramp up targets to limit global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees, there was so much talk about it that ""it has really been normalised,"" Mr Reed said. Peter Castellas, chief executive of the Carbon Market Institute, a lobby whose members includes Adelaide Brighton Cement, AGL Energy, Origin Energy, Wesfarmers, Aurizon, Telstra and Shell, said there is ""an increase in the urgency to raise the ambition of the Paris agreement"". The corollary is ""just how colossal a task and broad a transformation 1.5 degrees or even 2 degrees compatible targets are"", Mr Reed said. This will necessitate a ""big conversation"" in Australia about how to to achieve deep emissions cuts in carbon intensive sectors such as heavy industry and transport, and industrial heating. These industries have combined emit more carbon than electricity, which accounts for a third of Australian emissions, according to the Department of Environment's HYPERLINK Australia's Emissions Projections 2017 report. Climate Analytics found in a report for the Australian Conservation Foundation that Australia's manufacturing sector is effectively standing still on improving energy efficiency and falling behind global leaders Germany, italy, Japan, France and the US. Hydrogen 'not just hype' Existing policies such as the safeguard mechanism of the Morrison's government's Emissions Reduction Fund could play a role ""but we are going to have to do a lot more"", including using hydrogen as fuel, Mr Reed said. ""Hydrogen is not just hype"", he said. It is a potential substitute for carbon heavy petroleum and land-intensive biofuels in heavy transport, but Australia has only taken tentative steps and ""we are going to have to do a hell of a lot in hydrogen"" to transition to clean energy in these industries. Mr Reed said although carbon capture and storage (CCS) has been overhyped by some fossil fuel advocates it is ""implausible that we can come anywhere near 1.5 degrees without a lot of CCS and - globally - quite a bit of nuclear power"". Mr Castellas said there was ""massive unstoppable momentum and consensus emerging around the inevitability of carbon pricing frm many jurisdictions"" as a means of achieving climate goals, but delegates who looked to Australia for its record in designing and implementing carbon pricing mechanisms and markets were perplexed and asked, ""why are you not doing it at home?"" Environment minister Melissa Price kept a low profile at her first major climate change meeting. Mr Castellas said ""there was a very strong recognition that people want to see more from Australia"" and that current policies are not sufficient to meet the current target, let alone a more ambitious one. The formal business of COP24 is to approve technical rules for carbon markets and other measures such as financing for poor countries to fund carbon abatement and the transition to clean energy, and the talks were expected to continue into the early hours of Saturday before a text was agreed. \"
"COP24","Australia","COP24_Australia26","Sunday Herald Sun EDITORIAL","May 13, 2018 Sunday","Herald Sun (Australia)","Council wage hike exposed AN extraordinary blowout in council wage expenditure is a concerning development for Victorian homeowners. A Sunday Herald Sun investigation of the draft budgets of 31 municipalities has revealed that wage bills are accounting for close to 44 per cent of council revenue. In some big-spending councils, the figure is significantly higher. The figures do not include funds paid to external contractors meaning the total spent on manpower is even higher. A number of factors including population growth, a boost in executive salaries and new workplace agreements have been blamed on the surge. Moonee Valley council's draft budget shows plans to spend $84 million - or 54 per cent of its budget - on 861 staff next financial year, jumping from $55.4 million just five years ago. Meanwhile, Cardinia Shire spent less than a third of its revenue on staff salaries. The figures show a remarkable 25 per cent increase on staffing costs since 2013-14 across 30 metropolitan Melbourne councils and the City of Geelong. At a time of stagnant wage growth, when ordinary Victorians are tightening their belt, the extravagant increase in labour expenditure at local government warrants greater examination. The third tier of government has for too long escaped the level of scrutiny state and federal governments routinely receive. And yet dozens of council officers in Victoria earn more than Premier Daniel Andrews. Councils are increasingly populated by activists with delusions of grandeur who spend ratepayer resources to grandstand on issues of national and international significance, issues that have little to do with local government business. In recent years we have seen councillors from the City of Monash debate whether to officially acknowledge the Armenian genocide, which occurred a century ago on the other side of the world, while Yarra council voted to fly the Co Vang flag despite warnings from the Federal Government that it could jeopardise trade with Vietnam. Moreland council has debated a treaty with Aborigines, an issue far removed from its province, and has in the past defied advice from Victoria Police, the State Government and local business owners to back protests by masked troublemakers. Yarra, Moreland and Darebin councils have formally dumped Australia Day celebrations on January 26, despite the national holiday being supported by the overwhelming majority of the population. La Trobe council raised the ire of ratepayers earlier this year by spending $21,000 to send a contingent, including mayor Darrell White, to Asia to visit wind and solar farms. The waste is nothing new, in 2015 Mornington Peninsula ratepayers paid thousands to send councillors on a junket to Paris to attend a United Nations climate change conference . Global and national policy discussions are not matters for local government. It's little wonder that ratepayers are sick of their hard-earned being used by councillors to play politics on matters well above their station. The pet projects of activist councillors should not be allowed to monopolise council time and waste valuable resources. Australian policies on border protection, same-sex marriage, climate change and Australia Day are not issues that concern the third tier of government. Long-suffering ratepayers would appreciate councillors refocus on core council business that affect the daily lives of Victorians including the traditional three Rs of local government: rubbish, roads and rates. There needs to be far greater accountability to stop councillors and council staff from falling into the gravy train mentality. Addressing the expenditure on salaries would greatly reduce pressure to increase rates. Indeed, it could lead to a decrease in the amount property owners contribute in council rates and allow local municipalities to provide greater funding for services such as roadworks, parks and libraries. The mindset that wage costs and hence rates must rise every year is counter productive in creating efficiency and cost savings.Most hardworking property owners do not have the time to analyse council documents including annual reports. That's why we are exposing the soaring wages bill of Victorian councils - you deserve to know and the Sunday Herald Sun exists to serve you. \"

""All of this has to be seen in terms of the global environmental constraints here."" Johnson talks about greenhouse gas emissions. He recalls representing the EU at the first meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in the 1980s and is dismayed at how long it has taken to turn words of warning into action. While world leaders meet at the United Nations climate change conference in Katowice, Poland, Johnson appeals, ""Please let the Australian delegate in Katowice this week make a strong plea for urgent action."" ""Actually, Australia's unbelievably well placed, isn't it? Think of the amount of solar panels you could install in this country. If you didn't need to dig up more coal ... you could probably meet most of Australia's energy needs through solar energy."" During our conversation, Stanley Johnson has brought the argument close to home. ""I have known the Hunter Valley for 20 or 30 years, and I've driven up through the Hunter Valley,"" he says. ""And I do say to myself, 'How can it be that this perfect valley is now subject to this massive expansion of coal production, at a time when everybody is saying coal is no longer king?'. ""OK, there are internal economic pressures, but I go back to what I was saying. If Australia itself was not so gung-ho for economic expansion, those pressures wouldn't be so great."" I wonder how, as a prominent British Conservative, he has reconciled within himself holding some of these views that must be very lonely on his side of politics. ""It's an interesting question. I never myself have seen a basic contradiction between the word 'Conservative' and 'intelligent',"" he says, bursting into laughter. However, Johnson goes on to say that the great power of conservative regimes most of the world over is the business forces behind them. ""So, yes, I would say I am pretty unusual in this."" Back in Johnson's homeland, there is a lot of disagreement about Britain departing the European Union. This massive continental shift is simply known as Brexit, but there's nothing simple about it. The British people may have voted to leave the EU, but it is not a done deal. So the Brexit debate goes on across the nation; in the UK Parliament, in political parties, and in families, including the Johnsons'. ""Well, I'm in a really difficult situation, because I have one son, Boris, who is the leader of the 'Leave' campaign, and I have another son, Jo, who has come out as being the leader of the 'Remain' campaign,"" says Stanley Johnson. He has supported Britain remaining in the EU. The Brexit debate has also applied pressure on Prime Minister Theresa May, prompting talk, not for the first time, that Boris Johnson could be the UK's next leader. The father is diplomatic in the face of that speculation. ""If there was a strong sense in the country that we want to have a clean break [from the EU], OK, then I think it might well be that Boris turns out to be the leader of the 'clean breakers',"" Johnson muses. ""If, on the other hand, it turned out there was a strong sense in the country that we wanted to stay in, a 'remainer' might emerge."" But here we are at the start of the season of goodwill to all. So surely the big question of whether Britain should remain in, or leave, the EU will be left off the table at the Johnson family Christmas dinner. ""Who will be carving this year?,"" I ask. Stanley Johnson laughs, before he assures, ""Well, I think I'll be carving!"" \"

"COP24","Australia","COP24_Australia31","Don't dither on PRRT reform, says Woodside","November 14, 2018 Wednesday","Australian Financial Review","Woodside Petroleum chief executive Peter Coleman says Australian politicians should work toward a global price on carbon, consider further domestic gas reservations, and swiftly enshrine recent reforms to the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT) in legislation. Speaking in Melbourne on Tuesday, Mr Coleman said the federal government's proposed changes to the PRRT would not cause Woodside to slow development of its major liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects at Browse and Scarborough, but he said any delay in legislating the changes could see the development schedule at Browse slip. ""If it gets held up in the Senate through debate and it gets kicked out of this basic session of Parliament, if we don't see certainty before the end of the year then that is going to cause us some concerns, so we really need it to move forward as quickly as we can,"" he said. ""My request for politicians now is 'you have done it, now lets get it through the Senate because I have got some investment decisions to make here'. I need this legislation, we need this legislation through Parliament to give us the certainty to make those investments."" Announced by Treasurer Josh Frydenberg on November 2, the PRRT changes are expected to raise an extra $6 billion for the government over the next decade by reducing the amount of tax deductions that oil and gas ventures can carry forward and excluding onshore oil and gas developments from the regime. But there is no clarity over when the reform bill will be introduced, with Mr Frydenberg's statement on November 2 suggesting it may be 2019. The call for certainty over the PRRT's passage through Parliament was not the only piece of advice for Canberra in the wide-ranging speech Mr Coleman delivered to the Melbourne Mining Club on Tuesday. He said Australia's eastern states may need to replicate the sort of gas reservation that exists in Woodside's home market of Western Australia if they want to start tackling high gas prices. ""Each state needs a process to reassure the community that the reasonable domestic gas needs of Australians will be met. This may be achieved through reservation of acreage (as Queensland has done), or of volumes of domestic gas,"" he said. Mr Coleman also said Australian governments should lead the transition of the shipping, haulage and mining sectors away from diesel fuels to using cleaner-burning LNG. ""There is the chance to achieve emissions reductions consistent with industrial development if governments incentivise the switch from diesel to LNG ... there may be a role for targeted government support for the conversion of heavy vehicles,"" he said. Less than three weeks before the start of the 24th United Nations Climate Change Meeting ( COP24 ) in Poland, Mr Coleman said he hoped the international patchwork of carbon prices and policies could be replaced by a global approach to pricing carbon. ""What I am appealing for is a universal approach to this,"" he said. ""Somebody needs to take leadership on it and the international community is, at the moment, floundering in this regard. ""The biggest thing we could hope for in COP24 is that the emissions credits we generate here in Australia were actually able to be traded globally, at the moment under the Paris agreement, credits that a company like mine might generate somewhere else in the world are not able to be offset against emissions here in Australia and that is stifling where the market should be."" Instead of complaining about policy paralysis in Canberra, Mr Coleman said Australians needed to send a clear message to Canberra about what they want on carbon and energy policy. ""The key is going to be that as a nation we need to start demanding these things and expecting these things,"" he said. ""If you polled the room it would say 'we have really had enough of this to be quite honest', and it is time now to start moving beyond it. We do have the capabilities, we have the leadership talent in this country, we have the leadership talent in Canberra and in the states and we need to let them loose."" \"
"COP24","Australia","COP24_Australia32","OECD says we won't meet emissions target","December 10, 2018 Monday","The Australian","Australia needs a ""stable, stronger and co-ordinated climate change policy"" and will not meet its Paris Agreement emissions reductions target, a new OECD report says. The OECD Economic Survey of Australia for 2018 says Scott Morrison's emissions targets are ""insufficiently ambitious"" and Australia remains among the top 10 carbon emitters per capita in the 34-strong economic group of OECD nations. The report comes a week after Malcolm Turnbull called on the Coalition to revive the national energy guarantee he dumped in the dying days of his prime ministership, and accused a ""minority of MPs"" of trying to ""blow up the governme-nt"" over climate policy. ""As for many OECD countries, this target has been assessed as insufficien-tly ambitious to be consiste-nt with limiting global climat-e change to well below 2C, as required by the Paris Agreement,"" the report reads. ""Emissions projections from 2017 show these targets will not be reached."" The OECD report welcomes the lack of any commitment to build new coal-fired power plants, but criticises moves to expand coalmining. ""No projects for new carbon-fired power plants are being pursue-d, which is welcome in the context of reaching the -climate objecti-ves of the Paris Agreement,"" the report reads. ""However, there are plans to allow further expansion of coalmining, which runs counter to the need for the global decarbonisation of energy supply."" Environment Minister Melissa Price is due in Katowice, Poland, today for the COP24 Summit, the biggest climate change conference since the one in Paris in 2015. A spokeswoman for Ms Price said the government was ""committed to the Paris Agreement"".""Our 2030 target (26-28 per cent below 2005 levels) is strong and responsible,"" she said.

Soft power involves trying to influence other countries using culture, values and policies. South Africa is one of the African countries that has taken advantage of the opportunity that the use of soft power presents. It's successfully hosted international summits and sporting events such as the 2011 United Nations Climate Change Conference and the 2010 World Cup football tournament. I would HYPERLINK https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02533952.2018.1492833 argue that Nigeria, with its impressive soft power capabilities, has surprisingly lagged behind. There are three key ways in which Nigeria exercises some degree of soft power. These are HYPERLINK http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/product_info.php?products_id=806818 culture , \~ HYPERLINK https://www.africa.com/brand-africa-100-africas-best-brands-2017-18/ business and foreign policy programmes that send Nigerians abroad to help with \~ HYPERLINK https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-62202-6_12 peacekeeping and skills training. Despite having remarkable soft power resources, there's no coordination of efforts to harness their potential. Compare this to HYPERLINK China , that has used its soft power assets to extend influence across the world. This has included building Confucius Institutes, exporting cheap products and offering development assistance. These have shaped the preferences of other states and consequently helped it to emerge a global power. Abuja does not manage its soft power carefully. HYPERLINK https://www.eiu.com/topic/democracy-index Democracy Index , \~ HYPERLINK https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2018 The Freedom House , the \~ HYPERLINK http://s.mo.ibrahim.foundation/u/2018/11/27173840/2018-Index-Report.pdf?_ga=2.91277018.1989544098.1548941645-1329949972.1548941645 Mo Ibrahim Governance Index HYPERLINK https://www.transparency.org/cpi2018 Index that all measure democratic governance. This damages Nigeria's democracy credentials and undermines its moral authority to promote effective governance across the continent. The influence of Nollywood One of the most potent promoters of Nigeria's cultural soft power is arguably Nollywood. The country' movie industry has displaced Hollywood and Bollywood as the most important movie industry HYPERLINK http://cesran.org/attractions-and-limitations-of-nigerias-soft-power.html on the continent . It has also overshadowed local content across Africa and its diaspora. It's now the world's second largest producer of \~ HYPERLINK https://www.pwc.com/ng/en/assets/pdf/spolight-the-nigerian-film-industry.pdf films after Bollywood Its increasing appeal is demonstrated by HYPERLINK https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254095363_Global_Nollywood_The_Nigerian_Movie_Industry_and_Alternative_Global_Networks_in_Production_and_Distribution its visibility in the Americas, Europe, and the Caribbean. Among African viewers, the extent of Nollywood's influence can be heard in mimicking the Nigerian accent, growth of Nigerian pidgin English, and Nigerian fashion. Nigerian music has also made inroads. For example, Nigerian musicians have HYPERLINK https://allafrica.com/view/group/main/main/id/00046669.html dominated the MTV Africa Music Awards since their inauguration in 2008. And many black British and American artists are of Nigerian origin. Some, such as \~ HYPERLINK https://www.allmusic.com/artist/jidenna-mn0003397779/biography Jidenna and \~ HYPERLINK http://www.musicaltheatrenews.com/artists/simon-webbe.html Simon Webbe , have used their fame to promote Nigerian culture, and to challenge negative stereotypes of their ancestral home. Both Nollywood and the music industry provide the platforms to challenge the negative portrayal of Nigeria and its 180 million citizens as purveyors of corruption, drug-trafficking, terrorism, fraud, and internet scams. But neither has been able to shift the dial in Nigeria's favour. Take Nollywood, it has failed to exert the same sort of influence as Hollywood in the US which not only showcases the US's economic and military might but also its cultural hegemony. This is in no small part a consequence of the HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/hollywood-cia-washington-dc-films-fbi-24-intervening-close-relationship-a7918191.html US government's significant support to the industry . Compare this with the HYPERLINK https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/235490-nigerian-govt-gives-nollywood-extra-n420-million-grant.html small grants offered to Nollywood. These are clearly insignificant given the potential of the industry. Nigerian volunteers In the realm of foreign policy, Nigeria's soft power is illustrated by its peacemaking and peacekeeping roles. This is most notable in countries such as http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-07/30/c_136483216.htm Liberia , \~ HYPERLINK https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/mjss.2018.8.issue-4-1/mjss-2018-0079/mjss-2018-0079.pdf Sierra Leone , \~ HYPERLINK https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-23369865 Mali and Sudan's \~ HYPERLINK https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nigeria-un-mali/nigeria-to-pull-many-peacekeepers-from-mali-darfur-idUSBRE96I0PA20130719 Darfur region. This is addition to contributions to regional integration in West Africa and liberation struggles in southern Africa. Nigeria's Technical Aid Corps has served as an institutional platform to project the country's soft power. Through this initiative, Nigeria sends volunteers to countries with a dearth of skills in fields such as architecture, engineering, law, medicine, and science. Since its inception three decades ago, more than 4000 volunteers have been deployed to over 38 countries. Ongoing requests for these volunteers serve as proof that Nigeria's skilled workers are in demand. Nevertheless, the technical volunteer programme and Abuja's overall foreign policy have failed to change anti-Nigerian sentiments fundamentally. This reflects a lack of coordinated efforts by the Nigerian government to subtly use the opportunity presented by the Technical Aid Corps. Seizing the opportunity Given these realities, Nigeria is, at best, a potential soft power state. While its soft power resources are greater than most other African states, its soft power influence leaves much to be desired. To ameliorate this situation, Abuja should take advantage of the soft power resources at the country's disposal. West Africa's Gulliver has abundant human and material resources. Nollywood needs to reinvent itself to shape the perception of its African audiences about the country. Nigerian policymakers and academics, finally, must engage the sources and implications of Nigeria's soft power.

How can the transport sector, drawing on the full range of affordable technological developments, contribute to attaining climate change mitigation objectives? The increasing diversification of drive technologies, along with production and use of renewable fuels, constitute challenges for sustainable renewable mobility, yet also provide the key to achieving the targets. The extensive programme offers a variety of topics with relevance for increasing climate protection in individual and heavy goods traffic, as well as in the fields of aviation and shipping. On the opening day, the focus will be on mobility, set between the conflicting priorities of climate protection, economic efficiency and user acceptance. In the plenary session, representatives from the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure, the European Parliament, European agriculture, the petroleum and automotive industries and the scientific community will discuss future prospects for the transport sector. On the second day of the conference, 11 forums will examine a broad spectrum of topics from all areas of renewable energy in the mobility sector: German and international experts will present news on technical developments, research, certification, market analysis and trade flows, as well as entering into discussions with conference participants.

In a farewell address in Canberra yesterday, Menna Rawlings said Britain had avoided the same problem it had reduced its reliance on coal under Margaret Thatcher decades ago. Asked whether she was surprised by disagreement within the conservative side of Australian politics about carbon emissions, Ms Rawlings noted bipartisanship existed at home. ""And it's very different here but you have to ask why is it different? Why is it so much more important here? I think coal is just still so much more important in Australia than it has been in the UK for decades. ""Something about Australia - it's about the land and the earth.

Dermophis donaldtrumpi , 10 centimetres in length and belonging to group of snakelike animals called caecilians, was recently found in Panama by a group of scientists. Its naming rights were auctioned off in a fundraiser for Rainforest Trust, a non-profit rainforest conservation organisation. The winning bid of $34,478 was made by Aidan Bell, the head of a UK-based sustainable building materials company called EnviroBuild. ""It is the perfect name,"" Mr Bell told The Guardian. ""Caecilian is taken from the Latin caecus, meaning 'blind', perfectly mirroring the strategic vision President Trump has consistently shown towards climate change,"" he said. Mr Bell said Mr Trump's worldview resembled a caecilian's, whose eyes can only detect light and dark. ""Capable of seeing the world only in black and white. Donald Trump has claimed that climate change is a hoax by the Chinese,"" he added. Caecilians lost their limbs at least 60 million years ago to better burrow in the earth, and live almost entirely underground. To that, Mr Bell said: ""Burrowing its head underground helps Donald Trump when avoiding scientific consensus on anthropomorphic climate change and also appointed several energy lobbyists to the Environment Agency, where their job is to regulate the energy industry."" Mr Bell also took aim at Mr Trump's family. ""The dermophisgenus grows an extra layer of skin which their young use their teeth to peel off and eat, a behaviour known as dermatrophy,"" he wrote.

"COP24","Australia","COP24_Australia41","Coalition won't lift 2030 target: minister","December 5, 2018 Wednesday","Canberra Times (Australia)","The Morrison government has no intention of lifting Australia's commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions, Environment Minister Melissa Price said, as she prepared to fly to a major climate summit in Poland. Ms Price said the government remains ""confident"" the nation can achieve its pledge - made three years ago at Paris - to slice 2005 levels emissions 26-28 per cent by 2030 even though pollution is at seven-year highs. The UN's 24th Conference of the Parties - known as COP24 - began last Sunday in the Polish city of Katowice. Ms Price, who will be Australia's most senior delegate, is not due to arrive until Sunday to attend the final week. One key objective of the summit will be for nations to agree on the ""Paris Rulebook"" that is aimed at guiding nations to fulfil their promised reductions and to make those cuts more transparent and comparable. A second aim is to conclude the so-called Talanoa Dialogue to assess how pledges are tracking in terms of meeting the Paris goal of keeping global warming to well under two degrees, compared with pre-industrial times. Current pledges, even if implemented, would probably see warming closer to three degrees, resulting in worsening climate extremes including the demise of the great bulk of the world's coral reefs. While the government has sought to stress Australia's carbon emissions as a share of economic output and per capita were at 28-year lows, new analysis by Climate Analytics shows pollution rates are more than twice the average of G20 nations. Emissions intensity, for instance, in Australia in 2015 was higher than the US and twice that of the European Union, the emissions tracking group found. ""With current policies, Australia is not projected to catch up - indeed, it is projected to be overtaken by China by 2030 and stay far behind more-efficient and less- polluting economies such as Japan [and] the EU,"" Climate Analytics said. ""The latest round of major international climate change negotiations could prove embarrassing for Australia, given we are not on track to meet even our weak target for 2030,"" Kelly O'Shanassy, chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, said. ""But embarrassment could be the least of our problems. The Australian government's addiction to coal may result in diplomatic and trade implications if Australia refuses to do our fair share to limit global warming."" \"

In a speech on Wednesday at the COP24 climate talks in Katowice, Ms Price said Australia was ""committed to the Paris Agreement"" and the development of a ""robust rulebook"" to implement the pact. ""The clear message from the dialogue is that we must act, and act together, because climate change affects us all, and Australia must play its part,"" Ms Price said. ""Our clean energy finance corporation, the world's largest green bank, has leveraged nearly $20 billion in low-emissions technology investment,"" she said, adding that Australia would also help ""fuel the battery storage revolution"" with its large reserves of lithium. Australia was also implementing its $1 billion commitment to climate finance to 2020, focused on ""building resilience in the Pacific, one of the most vulnerable regions in the world,"" she said. Richie Merzian, a climate researcher with The Australia Institute, said the speech ""relied almost entirely on policies her government tried to kill off or water down"". He also criticised the climate finance pledge, saying Prime Minister Scott Morrison ""had trashed and cut support for UN's key climate finance body, the Green Climate Fund"". Australia's policies also copped flak from The Climate Action Network, an alliance of 1300 environmental groups, which declared the country ""fossil of the day"" for its four years of rising greenhouse gas emissions. The network also raised the issue, first reported by the Herald, that Australia had ""remained silent"" about whether it planned to use any surplus from the Kyoto Protocol period - possibly 400 million tonnes worth - to count against its Paris target. Ms Price's Labor counterpart, Mark Butler, has also continued to not rule out the use of any Kyoto credits for its post-2020 targets. ""It's not clear whether the so-called rulebook for the Paris Agreement will allow a carry-over,"" he told Radio National on Thursday. ""If it does, we would have to consider any conditions about that,"" he said, adding, ""My bias is to steer very clear of cop-outs and accounting tricks when it comes to climate change policies."" Greens climate spokesman Adam Bandt said: ""It is disappointing that Mark Butler has left the door open to cooking the books to meet their Paris commitment. The analysis is clear that up to a quarter of Labor's target could be met by fake Kyoto credits if they follow the Coalition and pull the same dodgy accounting tricks."" \"

The six-day meeting, which ended on Sunday, was scheduled to step up progress in the battle against rising global carbon emissions by adopting a completed text that could be presented at the COP24 conference in Katowice, Poland, three months from now. A primary objective of the 2015 Paris agreement, to which 190 nations including Australia subscribe, is to limit the global temperature increase by 2100 to less than 2 degrees Celsius and as close as possible to 1.5C, which is vital to the survival of island nations threatened by rising seas. But the absence of guidelines for meeting that goal has led to fears that not enough action is being taken. There have been notable disagreements over fair financing for implementation of the rules by developing countries, and the technical details of their reporting on progress. Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, said on Sunday that progress was made on most issues but nothing was finalised. The meeting was attended by representatives of most of the countries party to the Paris agreement, as well as the United States, which has announced that it is pulling out of the pact. Espinosa said there was ""limited progress"" on the issue of contributions from developed nations to developing countries, adding that she is ""hopeful"" that future discussions will be productive because of the importance of the issue. ""On the core issues of forward-looking climate finance and the degree of flexibility developing countries should be given on the information and reporting requirements for national commitments under the Paris Agreement, negotiators were stalemated in Bangkok,"" said a statement from Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a US-based activist group. Harjeet Singh, climate policy manager for ActionAid International, said on Sunday that a vital component of the Paris agreement is for wealthy nations to provide financial assistance to developing countries as they fight natural disasters brought by climate change. But he said wealthy and developed countries ""led by the United States and including countries such as Australia, Japan and even the European Union"" refused to clearly show ""how much money they are going to provide and how that is going to be counted"". Activists were critical of Washington's lobbying at the meeting, especially because President Donald Trump has announced plans to have the US withdraw from the Paris pact, which had been heavily promoted by his predecessor, Barack Obama. ""The US has announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement but still negotiates as if it is a party, weakening international co-operation by not contributing to finance and technology transfer to developing countries,"" Meena Raman, legal adviser at Third World Network, said in an emailed statement.

The study, conducted by Unfriend Coal, a group of international environmentalist groups including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and Market Forces, surveyed some of the world's largest insurers on their exposure to coal. The results were released to coincide with this week's United Nations COP24 climate change summit in Poland. Insurers were scored on the degree to which they were divesting or refusing to provide insurance to coal companies, or were making clear plans to move in that direction. European insurers scored the highest, with Swiss Re topping the list, followed by Generali, Zurich, Allianz and AXA. US, Japanese and Australian companies all scored poorly. QBE, the only Australian insurer included in the survey, was slapped with a score of zero on both underwriting and divestment. ""The scorecard clearly shows that QBE is falling behind its international competitors on climate action,"" Market Forces campaigner Pablo Brait said. ""Major insurers like Axa, Allianz and Zurich have dumped their coal company shares and are restricting their underwriting of coal. QBE continues to do nothing in this area despite climate change-fuelled natural disasters threatening its profits and entire business model."" QBE is regarded as the main Australian insurer active in the underwriting of coal companies. IAG, by comparison, has no exposure to coal on the underwriting side, and has reduced its investments in ""emissions intensive industries"" to 0.25 per cent of total assets. Suncorp, meanwhile, said fossil fuel activities made up just 1 per cent of its insurance activities. QBE would not reveal its exposure to coal on either the investment or underwriting side. However it plans to release ""enhanced disclosure"" of its fossil fuel investments in its annual report in February, with the figure expected to be small. QBE will review its fossil fuel underwriting activities next year, with a similar ""enhanced disclosure"" in the February 2020 annual report. Mr Brait told The Australian Financial Review that getting a clear idea of QBE's exposure to fossil fuels had so far proved impossible. ""QBE refuses to disclose its underwriting exposure to coal, oil and gas, but we know ... that QBE underwrites fossil fuel infrastructure like the Liddell coal-fired power station in NSW and the BP Deepwater Horizon oil rig which tragically exploded in the gulf of Mexico in 2010. ""QBE admitted at its 2017 annual general meeting that it has a business relationship with Adani, underwriting some of its shipping operations."" QBE declined to comment on its alleged exposure to Adani and Liddell. However the Financial Review understands it is unlikely to insure Adani's Carmichael project in Queensland. \"

Australia has unveiled an ambitious suite of policies to cement its position in the region and push back against China, including a massive new infrastructure bank and an ambitious move to electrify much of Papua New Guinea. But Mr Sopoaga declared climate change could ""totally destroy"" his tiny Pacific nation, and he called on Australia to help fight it by blocking the contentious Adani coal mine in Queensland and making deeper cuts to carbon emissions. ""We cannot be regional partners under this step-up initiative - genuine and durable partners - unless the Government of Australia takes a more progressive response to climate change,"" Mr Sopoaga said. ""They know very well that we will not be happy as a partner, to move forward, unless they are serious."" Tuvalu's low-lying atolls are particularly vulnerable Delegates from almost 200 countries are gathering in the city of Katowice for the COP24 talks, the most important UN meeting on global warming since the landmark Paris deal. Tuvalu is made up of nine low-lying coral atolls and its highest point is only 4.5 metres above sea level, making it particularly vulnerable to climate change. US President Donald Trump has already pulled the US out of Paris and Mr Sopoaga warned the world risked ""going backwards"" unless countries made concrete commitments to cut pollution. Mr Sopoaga also said all Pacific nations - including Australia and New Zealand - would sign a ""new declaration"" on climate change during the talks in Poland. ""The idea is to further project to our world the necessity and imperative of collective actions against climate change,"" Mr Sopoaga told the ABC. Pacific nations tip-toe around Canberra But the ABC understands the climate change statement has not yet been raised with Australia. Mr Sopoaga was not purely critical of Australia - he praised Prime Minister Scott Morrison for resisting calls to get out of the Paris deal, and said Australia was ""seriously looking"" at taking a more ambitious approach on renewable energy. But he pleaded with the Coalition to prevent Indian company Adani from HYPERLINK https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-11-29/adani-carmichael-coal-mine-go-ahead-plans-to-self-fund/10567848 pressing ahead with its plan to open a new coal mine in Queensland , although the project has been scaled down.

Something that might help is counting old credits, left over from the Kyoto targets, the first in 2012 and the second due in 2020, which Australia is expected to meet with a significant excess. The Climate Council's Professor Will Steffen said that would be using past accounting systems to apply a future reduction - using ""accounting fiddles to weaken even their pathetically weak target for 2030"". COP24 , the major annual summit on climate change is currently taking place at Katowice in Poland. ""So it's not clear to what extent there will or will not be rules around the use of surplus credits towards the 2030 targets,"" Professor Jotzo said. ""The name of the game really is transparency, and that's the provisions that many countries are aiming to tighten."" As to whether or not counting old credits would be legitimate, he said the 2030 Paris pledges were clear: countries will reduce emissions to a specified level in 2030. ""There's really no ifs and buts ... our expectation would clearly be that earlier surplus credits will not be used to justify an underachievement on the 2030 targets,"" Professor Jotzo said. The Labor Party has committed to a 45-per-cent emissions-reduction target by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050, but it won't comment on the question of credits. And the Federal Government hasn't responded to the ABC's request for comment on the matter either. Why it's not fair If Australia did come in miles ahead in its Kyoto targets, why should those not count towards its Paris 2030 targets? ""This is basically an accounting fiddle,"" Professor Steffen said. He described counting that excess towards the 2030 target as ""a loophole"". ""That's a tactic that other countries have not done explicitly, because they don't think it's fair,"" he said. Those countries are Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden. He said Australia's Kyoto target was ""completely inadequate"" from a scientific perspective, and ""pathetically weak"". ""It was a concession made by the other countries just to get Australia in the tent,"" he said. According to Professor Steffen, Australia's Paris target was equally devoid of scientific merit. ""So why should we use yet another fiddle to even get less action on climate change?"" The Paris targets are non-binding, but Dr Bruce Mountain, the director of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, said counting credits from the Kyoto targets was fundamentally against the spirit of the Paris agreement. ""To be honest, I find the whole discussion somewhat spurious,"" HYPERLINK http://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/pm/will-australia-reach-its-2030-climate-targets-using-a-loophole/10608330 he told PM .

My challenge to you and all those hundreds of thousands of (scientists) you speak of is: explain to little old me. Why has there been so many ice ages and global warmings over the millions of years to the present? Explain to me why the CO2 level has been many, many times higher than it is now? If you can explain these two queries, you have got me for life. These questions are only from the first barrel of a barrage. Really looking forward to your reply for the education and good of humanity. John Britton, Brinsmead Water and transport I COMPLETELY fail to understand the short term thinking common in news articles in relation to both transport and water issues. Having heard Sir David Attenborough's G20 speech only reinforces what I think we need to do. Why are we talking of building yet more dams to increase our water holding capacity when we should only be talking about using less water. I'm referring to Australia's 90 per cent of urban/residential/rural-residential population, not farming. The average water consumption in Cairns is 300l per person, per day, which I think is just ludicrous. An entire family can live on that for a week in many countries. The average consumption in Port Douglas is 1200l per person, per day. It's astounding. While the Tablelands average probably cannot be calculated as so many properties have unlimited creek/river/bore usage - which also needs to be changed - I regularly check my metre and have averaged 100l per person, per day, for the last three years. No, we don't smell, and yes, we have a garden. We should all be doing that, before we end up like Capetown, or worse. Same with transport. Why are we talking of spending billions on the Kuranda Range road, when there are already two forms of infrastructure that could be used far more effectively? Others have already suggested using the railway for freight, which makes sense, and could be easily done. Surely the rail could also cater for locals at a discounted rate to save everyone taking their own car? And why can't all of the Kuranda/Cairns commuters go down and back in the Skyrail, filling their empty cars at peak times? A government subsidy would still be cheaper for us than building tunnels. Plus, make carpooling during peak hours compulsory, at least three days a week. North Queensland could become a shining example on both fronts, to prove we care about our rainforest environment and the Reef, and are doing all we can to look after it. Maybe our bigger cities would finally take notice if we were the leaders. Jo Zapala, Malanda Gas find a disaster WHEN will we understand that a ""Huge gas find"" (CP, 6/12) might be good for business but a disaster for the planet? Sir David Attenborough supported by the Australian Academy of Science has addressed the COP24 climate conference in Poland this week warning of the collapse of civilisation unless we act immediately to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We can no longer invest in products that will cause catastrophic climate change. We have a decade to reduce our emissions.

The communique was HYPERLINK http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-05/pacific-islands-forum-what-will-the-leaders-be-discussing/10201272 signed at the end of the Pacific Islands Forum in Nauru , attended by large and small island states as well as New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Australia's Foreign Minister Marise Payne. But there was last-minute wrangling over the language on climate change, with some Pacific nations privately accusing Australia of trying to water down the final declaration from leaders. Australia would also not back a statement from small island states which calls for countries to ""urgently accelerate"" reductions in carbon emissions. Tuvalu's Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga didn't directly name Australia, but when pressed by journalists confirmed a country ""starting with a capital A"" had objected. ""The issues are so critical for leaders of smaller island states because of their vulnerability to climate change,"" Mr Sopoaga said. ""We appealed to Forum leaders to endorse [the statement] so we can walk the talk.""

Mr Waqa lashed out at the official during the meeting's final press conference, and said Nauru would try to escalate the dispute. ""Would he behave like that in front of his own President? ... You look at him, he's a nobody!"" Mr Waqa said. ""We won't just seek an apology, we'll even take it to the UN."" Tensions first flared when Chinese officials were unable to enter Nauru on diplomatic passports. Nauru is one of the Pacific nations which recognises Taiwan rather than Beijing - and the episode highlighted the way their contest for influence can stir conflict in the region. Pacific 'increasingly crowded and complex' The Boe declaration recognises the Pacific's ""dynamic geopolitical environment"", which was leading to ""an increasingly crowded and complex region"". China's increasing presence in the region has been in the spotlight in recent months, especially its HYPERLINK /news/2018-08-16/tonga-leads-pacific-call-for-china-to-forgive-debts/10124792 loans for large-scale infrastructure projects in island nations .

Foreign Minister Marise Payne announced that Australia would also work to establish a new centre focused on ""strengthening the ability of Pacific governments to enforce their laws and protect their sovereignty."" Senator Payne said the new Pacific Fusion Centre, to be established in mid-2019, will provide Pacific decision makers with information needed to better identify and respond to security threats, such as illegal fishing, people smuggling and narcotics trafficking. In addition to the new centre, Senator Payne said Australia would help provide strategic policy development in the region with a new Australia Pacific Security College, to be established in early 2019. \"
"COP24","Australia","COP24_Australia53","Why we should all follow Greta's lead","April 11, 2019 Thursday","The Courier","On March 15 this year more than 1.5 million children, young people and their supporters protested for urgent action on climate change. That it has taken 16-year-old student Greta Thunberg to ignite that sense of urgency so many feel, into popular action, is primarily testament to her clarity of vision and direct approach. To those politicians who say children should be in class and not trying to tell political leaders what to do, Greta replied: ""Good, we want you to talk to scientists.' A once lone protester, whose solitary stance outside the Swedish house of parliament struck a global chord, Greta is now inspiring millions to follow her example. She has cut through the mainstream news media's muddled messaging on climate change, something that few have achieved - petite and earnest, refreshingly lacking affectations, she's a teenager who tells it like it is. In the last few months she has addressed: the UN Climate Summit, COP24 in Poland; the Davos global gathering of wealth and power; Berlin's film world glitterati; and won the Prix Libert&#xE9; worth 25,000 Euros - which she passed on to four climate action groups - as well as being nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. But why, when we have a host of talented science journalists and communicators - many working within the mainstream media - has it taken so long for climate change to get this kind of attention? It seems the younger generation in taking their lead from Greta, are following what commonsense tells them. They have grown up with climate change, with meteorological records being broken year after year with increasingly extreme temperatures, floods, bushfires and cyclones. The doubt fostered by deniers finds little purchase among this generation, which knows that climate change is here and happening now. Their collective survival instinct has been triggered. While older generations have turned away from accepting the worst, presumably hoping it won't happen in their life time, youth are seeing their future disappear before their very eyes. Acceptance of the science of anthropogenic climate change has finally become commonplace. But achieving carbon neutrality within 11 years, the deadline identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in order to contain global warming to 1.5&#xBA;C, will be very challenging. While most media coverage of the topic tends to focus on state and federal government, there is arguably more happening on the ground at the local level. Many local communities have been moving on renewable energy for some time. In May 2017, the Municipal Association of Victoria - the peak body for 79 local governments in Victoria - passed a climate emergency motion, with 77 per cent support. In November 2018, the City of Ballarat endorsed this statement of climate emergency, and by March this year, 423 councils around the world representing 36 million citizens had followed suit. At Ballarat council's April meeting last Wednesday, councillors voted unanimously to endorse the carbon neutrality and 100 per cent renewables action plan by 2025. The plan was developed by council, staff in consultation with several community groups, notably the Regional Sustainability Alliance of Ballarat and the Ballarat Climate Action Network, and drew on considerable local expertise. Other ground-breaking projects are under way in this region. North-east of Ballarat, the Hepburn Shire, with the help of its community-owned windfarm, plans to be powered 100 per cent by renewable energy by 2030 - Australia's first zero-net emissions community, while nearby, Daylesford is already Australia's first zero-net energy town. On Sunday, April 14, following the lead set by students in March, many Ballarat citizens will join in the Walk Against Warming around Lake Wendouree to show support for action on climate change - at the personal, community, state and federal government level. This is a nonpartisan issue. It is now a matter critical to human well-being and to the well-being of our community, as confirmed by Ballarat Council's endorsement of the MAV statement of Climate Emergency. As Ballarat student protest organiser Rosa, channelling Greta, said at the March protest in Deakin Place: ""I don't want you to hope, I want you to panic. The house is on fire.""

"COP24","Australia","COP24_Australia54","EXPENSIVE ELECTION LOOMS","December 18, 2018 Tuesday","The Australian","Expect Labor and the Coalition to throw cash around It was a nice, if ominous, irony that while Opposition Leader Bill Shorten was inside the Adelaide Convention Centre on Sunday promising more government spending when he becomes prime minister, protesters were outside, and inside, promising to fight the Adani coal mine, and coal mining generally. Elsewhere the MYEFO papers were being printed with duelling spending promises from the government. In each case that was just the beginning of what is likely to be one of the most spendthrift election campaigns in history, because a $10 billion-plus revenue windfall has hit the budget in 2018. The irony? That much of the revenue windfall has come from coal, the object of so much angst, and it is ominous because for that reason there's a good chance we are in for a second dose of what happened between 2004 and 2008. Those years saw a commodity-led budget windfall that produced big budget surpluses as well as big, permanent, increases in spending as the Howard government tried to buy a fifth term. Unfortunately, the increase in revenue proved to be a lot less permanent than the spending, as the terms of trade collapsed, locking in 11 deficits and taking public debt from nothing to $350bn. The current increase in revenue will be temporary as well, not for the same reason as the last time but the effect is likely to be the same, if not worse. The reason tax revenue collapsed last time was the global financial crisis in 2008 followed by the devastating breakdown in commodity prices in 2011-12. This time is likely to be different, but the same: China's economy is in a structural slowdown, as evidenced by Friday's latest batch of data, and the world is moving away from coal. That's not because of protests like the anti-Adani ones in Adelaide on Sunday, but because the Paris Agreement on emissions reduction was further solidified at COP24 in Poland on the weekend and because the cost of renewable energy has fallen to below that of coal. The price of thermal coal has been falling since July after a strong rise in the previous 12 months. Obviously the revenue windfall revealed in MYEFO is not entirely, or even mostly, due to thermal coal, but that's an important part of it. The rest of it is iron ore, coking coal and LNG, exports of which to China have been growing strongly this year, in both price and volume. There is now a question mark over how long that will last. But for the moment, things couldn't be better. Treasury's estimate of nominal GDP - the main driver of taxation revenue - was previously 3.75 per cent for 2018-19. Thanks to the stronger than anticipated terms of trade, that's now much higher, and the deficit is shrinking faster than it did in the early 2000s. As a result of that, the government now has a whopping war chest for the 2019 election and of course the Labor Party has the same chest, plus a bit more because of ""tough decisions"" on dividend franking, negative gearing and capital gains tax. There can be nothing worse for the health of future budgets than the combination of a temporary lift in tax revenue and a federal election, especially one where a Coalition government is well behind in the polls and likely to lose, and is going to bring down a pre-election budget. That's because like the MYEFO, the April budget will contain more actual locked-in spending increases, not just campaign promises - like the pre-election budget of 2007 did - and then on top of that we get the campaign promises of Labor on top of those spending increases in the budget, after they win the election. And then we get the cyclical commodity downturn as China's economy slows, this time with an Australian property collapse and likely household consumption recession, plus a global agreement on carbon emissions, thrown in. It could be a very expensive election indeed.Alan Kohler is the editor in chief of InvestSMART. \"
"COP24","Australia","COP24_Australia55","We should keep to the long-term vision of a zero carbon economy by 2050: Manuel Pulgar-Vidal","December 4, 2018 Tuesday","ABC Transcripts (Australia) PM 6:47 PM AEST","LINDA MOTTRAM: So China says it unswervingly supports the multilateral process of tackling climate change. Its delegates at the latest climate conference in Poland describe green and low-carbon development as the ""big trend"" that's irreversible. In stark contrast, the Trump administration remains determined to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. It can't do that formally for another two years but it's rolling back a slew of Obama-era climate regulations and shifting incentives to the fossil fuel sector - even as experts warn the world is nowhere near meeting its target of limiting average global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees by the end of the century. At the COP24 ANTONIO GUTERRES: We are in trouble. We are in deep trouble with climate change. According to the World Meteorological Organization, the 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years, the concentration of carbon dioxide is the highest it has been in three million years and emissions are now growing again. LINDA MOTTRAN: So the only answer, experts say, and its locked in the Paris Agreement, is to phase out the use of fossil fuels by 2050. So what are the prospects? Manuel Pulgar-Vidal is a former president of the UN-FCCC, the Framework Convention on Climate Change, and a former environment minister in Peru. Currently he heads Climate and Energy Practice for WWF International and he joins me from Katowice. Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, thank you very much for joining us. The Trump administration is rolling back climate measures and encouraging fossil fuels, but at the conference the former California Governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, offered some hope about the US. Here he is. ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER: We have leadership in Washington that is backwards, but America as a country did not drop out of the Paris Agreement. The mayors and the governors are still on board, the private sector is in. The financial sector is in, the universities and the academic sector is in. Everyone is still in. We still are marching in the right direction. LINDA MOTTRAM: Everyone is marching in the right direction except the Federal Government. Is he right about that, Manuel Pulgar-Vidal? MANUEL PULGAR-VIDAL: Yeah, hello Linda, morning to you all. Let me say some something about the Trump administration: Despite of the announcement to have the US withdraw with the Paris Agreement, we should keep the long-term vision, and that is happening in America. Two strong things: most of the Americans are with the Paris Agreement - and this initiative by the non-state actors, mostly the business sector, that is called 'We are still in', is showing that the non-state actors' agenda is defining clear (inaudible) targets, and those targets are strongly based on science. Because everybody knows that it is an irreversible and unstoppable process. So I think, Linda, that what we should be pleased to see that when we keep the long term vision, that political difficulties should be seen as a political accident. Let me put the example of the G20. Despite of the opposition of the US, the Argentina presidential- presidency, sorry, of the G20 has gotten a communique, and the communique is strong, it is good, it is enough to continue moving the process forward. LINDA MOTTRAM: But, I mean, China's delegates are saying all the right things, but China's record is mixed - as are many other countries - India, Japan, South Korea, there's some rekindling of the love of coal. Isn't there evidence here that the global effort is at risk of falling apart? MANUEL PULGAR-VIDAL: Yeah, there are for sure some risks. But again, if we are able to keep the idea of a 2050 pathway towards a zero net carbon economy by 2050, I think that we could continue pushing this idea forward. Because as much, Linda, as there are countries that are thinking to withdraw the Paris Agreement, as much as new leadership are emerging - and that is really important. The US used to be, in Obama's time, the leader of this process towards a Paris Agreement, and after that, he was replaced some way by France, by Canada, by the European Union, among some others, and that is what we are going to have. Yesterday I was using this analogy: If we are planning to go from the northern part of Canada to the southern part of Argentina, in the road I am sure that we are going to have some good roads and highways, and some other not so good, some big holes. Probably we are going to have some difficulties with the car. That is the risk that we are going to face in this process. But we should continue keeping the idea of moving the planet agenda forward, because we at the time in which we should implement in Paris and draw out good elements that could keep our optimism to do that. Let me say one more thing: We can see that this COP24 in Katowice in a negative way or positive way, that it is in the most important region for coal workers and coal industry in Poland - and more to the positive way. So in some ways, Linda, what we are doing here in Katowice, it is sending a message to the coal industry that the phase-out of coal, it is irreversible. But on the other hand that we are going to work strongly, in just transition and including social considerations, to that phase-out - because that is the way in which we are going to kick out of the fossil fuels in some time soon. LINDA MOTTRAM: Well, optimism, pessimism, I think there is a lot of swinging between those. I mean, the warnings that we heard from David Attenborough, for example, about civilizational calamity if more is not done. I mean, is it realistic, do you think, that by 2050 we will meet that 1.5 degree goal, or are we going to go well beyond that because at the moment we are on target to go well beyond it? MANUEL PULGAR-VIDAL: I am fully, fully sure that we are going to keep the 1.5 by 2050. But for sure, the point it is if we can go there with overshooting or not overshooting, so that is why we are pushing the agenda as a way to really have a strong reduction of carbon emissions. That is the way. And on the other hand, we don't know exactly what it would happen and what role it could play, that middle technology that is going to emerge for the next 32 years. Thirty-two years, it is a timeframe from now until 2050 in which many things could happen. But I am sure that this awareness and the presence of some elements of science, new financial flows. We are in a strong agenda of the non-state actors. Some new leaders that are emerging, new mobilisation could make us able to really get with success the 1.5 by 2050. LINDA MOTTRAM: The voices of young people are being highlighted. Fifteen-year-old Greta Thunberg stopped going to school for three weeks to protest outside the Swedish Parliament for climate action. Here she is speaking earlier at the meeting in Poland: GRETA THUNBERG: There was some youths in the USA that refused to go to school because of the school shootings, and then someone said 'What if children did that, refused to go to school, but for the climate?' And then I thought it was a very good idea and I thought that hasn't been done before in this purpose. LINDA MOTTRAM: Students here were also on strike in Australia last week on climate. MANUEL PULGAR-VIDAL: Yes, for sure, yes. I think that the voice of youth, it is really important to mobilise political leaders and the strongest leaders towards taking some strong decisions. And remember, Linda, that it is not just about COP, it is about many places, many rooms in different levels in which the politicians should take decisions to address climate change. The COP, it is the most important place to take those kind of decisions - but also on the other hand, the economic sector should continue defining strong targets based on science, and we do need to have the mobilisation of people. And the people and the citizens have their roles to play. The first one it is to bring pressure to politicians and authorities and government; but on the other hand, also to take their behaviour. Because climate change, it is about behaviour, it is about consumers. So the equation it is politicians and authorities in COP, economic sectors and a world and committed citizens. From Poland, Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, who is a former president of the UN-FCCC, and a former environment minister in Peru currently with WWF International. \"
"COP24","Australia","COP24_Australia56","Writer Stanley Johnson no bush basher","December 8, 2018 Saturday","Newcastle Herald (Australia)","HE looks very much like his eldest son. Or the son looks very much like him. He has the same cheeky schoolboy's face and a mop of hair falling over his forehead. But Stanley Johnson is not just the father of Boris Johnson, former Lord Mayor of London, ex-British Foreign Secretary and a central player in the Brexit maze. Stanley Johnson is also a former politician, an environmentalist and a writer of 25 novels and non-fiction books. Yet this week, the Englishman's snow-coloured hair has been glimmering under the Australian summer sun, as he visited his sister and brother-in-law, Hilary and Peter Heanly, on their farm in a remote valley outside the village of Stroud. ""I think this is the most wonderful valley,"" Johnson says, as he gazes over paddocks dissected by a creek. He recounts how he has been going into town to swim in the public pool, he attended the local Carols at the Rotunda, and he loves Stroud's historic buildings. ""It gives a real feeling of being an 1850s, 1860s place,"" Johnson says. ""It's a wonderful place to be."" As well as visiting family, Stanley Johnson has been in Australia for work - as a reality television star. ""Basically, reality TV is standing around, acting in a normal way,"" he explains. In Britain, Stanley Johnson's face has become almost as widely known as his eldest son's. Last year, he was a contestant on the UK version of I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!, a TV show that involves people of varying levels of fame surviving challenges in a jungle, and the whims of the viewing public. The 78-year-old has returned to the production set in the ""jungle"" near ""Mur-will-um-bah"" (and he pronounces each syllable of the northern NSW town's name as though he is carefully rolling a crystal around inside his mouth), as a guest on the program. ""That is the most important place in Australia at the moment,"" Johnson says, ""because that is where most of the eyes of Britain are now focused, because the issue is, 'Who is going to come out of that jungle at the end of this week?'."" Stanley Johnson has appeared in a string of British television reality and quiz shows, including The Real Marigold Hotel, The Chase, ""and, worryingly, I'm on a program called Celebrity Mastermind"". When asked why he appears on so many television programs, Johnson cheerfully replies, ""At my age, you've got to do something. You can't sit in a garden in Stroud, moving cows from place to place!"" Johnson's principal workplace has been Britain and Europe. He was a Member of the European Parliament, and he has held high-ranking positions in the European Commission. He has stood on the conservative side of politics. His sons, Boris and Jo, until recently the British transport minister, are Conservative Party representatives. Yet Johnson's politics, and his world view, have been heavily shaped by his passion for the environment. That passion flowed through much of his work for the European Union. That passion has taken him around the globe to remote places, and it has fuelled many of his written words. One of his books, for instance, is titled, Where The Wild Things Were: Travels of a Conservationist. ""I probably still think of myself as mainly an environmentalist,"" he says. Johnson has been a regular visitor to this part of the world. As he says, he is ""quite familiar"" with Williamtown airport, and he doesn't need a GPS device or map to find his way to Stroud. And he has been coming to Australia for long enough to chart change. Johnson says he is ""devastated"" to see the nation's population increasing so rapidly, as it approaches 25 million. ""How can this be?,"" he asks. ""Don't the people living in this country realise they have a very, very scarce resource base, in terms of the land and the water and forest? And can they really afford to continue with population expansion at this rate? Stanley Johnson dismisses the idea that population growth is needed for an economy to grow: ""In my view, if you can manage to keep a stable population, then the desperate need for continued economic growth is much smaller. ""All of this has to be seen in terms of the global environmental constraints here."" Johnson talks about greenhouse gas emissions. He recalls representing the EU at the first meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in the 1980s and is dismayed at how long it has taken to turn words of warning into action. While world leaders meet at the United Nations climate change conference in Katowice, Poland, Johnson appeals, ""Please let the Australian delegate in Katowice this week make a strong plea for urgent action."" ""Actually, Australia's unbelievably well placed, isn't it? Think of the amount of solar panels you could install in this country. If you didn't need to dig up more coal ... you could probably meet most of Australia's energy needs through solar energy."" During our conversation, Stanley Johnson has brought the argument close to home. ""I have known the Hunter Valley for 20 or 30 years, and I've driven up through the Hunter Valley,"" he says. ""And I do say to myself, 'How can it be that this perfect valley is now subject to this massive expansion of coal production, at a time when everybody is saying coal is no longer king?'. ""OK, there are internal economic pressures, but I go back to what I was saying. If Australia itself was not so gung-ho for economic expansion, those pressures wouldn't be so great."" I wonder how, as a prominent British Conservative, he has reconciled within himself holding some of these views that must be very lonely on his side of politics. ""It's an interesting question. I never myself have seen a basic contradiction between the word 'Conservative' and 'intelligent',"" he says, bursting into laughter. However, Johnson goes on to say that the great power of conservative regimes most of the world over is the business forces behind them. ""So, yes, I would say I am pretty unusual in this."" Back in Johnson's homeland, there is a lot of disagreement about Britain departing the European Union. This massive continental shift is simply known as Brexit, but there's nothing simple about it. The British people may have voted to leave the EU, but it is not a done deal. So the Brexit debate goes on across the nation; in the UK Parliament, in political parties, and in families, including the Johnsons'. ""Well, I'm in a really difficult situation, because I have one son, Boris, who is the leader of the 'Leave' campaign, and I have another son, Jo, who has come out as being the leader of the 'Remain' campaign,"" says Stanley Johnson. He has supported Britain remaining in the EU. The Brexit debate has also applied pressure on Prime Minister Theresa May, prompting talk, not for the first time, that Boris Johnson could be the UK's next leader. The father is diplomatic in the face of that speculation. ""If there was a strong sense in the country that we want to have a clean break [from the EU], OK, then I think it might well be that Boris turns out to be the leader of the 'clean breakers',"" Johnson muses. ""If, on the other hand, it turned out there was a strong sense in the country that we wanted to stay in, a 'remainer' might emerge."" But here we are at the start of the season of goodwill to all. So surely the big question of whether Britain should remain in, or leave, the EU will be left off the table at the Johnson family Christmas dinner. ""Who will be carving this year?,"" I ask. Stanley Johnson laughs, before he assures, ""Well, I think I'll be carving!"" \"
"COP24","Australia","COP24_Australia57","Attenborough's warning of climate disaster","December 5, 2018 Wednesday","The Australian","KATOWICE: Naturalist and documentary maker David Attenborough said yesterday the world was facing a man-made disaster of global scale. Addressing world leaders at the COP 24 UN climate conference in Katowice, Poland, Sir David said without action the collapse of civilisation and the -extinction of much of the natural world was on the horizon. Launching a multimedia site for the convention, Sir David said people were willing to make sacrifices in their daily lives recognising they too must play their part. Opening the conference, UN Secretary-General Antonio -Guterres said ""for many people, regions and even countries this is already a matter of life and death"". ""Climate change is running faster than we are and we must catch up sooner rather than later before it is too late,"" he said. Mr Guterres said the Katowice conference was the most important gathering on climate change since the Paris Agreement was signed three years ago. ""We need a complete transformation of our global energy economy, as well as how we manage land and forest resources,"" he said. Mr Guterres had four messages for those attending to negotiate a rule book to bring the Paris Agreement to life. Firstly, science demands a more ambitious response. Secondly, the Paris Agreement provides a framework for action. Thirdly, there was a collective responsibility to invest in averting global climate chaos, to consolidate the financial commitments made in Paris and to assist the most vulnerable nations. Finally, climate action offers a compelling path to transform the world for the better. Mr Guterres said the latest UN Environment Program Emissions Gap Report found the current -nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement would lead to global warming of about 3C by the end of the century. The majority of countries most responsible for greenhouse gas emissions were behind in their efforts to meet their Paris pledges. The report, released ahead of the conference, said while G20 members collectively were on track to achieve the target emission levels in 2020 implied by the Cancun pledges, Canada, Indonesia, Mexico, South Korea, South Africa and the US were either not projected to or uncertain of meeting their pledges. And G20 nations were not on track to meet their unconditional NDCs for 2030 and about half of members' greenhouse gas emissions trajectories were set to fall short. They included Argentina, Australia, Canada, the EU, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and the US. Three G20 members - Brazil, China and Japan - were on track to meet their targets, while emissions from India, Russia and Turkey were projected to be more than 10 per cent below their unconditional NDC targets. It was uncertain whether Indonesia and Mexico were on track to meeting their NDC targets in 2030. Recent studies have cast doubt on China's ability to peak its greenhouse gas emissions before 2030 as it has promised. Nepalese President Bidhya Devi Bhandari said it was incumbent on the international community to ensure that justice is done. ""We feel as if we have been penalised for the mistakes we never made,"" Mr Bhandari said. Not a single G20 nation sent a top-level representative to the COP 24 opening on Monday. Mr Guterres said transformative action was needed in energy, cities, land use, water and industry. He said 75 per cent of the infrastructure needed by 2050 still remained to be built. ""How this is done will either lock us in to a high-emissions -future or steer us towards truly sustainable low-emissions development,"" he said. ""Governments and investors need to bet on the green economy, not the grey. That means embracing carbon pricing, eliminating harmful fossil fuel subsidies and investing in clean technologies. ""It also means providing a fair transition for those workers in traditional sectors that face disruption, including through retraining and social safety nets.""EDITORIAL P15 \"

It is highly disturbing to read in the NVI that this year only 200 students have commenced Year 7 in Gunnedah. The economic reality is that two hundred students will probably only attract funding to employ about fifteen teachers. When these teachers are spread across three schools there may be enough to staff each school in the core subjects, but in specialist areas there will be not enough expertise available to provide quality teaching (and please don't tell me that internet education can compensate for good teachers). In the long term this will result in limited curriculum opportunities for Gunnedah students. Catering for the interests and abilities of all students is essential. Those who are unable to develop their potential in Gunnedah may be forced to travel to Tamworth to chase broader curriculum opportunities. Can you imagine anything worse than spending your teenage years on a bus for two hours a day? Tamworth has an unenviable reputation for being an economic sponge city as many outlying communities will testify. Gunnedah may be their next victim. I fear there is a strong chance that parental delight with additional school choice will turn into future student despair at the lack of opportunity.

"COP24","Australia","COP24_Australia59","Do we want to watch people get sicker because of inaction?","April 5, 2019 Friday","Hobart Mercury (Australia)","Climate-related illness will change vastly during my medical career On March 15, more than 1.6 million young people around the world took part in school strikes for climate action. This movement, started by a single 16-year-old Swedish student, Greta Thunberg, has received the strongest response from Australian young people. I saw this when I met students from Huonville High School and New Town High School last year at the COP24 Climate Change Conference in Katowice, Poland. They spoke with eloquence and passion, their words and actions backed by an overwhelming amount of evidence. One such suite of evidence comes from the LancetCountdown: Tracking Progress on Health and Climate Change, a collaboration of researchers from the world's leading institutions, tracking health impacts and responses to climate change. The key messages of its 2018 report can be summarised in three words: impact, delay, opportunity. We are already experiencing health impacts. More people are exposed to extreme heat, infectious diseases, losses from extreme weather events and food insecurity. More than half of cities in a global survey expect climate change will seriously compromise their public health infrastructure. The Medical Journal of Australia-LancetCountdown report has found Australians are already more vulnerable to dengue fever outbreaks, heatwaves, reduced ability to work due to heat, reduced wheat yields and impacts on mental health. Impacts have occurred with a global warming of 1C. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Global Warming warned of changes that would occur with a further warming of 0.5C by 2100 and the even greater impacts that would occur with global warming of 2C. Given the world is warming at 0.2C per decade, these impacts are not set to start in 2100, but will worsen from now and throughout this century. I graduated from medical school in 2015 and will likely be working beyond 2060. Climate-related health exposures, vulnerabilities and impacts affecting the populations I serve will look vastly different even over the course of my career. There has been an unconscionable delay in the global response to climate change, an issue the world's leaders have been aware of for longer than I have been alive. The carbon intensity of the world's total energy supply has remained unchanged since 1990 and per-person fossil fuel use for road transport is increasing. Burning fossil fuels not only causes climate change, it is the biggest contributor to air pollution. Coal alone is responsible for more than 460,000 early deaths per year due to air pollution. The IPCC Special Report tells us we should be achieving carbon neutrality within 30 years, meaning global emissions need to start reducing now and continue to reduce at a rapid rate. But the UN Environment Emissions Gap Report states that current trajectories show global emissions rising beyond 2030. Australia's emissions reduction target for the Paris Agreement is far from consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5C by 2100 and, with carbon emissions heading in the wrong direction, Australia is on track to overshoot even this weak commitment. However, action on climate change presents the opportunity to improve health. Switching from burning fossil fuels to clean sources of energy and transport will reduce human-caused air pollution, which is responsible for about 2900 premature deaths each year in Australia. Supporting walking and cycling as transport can improve physical activity and encouraging plant-rich diets can reduce agricultural emissions and improve nutrition. These actions can reduce Australia's biggest burdens of disease: heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, bowel cancer, breast cancer and type 2 diabetes. Now is a crucial time. We have seen leadership in our young people, but unfortunately for us, they are not yet the key decision-makers. Australia has delayed action for far too long and we must elect a government committed to action on climate change and improving the health of Australians and people around the world. Next year the commitment period for the Paris Agreement begins and governments must increase their commitments to be in line with the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C by 2100. The headline quote of the 2018 report of the Lancet Countdown was, ""the nature and scale of the response to climate change will be the determining factor in shaping the health of nations for centuries to come"". Probably something worth missing a few days of school for.Dr Alice McGushin studied medicine at the University of Tasmania and a Masters of Public Health in London, and is working as a consultant for The Lancet Countdown: Tracking Progress on Climate Change and Health.

The passionate sustainability advocate, who was part of the team that led his high school to win the international Zayed Sustainability Prize last year, was yesterday named as one of seven student Ambassadors of Public Education as Tasmania celebrates 150 years of public education. Twelve inspiring former students were also named ambassadors at yesterday's launch of what will be a year-long celebration to highlight the important role public education plays in individuals' lives and in society. Tasmania was the first state to make public education compulsory 150 years ago. Mr Thorpe said he had been told that a private school education would be needed to ""make something"" of himself but found that was not so. ""You need to own your education. You are the driver not the passenger. Public education builds future leaders, provides an opportunity to grow as a person and be part of a community,"" he said. His passion for sustainability has taken him around the world and soon he will head to Poland - along with some New Town High School students - to be part of the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 24 ) to the UNFCCC at the Katowice Climate Change Conference. Adult ambassador and neuroscientist Dr Lila Landowski said public education gave students the key ingredients to live a rich and rewarding life. ""It doesn't matter what walk of life you come from, because public education is ultimately the great equaliser. It gives us all a chance to succeed,"" she said.

"COP24","Australia","COP24_Australia61","GLOBAL FUND IS FOLLY FOR US","September 30, 2018 Sunday","Herald Sun (Australia)","A few weeks ago in Bangkok, there was a six-day meeting of the world's climate-change bureaucrats to thrash out the details of a new rulebook for the Paris Agreement. In December, world leaders will congregate in Poland for the UN climate-change conference, COP24 as it's known. Like Copenhagen and Paris that went before it, after their posturing speeches and group photograph, the politicians will ""agree"" what's already been agreed by these bureaucrats in Bangkok. Well, that was the plan. But Bangkok went off the rails. Officially it was reported as ""beset with tension"", that key issues were ""stalemated"" and that the future of the Paris deal was ""on the brink"". Central to this lack of consensus was a fight about the proposed rulebook governing the implementation and monitoring of various Paris Agreement commitments. But really, the conflict was about the money. Forget all the language about rising sea levels in the Pacific and saving polar bears. The real purpose of international climate-change agreements is to move money from rich countries like Australia and the US to poor countries in the developing world. The Paris Agreement is not about the environment; it is about deindustrialising the West and imposing a ""moral tax"" on nations that used fossil fuels to build wealth over the past two centuries. The key to facilitating this is the new $100 billion global climate- change fund. At Bangkok, Australia and the US were accused of stalling negotiations on the fund because they (rightly) demanded greater transparency for how their billions would be spent. Like foreign aid, which fails to reach the people who desperately need it, I fear much of the climate-change millions are merely being used to prop up the budgets of poorer countries under the guise of green-religion politicking, hiding more systemic financial problems in their countries. But it gets worse. This week, the climate-change shame police came knocking on Australia's door again. Despite our minuscule contribution of 1.3 per cent of global emissions, as a nation we're now told we're expected to pony up some four billion dollars as part of our promises at the Paris conference in December 2015. Or rather, Malcolm Turnbull's commitments. Remember him? The Abbott government first put Australia's 26 per cent emissions reduction target on the table, but it did so on the advice that we could achieve these reductions without any policy change and without any significant economic damage. It was also on the written understanding that the emissions reduction agreement would include all countries. Three years on, we now know that even existing emissions reductions policy is putting power prices through the roof, sending jobs offshore, and risking blackouts when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine. When circumstances change, smart people change their position. Tony Abbott has said that if we'd known then what we know now, he'd never have agreed to a 26 per cent emissions reduction. Let's never forget that it was the Turnbull government that signed the Paris Agreement and then raced out and ratified it the day after Trump was elected, knowing the US was out. So far, and without much conviction, Prime Minister Morrison has said we're staying in - but that shouldn't mean that we hand over even more money to global green bureaucrats. To big-note himself at the Paris conference, Turnbull promised ""up to a billion dollars"" for this UN green climate fund that was supposed to total $100 billion each and every year. Now, something called the World Resources Institute says this week that Australia should be the sixth- biggest donor to this fund - behind just the US, Britain, Japan, Germany and Canada - because of our wealth and because of our historical contribution to carbon dioxide emissions. And what was initially supposed to be a one-off contribution of billions could even become an annual tax at the Poland summit in December. I can appreciate that Scott Morrison is reluctant to change an international commitment made by his predecessor. But that's a weak reason in my book. It's one thing to stick with Paris, but it's another altogether to keep shovelling out good money after bad to a fund that we don't control. Morrison should send a clear signal that he's in charge here, not the faceless global bureaucrats, by walking away from Turnbull's promise to put a billion dollars in the fund and declare from now on that Australia comes first.PETA CREDLIN IS A SUNDAY HERALD SUN COLUMNIST \"

However, if Indonesia wishes to achieve a carbon-neutral power system, it will be extremely difficult to meet the extraordinary growth in demand with domestic renewables alone. Indonesia would need to build a huge amount of renewable capacity to meet peak demand, which would then go to waste most of the time. The lack of high-quality wind and solar resources, and a broad geographic area make this route very costly. Australia can help Australia's northwest desert region has some of the world's best solar and wind resources. An underwater high-voltage Direct Current (HVDC) link connecting Indonesia's Java-Bali power grid to the Australian National Electricity Market grid through the Northern Territory would help both nations to achieve a 100% renewable power system by 2050. An interconnector would change the Java-Bali decarbonisation pathway dramatically. In this scenario, power generation in Java-Bali is greatly reduced due to imports; energy wasted from local wind and solar PV becomes negligible. A large amount of electricity is imported into Java-Bali from Australia, especially in the evening after the sun has set and the PV in Java-Bali stops generating. We could also take the opportunity to connect the Northern Territory to the rest of Australia's energy market through an above-ground transmission line. Any wind and solar energy not used by Indonesia could then be fed to the national grid. Australia could then meet the bulk of its energy needs through wind power, since strategic placement of wind farms would minimise variability in generation. Our models also favoured coupling wide-scale solar power with HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/want-energy-storage-here-are-22-000-sites-for-pumped-hydro-across-australia-84275 pumped hydro facilities Despite the high cost of building this infrastructure, our research found a 100% renewable Australasia power system could reduce wholesale electricity costs by more than 16%. Our estimates may be on the conservative side, as we assumed a constant cost for the HVDC technology but it's likely to become cheaper in the coming decades. The model finds that the optimal configuration of the international connector from NT to Indonesia is a staggering capacity of 43.8GW with construction starting from 2030.

"COP24","Australia","COP24_Australia65","CLIMATE TRIBES CLOUD TALKS","December 17, 2018 Monday","The Australian","The Poland climate change talks were mostly about hope As talks ground on in Katowice and the deadline neared for negotiators to agree on key details to bring the Paris Agreement to life, the decision that everyone had been waiting for finally was made. Next year's Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change will be held in Chile with a pre-conference in Costa Rica, a welcome tropical change from the snow and cold of Poland. The Katowice COP24 had been dogged by the decision by Brazil's president-elect Jair Bolsonaro to withdraw his country's agreement to host the travelling climate circus next year. Bolsonaro stopped short of following US President Donald Trump out of the agreement altogether. But against a background of riots in France, sparked by the heavy cost of the green transition, a sense of pending doom was never far from the mind in Katowice. In the end, Brazil scuttled any chance of agreement on the rules for future carbon trading markets by insisting carbon offsets could effectively be double counted. But the real contest has always been between the developed and developing world over money on the one hand and shared commitment on the other. Australia will be happy with the outcome. There will be pressure to give more money to the Green Climate Fund but significant issues about governance remain. The federal government will not be required to change its existing timetable on lifting its Paris Agreement targets. But there will be added pressure to give more detail about climate finance more generally into the future. The conference agreed to a new process from 2020 to decide how to lift the agreed finance past $US100 billion ($139bn) a year. The positive for developing countries is that there is now a single, strict rule book that covers all countries. The COP is a high-stakes game. For purists it is all about saving the world from what scientists warn will be the heavy consequences of rising global temperatures caused by greenhouse gas emissions. Noam Chomsky sent a video message, following up on David Attenborough's warning of the existential threat that opened the COP. ""We face a very serious dilemma, stark, cruel dilemma,"" said Chomsky. Climate change was ""the most important issue that has arisen in human history"". For developing countries, the UNFCCC process remains the last and best chance at multilateralism to push a broad range of social justice and equity issues. And that explains why, after two weeks of talks, agreement was reached on the most substantive issues needed to bring the Paris Agreement into force. In essence the dynamic has always been what liabilities developed nations are willing to shoulder to encourage developing nations into a single agreement. For non-government organisations and particularly small island states, the drumbeat of ""ambition"" has become the benchmark against which success or failure can be judged. Much of the theatre in Poland, if not the substance, had been around how to incorporate the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report on 1.5C warming. The difference between ""noting"" the IPCC report and ""welcoming"" the report may seem semantic. But it reflected the push by some countries to insist the report anchor the Paris Agreement and call for an immediate lift in measures by all countries to curtail carbon dioxide emissions. Australia had argued the timetable for ambition was set in Paris, with countries obliged to indicate their plans in 2020. And this is what COP24 agreed. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called a special conference in New York next September. UNFCCC executive secretary Patricia Espinosa says her five aims at that meeting will be ambition, ambition, ambition, ambition and ambition. In Katowice, developed countries, including Australia, argued solid rules and clear guidelines were needed to make higher ambition possible. Towards the end of negotiations, Environment Minister Melissa Price told The Australian there were ""two tribes"" within the -climate talks. ""Sometimes it is clear that it is developing and developed countries, but other times it is more confusing,"" she said. Price says Australia believes it is in the best interests of the Paris Agreement that there be full transparency on what all countries are doing. ""If you don't have transparency you can have high ambition,"" she says. ""But if we are not all measuring and accounting and reporting the same, then what is the point?"" Price left Poland before the end of the talks. China and India remained determined throughout talks to preserve for developing countries the right to continue on the road of economic transformation. In the end, the US and its developed country partners appeared to be more satisfied than most others. Indian media was reporting that attempts by developed nations to dilute differentiation represented backsliding by them on what had been agreed to in Paris. For developed country negotiators it was China, India and other developing countries that had misinterpreted the intent of Paris. Friends of the Earth campaigner Meena Raman provides an insight into the thinking of the developing world. ""In Paris it was very hard-fought on the different responsibilities in light of national circumstances,"" Raman says. ""How the US interprets that and how the developing countries are interpreting that is the clash."" This issue has an extended history in the UNFCCC process. The Durban meeting in 2011 agreed to negotiate the Paris Agreement after an angry last-minute clash in which India said it would not proceed without a clear understanding that different countries would face different obligations. Then US secretary of state John Kerry closed the deal on the Paris Agreement in 2015 by threatening to withdraw the US from talks if the developing world continued to insist on differentiation or a bifurcated process. Nonetheless, India says the -Katowice decision signified the success of the multilateral forum and reinstated its faith in it to find solutions to global problems. But it says: ""We must recall our commitment to equity to ensure climate justice to the poor and vulnerable people across the globe."" Malaysia, on behalf of lesser -developed countries, was more outspoken. ""We simply cannot ignore the past to understand the present and plan for the future,"" Malaysia says. ""It is crucial to understand why developed countries are developed and we are developing. ""The largest share of the carbon budget has been utilised by western Europe and northern America as they industrialised, fuelled by the use of fossil fuels. This was the genesis of climate change. ""Developing countries want to develop, and for this the remaining carbon space must be shared -equitably."" In reality, developing nations won't abandon UNFCCC talks because there is potentially too much at stake. ""We walk away from here, we let them get off the hook. Those who have the responsibility should be held to account and this is the process we have to hold them to account."" Price's message to the conference was ""we must act together because climate change affects us all and Australia must play its part"". She says Australia is on track to meet its 2030 target, which represents a halving of emissions per person. Action groups dispute that Australia is on track to meet its 2030 target of 26 per cent to 28 per cent below 2005 levels and they accuse it of using sharp accounting practices by booking over-achievement in the Kyoto agreement towards the 2030 target. But Price says the federal government will not be intimidated into bringing forward its timetable to announce further cuts. ""We are comfortable where we are now,"" she says. ""We are not intending to even review that until 2020. Our focus in Katowice is on the quality of the rule book."" Australia's position was confirmed by the Poland COP. The disappointment expressed by climate action groups after the meeting was that it did not push for immediate higher targets. Climate Action Network says governments failed to respond with the political will to tackle the urgency of the climate crisis informed by the latest science. ""The overbearing presence of the fossil fuel industry combined with a weak Polish presidency cast a shadow over these talks,"" it says. The reality is few countries are meeting their existing commitments. Germany is well off target for 2020 and, according to reports released at the Katowice conference, global greenhouse gas emissions are back on the rise at an accelerating rate. The outgoing COP president, Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, says: ""The world must take heed of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels and take dramatic and urgent steps to decarbonise the global economy and assist those at the frontline of climate change impacts."" Small island states called for all OECD countries to phase out their use of coal by 2030, and for all other countries to phase it out by 2040. ""There must be no expansion of existing coalmines or the creation of new mines,"" they say. European Climate Foundation chief and former French negotiator Laurence Tubiana says the UN meeting in September 2019 will be ""a very important political -moment"". She says a single rule book is a condition for raising ambition over time. ""Ambition is 2020, not now,"" she says. The mega trend, according to Tubiana, is that the real economy is starting to influence the mindset of government. Leading carmakers are shifting to electric vehicles, and the world's largest shipping company, Maersk, has pledged to be carbon-neutral by 2045. Corporate decision-makers are falling over themselves to be on the right side of the debate. The travel industry and fashion have both pledged global efforts for carbon neutrality. The finance sector is writing new rules that will make it hard to raise capital for sectors that are considered not to be acting in accordance with the Paris Agreement ambitions. ""All that is happening in the real economy will begin to be translated in government policy and recognition,"" Tubiana says. Another trend in Katowice has been the concerted effort to mobilise the youth. ""It is interesting the young people are now saying 'stop it, you are not serious', and the mobilisation of the young generation is really taking up"", Tubiana says. ""We end this bickering on the details (of the Paris Agreement) and we are beginning to focus on what is really important, which is how we transform the economy supported by a powerful movement of civil society and youth that will really make companies and governments accountable for what they are doing. ""This is in my view the new phase."" Chomsky agrees. ""To combat climate change we need much more than government, we need society,"" he says. ""That is why we are now entering a very interesting phase"". The actual face of protest doesn't appear to have changed all that much. Camped out on the main staircase during the conference was a rainbow coalition comprising men in suits, a man wearing a florid dress with purple hair, another in a bowler hat with full beard, and women from Brazil with war paint, giving evidence from places where protest can cost you your life. For some, however, the key message was lost in translation.

"COP24","Australia","COP24_Australia66","Carbon capture and conversion must not rely on rare metals","January 28, 2019 Monday 3:13 PM EST","The Conversation - United Kingdom","Last year, humans emitted approximately HYPERLINK https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07585-6 37 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere - a disastrous and unsustainable figure. To avoid the worst effects of climate change we could capture some of that carbon as it is released by power plants and store it permanently below ground. Better still, some of that waste carbon dioxide could be \~ HYPERLINK https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ente.201600747#!divAbstract converted into useful chemicals or fuel . These processes are known respectively as HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/05/carboncapturestorage.carbonemissions1 ""carbon capture and storage"" HYPERLINK https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jctb.4229 ""carbon dioxide utilisation"" To make a dent in climate change, the amount of metal required would be huge. For example, if 1 gram of a metal, in a metal catalyst, could capture 100 grams of coal-based carbon dioxide emissions (an optimistic scenario), around 1.5m tonnes of this metal would reduce HYPERLINK http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/18/files/GCP_CarbonBudget_2018.pdf global emissions by just 0.4% So, although keeping carbon out of the atmosphere is important, it is equally important that we do it in a green and sustainable manner. If large amounts of a metal are ever used to significantly decrease carbon emissions, it must have a sustainable supply so that reserves are not depleted. Sadly, many technologies seem to be ultimately unsustainable. For instance, a recent study by a team of Japanese scientists, highlighted by the HYPERLINK Royal Society of Chemistry HYPERLINK https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/sc/2018/c8sc04124e carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide HYPERLINK https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319917310571 hydrogen and \~ HYPERLINK https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0021951785901162 methanol . The catalyst is indeed extremely active and can work with carbon dioxide at very low concentrations, but the system is still not ideal. Rhenium is very rare: mostly found in HYPERLINK Chile and Kazakhstan HYPERLINK https://www.nature.com/articles/nature01482 10 parts per billion HYPERLINK about 8% of the Earth's crust. Rhenium itself is mostly used to make turbine blades in aircraft jet engines. If this metal was employed to tackle climate change globally, resources would decrease and its price would increase. This would have a knock-on effect on industrial manufacturing. Its low abundance also means that producing this catalyst would be expensive. It is therefore unlikely that a global business model for worldwide rhenium based carbon dioxide utilisation would be pursued. In another study, an American research team created a HYPERLINK https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.5b12354 ruthenium catalyst which could transform carbon dioxide from the air into the fuel methanol. However, ruthenium is also \~ HYPERLINK https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0016703795000382 incredibly rare , and would likely encounter the same availability and cost problems. Sustainable carbon dioxide conversion Fortunately, it is possible to develop catalysts that are more sustainable and environmentally friendly. This ties in with the principles of "" HYPERLINK https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2010/cs/b918763b green chemistry "" which has been around since the 1990s and has gone from strength to strength. I am one of numerous researchers across the globe using relatively abundant, and thus more sustainable, metals for carbon dioxide conversion. Colleagues and I recently developed an HYPERLINK https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/adsc.201801229 aluminium catalyst , for instance. It makes sense to use aluminium as it is one of the most abundant metals in the Earth's crust and has shown promise in \~ HYPERLINK https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2015/gc/c4gc01719f carbon dioxide utilisation This catalyst can convert carbon dioxide into HYPERLINK https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/cs5018997 cyclic carbonates , commercially valuable products used in batteries, pharmaceuticals and polymers. The catalyst can also be ""regenerated"" once its reactivity has gone and can be reused multiple times. Abundance vs reactivity But it's not always straightforward to use more abundant metals and I admit I myself have dabbled in using less sustainable metals. These include HYPERLINK https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acscatal.6b01386 chromium , a \~ HYPERLINK https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2556938 toxic form of which was the subject of the film ""Erin Brockovich"", and \~ HYPERLINK https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cssc.201702087 platinum , another metal estimated to account for less than \~ HYPERLINK https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703716303842 0.000001% of the Earth's crust. I used these scarce metals because sustainability is not always a substitute for reactivity. Fundamental chemical differences between rare and abundant elements means that simple substitution will not necessarily create a catalyst. For example, my colleagues found that chromium HYPERLINK https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/chem.201504305 was more reactive in some cases than aluminium in forming cyclic carbonates. Researching rare metals is still an interesting area to explore and will lead to new chemical discoveries that abundant metals could not produce. The impressive catalytic activity of the rhenium and ruthenium catalysts must not be ignored. The massive problem of climate change however means that we have to be more realistic and considerate when it comes to designing catalysts for large-scale industrial application. This is by no means an easy feat. HYPERLINK assessment of the entire process Ultimately, we must divert more effort towards sustainable climate change reduction as soon as possible.

"COP24","Australia","COP24_Australia67","YOUR VIEWS","December 21, 2018 Friday","The Gold Coast Bulletin (Australia)","Negative gearing is hardly for ordinary Australians There has been consternation among some voters whether, despite its clear shortcomings, that negative gearing offset should be abolished. Many are concerned that the changes suggested by the ALP will affect the economy and push it into recession. The figure has been quoted that 62% of those with one negatively geared investment property have taxable incomes less than $80,000. That is true, however, these so-called ""Mum and Dad"" investors would actually have taxable income well over $80,000 without the negative gearing tax offset. Therefore, the negative gearing tax offset (NGO) is hardly egalitarian. I suspect that we may already be in a recession. This has probably less to do with the current Liberal government and more to do with overseas governments. Certainly, there is little point in ""Seinfeldian"" regulation, simply enveloping risk-averse behaviour already evident in market players. However, when there is a lull in property investment it is a perfect time to make changes to investment taxation policy because investors will have more time to assimilate any changes into their strategies.

EVELYN CADDIE ARUNDEL THE Tweed Mayor condemns an application to increase the build levels at Cobaki (currently 3) in part to 5, 8 and up to 10 levels in specific precincts. She uses birds, bats and bugs as her reasoning to decry the proposal. No doubt the Mayor made zero mention of wind farms and the damage they do to fauna. A study conducted by Health Infrastructure on redeveloping the current (brownfield) hospital highlights the adverse impacts on patients, staff and residents around the current Tweed Heads Hospital. Build times blow out to years and years of construction works. Local road impacts, including the partial loss of one, some older hospital buildings would have to be kept to link newer builds, therefore building standards are compromised. Allocated budget is eaten up (20%) by engineering a solution out of the Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) etc. meaning a huge chunk ($106.8M) out of the $534M budget. Decanting patients and services from area to area within the built environment of the existing hospital to enable works would be a logistical nightmare. The first 'new building' at the THH would need to be built at 15 levels high in comparison to the Cudgen Road site to obtain the equivalent floor space needed. The Tweed Mayor demands that The Tweed Hospital site be redeveloped. A 15-level building in the CBD to placate her whims and egged on by some disgruntled NIMBY's in her ear. Obviously birds, bats and bugs aren't a problem near that area of the Tweed River, only sandflies. Go figure.

Instead, the Labor government continued its culture of secrecy and cover-ups by only releasing a 4-page cherry-picked summary of what should have been a combined 100 plus pages of analysis. Labor's selective SLATS summary failed to even mention the word drought which was ravaging more than 80 per cent of Queensland at the time of the report. If this isn't further proof that Labor are drought deniers, I don't know what is. Once again, Labor are hiding the full story and the SLATS report has again failed to explain the full picture of vegetation management in Queensland. The report doesn't even measure regrowth and vegetation rejuvenation which is essential when assessing the real state of the environment. It is clear that Labor are more interested in manipulating the data than achieving sensible environmental outcomes. The LNP understands that landholders are sick and tired of Labor using vegetation management for political gain at the expense of farmers.

"COP24","Australia","COP24_Australia69","Climate shaming to take billions","September 30, 2018 Sunday","The Courier Mail (Australia)","Existing emissions reductions policy is putting power prices through the roof It's time our Prime Minister walked away from an agreement that is draining cash reserves A few weeks ago, in Bangkok, there was a six-day meeting of the world's climate change bureaucrats to thrash out the details of a new rule book for the Paris Agreement. In December, world leaders will all congregate in Poland for the UN's Climate Change Conference, COP24 as it's known, and like Copenhagen and Paris that went before it, after their posturing speeches and group photograph, the politicians will ""agree"" what's already been agreed by these bureaucrats in Bangkok. Or so that was the plan. But Bangkok went off the rails. Officially it was reported as ""beset with tension"", that key issues were ""stalemated"" and that the future of the Paris deal was ""on the brink"". Central to this lack of consensus was a fight about the proposed rule book governing the implementation and monitoring of various Paris Agreement commitments. But really, the conflict was about the money. Forget all the language about rising sea levels in the Pacific and saving polar bears, the real purpose of international climate change agreements is to move money from the developed world, rich countries like Australia and the US, to poor countries in the developing world. The Paris Agreement is not about the environment; it is about deindustrialisation of the West and imposing a ""moral tax"" on nations that used fossil fuels to build wealth over the past two centuries and key in facilitating this is the new $100 billion global climate change fund. At Bangkok, Australia and the US were accused of stalling negotiations on the fund because they demanded greater transparency for how their billions would be spent. Quite rightly, the growing scepticism of taxpayers in both our countries is forcing a rethink on money being given away, hand over fist, to these global entities for little or no environmental gain. Like foreign aid, which I grow ever more concerned fails to reach the people who desperately need it. I fear much of the climate change millions are merely being used to prop up the budgets of poorer countries, under the guise of green religion politicking, hiding more systemic financial problems in their countries such as lack of governance and corruption. But it gets worse, because this week, the climate change shame police came knocking on Australia's door again. Despite our minuscule contribution of 1.3 per cent of global emissions, as a nation, we're now told we are expected to pony up some $4 billion - that's more than four thousand million of your money - as part of our promises at the Paris Conference in December 2015. Or rather Malcolm Turnbull's commitments, remember him? While it was the Abbott Government that first put Australia's 26 per cent emissions reduction target on the table, it did so on the advice that we could achieve these reductions, without any policy change, and without any significant economic damage. It was also on the written understanding that the emissions reduction agreement would include all countries. Three years on, we now know that even existing emissions reductions policy is putting power prices through the roof, sending jobs offshore, and risking blackouts when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine. We now know, that the emissions commissars will soon turn their attention to culling our animal herds and putting a carbon tax on cars. What's more - and this should be the clincher - we now know, that three of the four biggest emitters will make no commitments whatsoever, to reducing their emissions, leaving Australia in an even worse position than before. Now, when circumstances change, smart people change their position. Tony Abbott has said that if we'd known then, what we know now, he'd never have agreed to a 26 per cent emissions reduction. Let's never forget that it was the Turnbull government who signed the Paris Agreement and then raced out and ratified it the day after Donald Trump was elected knowing the US were out. So far, and without much conviction, Prime Minister Morrison has said we're staying in - but that shouldn't mean that we hand over even more money to global green bureaucrats. To big note himself at the Paris conference, Mr Turnbull promised ""up to a billion dollars"" for this UN green climate fund that was supposed to total no less than one hundred billion dollars every year. Now, something called the World Resources Institute says this week that Australia should be the sixth biggest donor to this fund - behind America, Britain, Japan, Germany and Canada - because of our wealth, and because of our historical contribution to carbon dioxide emissions - and what was initially supposed to be a one-off contribution, of billions, could even be converted to an annual tax at the December meeting in Poland. I can appreciate that Prime Minister Morrison is reluctant to change an international commitment made by his predecessor. But that's a weak reason in my book. After all, just the other day Labor agreed to support the TPP trade deal as it stands now but have already said they'll change it if elected. So, if they can change international commitments made by another government, why can't Morrison move here and be his own man? It's one thing to stick with Paris, and on that I disagree with the PM, but it's another thing altogether to keep shovelling out good money after bad to a fund that we don't control.Mr Morrison should send a clear signal that he's in charge here, not the faceless global bureaucrats, by walking away from Turnbull's promise to put a billion dollars in the fund and declare from here on in, ""Australia comes first"". \"
"COP24","Australia","COP24_Australia70","We finally have the rulebook for the Paris Agreement, but global climate action is still inadequate","December  18, 2018 Tuesday 12:32 AM EST","The Conversation - Australia","Three years after the https://theconversation.com/the-paris-climate-agreement-at-a-glance-50465 Paris Agreement was struck, we now finally know the rules - or most of them, at least - for its implementation. The HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/documents/187593 Paris Rulebook , agreed at the UN climate summit in Katowice, Poland, gives countries a common framework for reporting and reviewing progress towards their climate targets. Yet the new rules fall short in one crucial area. While the world will now be able to see how much we are lagging behind on the necessary climate action, the rulebook offers little to compel countries to up their game to the level required. Read more: COP24 The https://cdn.theconversation.com/infographics/190/8c77ad2c631b947ec1188bf545bc5376f6623e31/site/index.html?&lat=-25&lng=-25&zoom=3 national pledges adopted in Paris are still \~ HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/paris-climate-targets-arent-enough-but-we-can-close-the-gap-61798 woefully inadequate HYPERLINK special report detailing the urgent need to accelerate climate policy. Yet the summit ran into trouble in its efforts to formally welcome the report, with delegates eventually agreeing to welcome its ""timely completion"". Rather than directly asking for national climate targets to be increased, the Katowice text simply reiterates the existing request in the Paris Agreement for countries to communicate and update their contributions by 2020. Much now hinges on the UN General Assembly summit in September 2019, to bring the much-needed political momentum towards a new raft of pledges in 2020 that are actually in line with the scientific reality. A key element of the Paris Agreement is the HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/topics/science/workstreams/global-stocktake-referred-to-in-article-14-of-the-paris-agreement Global Stocktake - a five-yearly assessment of whether countries are collectively on track to meet the Paris Agreement's goals to limit global warming. The new rulebook affirms that this process will consider ""equity and best available science"". But it does not elaborate specifically on how these inputs will be used, and how the outcomes of the stocktake will increase ambition. This raises concerns that the rulebook will ensure we know if we are falling behind on climate action, but will offer no prescription for fixing things. This risks failing to address one of the biggest issues with the Paris Agreement so far: that countries are under no obligation to ensure their climate pledges are in line with the overall goals. A successful, ambitious and prescriptive five-yearly review process will be essential to get the world on track. Transparency and accounting One of the aims of the Katowice talks was to develop a common set of formats and schedules for countries to report their climate policy progress. The new rules allow a degree of flexibility for the most vulnerable countries, who are not compelled to submit quantified climate pledges or regular transparency reports. All other countries will be bound to report on their climate action every two years, starting in 2024. However, given the ""bottom-up"" nature of the Paris Agreement, countries are largely able to determine their own accounting rules, with guidelines agreed on what information they should provide. But a future international carbon trading market will obviously require a standardised set of rules. The newly agreed rulebook carries a substantial risk of double-counting where countries could potentially count overseas emissions reductions towards their own target, even if another country has also claimed this reduction for itself. This issue became a major stumbling block in the negotiations, with Brazil and others refusing to agree to rules that would close this loophole, and so discussions will continue next year. In the meantime, the UN has no official agreement on how to implement international carbon trading. Accounting rules for action in the land sector have also been difficult to agree. Countries such as Brazil and some African nations sought to avoid an agreement on this issue, while others, such as Australia, New Zealand and the European Union, prefer to continue existing rules that have delivered windfall credits to these countries. Finance The new rulebook defines what will constitute ""climate finance"", and how it will be reported and reviewed. Developed countries are now obliged to report every two years on what climate finance they plan to provide, while other countries in a position to provide climate finance are encouraged to follow the same schedule. But with a plethora of eligible financial instruments - concessional and non-concessional loans, guarantees, equity, and investments from public and private sources - the situation is very complex. In some cases, vulnerable countries could be left worse off, such as if loans have to be repaid with interest, or if financial risk instruments fail. Countries can voluntarily choose to report the grant equivalent value of these financial instruments. Such reporting will be crucial for understanding the scale of climate finance mobilised. Read more: We can't know the future cost of climate change. Let's focus on the cost of avoiding it instead The Paris Agreement delivered the blueprint for a global response to climate change. Now, the Paris Rulebook lays out a structure for reporting and understanding the climate action of all countries. But the world is far from on track to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. The latest report from the HYPERLINK https://www.unenvironment.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2018 UN Environment Programme Multilateral climate policy has perhaps taken us as far as it can - it is now time for action at the national level. Australia, as a country with very high per-capita emissions, needs to step up to a leadership position and take on our fair share of the global response.

"COP24","Australia","COP24_Australia71","COLD COMFORT FOR ACTION","November 28, 2018 Wednesday","The Australian","The details of the landmark climate accord are likely to wind up being kicked down the road again When world leaders rose to applau-d their efforts to deal with climate change in Paris in December 2015, they kicked the details of how it would be done down the road for later. Three years on, later has -arrived in the colder, less-romantic and coal-fired city of Katowice, Poland, where the urgency of the challenge has been amplified in a new UN climate change report but the political momentum for action weakened to a point of near exhaustion. The US, a key driver of the Paris Agreement, is planning to withdraw. France, a key driver in Paris, has been choked with protest in -recent days in a popular revolt sparked by rising diesel fuel prices. Further riots are planned, despite the government saying there would be a new measure to make the ""ecological transition"" more equitable. Already, most countries are falling well short of pledges made in Paris to cut emissions which are themselves well below what scientist-s have said is necessary to keep future temperature rises below even the less-ambitious -target of 2C. The pact on finance that binds the developed and developing world together in taking action under the Paris Agreement is strained. And old arguments about the different responsibilities of developed and developing nations have risen back to the surface and threaten to derail talks in Poland. Above all this, the Katowice gathering, which is due to start on Sunday, is billed as the most importa-nt Conference of the -Parties since Paris and the momen-t the Paris Agreement will be brought to life. To do so, world leaders must concur on the Paris Agreement rule book of how countries will set and measure their ambitions to cut greenhouse gas emissions across time. Success in Poland will kick off a series of rolling five-year reviews in which countries are supposed to progressively increase the actions they will take. The sticking points include how the rules will apply to everyone, whether developed or developing countries, and how vast sums of money will be transferred from developed to developing countries to assist the transition. ""To adopt implementing guidelines this year, negotiators must navigate sensitive and potentially divisive challenges, including how to reflect differences in national circumstances while -driving climate progress by all,"" the global research organisation World Resources Institute says. ""Reflecting these differences while maintaining the 'Paris spirit' of solidarity, trust and ambition will be difficult."" For Australia, the upcoming talks in Poland coincide with fierce debate about the cost and practic-ality of meeting even the existing target of 26-28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. Bipartisan agreement on the target or the way to meet it has not been possible and looks set to be a key battleground in the federa-l election, due next year. Scott Morrison has said that Australia will not withdraw from the Paris Agreement and would meet the current pledge ""in a -canter"". Australia will not be required to recommit to the Paris Agreement in Poland but all countries are on notice that they will be expected to lift their post-2020 climate change targets by as early as a special UN climat-e conference called for Septemb-er next year. To date, the Prime Minister has made reducing electricity prices a much higher-order priority for his government. Energy remains the focus of domestic climate policy at this stage. Internationally, Australia is likely to come under most pressure for its decision to stop funding for the Green Climate Fund. The GCF was supposed to be the start of what will become $100 billion a year in climate financ-ing from developed to developi-ng countries from 2020. But the fund has suffered a crisis of confidence, failing to raise the money pledged, and with donor and recipient countries at loggerheads over how what funds have been raised should be managed. The Department of Foreign Affair-s and Trade tells The Aust-ralian that the Green Climate Fund replenishment is a separate process from the COP24 meeting in Poland. ""Australia will not participate in negotiations for the replenishment of the Green Climate Fund,"" a DFAT spokesperson says. ""Australia is not compelled to make further contributions to the fund. All contributions are voluntary."" But climate finance is considered a key element of the talks in Katowice, and climate groups say failure to agree on how funds will be supplied in the future could derai-l progress on the rule book. Australia has not pulled out of the GCF entirely. It will remain a member of the Green Climate Fund board and receive inform-ation and reporting on the replenishment process. Overall, DFAT says the Australian government is committed to the Paris Agreement and its emissions reduction targets. ""Participation in the agreement is in our national interest, in the interests of the Indo-Pacific regio-n, and of the international community as a whole,"" the DFAT spokesperson says. A spokesman for Environment Minister Melissa Price said it had not yet been decided who would represent Australia at the Kato-wice meeting. The federal opposition and climat-e groups are clear on what they expect out of Poland. Emboldened by election results in Malcolm Turnbull's former seat of Wentworth, where independent Kerryn Phelps won the former-ly safe Liberal seat, and in Victoria, where climate change and energy were claimed as significan-t campaign issues, Labor is keen to exploit perceived division-s within the Coalition. Last week, Labor put forward an energy policy that dramatically increases spending to achieve a 50 per cent renewable energy -target unless the government is prepared to restart negotiations for a national energy guarantee, a policy that ultimately cost the former prime minister his job. Opposition clim-ate change and energy spokesman Mark Butler tells The Australian the COP24 meeting agenda is full of important issue-s for Australia and the world. ""Two crucial topics to be address-ed for Australia include progress on international carbon offset markets under the Paris accords, and progress towards a just transition for workers and communities affected by the global energy transiti-on under way,"" Butler says. On the rule book, he says: ""It's going to be hard work in the curren-t international environment, and it is difficult to see that the current government is up to it."" Butler says the Morrison governm-ent's commitment to the Paris Accords appears to be ""nothing but rhetorical"". Labor remains committed to the Green Climate Fund. ""We are a substantial power with much at stake and much to contribute if we are to have a fund that is equitable and effective,"" Butler says. But he says compulsion will not work. ""What we need to do is to help construct a fund that nations want to contribute to in their own interests."" Australian Conservation Fund chief executive Kelly O'Shanassy says Australia should be forced to contribute to global climate change finance. ""It's a matter of international justice that wealthy countries should help poor countries with mitigation, adaptation and econo-mic development,"" O'Shanassy says. ""While the Morrison government's announcement of a $2bn infrastructure bank for the Pacific, along with increased diplomatic links, shows a commitment to the region, there's no mention of the critical assistance needed to help our neighbours build their resil-ience to climate change or provide our fair share of climate finance. ""For Australia to be a leader, we should make a generous early commitment to ongoing climate finance, with a particular focus on support for our Pacific Island neighbours."" The ACF says Australia may be embarrassed in Poland when assessed on its climate change action-s compared with its commitments. ""Australia may face diplomatic and trade impacts if our federal government refuses to do our fair share to limit global warming,"" O'Shanassy says. The Climate Council says the lack of credible climate or energy policy from the federal government will be an embarrassment at the international meetings. ""We need to accelerate the transition to renewables, storage technologies and other climate solutio-ns,"" a Climate Council spokeswoman says. ""It is therefore essential that the Katowice meeting sets us on course to enhance collective ambitio-n and close the emissions gap."" The council says Australia is not compelled to do anything on climate finance under the Paris Agreement. ""But Australia should, as a rich country, contribute to the fund to enable poorer countries to tackle climate change,"" it says. ""Climate change is a threat multiplier, exacerbating other stresses like poverty, economic shocks and unstable institutions, making crises worse, particularly in poorer countries - with implic-ations for Australia."" Money and shared responsib-ility are at the heart of the UN's -climate process and the weak natur-e of what was actually agreed in Paris in December 2015 underscores how difficult the talks in -Poland will be. To provide momentum, the scienc-e of climate change has been invigorated with a report detailing the likely impact of the Paris Agreement's more ambitious -target of keeping global warming to 1.5C. But questions about the role of natural variation in climate change, the quality of historic data, the accuracy of climate models and lack of physical evidence to match predictions have become more open. The political cycle has shifted, too. Former US president Barack Obama drove the Paris process, which for the first time brought -developed and developing countries to the table through a non-binding agreement based on voluntary actions and compromise. The world is a different place today. Incumbent US President Don-ald Trump has put the Paris deal in the deep freeze as being against the best interests of the US. The US is still active in UN climat-e negotiations and cannot officially leave the Paris Agreement until November next year but Trump has effectively turned off the funding tap. China is facing a trade war with the US and has been caught retreat-ing from promises to cut back on coal power and potentially cheating on an earlier global agreement to halt the production of ozone-depleting chemicals. The reign of climate-champion German chancellor Angela Merkel is at an end and an anti-Paris strongman, Jair Bolsonaro, has been elected president in -Brazil. Bolsonaro previously has praised Trump's plan to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. He now says Brazil will stay in as long as it does not affect Brazilian -control over the Andes Mountains, the Amazon and Atlantic Ocean, all of which are critical to global ambitions to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Bolsonaro plans to merge Brazil's environment and agriculture ministries and open the Amazon to mining, agriculture and construction. Trump's withdrawal, China's actions and Brazil's change in direct-ion are seen as evidence of a fracture in the global co-operation that reached a zenith in Paris. ""Brazil's election result and Germany's leadership vacuum are the latest signs of the alliance that forged the Paris Agreement in 2015 drifting apart,"" is the view of pro-action website Climate Home News. To underscore the point, only 16 countries out of the 197 that signed the Paris Agreement have defined national climate action plan ambitions enough to meet their pledges, according to a policy brief released by Britain's Grantham Institute. The 16 countries are: Algeria, Canada, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Indonesia, Japan, FYR Macedonia, Malaysia, Montenegro, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Samoa, Singapore and Tonga. In a joint statement, the report authors say: ""Our analysis reveals that countries are being slow to reproduc-e their NDC (nationally determined contributions) commitments as targets in national laws and policies."" But the difficult political reality of taking action was again demonstrated in the US mid-term elections this month, which showed voters remain keenly aware of the potential cost. Two measures to price carbon and cut emissions were roundly rejected by voters in the US states where they were put. Washington state had proposed a carbon emissions fee and revenue allocation initiative known as Initiative 1631. The measure would have imposed a $US15 ($20.70) fee on each metric tonne of carbon emissions, rising by $2 a year until the state's 2035 emissions target was met. A set 35 per cent of money raised from the fee would have been returne-d to low-income communities. It would have been the first fee of its kind in the US and received heavyweight backing, including from Microsoft founder Bill Gates, but got less than 44 per cent of the vote. A coalition of environmental groups mobilised to support the initiative with big financial backing, including from Gates. Industry responded with its own campaign, reportedly costing $US31 million to oppose it. Likewise, in Arizona, millions of dollars were spent arguing over Proposition 127, a move to force the state's electricity companies to acquire 50 per cent of electricity from renewable energy sources such as wind and solar by 2030. Voters overwhelmingly rejected the idea, which might have some interesting lessons for the present political contest in Aust-ralia. ""Arizona voters have spoken loud and clear, overwhelmingly rejecting Proposition 127,"" Arizonans for Affordable Energy spokesman Matthew Benson said after the vote. ""Much will be written and said in the coming days about why Prop 127 was defeated, but it's really pretty simple. Arizonans support clean energy, but not costly, politically driven mandates. Arizonans support solar power and renewable technology, but not at the expense of an affordable, reliable energy supply. Arizonans prefer to choose our own energy future rather than have it dictated to us by out-of-state special interests.""Poland, a coal centre of Europe, may well bring a dose of political reality to the climate change talks this weekend. Without a rule book, the Paris Agreement is merely a statement of intent. Already, there are signs that the hard decisions may once again be kicked further down the road for later. \"
"COP24","Australia","COP24_Australia72","Corporations see trillions adding up on global action","December 8, 2018 Saturday","The Australian","As miners worry about their jobs, delegates at Katowice are warmed by diesel generators The UN Climate Change Conference in southern Poland is being held in a space station-like portable city built around a convention centre that has been plonked on top of a disused coalmine. Days before the conference began, a cold snap plunged temperatures in Poland to well below freezing and outside the plastic marquee walls there are banks of diesel generators to blast hot air inside. The host city, Katowice, is fully booked to accommodate the tens of thousands of delegates to what has been billed as the most important climate conference since Paris in 2015. It is still possible to get a room at Bytom, about 20km away, where half the town works in the coalmining industry and the centuries-old buildings are cracking under the strain of earthquakes caused by extensive underground excavation. The air stings the eyes and there is an unmistakeable smell of burned coal in the air. But it is overcast and still. Throwing out a solar panel or wind turbine most probably would be in vain. As delegates at COP24 worry about the future of the world, the miners in Bytom worry about their jobs. The Polish trade union Solidarity has issued a joint statement with Chicago-based think tank the Heartland Institute rejecting the science of climate change, which the institute says is ""climate totalitarianism"" propaganda invented by ""the socialist internationalist green movement"". However, inside the conference there is a grinding sense of -inevitability. The political difficulties of agreeing on what to do are being subsumed by a global corporate recognition sparked in Paris that this is a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity. China estimates it will spend $US7 trillion ($9.6 trillion) just to meet its commitments for 2030 and an International Finance Corporation report estimates the spend for emerging markets overall will be $US23 trillion. One developed country lead negotiator tells Inquirer: ""The corporates are saying if this is a transition of the entire global economy sector by sector, there are bucketloads of money to be made."" To make the point, the World Bank this week set a five-year target of $US200 billion for climate-linked finance. Major European institutions have said they no longer will lend money to things that are not consistent with the Paris Agreement goals. To push things along, protest groups have implemented a global strategy under the branding ""extinction"" to mobilise children as the frontline to demand government action. The school protests are the first sign of things to come. The political challenge is to avoid the vast gaps that already exist from widening further, between nations and between the elites and middle and lower classes who increasingly are feeling the pinch of change. The heads of state and heavyweight delegates fly in this weekend, when they will be faced with the same three-cornered dilemma that has characterised global -climate talks for the past two -decades. The tripod on which global -action rests is that all countries agree to take action, that all are willing to be open about what they have actually done and that there is confidence that money will be made available to developing -nations from the developed world. The Paris Agreement secured only part of the deal. It has been described by sceptics as a ""Claytons agreement"" because it is voluntary and can be enforced only by peer pressure. Negotiators prefer to describe the Paris deal as a ""postmodern"" agreement for much the same -reasons. But the Paris Agreement is an agreement in name only. It will not become operational until the details of all three elements of the tripod can be agreed. The deadline for agreement on the rule book is the end of this year. In Poland, countries must agree exactly how nations will measure and report what they are doing. Ultimately, this will be the foundation for peer pressure should things not turn out as promised. Already there are cracks. The promised withdrawal of the US from the Paris Agreement from next year has removed the big-stick negotiator for the developed world. In fact, there would be no Paris Agreement had then secretary of state John Kerry not thrown a tantrum in a late-night session in 2015 and threatened to pull the US out if developing countries did not agree to be in the one deal with the developed world. The issue of differentiation or bifurcation has always been a deal-breaker. ""The Paris Agreement is essentially saying let's get all -nations on the same page,"" a lead negotiator says. ""Let's accept we can be at different places on that same page, but let's not have a system where you can have a different set of rules for developed and developing countries. That is clearly what the Paris Agreement was saying."" But with the US on the way out, China has assumed more of a leading role in climate talks, claiming to be acting as a good global citizen. But its interests are more aligned with developing nations. Throughout the negotiations. China has been encouraging others to push for greater division within the agreement that undermines the fundamental basis on which the Paris deal was done. The main countries involved in the pushback are China, India, Iran, the Arab Group and Vietnam, with broad support from many within the so-called G77. Small island states want stringent rules for everyone, as do many South American countries. The unknown in Poland is how much of the pushback is a negotiating tactic by China and how firm the developed world is prepared to stand against it. The China-led group is pushing for a maximalist approach for developed countries, with a more flexible regime (blanket flexibility) for the developing world. At the extreme, this would mean major developing country emitters, including China and India, would not have to be open or transparent with their emissions plans or results. The Paris Agreement allows for some flexibility according to capacity (technical or financial), but it was never intended to retain the division of the developed and developing worlds. Blanket flexibility for developing nations would allow all such countries to have lesser reporting requirements. A qualified flexibility would give flexibility to those without the means to account properly. The pressure is being felt. Says an insider: ""It could still come out blanket flexibility for optics for China, but India and China could say they were not going to use the flexibility. You could have this weird world where you have got blanket flexibility."" What is sure is that this sort of flexibility is not what was envisaged and would never have been agreed in Paris. Former US negotiators have said if such a deal is accepted in Poland it will mean the US never re-enters the Paris Agreement, under the Democrats or the -Republicans.Right now, the Trump administration is more concerned about the money. It has scaled back the US presence in Poland but is holding a showcase in -Katowice early next week where coal and nuclear power will be very much on the agenda. \"

"COP24","Australia","COP24_Australia74","Delegates burn midnight oil","December 17, 2018 Monday","Canberra Times (Australia)","The two-week COP24 Katowice: Weary climate negotiators have limped across the finish line after days of round-the-clock talks, striking a deal that keeps the world moving forward with plans to curb carbon emissions. But the agreement fell well short of the breakthrough that scientists - and many of the conference's own participants - say is needed to avoid the cataclysmic impacts of a warming planet. The deal struck on Saturday at a global conference in the heart of Polish coal country, where some 25,000 delegates had gathered, adds legal flesh to the bones of the 2015 Paris agreement, setting the rules of the road for how nearly 200 countries cut their production of greenhouse gases and monitor each other's progress. The agreement also prods countries to step up their ambition in fighting climate change, a recognition of the fact that the world's efforts have not gone nearly far enough. But, like the landmark 2015 agreement in Paris, it does not bind countries to hit their targets. Observers questioned whether it was sufficient given the extraordinary stakes. ""We are driven by our sense of humanity and commitment to the wellbeing of the earth that sustains us and those generations that will replace us,"" Michal Kurtyka, the Polish environmental official who provided over the two-week international summit, said late Saturday as the marathon talks drew to a close. Kurtyka noted the difficulty of finding global consensus on issues so technical and, in many ways, politically fraught. ""Under these circumstances, every single step forward is a big achievement,"" he said. ""And through this package, you have made 1000 little steps forward together."" But even as he spoke, the outcome raised immediate questions about whether those steps were large enough. ""In the climate emergency we're in, slow success is no success,"" said Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development. ""In an emergency, if the ambulance doesn't get you to the hospital in time, you die. If the fire truck doesn't get to your house in time, it burns down."" Negotiators said the agreement was the best that could have been expected given the limited agenda for the talks and the need for a global consensus. Virtually every nation on Earth was represented at Katowice, ranging from small island countries that threaten to be swallowed by rising seas - and that pushed for a crisis-level response - to the United States, which has said it plans to withdraw from the Paris process. The United States, the world's largest economy and its second-largest polluter, remains in the agreement until at least 2020. It played an at-times contentious role in the negotiations, with its officials rankling fellow delegates by initially refusing to accept a landmark climate report and later putting on a presentation touting the virtues of fossil fuels. But fellow negotiators said it was mostly notable for its absence. ""The US was the driving force in the run-up to Paris. Once they decide to no longer be a part of the agreement, they can't be a driver,"" said Jochen Flasbarth, a top German delegate. Flasbarth said the minimised US role was particularly apparent in negotiations with China, which did not feel as much pressure to ramp up its ambition in fighting climate change as it otherwise might have because the US was not applying it. China is the world's largest producer of greenhouse gases. ""The US role here is somewhat schizophrenic - pushing coal and dissing science on the one hand, but also working hard in the room for strong transparency rules,"" said Elliot Diringer, executive vice president of the Centre for Climate and Energy Solutions, a Virginia-based nonprofit group. ""Over the long haul, making the agreement operational will do more to strengthen climate ambition than any immediate political signals."" In another sign of a more difficult environment for climate negotiations this year, text establishing a large part of a planned carbon trading system was scuttled after Brazil, one of the world's leading greenhouse gas producers, blocked proposals for counting certain emissions. Brazil led a push for lenient rules that other nations said would weaken the system, which is intended to encourage emissions cuts by creating a market price. With negotiators unable to reach a deal, the issue was punted until next year - a move that Boston College environmental law professor David Wirth said could ""delay or undermine confidence among the private sector in undertaking climate-friendly investments - one of the most important purposes of the Paris Rulebook"". This year's conference - an annual UN-sponsored exercise now in its 24th year - came against the backdrop of a series of increasingly dire assessments by scientists. Specifically, an October report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned the world was far off-track in its efforts to avoid the most catastrophic impacts from warming temperatures. It concluded that a ""rapid and far-reaching"" transformation of the world's energy, transportation and other sectors will be necessary over the next dozen years to avoid warming the globe more than 1.5 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The report became a source of political friction during the talks in Poland. Early in the summit, the Trump administration joined Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait in blocking official acceptance of the report's findings, arguing that any agreement should merely ""note"" its existence rather than ""welcome"" its warnings. The semantic fight encapsulated the shift of the US under President Donald Trump from a country pushing fellow countries to act more aggressively to one that refuses to acknowledge the conclusion of the world's top scientists. A chorus of activists and diplomats and national delegates - none more vocal than a coalition of small island states already feeling the impact of rising seas - had implored summit leaders to recognise the IPCC report. The issue continued to be debated into the conference's closing hours. The conference was scheduled to end Friday, but repeated deadlines for closing out the talks came and went, with negotiators haggling through the night and through Saturday. By then, some negotiators had nearly lost their voices. Bleary-eyed journalists slept on chairs or FaceTimed with their loved ones from afar. UN staffers, security officials and the rest of the dwindling crowd at the cavernous conference centre - built on the site of a former coal waste dump - speculated over when the talks would finally reach their end. The once-busy pavilions were being broken apart. A group of Pacific Islanders sat in a small circle, playing a guitar and drums. A group of Austrians seemed determined to clear out any remaining wine, beer and sweets in their corner of the conference centre. After two weeks under the gray skies of a December in Poland, negotiators are due to meet in the sun and warmth of Santiago, Chile, next winter. In between, the UN is hosting a climate summit next September that observers say now takes on crucial importance as a measure of whether countries are serious about upping their ambition. Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, who led a previous round of UN climate talks and is now leader of the World Wildlife Fund's global climate and energy practice, said world leaders needed to come through in New York on the promises they made in Katowice. ""Anything less,"" he said, ""is a failure in political and moral leadership.""

Her comment came a few days before a major UN climate summit, COP24 , held in Katowice, Poland. Other panellists on Q&A contradicted Ms Vanstone, saying emissions were rising. This prompted many viewers of the program to call on RMIT ABC Fact Check to investigate Ms Vanstone's claim. The verdict Ms Vanstone's claim is misleading. Latest federal government figures suggest that although greenhouse gas emissions have fallen over the past 10 years, emissions started trending upwards again about four years ago. The upturn, since 2014, has coincided with the Abbott government's removal of the carbon tax. Also, while emissions from electricity production have been falling, the decrease has been outweighed over the past four years by rising emissions in other sectors of the economy, such as transport, where emissions are associated with increased LNG production for export. Emissions can be measured in different ways: for example, as total emissions or emissions per capita or per GDP. In the past year, Australia's total emissions have been rising. But emissions per capita or per dollar of real GDP have been falling, mainly due to Australia's rapid population growth. However, it is worth noting that Australia's progress in cutting emissions under its international obligations (the Paris Agreement) is measured by changes in total emissions rather than by other measures. As one expert put it: ""The atmosphere doesn't care how many people are contributing to emissions; it's the total quantity of emissions that matters."" The context Ms Vanstone made her claim during a discussion on Q&A about a protest by Australian schoolchildren titled ' https://www.news.com.au/technology/environment/climate-change/students-expected-to-skip-school-to-attend-strike-for-climate-action/news-story/907d3d23594af8ecb3f88a95ad794747 Strike 4 Climate Action She was speaking about the climate policies of Australia's two major political parties, and in the broader context of greenhouse gas emissions and their impact on the environment, as perceived by young people. Ms Vanstone did not specify which kind of emissions she was talking about. Nor whether she was referring to simple totals or ratios. Fact Check invited her to clarify this. She said she had not been expecting to talk about emissions: ""I can't tell you that I had a particular tight construct in my head at the time,"" she said. ""I think I was just making a general remark about emissions generally over a long period of time."" Fact Check considers it reasonable to assume that her claim refers to Australia's total greenhouse gas emissions over the past 10 years - the length of time examined by the Government's most recent report on emissions. What others are saying Ms Vanstone is not alone in claiming emissions in Australia are decreasing, though other speakers have been more specific. Liberal senator Linda Reynolds, also on Q&A, said carbon emissions per capita and by GDP were at their lowest levels in 28 years. Federal Environment Minister Melissa Price also highlighted this low in HYPERLINK http://www.environment.gov.au/minister/price/media-releases/mr20181130a.html a press release announcing the Government's latest quarterly emissions data. Nonetheless, she acknowledged that total emissions had risen over the year to June 2018. Others have also pointed to the rise in total emissions. Labor senator Lisa Singh, another of the recent Q&A panelists, argued that ""emissions have continued to go up since 2011"". And HYPERLINK https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/breakfast/australia-wont-commit-to-increasing-paris-target/10583482 on ABC radio the same week, Richie Merzian, the climate and energy director for think tank the Australia Institute said: ""For the last four years, Australia's greenhouse gas emissions have been increasing."" Measuring emissions http://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/climate-science-data/greenhouse-gas-measurement National Greenhouse Accounts The accounts track greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 onwards, and fulfil Australia's international reporting obligations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and Kyoto Protocol. Quarterly reports, released as part of the accounts, track total emissions as well as emissions by sector, per capita and per GDP. The HYPERLINK http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/e2b0a880-74b9-436b-9ddd-941a74d81fad/files/nggi-quarterly-update-june-2018.pdf latest report , released three days before Ms Vanstone's Q&A appearance, provides estimates of Australia's national inventory of greenhouse gas emissions up to the June quarter of 2018. The report examines emissions produced by eight sectors: electricity, stationary energy, transport, fugitive emissions (for example, leakages), industrial processes and product use, agriculture, waste, and land use, land use change and forestry. Emissions from electricity production are falling The report shows emissions in the electricity sector have fallen by 3.6 per cent in the year to September 2018. This was driven by a 13 per cent reduction in brown coal supply and a corresponding 14 per cent increase in supply derived from renewable sources, it says. But emissions from other sectors, such as transport, have been rising. HYPERLINK http://energy.anu.edu.au/about-us/participants/hugh-saddler Hugh Saddler , an honorary associate professor at ANU's Crawford School of Public Policy, told Fact Check: ""Significant increases in emissions from petroleum and diesel consumption in transport, and gas consumption associated with LNG, have outweighed the decrease in emissions from the electricity sector."" What's going on with total emissions? Over the year to June 2018, Australia's total greenhouse gas emissions rose in each quarter, according to the report. Specifically, seasonally adjusted total emissions rose 1.3 per cent in the June quarter and by 0.6 per cent in the year to June 2018. While emissions have fluctuated over the past four years, they have been trending upwards since late 2014, as the graph below shows. The data shows emissions have risen 5 per cent over this time. Emissions touched their lowest point in March 2013, but have since rebounded to 2011 levels. Under the HYPERLINK Paris Climate Agreement According to the national greenhouse audit, total emissions are down 11.7 per cent on 2005 (the Paris Agreement base year) and 7.5 per cent since 1990 (the base year for Kyoto Protocol calculations). Why are people saying emissions are falling? As shown above, total greenhouse emissions when measured quarterly over the past year, or by trend data over the past four years, have been rising. So, why are some people arguing that emissions are going down? Because, when emissions are measured per capita or per dollar of GDP, they are lower. This is because Australia is experiencing rapid population growth. The Department of the Environment and Energy highlights this fall in both the preface to its latest quarterly greenhouse report and on its HYPERLINK website . The report states that emissions per capita and the emissions intensity of the Australian economy were at their lowest levels in 28 years, falling 37 per cent and 60 per cent respectively since 1990. Are emissions per capita and per GDP useful measures? Put simply, no. Dr Saddler said focusing on emissions per capita was meaningless, since the measure used in international agreements was the more crucial total emissions. ""The atmosphere doesn't care how many people are contributing to emissions; it's the total quantity of emissions that matters,"" he said. HYPERLINK https://www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person67077 Professor David Karoly ""The Australian per capita share at the moment is higher than any other developed country in the world - higher than the US. Yes, it's coming down, but it is still the highest."" Both Dr Saddler and Professor Karoly confirmed the fall in emissions per capita and GDP were due to rapid population growth in Australia. Experts assess the claim Professor Karoly said if Amanda Vanstone's claim was made in reference to total Australian emissions, ""they are going up"". He noted that the start of the recent rebound in emissions from mid-2014 coincided with the HYPERLINK http://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/government/repealing-carbon-tax dumping of the carbon tax HYPERLINK http://climate.anu.edu.au/about-us/people/mark-howden Professor Mark Howden He said an argument could be made that emissions have come down, given they are lower now than at their peak between 2005 and 2008. ""However, this is a problematic argument,"" he said. ""Under the current mix of policies and economic activities, emissions are clearly not coming down but instead are rising steadily."" HYPERLINK https://people.csiro.au/C/P/Pep-Canadell Pep Canadell , a senior principal research scientist in the CSIRO Climate Science Centre, and the executive director of the Global Carbon Project, suggested that 1990 was a good reference year for gleaning a long-term view of changes to emissions. ""Good annual data only starts from 1990, which is the reference year of the Kyoto Protocol and why the Government started the good quality data then,"" Dr Canadell said. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par Emissions per capita have fallen 37 per cent since 1990. However, Dr Canadell added: ""Given Ms Vanstone's statement is present tense, I disagree [that emissions are falling].

"COP24","Australia","COP24_Australia78","MORE CRACKS IN PARIS PACT","September 17, 2018 Monday","The Australian","Money, power and trust are central to the divide on climate Winter is coming to Poland, where temperatures dip below zero, but the coal-hungry Euro-pean centre has become the last hope to pull progress on the Paris Agreement from the deep freeze. It's not just in Australia that tempers have been flaring over the future of the Paris Agreement to tackle climate change. An emergency meeting in Bangkok ended on September 9 in stalemate as longstanding divisions blocked progress on developing a rule book for how the Paris Agreement will operate. Money, power and trust sit at the heart of the dispute, which will only intensify as governments prepare for the December 3 Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in Katowice, Poland. Behind the scenes, a group of countries led by China has been working to widen the gap on how rules should apply differently to the developed and developing world. This is familiar territory for anyone who has watched the two decades of UN climate change -diplomacy. Developing nations blame the developed world for causing the problem of climate change and -insist on protecting their right to develop. Simple mathematics shows -developed nations cannot solve the problem alone. The $US100bn fund has been the glue that brought developed and developing nations into a single compact. But the devil, as -always, is in the detail. It is usual in global climate change negotiations for talks to go down to the wire. But the 2009 meeting in -Copenhagen has shown that success cannot always be guaranteed. A new level of uncertainty has been added to negotiations by US President Donald Trump's decision to signal his withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. A formal departure cannot be announced until November next year and would not take effect until November 2020. In the meantime, the US -remains active in negotiations. Without the US, ambitions to raise $US100bn a year from 2020 will be exponentially more difficult. Uncertainty has allowed the pathway for the Paris Agreement to begin to unravel on several fronts. The Paris Agreement entered into force on November 4, 2016, after it was adopted to a fanfare of consensus on December 12, 2015. The deal is yet to be operational because agreement must still be reached on the rule book on how it will operate. In its present form, despite all the emotion vested in it, the Paris deal is merely an agreement of -intent. Even if it becomes operational, it will be largely voluntary, relying on international peer pressure to keep participants in check. Countries will be obliged to -report ambitions to keep future global tem-p-erature rises below 2C -but there is no legal mechanism to -enforce their actions. Final details are supposed to be agreed by the end of this year. But after Bangkok, despite some encouraging official pronouncements, that agreement seems as far away as ever. Observers have said publicly that the Paris deal is on the brink of collapse. India's Economic Times laments ""the world is now setting the new norms of not keeping the promises made on global -co-operation"". These developments provide context to debate about the future of the Paris Agreement in Australia, where the focus has been on what level targets should be set to cut future carbon dioxide emissions. Internationally, despite its relatively small contribution to global carbon dioxide emissions, Australia is still playing a very active role in negotiations. In resisting calls from within his party to abandon the Paris deal -because of the cost to electricity prices of a renewable energy transition, Scott Morrison has remained fixed on diplomacy. ""I have to consider not just the issue here,"" the new Prime Minister told Sydney 2GB radio host Alan Jones. ""In the Pacific, this is an issue which is incredibly important. This issue dominates their thinking and agenda. Now the Pacific is one of the most strategic areas of influence in our world today."" In short, backsliding on the Paris Agreement could have big -regional consequences and frustrate negotiations for free trade with the EU. Despite the criticism levelled at Australia during the Bangkok talks, a spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade says we are committed to the Paris Agreement process. ""Australia wants to secure comprehensive and effective -implementing guidance for the Paris Agreement, including robust emissions accounting and transparency rules,"" the DFAT spokesman says. ""Australia is aiming for the Paris Agreement implementation guidance to be finalised at COP24 in December (Poland) this year and supports effective assistance, including financial assistance to be provided to developing countries."" Australia has invested more than half of a commitment made in 2015 to spend $1bn across five years (2015-16 to 2019-20) to support developing countries to build climate resilience and reduce emissions. This includes $300 million across four years for climate action in the Pacific. Australia's assistance is grant-based, based on partner country requests, balanced across mitigation and adaptation, and -focused on small island developing states and less developed countries in the Indo-Pacific region. The money is dispersed through multilateral, global, -regional and country-level mechanisms through the Australian aid program managed by DFAT. The truth, however, is that global talks on finance have stalled over whether loans and existing foreign aid should be counted as part of the proposed $US100bn a year fund from 2020. In addition, delivery of funding through the interim Global Climate Fund has been shambolic. Pledges to the GCF have totalled $US10.4bn but only $US3.5bn has been committed. The US withdrew $US2bn promised to the fund when Trump announced his intention to pull out of the Paris Agreement. GCF administrators cannot agree how the fund money should be spent, with the Australian chairman resigning abruptly in July for ""personal reasons"" after an acrimonious meeting. A delegate at the Bangkok meeting was quoted as saying ""GCF is melting down faster than Antarctica"". No one is disputing there is much work still to be done. ""Frankly, we are not ready,"" -last year's climate conference president and Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainima-rama declared on the opening day of the Bangkok summit. After the talks the official view was that progress had been -""uneven"", a description that is loaded with peril in the language of these talks. Climate Victoria climate and energy adviser Erwin Jackson says the compilation text that emerged from Bangkok lacks the streamlined clarity required for smooth negotiation in Poland. A thorough analysis by the International Institute for Sustainable Development says while the options are now more clearly identified, they reveal fundamental disagreement on many of the key issues. ""Familiar political disagreements underpin several key -issues,"" the IISD analysis says. ""It is these issues that could throw a wrench in the gears, potentially halting negotiations and threatening a successful outcome in -Poland."" Finance remains a perennial roadblock. Developing countries, led by Africa, want much greater detail on how much money will be provided and greater freedom over how it will be spent. The African Group, supported by other developing countries, has attempted to link finance to the ""transparency framework"" in which countries must declare what -actions they are taking. By tying these issues together, a failure to agree on finance ""could result in parties stalling, or blocking, the realisation of the transparency framework, potentially leading to the collapse in Katowice that some fear"", IISD says. Another principal roadblock is differentiation that centres on burden sharing in the collective effort to reduce emissions, given countries' different historical responsibilities for the problem and capacities to address it. The Like-Minded Developing Countries including China, India and Saudi Arabia recall the convention's bifurcated approach that treated developed and developing countries differently. Moving on from bifurcation, the premise of the original Kyoto agreement, which excluded developing countries, was a non-negotiable tenet of US participation in Paris. ""At stake in these negotiations is the degree to which all major emitters, inducing key emerging economies, will contribute to mitigation,"" IISD says. In short, it says, differentiation and finance have long been the wrenches in the gears of global climate action. ""Developing countries continue to call for new, additional and predictable finance that will enable them to undertake sustainable development,"" the IISD anal-y-sis says. ""Developed countries continue to demand broader participation in the mitigation effort and transparency of all countries' actions. ""In Katowice, parties will have to find a way to interpret deeply held political differences papered over by the Paris Agreement's -ambiguous language. ""Given these disagreements have fuelled tensions for at least two decades, the task for Katowice is indeed daunting."" To keep the pressure on, a -series of grand events have been planned between now and the Polish meeting, which has been -extended by one day. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres delivered a major speech last Monday in which he said the ""direct existential threat"" of climate change was nearing a point of no return. The IPCC will deliver a special report next month on the implications of 1.5C warming. A leaked draft of the report says global warming is on track to breach the toughest limit set by the Paris climate agreement by the middle of this century unless governments make unprece-dented economic shifts from fossil fuels. Governments also will have to start sucking CO2 from the air to achieve the ambition of meeting the lower target, the draft says. Guterres calls for a shift away from the dependency on fossil fuels towards cleaner energy and away from deforestation to more efficient use of resources. In his call to action, Guterres describes arguments that tackling climate change is expensive and can harm economic growth as ""hogwash"". ""In fact, the opposite is true,"" he says. Hard-pressed Australian electricity consumers may beg to -differ. But, by nature, the politics of climate change transcends nat-ional borders.And as with Copenhagen, the Paris Agreement remains far from being a done deal. \"
"COP24","Australia","COP24_Australia79","IF CLIMATE SCIENCE IS SO COMPELLING, WHY MAKE IT UP?","December 18, 2018 Tuesday","The Australian","Schoolchildren have been weaponised to advertise the religion of global warming Recent striking Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane schoolchildren calling for Australian politicians to ""take our futures seriously and treat climate change for what it is - a crisis"" proves, yet again, this movement is political. When asked to explain the science behind the ""crisis"", the children's teachers were clueless. But the strike wasn't about science. It was about weaponising children to advertise the world's newest religion - anthropogenic global warming - ahead of this year's UN Conference of the Parties in Katowice, Poland. To maintain public interest in global warming, the media is willingly conscripted, never failing to oblige with doomsday headlines and scary vision of belching smokestacks and disappearing ice caps. However, this year the pre-conference scaremongering got off to a bad start. First, the co-author of a widely cited, peer-reviewed study had to admit to a mathematical error that mistakenly concluded ocean temperatures had warmed 60 per cent more than previously thought. The paper was withdrawn and the authors are redoing their sums. Then, on conference eve, the US government released a paper claiming climate change would kill thousands and shrink America's economy ""by 10 per cent by 2100"". Contributors included former Obama appointees and left-wing bureaucrats. The report immediately was debunked by scientists around the world for deliberately cherrypicking data and exaggerating climate risks. It was labelled, variously, ""unhinged"", ""embarrassing"", ""tripe"" and a ""400-page pile of crap"". If the science is so compelling, why make it up? None of this would faze the 22,771 climate evangelists gathered in Poland for COP 24 . By the time Sir David Attenborough and Arnold Schwarzenegger had finished their sermons warning of the ""collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world"" and ""If we would've never started in that direction and used other technology, we'd be much better off"", they were ready to accept that the Stone Age was the sweet spot in human history. And so the global warming juggernaut rolls on, subtly shifting focus from dodgy science to politics and morality. Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman likens the fossil fuel industry to the tobacco industry and argues denial of climate science is ""depravity, on a scale that makes cancer denial seem trivial"". Nobel laureate climate scientist Richard Lindzen sees things differently. To him, climate science is ""implausible conjecture backed by false evidence which, repeated incessantly, has become politically correct 'knowledge' "". ""Global warming, climate change, all these things are a dream come true for politicians. The opportunities for taxation, for policies, for control, for crony capitalism, are just immense, "" he says. Indeed. A new report commissioned by scientists appointed by the UN Secretary-General finally lays bare the underlying Leninist manifesto (long denied by the Left) that has been driving UN climate policy since Maurice Strong hosted the Rio Climate Conference in 1992. The study declares: ""Capitalism as we know it is over."" The world, it says, is suffering ""biodiversity loss and other environmental hazards, societies are witnessing rising inequality, rising unemployment, slow economic growth, rising debt levels and governments without workable tools for managing their economies"". It recommends more expensive ""clean energy"", conceding ""rich countries' citizens would have less purchasing power than now, but it would be distributed more equally"". On the other hand, ""developing countries do not need to begin by dismantling the fossil-fuelled infrastructure that has provided a range of low-cost produc-tion and consumption opportuni-ties in rich countries, for decades"". No wonder Turkey has applied to the UN to switch from developed to developing nation status. For the authors of the UN Secretary-General's paper, China is utopia. It ""serves as a reminder that economic theories, other than neo-classical ones, are already effective in the world"". They are. But it is capitalist reforms and the ingenuity of markets that, during the past 20 years, have lifted one billion people, mostly in China, out of extreme poverty. Beijing understands this, even if the UN doesn't. Holding the conference in the heart of a mining region where coal supports five million people vividly illustrates the ideological chasm that separates global warming fantasists from the real world. As Polish President Andrzej Duda explains: ""According to experts, we have coal deposits that will last 200 years. It would be hard to expect us to give up on it totally."" The French learned this the hard way. After three weeks of viol-ent protests over a proposed fuel tax, the Macron government scrapped the idea. That policy reversal was particularly disheartening for Katowice delegates already coming to terms with the conspicuous absence of heads of government, the US's token attendance, China's low-level participation and Brazil's threat to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. To lift flagging spirits, organisers flew in a 15-year-old Swedish girl to castigate world leaders for their lack of concerted action and they sanctioned a protest which disrupted a pro-fossil fuel session. What Poland brings to light is the collective deception behind the Paris Agreement. The rash, non-binding commitments were soon forgotten once they were subjected to the harsh test of domestic economic realities. So Katowice will close with ""what's possible but not what's necessary"" - and 22,771 ideologically charged campaigners will jet home on fossil fuel, disappointed with progress and alarmingly detached from scientific and economic reality.Still, at least the kids managed to skip school for a day. \"
"COP24","Australia","COP24_Australia80","Privitisation: There's more to services than profit and salaries","December 13, 2018 Thursday 06:40 PM GMT","Canberra Times Online","To submit a letter to The Age, email letters@theage.com.au. Please include your home address and telephone number. Ross Gittins (Comment, 12/12) is right with his criticisms of the privatisation of government-owned enterprises including electricity. He could have added public transport in Victoria along with a range of in-house government services. Privatisation is promoted by economists and the corporate sector without taking into account a range of issues other than profits for shareholders and excessive pay for executives. It has been shown not to be more efficient and certainly has ignored the environmental impacts of its actions. Surely it is time for politicians and other corporate leaders who base decisions on ideology and not the needs of the community to be held accountable not only at the ballot box but through our legal system. A return to a mixed economy is well overdue and tighter price control and regulation a must. Ray Cleary, Camberwell Some institutions should not have been touched With regard to Ross Gittins' article, no doubt Michael Hassett (Letters, 13/12) is correct about Telstra and the downside of its privatisation. But what about the CBA? What were we thinking when we privatised it? It's worth recalling the reasons, against the background of the current banking and financial services royal commission. All Australians had a share in the old CBA until someone decided it was a good idea to parcel up everybody's shares into a number of discrete private shares and sell them off to the rich; one of whom was me. And look where we've ended up. Instead of having a low, or no-profit bank, providing affordable services to all Australians, we have a discrete number of private shareholders divvying up billions of dollars of profit each year, and ripping off large numbers of Australians along the way. Tony Adami, Caulfield South Greed should have no part in it I am in full agreement with Ross Gittins that both the Australian and state governments made a massive error in guiding our public-run state institutions down the slippery path of privatisation. One aspect that I would like to add is training of staff. Apprentices were expertly trained in all disciplines. The Gas and Fuel Corporation, Board of Works and the SEC produced people who could actually ""do"". Some apprentices started their own business, some went on to further studies at university and gained degrees in engineering and/or management. The system worked economically and well. What the governments and their advisers failed to factor in to their economic modelling was greed. Frank Jenkins, Dromana Where the real power resided Ross Gittins makes some strong points about the apparent flaws in state governments' privatisation of former state-owned assets in electricity and ports. However, we need to also be aware that state ownership of major assets is not without its own problems - judging by the behaviour of the plethora of state-owned authorities in Victoria in the period 1970 to 1980. The CEOs of these large entities, which enjoyed monopoly status, were collectively more powerful than state governments of the time. Indicative of their attitude was the SECV's decision in 1981 to unilaterally raise electricity tariffs by 19.4 per cent in one hit - only deigning to inform the relevant portfolio minister an hour before it announced the massive price hike - which had adverse implications for businesses in the state, (eg, the Portland Aluminium smelter then in construction) not to mention adverse political impact for that government. The incoming Cain government of 1982 had a significant battle on its hands to wrest control from these powerful organisations. Thomas Hogg, East Melbourne FORUM Rising tides Perhaps the next UN conference on climate change could be held in Tuvalu. Seats could be placed on the beach with water lapping around the attendees' ankles. Maybe then the Australian and US delegates advocating for greater coal use may get the message. I doubt it. The madhouse effect First it's the insects, then it's the birds, then it's the small mammals. How far up the food chain is too far, too much risk to humanity? The greatest cause for concern is no longer the greenhouse effect but the madhouse effect where politicians in possession of these and other alarming facts simply turn away. How can they continue to put up false choices like lower electricity prices ahead of our very existence? Politicians in this country and the US need to re-evaluate their climate policy risks. Let's hope it is not already too late. Robert Brown, Camberwell Priorities deficit If we ever needed proof that Scott Morrison has no grasp on priorities it is his announcement that the government will appoint a Freedom of Religion Commissioner. Is this not the same Prime Minister who thought that there was absolutely no need for a federal anti-corruption commission ? Maybe he is still desperately seeking to satisfy the so-called ""base"". Brandon Mack, Deepdene It's not science Shame on the PM in making a clearly political choice for the state to house Australia's space agency. Victoria is the home of the Victorian Space Science Education Centre, a world-class facility that was the first of its type in the southern hemisphere. It has first-class direct links to NASA, pioneering educational programs to prepare the next generation towards potential careers in the space industry, and is strongly supported by La Trobe University. Instead, Scott Morrison selected the Liberal state that could otherwise return to Labor at the next state election. And he has unelected unrepresentative of anyone Georgina Downer as well for the photo shoot. As one of the founders of VSSEC I am grossly unimpressed. Ange Kenos, Niddrie The TAFE option It was encouraging to see the article (""What happens if you don't get a high ATAR"", The Age, 12/12) regarding options open for school leavers if they don't achieve a high score, the inference being that they won't get a place at university and so must look elsewhere. VET/TAFE offers a clear and productive study and employment opportunity that is not a second-class pathway, but more needs to be done by parents, teachers and career counsellors to encourage this option. Students' satisfaction in vocational education is high and graduate employment outcomes are positive with good starting salaries. More support is required for VET/TAFE to ensure this educational sector remains viable. Denise Stevens, Healesville Path to walking I'd have to agree with the sentiments expressed in the article (""Walking good for health and wallet"", The Age, 13/12). I walk to a local shopping centre in Northcote, about 15 minutes each way. A pedestrian crossing has recently been installed in the street just to the north of the shopping centre, but there is no designated walking route within the car park. Recently I saw a young mother with a pram. Having used the clearly marked crossing, she had no obvious safe path into the shopping centre. Most likely she had to navigate a way beside vehicle traffic also entering. Both local councils and state government agencies would do well to encourage and enhance pedestrian traffic wherever possible. Geoff Crowhurst, Thornbury Not May's fault It is unjust and over the top to brand Theresa May the ""worst ever"" British PM (Letters, 12/12). The split in The Conservative Party over Europe has been running for more than 50 years and is deep and bitter. There is no faction or group in that party that can command majority support over Brexit. Add to that the perennial Irish border issue and these matters become virtually insoluble. It would have been better that the ex post facto situation was kept as it was instead of stirring up this hornet's nest. May has done a remarkable job in holding the party together as far as she has. Margaret Thatcher would not have allowed these matters to be reopened in the first place. It was not May who did so. It was her predecessor David Cameron. Andrew Farran, Edenhope A word from Down Under The UK Conservatives need to take advice from their Australian counterparts on how to plan and execute a smooth and harmonious removal of a prime minister. David Kerr, Geelong What subs? We needn't spend $50 billion on a fleet of state-of-the-art submarines. We need only give the impression we have a fleet of state-of-the-art submarines roaming the seas. For all we know, this is what everyone else is doing already. Ben Laycock, Castlemaine Slice of white-bred Thank you Anne Aly (Comment, 13/12) for highlighting the obvious lack of diversity in our very Anglo-Australian Parliament. I recently rang an electoral office here in Melbourne that's considered quite progressive and one of the staffers made a lame joke about the ""wogs"" in their electorate. They reassured me their non-judgmental opinions by saying. ""Yes but I have friends who are ethnic."" It seems that being nice, white and middle class is the prerequisite for fitting into an outdated political culture that accepts multiculturalism as a shallow joke for the bourgeoisie when it suits them and makes them look progressive. Melina Smith, Brighton Kennett's poker face In the same week as Collingwood formally divested themselves from the gaming industry it is simply beyond my comprehension as to how Jeff Kennett, former chairman of beyondblue and current president of Hawthorn Football Club, can restate that his club will continue to rely on gaming machine revenue because they ""are legal"". Kennett, of all people, must be acutely aware of the damage that pokies cause to families while producing absolutely nothing, yet clearly Hawthorn (who have always proudly proclaimed themselves as ""The Family Club"") is more important than anything or anyone. The club's two gaming venues topped the charts for Victorian clubs' takings from poker machines last year, with customers registering $24.3million worth of losses. Neale Meagher, Malvern Not suppressed A suppression order on Australian media in a high-profile case is ludicrous in this day and age when anyone can Google it. Open info age While we would not wish to jeopardise the safety of police informer 3838, or influence the objectivity of jurors in the second trial of a high-profile figure who has been convicted in a first trial, the reality is that the information that has been kept secret is widely available on the internet. Modern courts will soon have to accept that there is now an increased chance that jurors will bring with them some knowledge and that their decisions must be based on the facts presented to them during the trial. I would rather we have number plates proclaiming Victoria the Transparent State than Victoria the Secret State. Kevan Porter, Alphington All too hard, sorry So Scott Morrison assures us that bringing sick children off Nauru will start the people smugglers ""printing up their posters"" again. I wonder what the content of them would look like. Maybe I could make a suggestion: Wonderful Offer - perilous trip in a leaky boat to head off somewhere in the direction of Australia. If you survive the journey you are guaranteed a ""holiday"" of five years or more in ""budget"" accommodation in an island ""paradise"" with a rustic environment and limited ""eco-friendly"" facilities. There is no return ticket guaranteed with the package but if your children get sick they may earn the additional bonus of a short stay in an Australian hospital. How could anyone resist such an offer? When will governments stop treating people like gullible idiots? Or do they are assume we are all as selfish and self-centred as they are? Some of us at least would have more respect for the PM and other politicians if they had said in a type of ""Scomo"" vernacular. ""Well it is all too hard, we have to think about losing some votes here, so we are going to bugger off and enjoy Christmas with our own families."" Cheryl Day, Beaumaris Take a bow What a joy it was, on turning into Stanhope Grove, Camberwell, on Friday to see every tree wearing a red bow to welcome Christmas. This makes so much more sense than lights, while celebrating a real sense of community. Christina Hart, Box Hill A pet is not a toy I have been appalled to see pets being denigrated by being tarted up in festive outfits for the seasonal amusement of adults. They are not toys. They rely on us for their care, companionship and enlightened ownership. Claire Nailer, East Doncaster Eating your words Matt Holden misses the point (Comment, 13/12) when he says of his uncle's nut loaf ""You can barely tell it's not meat"". He should try the vegan degustation menus at restaurants and prepare to eat his words. Jan Kendall, Hawthorn AND ANOTHER THING Politics It's obvious that the UK Tories need some basic wrecking training from the master. Tony Abbott - pack your bags. Gary Sayer, Warrnambool Peter Dutton has accused asylum seekers ""of being ungrateful political opportunists"" (13/12). Talk about the pot calling the kettle black. Phil Alexander, Eltham I am surprised that the current Coalition government has the wit to find three wise elders this Christmas. Alan Inchley, Frankston Scott Morrison's Wentworth call to shift the embassy to Jerusalem is looking more like a Trump tweet every day. Lindsay Donahoo, Wattle Glen Don't worry about cuts to border patrols. Since corporate self-regulation has worked so well, just get the people smugglers to report when they break our laws. Is the government reducing funding for maritime border patrols so that any boat arrivals between now and the May election can be used as a stick to beat the opposition with? John Weston, Melton South Doug Perry, Mt Martha As to Brexit, the May-hem continues. David Coorey, Brunswick Furthermore Perhaps Hakeem al-Araibi should have played cricket instead of soccer or trained as an au pair. AFP - clearly not an acronym for Australian Fair Play.

There are two broad types of engineering, HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/cant-we-just-remove-carbon-dioxide-from-the-air-to-fix-climate-change-not-yet-45621 greenhouse gas removal HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/blocking-out-the-sun-wont-fix-climate-change-but-it-could-buy-us-time-50818 solar radiation management An engineered future? : It's increasingly looking like we may have to rely on a combination of such technologies in facing climate change. The authors of the recent HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/ipcc-1-5-report-heres-what-the-climate-science-says-104592 IPCC report concluded that it is possible to limit global warming to no more than 1.5\'b0C, but every single one of the pathways they envisaged that are consistent with this goal require the use of greenhouse gas removal, often on a vast scale. While these technologies vary in their levels of maturity, none are ready to be deployed yet - either for technical or social reasons or both. If efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by transitioning away from fossil fuels fail, or greenhouse gas removal technologies are not researched and deployed quickly enough, faster-acting SRM ideas may be needed to avoid so-called ""climate emergencies"". SRM ideas include installing mirrors in Earth's orbit, growing crops that have been genetically modified to make them lighter, painting urban areas white, spraying clouds with salt to make them brighter, and paving mirrors over desert areas - all to reflect sunlight away. But by far the best known idea - and that which has, rightly or wrongly, received the most attention by natural and social scientists alike - is injecting reflective particles, such as sulphate aerosols, into the stratosphere, otherwise known as ""stratospheric aerosol injection"" or SAI. MW : Despite researching it, I do not feel particularly positive about SRM (very few people do). But our direction of travel is towards a world where climate change will have significant impacts, particularly on those most vulnerable. If you accept the scientific evidence, it's hard to argue against options that might reduce those impacts, no matter how extreme they appear. Do you remember the film HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jan/06/127-hours-review 127 Hours ? It tells the (true) story of a young climber who, pinned under a boulder in the middle of nowhere, eventually ends up amputating his arm, without anaesthetic, with a pen knife. In the end, he had little choice. Circumstances dictate decisions. So if you believe climate change is going to be severe, you have no option but to research the options (I am not advocating deployment) as broadly as possible. Because there may well come a point in the future where it would be immoral not to intervene. SRM using stratospheric aerosols has many potential issues but does have a comparison in nature - active volcanism - which can partially inform us about the scientific challenges, such as the dynamic response of the stratosphere. Very little research is currently being conducted, due to a challenging funding landscape. What is being done is at small scale (financially), is linked to other, more benign ideas, or is privately funded. This is hardly ideal. A controversial idea : But SAI is a HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/time-is-running-out-on-climate-change-but-geoengineering-has-dangers-of-its-own-107732 particularly divisive idea Read more: Time is running out on climate change, but geoengineering has dangers of its own Such ideas also raise concerns about governance. What if one powerful actor - be it a nation or a wealthy individual - could change the global climate at a whim? And even if there were an international programme, how could meaningful consent be obtained from those who would be affected by the technology? That's everybody on Earth. What if some nations were harmed by the aerosol injections of others? Attributing liability would be greatly contentious in a world where you can no longer disentangle natural from artificial. And who could be trusted to deliver such a programme? Your experience with the HYPERLINK http://www.spice.ac.uk/ SPICE (Stratospheric Particle Injection for Climate Engineering) project shows that people are wary of private interests. There, it was concerns about a patent application that in part led to the scientists calling off a test of delivery hardware for SAI that would have seen the injection of water 1km above the ground via a pipe and tethered balloon. MW : The technological risks, while vitally important, are not insurmountable. While non-trivial, there are existing technologies that could deliver material to the stratosphere. Most researchers agree that the socio-political risks, such as you outline, outweigh the technological risks. One researcher remarked at a Royal Society meeting, in 2010: ""We know that governments have failed to combat climate change, what are the chances of them safely implementing a less-optimal solution?"". This is a hard question to answer well. But in my experience, opponents to research never consider the risk of not researching these ideas. The SPICE project is an example where scientists and engineers took the decision to call off part of an experiment. Despite what was reported, we did this of our own volition. It annoyed me greatly when others, including those who purported to provide oversight, claimed victory for the experiment not going ahead. This belies the amount of soul searching we undertook. I'm proud of the decisions we made, essentially unsupported, and in most people's eyes it has added to scientists' credibility. Moral hazard RB : Some people are also worried that the promise of large-scale climate engineering technologies might delay or distract us from reducing greenhouse gas emissions - a ""moral hazard"". But this remains to be seen. There are good reasons to think that the promise (or threat) of SRM might even galvanise efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. MW : Yes, I think it's at least as likely that the threat of SAI would prompt ""positive"" behaviour, towards a sustainable, greener future, than a ""negative"" behaviour pattern where we assume technology, currently imaginary, will solve our problems (in fact our grandchildren's problems, in 50 years time). RB : That said, the risks of a moral hazard may not be the same for all climate engineering ideas, or even all SRM ideas. It's a shame that the specific idea of stratospheric aerosol injection is so frequently conflated with its parent category of SRM and climate engineering more generally. This leads people to tar all climate engineering ideas with the same brush, which is to the detriment of many other ideas that have so far raised relatively fewer societal concerns, such as more reflective settlements or grasslands on the SRM side of things, or virtually the entire category of greenhouse gas removal ideas. So we risk throwing the baby out with the bathwater. MW : I agree with this - somewhat. It's certainly true all techniques should be given the same amount of scrutiny based on evidence. Some techniques, however, often look benign but aren't. Modifying crops to make them more reflective, brightening clouds, even planting trees all have potentially profound impacts at scale. I disagree a little in as much as we simply don't know enough yet to say which technologies have the potential to reduce the impacts of climate change safely. This means we do need to be thinking about all of these ideas, but objectively. Anyone that passionately backs a particular technology concerns me. If it could be conclusively proven that SAI did more harm than good, then we should stop researching it. All serious researchers in SAI would accept that outcome, and many are actively looking for showstoppers. RB : I agree. But at present there is very little demand for research into SRM from governments and wider society. This needs to be addressed. And we need broad societal involvement in defining the tools - and terms - of such research, and indeed in tackling climate change more broadly. Read more: Why you need to get involved in the geoengineering debate - now The question of governance MW HYPERLINK http://www.ice911.org/ Some people think that we should just be getting on with engineering the climate, whereas others feel even the idea of it should \~ HYPERLINK http://www.etcgroup.org/content/global-manifesto-against-geoengineering not even be discussed A challenge, of course, is who governs the governors. There are strong feelings on both sides - scientists either must, or cannot, govern their own research, depending on your viewpoint. Personally, I'd like to see a broad, international body set up with the power to govern climate engineering research, especially when conducting outdoor experiments. And I think the hurdles to conducting these experiments should consider both the environmental and social impact, but should not be an impediment to safe, thoughtful research. RB : There are more proposed frameworks for governance than you can shake a stick at. But there are two major problems with them. The first is that most of those frameworks treat all SRM ideas as though they were stratospheric aerosol injection, and call for international regulation. That might be fine for those technologies with risks that cross national boundaries, but for ideas like reflective settlements and grasslands, such heavy handed governance might not make sense. Such governance is also at odds with the HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions/ndc-registry bottom-up architecture Which leads us to the second problem: these frameworks have almost exclusively arisen from a very narrow set of viewpoints - either those of natural or social scientists. What we really need now is broad societal participation in defining what governance itself should look like. MW : Yes. There are so many questions that need to be addressed. Who pays for delivery and development and, critically, any consequences? How is the global south enfranchised - they are least responsible, most vulnerable and, given current geopolitical frameworks, unlikely to have a strong say. What does climate engineering mean for our relationship with nature: will anything ever be ""natural"" again (whatever that is)? All these questions must be considered against the situation where we continue to emit CO? and extant risks from climate change increase. That climate engineering is sub-optimal to a pristine, sustainably managed planet is hard to argue against. But we don't live in such a world. And when considered against a +3\'b0C world, I'd suggest the opposite is highly likely to be true.

"COP24","Australia","COP24_Australia82","No Headline In Original","December 6, 2018 Thursday 9:11 AM AEST","MediaNet Press Release Wire","\~\~\~\~With the UN Climate Change Conference in Katovice ( COP24 ) now underway, the international community is discussing how to drastically reduce CO2 emissions. Transport is a key factor, responsible for about a fifth of global CO2 emissions - and the trend is rising. \~\~\~\~German technology company Graforce has developed a unique technology for producing climate-neutral, synthetic fuels from industrial wastewater and renewable energies. With low hydrogen production costs, a wide variety of wastewaters and significantly reduced emissions, its new plasmalysis technology makes a significant contribution to replacing fossil fuels. \~\~\~\~""We are well below the climate targets agreed in Paris. It's high time to seize every opportunity,"" explains Dr. Jens Hanke, founder of Graforce. ""E-fuels could be critical to climate protection, especially in the transport sector."" \~\~\~\~Gasoline, diesel, natural gas, kerosene: climate-neutral fuel production is possible \~\~\~\~Graforce has been working on the future of energy supply since 2010. At its Power2X plant in Berlin, Graforce is already producing hydrogen using the plasmalysis process developed in-house. Unlike electrolysis, which uses distilled water, plasmalysis produces hydrogen from high-energy chemical compounds in wastewater. The process halves fuel production costs and results in significantly higher yields. \~\~\~\~A high-frequency field of tension - called plasma - is generated from solar or wind energy above wastewater, which is produced, for example, in production processes in biogas, sewage or industrial plants. This plasma breaks down the carbon and nitrogen compounds (urea, amino acids, nitrates and ammonium) contained in the water into individual atoms, which then rebond. This produces hydrogen and - depending on the requirements - CO, CO2 or methane (CH4). \~\~\~\~Synthetic liquid fuels can then be produced from the resulting CO2 or CO and hydrogen using the proven Fischer-Tropsch process. These fuels make, above all, long-haul transport, aviation and shipping more climate-friendly without any adjustments or restrictions. \~\~\~\~Using methane or mixing hydrogen with biogas produces HCNG, which can be used as fuel in natural gas vehicles and in combined heat and power plants to reduce emissions (CO2, CO, HC, NOx) by 20 to 60 percent. The only waste products that remain are purified water and oxygen. Graforce cooperates with the carmaker Audi, the utility company Berliner Wasserbetriebe and other firms. \~\~\~\~- Cross reference: Picture is available at AP Images ( HYPERLINK http://www.apimages.com http://www.apimages.com \~\~\~\~For more information: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.graforce.com http://www.graforce.com \~\~ Contact Graforce GmbH Dr. Jens Hanke Johann-Hittorf-Str. 8 12489 Berlin Phone: +49 30 - 63 2222-110 HYPERLINK mailto:presse@graforce.de presse@graforce.de \~\~\~\~SOURCE: Graforce GmbH ASIANET \"
"COP24","Australia","COP24_Australia83","No Headline In Original","December 28, 2018","Dalby Herald (Queensland)","Lessons to be learned from recent bushfires THE recent catastrophic bushfire conditions in central and southern parts of the state brought out the best and worst of what Queensland has to offer. We witnessed brave men and women fight fires on the frontline, co-ordinate a response and lead recovery efforts. As someone who grew up in regional Queensland, I know how important small communities are during a time of crisis. Thank you to those people who sacrificed so much to ensure lives, properties, vegetation and livestock were saved. I believe these outstanding members of the community deserve more recognition and that's why I've written to the National Emergency Committee for them to consider opening a citation application process. During early December, LNP Member for Burnett Stephen Bennett and I had the privilege of meeting and thanking volunteers in areas including Bundaberg, Agnes Water and Baffle Creek. It was an opportunity for us to hear the stories of bravery, mateship and teamwork. In the past, a National Emergency Medal has been awarded to people who worked or volunteered during the Queensland floods of 2010, Cyclone Yasi and the 2009 Victorian bushfires. The men and women who worked tirelessly to protect their communities deserve this honour. I also believe we need to learn from this bushfire emergency and the best way for that is to hold a parliamentary inquiry by investigating issues including the managing of national parks, communication to affected communities and issuing of backburning permits to allow landholders to manage fuel loads. It can be the difference between saving lives and saving communities. Deb Frecklington, LNP Leader Climate carnival COP 24 just concluded in Poland. Nearly 23,000 climate saviours attended this 24th annual climate carnival. When the costs of hotels, ground transport, food, entertainment, air conditioning and office services are added, the bill is likely to top $500million. Australian taxpayers supported 46 junketeers. Now these Chicken Littles are back home spreading climate scare stories and lecturing locals to not overspend on Christmas presents. There is a bright side - all that carbon dioxide emitted by planes, cars, buses, heaters, stoves, beer, champagne and Poland's coal-fired power stations will help global plant growth.

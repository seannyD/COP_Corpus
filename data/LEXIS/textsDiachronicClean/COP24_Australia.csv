Former Labor climate change minister Greg Combet is its new chairman.It is one of a group of 441 global investors holding $US32 trillion ($44 trillion) - which also includes Australian Super, CBus and BT Investment Group - and urging governments around the world to match their deeds to their words on the Paris agreement on climate change.""The reality is that the long-term nature of the challenge has, in our view, met a zombie-like response by many. This is a recipe for disaster as the impacts of climate change can be sudden, severe and catastrophic,"" said Chris Newton, head of responsible investment at IFM Investors.Mr Newton said in Katowice, Poland, where the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP24) is taking place, that asset owners had to rise to the challenge because governments were not.""We need our infrastructure assets to continue to provide essential services to communities and economies around the world. We have a duty to our investors to act for the long term when others are clearly side stepping the challenge,"" he said.Mr Newton's remarks come as environment minister Melissa Price heads to Poland this week for COP24. Ms Price last week said the government had no intention of increasing its current goal of a 26-28 per cent reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 until 2025, even though emissions have increased to their highest quarterly rate in seven years under the Morrison government.Australia did not join nations such as the United States, Russia, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia in vetoing the adoption by of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's 2018 report, which said a complete phase-out of coal power by 2050 would be needed to limit temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius and avoid irreversible damage such as the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef. But Australia's current emissions targets and policies - like those of many nations - are considered inadequate to meeting the goal.The signatories to the 2018 Global Investor Statement to Governments on Climate Change are concerned that current emissions reduction commitments by governments will not achieve the goal they signed up to in Paris in 2015.Signatories to the Paris pact agreed to do whatever they it took to limit global temperature increases to well below 2 degrees Celsius to prevent irreversible damage to the global economy and natural wonders such as the Great Barrier Reef.Without greater action, Schroders points to long-run temperature rises of around 4 degrees Celsius, with $US23 trillion of associated global economic losses over the next 80 years. This is permanent economic damage three or four times the scale of the impacts of the 2008 global financial crisis. Specific actions sought by the investors include accelerating private sector investment into low-carbon energy, improved climate-related financial reporting, phasing out fossil fuel subsidies and thermal coal power and putting a meaningful price on carbon.Global members of the Investor Group on Climate Change include Schroder, Mercer, Hermes and a string of giant US public sector pension funds from large US states including California and New York.

I think it's a good signal - we can, in dialogue, advance all together.""He added that Poland stood by its assertion that ""green pragmatism"" was key to ensuring no countries were left behind.Richie Merzian, director of the Australia Institute's Climate and Energy Program, said the coal-heavy setting left ""a sour taste in the mouths of those who are committed to climate action"".""We're not here to celebrate coal, we're not here to adorn our bodies in coal jewellery, and so it sends the wrong message,"" he said.""But at the same time it is symbolic of trying to deal with the vested interests and the long history of reliance on fossil fuels in many of these cities and countries.""Mr Merzian added that coal companies were not on the same page as delegates seeking an ambitious plan to combat climate change.""Their core business is directly in contrast to ... the goal of the Paris Agreement, which is to transition completely away from reliance on fossil fuels,"" he said, adding that the influence of coal companies on governments ran deep.""Stopping that outright, in-your-face sponsorship would definitely help in terms of optics, but a lot of the influence is just strongly embedded into the positions that the countries bring forward."" Desperation in the PacificMr Kurtyka said global warming was undeniable and extraordinary summers had ravaged the planet.He stressed Poland's shift to more renewable energies and said there was strong political will amid the intense discussions at the conference.The issue was vital to Pacific nations facing an ""existential threat"", he added.Yesterday New Zealand released a defence policy statement naming climate change as its biggest security threat and stressing the impact of climate change on the Pacific.""It identifies climate change as one of the most significant security threats of our time, and one that is already having adverse impacts both at home and in New Zealand's neighbourhood,"" said Defence Minister Ron Mark in an emailed statement to Reuters.Australia, however, has turned its back on its Pacific neighbours in terms of climate change, Mr Merzian said.""The Pacific are getting desperate, and instead of their friends helping, they're hurting,"" he said.""Poland is the Australia of the EU - the largest coal user, the largest coal producer - but unlike Australia that can operate in its own bubble, Poland has to marry up its position with its EU colleagues as a bloc, and that's why they help drag Poland to be better than what it would otherwise be.""\l"

Political leaders everywhere, including strongmen, are still motivated by money.For example, in many countries, public health has became a key climate change issue. Just look at China, where leader Xi Jinping shares some characteristics with classic strongmen yet his government has realised that HYPERLINK https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674927816300223fossil fuel use comes at a growing cost to public health, tourism and labour productivity. \~ HYPERLINK https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(17)32345-0.pdfThe Lancet estimates the welfare costs from pollution to be equivalent to 6.2% of global GDP - and these costs are rising.

The HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/english_paris_agreement.pdfParis Agreement refers toTaking into account the imperatives of a Just Transition of the workforce and the creation of decent work and quality jobs in accordance with nationally defined development priorities.This issue of a just transition remained relatively dormant but has risen to prominence over the past year. It was highlighted in the communiqu\'e9 produced from the recent HYPERLINK http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2018/06/09/the-charlevoix-g7-summit-communique/G7 talks in June this year.

But ultimately the movement has already gathered sufficient pace for continued cooperation by other countries, as evidenced by the numbers signed up to Paris.

But before we pin our hopes on finance to solve climate change, there are some things we need to ask ourselves.Difficult questions for COP24 negotiatorsHow did we get to a point in history where it is taken for granted that public money alone can never be sufficient to finance our transition from fossil fuels? Is it an objective condition with no clear causation and responsibility, or something else?

As Michael Lewis noted in his \~ HYPERLINK https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/27/books/boomerang-by-michael-lewis-review.htmlboomerang theory, states that have propped up financiers with public money are now asking those same financiers to step in and do the job that states should do. And this leads to the second consideration.Climate change is historically, politically and socially complex. Although sustainable finance is not presented as the sole solution, analysing its role produces a series of strategic short circuits. It oversimplifies and depoliticises the response to climate change. It legitimises the idea that sustainability can be achieved within HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/14/climate-change-and-the-continual-demand-for-economic-growthcontinuous growth and expansionIt rewrites the way we think about our planet in the vocabulary of finance and its obsession for a return on investment. It marginalises any claim to address climate change based on present and historical injustices, redistribution and bottom-up projects organised by ordinary people.It accepts that the financial way of defining sustainability and its achievements are inherently aligned with the rights, interests and needs of people and the planet.Finance may be a partner in the fight against climate change, but it is certainly not a partner motivated by altruism. It's motivated by generating profit from the transition. It is therefore unsurprising that energy generation, railways, water management and other forms of climate mitigation have been identified as HYPERLINK http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/climatefinance/projectspriorities for sustainable financeFighting climate change on Wall Street's terms HYPERLINK https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/07/is-the-boom-in-megaprojects-sustainable/large returns by investing in the transition to ""greener"" infrastructure, including the not-so-green \~ HYPERLINK https://www.cgdev.org/blog/chinas-green-belt-road-initiative-isnt-very-greenChinese green belt and road HYPERLINK https://www.pri.org/stories/2013-07-01/brazils-hydro-dams-could-make-its-greenhouse-gas-emissions-soarsustainable investment HYPERLINK https://www.climatebonds.net/get-involved/green-city-bond-campaignGreen bonds can help cities finance projects to reduce their environmental impact or adapt to climate change. However, if money is the driver, we should not expect private investors to have any interest in projects that won't generate a sufficient return, but would benefit people or cities that cannot pay for the service or for the debt, or that would protect vulnerable people from climate change. If climate change is fought according to the rules of Wall Street, people and projects will be supported only on the basis of whether they will make money.Ten years ago, the world saw that finance had permeated every aspect of the global economy. Back then, it was clear that financial interests could not build a better and different world.

Six large forest programmes were introduced during the late 1990s and early 2000s, targeting over 100m hectares of land for reforestation.

It reduced soil erosion and desertification and stabilised local rainfall patterns.The ongoing programme also helped to alleviate poverty, as payments are made directly to farmers who set aside their land for reforestation. It has also reduced China's grain surplus, which was depressing prices, and helped to rebalance the inequality between the eastern and western provinces. The Grain for Green programme shows that widespread reforestation can have a very positive affect on the economy as well as the environment.There is ample opportunity and land on which to reforest.

The HYPERLINK UN Convention on the Law of the Sea HYPERLINK Honolulu Strategy was agreed in 2011 to help tackle marine debris coming from land-based activities. If these commitments were to be fully met then our plastic problem would be vastly reduced.One issue is that these obligations depend on plastic being recognised as harmful to humans or marine life. Plastic has long been considered a wonder material, which makes modern life possible. Like other ""wonderful inventions"" such as the HYPERLINK https://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/articles/ozone-layer-antarctic-ozone-hole-may-be-completely-healed-within-50-years-un-report/116451ozone-eating CFCs, it is only as plastic has started to accumulate in the world that we have realised it is a problem.A second issue is that each country has responded to this problem in different ways. HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/aug/28/kenya-brings-in-worlds-toughest-plastic-bag-ban-four-years-jail-or-40000-fineKenya, for example, has adopted legislation banning single use plastic bags, while the \~ HYPERLINK https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/single-use-plastic-carrier-bags-why-were-introducing-the-charge/carrier-bags-why-theres-a-5p-chargeUK has added a charge to their use. Current proposals to tackle plastics focus on increasing recycling. It is worth remembering though that only around https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2018/drowning-in-plastic?lang=cy11% of plastic is currently recycled around the world. If we are to rely on recycling as a means to tackle plastic pollution we need to rapidly increase recycling in almost every country. An increase in recycling to the extent needed can't happen overnight. We'd need effective and accessible recycling facilities and public education. Both would need huge investments of time and resources across the world. A treaty may be one way of coordinating such action and sharing knowledge about how best to improve recycling. Countries already share knowledge about how they meet some treaty obligations through HYPERLINK https://www.cbd.int/reports/reports to a governing bodyTax and replaceAnother measure being used is taxation. The assumption is that if we make plastics more expensive then either less will be used or alternative materials will replace them. Deposit return schemes are also suggested as a way to ""nudge"" producer and consumer behaviour. These types of measures do not always, however, HYPERLINK http://www.oecd.org/development/extended-producer-responsibility-9789264256385-en.htmprompt the desired responseSometimes, for example, costs are simply passed on to consumers. It is also difficult to apply these measures in emerging economies which lack the same regulatory bodies and infrastructure to monitor these measures, so other approaches may be needed.Governments have faced the question of how to tackle a pervasive pollutant produced by all countries before and the answer was to adopt a treaty for a rapid and coordinated response. The best known example is the HYPERLINK http://ozone.unep.org/Ozone Convention which was adopted in 1985 to reduce chemicals used in refrigeration and aerosols which damaged the ozone layer.Like subsequent treaties addressing other harmful chemicals, such as the HYPERLINK http://chm.pops.int/POPs Convention, the Ozone Convention tackled the most harmful first and was designed to enable alternatives to be introduced. Alternatives to harmful plastics do already exist - current plastics are largely derived from oil and so do not easily degrade.

Single use bags and straws could be phased out almost immediately under a global treaty, with other plastics addressed over a longer time frame. Those used in medical surgery may take decades to phase out, but support could be provided to industry to develop bioplastics, or other alternatives to plastics.A treaty could also address gaps in the current law. There is, for example, no provision for cleaning up the plastics already in the ocean. A new treaty could provide for a clean up fund to address these ""legacy"" plastics.The fund could be supported through contributions from importers and exporters of plastics, as already happens with importers and exporters of oil who pay into HYPERLINK a fund to address harm from oil spills, or through a tax on oil-based plastics products.The public are HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/18/uk-public-backs-tough-action-on-plastic-waste-record-numbers-consultation-latte-levy-taxclearly supportive of actionElizabeth Kirk does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.\l"

One of the best is the space exploration simulator HYPERLINK Kerbal Space Program (2011)The game wasn't originally designed for educational purposes.

It only damages their education,"" Mr Pyne said, in a comment that suggests he was wearing a suit and tie and carrying an appointment diary while still in kindergarten.Hunter MP Joel Fitzgibbon got the mood right and acknowledged students' need to express their mounting concerns in the public realm. He also crushed Pyne's argument about the ""damaged education"" that would flow from a few hours at the strike.""I don't think any student is going to miss out on their career because they missed a few hours of school today. As long as they are safe and their parents know where they are and they are marching or protesting in a respectful way, in a responsible way, I think that is fine,"" Mr Fitzgibbon said.While Friday's strike was overshadowed by the tragic New Zealand shootings, the students have made clear their demand for a global response to climate change will continue, and grow.""You are not mature enough to tell it like it is. Even that burden you leave to us children,"" she told adults at the UN conference.And she is right.Issue: 39,154.\l"

Australia is represented at COP24 (COP stands for conference of the parties) by Woodside Petroleum, BHP, environment minister Melissa Price and climate ambassador Patrick Suckling.Talk of 1.5 degrees 'normalised'Although the meeting has failed to agree - thanks to the US, Russia and Saudi Arabia - to language welcoming the HYPERLINK Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's September report urging the world to ramp up targets to limit global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees, there was so much talk about it that ""it has really been normalised,"" Mr Reed said.Peter Castellas, chief executive of the Carbon Market Institute, a lobby whose members includes Adelaide Brighton Cement, AGL Energy, Origin Energy, Wesfarmers, Aurizon, Telstra and Shell, said there is ""an increase in the urgency to raise the ambition of the Paris agreement"".The corollary is ""just how colossal a task and broad a transformation 1.5 degrees or even 2 degrees compatible targets are"", Mr Reed said. This will necessitate a ""big conversation"" in Australia about how to to achieve deep emissions cuts in carbon intensive sectors such as heavy industry and transport, and industrial heating.These industries have combined emit more carbon than electricity, which accounts for a third of Australian emissions, according to the Department of Environment's HYPERLINK Australia's Emissions Projections 2017 report.Climate Analytics found in a report for the Australian Conservation Foundation that Australia's manufacturing sector is effectively standing still on improving energy efficiency and falling behind global leaders Germany, italy, Japan, France and the US.Hydrogen 'not just hype'Existing policies such as the safeguard mechanism of the Morrison's government's Emissions Reduction Fund could play a role ""but we are going to have to do a lot more"", including using hydrogen as fuel, Mr Reed said.""Hydrogen is not just hype"", he said. It is a potential substitute for carbon heavy petroleum and land-intensive biofuels in heavy transport, but Australia has only taken tentative steps and ""we are going to have to do a hell of a lot in hydrogen"" to transition to clean energy in these industries.Mr Reed said although carbon capture and storage (CCS) has been overhyped by some fossil fuel advocates it is ""implausible that we can come anywhere near 1.5 degrees without a lot of CCS and - globally - quite a bit of nuclear power"".Mr Castellas said there was ""massive unstoppable momentum and consensus emerging around the inevitability of carbon pricing frm many jurisdictions"" as a means of achieving climate goals, but delegates who looked to Australia for its record in designing and implementing carbon pricing mechanisms and markets were perplexed and asked, ""why are you not doing it at home?""Environment minister Melissa Price kept a low profile at her first major climate change meeting.

"COP24","Australia","COP24_Australia26","Sunday Herald Sun EDITORIAL","May 13, 2018 Sunday","Herald Sun (Australia)","Council wage hike exposed AN extraordinary blowout in council wage expenditure is a concerning development for Victorian homeowners.A Sunday Herald Sun investigation of the draft budgets of 31 municipalities has revealed that wage bills are accounting for close to 44 per cent of council revenue. In some big-spending councils, the figure is significantly higher. The figures do not include funds paid to external contractors meaning the total spent on manpower is even higher.A number of factors including population growth, a boost in executive salaries and new workplace agreements have been blamed on the surge.Moonee Valley council's draft budget shows plans to spend $84 million - or 54 per cent of its budget - on 861 staff next financial year, jumping from $55.4 million just five years ago.Meanwhile, Cardinia Shire spent less than a third of its revenue on staff salaries.The figures show a remarkable 25 per cent increase on staffing costs since 2013-14 across 30 metropolitan Melbourne councils and the City of Geelong.At a time of stagnant wage growth, when ordinary Victorians are tightening their belt, the extravagant increase in labour expenditure at local government warrants greater examination.The third tier of government has for too long escaped the level of scrutiny state and federal governments routinely receive.And yet dozens of council officers in Victoria earn more than Premier Daniel Andrews.Councils are increasingly populated by activists with delusions of grandeur who spend ratepayer resources to grandstand on issues of national and international significance, issues that have little to do with local government business.In recent years we have seen councillors from the City of Monash debate whether to officially acknowledge the Armenian genocide, which occurred a century ago on the other side of the world, while Yarra council voted to fly the Co Vang flag despite warnings from the Federal Government that it could jeopardise trade with Vietnam.Moreland council has debated a treaty with Aborigines, an issue far removed from its province, and has in the past defied advice from Victoria Police, the State Government and local business owners to back protests by masked troublemakers.Yarra, Moreland and Darebin councils have formally dumped Australia Day celebrations on January 26, despite the national holiday being supported by the overwhelming majority of the population. La Trobe council raised the ire of ratepayers earlier this year by spending $21,000 to send a contingent, including mayor Darrell White, to Asia to visit wind and solar farms.The waste is nothing new, in 2015 Mornington Peninsula ratepayers paid thousands to send councillors on a junket to Paris to attend a .Global and national policy discussions are not matters for local government. It's little wonder that ratepayers are sick of their hard-earned being used by councillors to play politics on matters well above their station.The pet projects of activist councillors should not be allowed to monopolise council time and waste valuable resources.Australian policies on border protection, same-sex marriage, climate change and Australia Day are not issues that concern the third tier of government.Long-suffering ratepayers would appreciate councillors refocus on core council business that affect the daily lives of Victorians including the traditional three Rs of local government: rubbish, roads and rates.There needs to be far greater accountability to stop councillors and council staff from falling into the gravy train mentality.Addressing the expenditure on salaries would greatly reduce pressure to increase rates.Indeed, it could lead to a decrease in the amount property owners contribute in council rates and allow local municipalities to provide greater funding for services such as roadworks, parks and libraries.The mindset that wage costs and hence rates must rise every year is counter productive in creating efficiency and cost savings.Most hardworking property owners do not have the time to analyse council documents including annual reports. That's why we are exposing the soaring wages bill of Victorian councils - you deserve to know and the Sunday Herald Sun exists to serve you.\l"

He recalls representing the EU at the first meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in the 1980s and is dismayed at how long it has taken to turn words of warning into action. While world leaders meet at the United Nations in Katowice, Poland, Johnson appeals, ""Please let the Australian delegate in Katowice this week make a strong plea for urgent action.""""Actually, Australia's unbelievably well placed, isn't it? Think of the amount of solar panels you could install in this country.

""And I do say to myself, 'How can it be that this perfect valley is now subject to this massive expansion of coal production, at a time when everybody is saying coal is no longer king?'.""OK, there are internal economic pressures, but I go back to what I was saying.

This massive continental shift is simply known as Brexit, but there's nothing simple about it. The British people may have voted to leave the EU, but it is not a done deal. So the Brexit debate goes on across the nation; in the UK Parliament, in political parties, and in families, including the Johnsons'.""Well, I'm in a really difficult situation, because I have one son, Boris, who is the leader of the 'Leave' campaign, and I have another son, Jo, who has come out as being the leader of the 'Remain' campaign,"" says Stanley Johnson.

""If, on the other hand, it turned out there was a strong sense in the country that we wanted to stay in, a 'remainer' might emerge.""But here we are at the start of the season of goodwill to all. So surely the big question of whether Britain should remain in, or leave, the EU will be left off the table at the Johnson family Christmas dinner.""Who will be carving this year?,"" I ask.Stanley Johnson laughs, before he assures, ""Well, I think I'll be carving!""\l"

The COP is an annual conference, but, as we draw towards 2030, when we would cross over a number of critical tipping points, the conference is also an annual reminder of how little time we have to act. That is a very real possibility, unless we take serious action, and we're running out of time to take serious action. We're running out of time to take the kind of action that will ensure the long-term wellbeing of our children and our children's children. We're running out of time at precisely the same time as those opposite debate what size stick they'll take to the energy companies. It's a matter of complete insanity, quite frankly, that, as we stare down one of the most serious threats to our survival as a species, we're unable to convince those opposite that serious action needs to be taken, and needs to be taken immediately.

I need this legislation, we need this legislation through Parliament to give us the certainty to make those investments.""Announced by Treasurer Josh Frydenberg on November 2, the PRRT changes are expected to raise an extra $6 billion for the government over the next decade by reducing the amount of tax deductions that oil and gas ventures can carry forward and excluding onshore oil and gas developments from the regime.But there is no clarity over when the reform bill will be introduced, with Mr Frydenberg's statement on November 2 suggesting it may be 2019.The call for certainty over the PRRT's passage through Parliament was not the only piece of advice for Canberra in the wide-ranging speech Mr Coleman delivered to the Melbourne Mining Club on Tuesday.He said Australia's eastern states may need to replicate the sort of gas reservation that exists in Woodside's home market of Western Australia if they want to start tackling high gas prices. ""Each state needs a process to reassure the community that the reasonable domestic gas needs of Australians will be met. This may be achieved through reservation of acreage (as Queensland has done), or of volumes of domestic gas,"" he said.Mr Coleman also said Australian governments should lead the transition of the shipping, haulage and mining sectors away from diesel fuels to using cleaner-burning LNG.""There is the chance to achieve emissions reductions consistent with industrial development if governments incentivise the switch from diesel to LNG ... there may be a role for targeted government support for the conversion of heavy vehicles,"" he said.Less than three weeks before the start of the 24th United Nations Climate Change Meeting (COP24) in Poland, Mr Coleman said he hoped the international patchwork of carbon prices and policies could be replaced by a global approach to pricing carbon.""What I am appealing for is a universal approach to this,"" he said. ""Somebody needs to take leadership on it and the international community is, at the moment, floundering in this regard.""The biggest thing we could hope for in COP24 is that the emissions credits we generate here in Australia were actually able to be traded globally, at the moment under the Paris agreement, credits that a company like mine might generate somewhere else in the world are not able to be offset against emissions here in Australia and that is stifling where the market should be.""Instead of complaining about policy paralysis in Canberra, Mr Coleman said Australians needed to send a clear message to Canberra about what they want on carbon and energy policy.""The key is going to be that as a nation we need to start demanding these things and expecting these things,"" he said.""If you polled the room it would say 'we have really had enough of this to be quite honest', and it is time now to start moving beyond it. We do have the capabilities, we have the leadership talent in this country, we have the leadership talent in Canberra and in the states and we need to let them loose.""\l"

Ms Price, who will be Australia's most senior delegate, is not due to arrive until Sunday to attend the final week. One key objective of the summit will be for nations to agree on the ""Paris Rulebook"" that is aimed at guiding nations to fulfil their promised reductions and to make those cuts more transparent and comparable. A second aim is to conclude the so-called Talanoa Dialogue to assess how pledges are tracking in terms of meeting the Paris goal of keeping global warming to well under two degrees, compared with pre-industrial times.Current pledges, even if implemented, would probably see warming closer to three degrees, resulting in worsening climate extremes including the demise of the great bulk of the world's coral reefs. While the government has sought to stress Australia's carbon emissions as a share of economic output and per capita were at 28-year lows, new analysis by Climate Analytics shows pollution rates are more than twice the average of G20 nations.Emissions intensity, for instance, in Australia in 2015 was higher than the US and twice that of the European Union, the emissions tracking group found.""With current policies, Australia is not projected to catch up - indeed, it is projected to be overtaken by China by 2030 and stay far behind more-efficient and less- polluting economies such as Japan [and] the EU,"" Climate Analytics said. ""The latest round of major international climate change negotiations could prove embarrassing for Australia, given we are not on track to meet even our weak target for 2030,"" Kelly O'Shanassy, chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, said.""But embarrassment could be the least of our problems.

Richie Merzian, a climate researcher with The Australia Institute, said the speech ""relied almost entirely on policies her government tried to kill off or water down"". He also criticised the climate finance pledge, saying Prime Minister Scott Morrison ""had trashed and cut support for UN's key climate finance body, the Green Climate Fund"".Australia's policies also copped flak from The Climate Action Network, an alliance of 1300 environmental groups, which declared the country ""fossil of the day"" for its four years of rising greenhouse gas emissions. The network also raised the issue, first reported by the Herald, that Australia had ""remained silent"" about whether it planned to use any surplus from the Kyoto Protocol period - possibly 400 million tonnes worth - to count against its Paris target.Ms Price's Labor counterpart, Mark Butler, has also continued to not rule out the use of any Kyoto credits for its post-2020 targets. ""It's not clear whether the so-called rulebook for the Paris Agreement will allow a carry-over,"" he told Radio National on Thursday.

The results were released to coincide with this week's United Nations COP24 climate change summit in Poland.Insurers were scored on the degree to which they were divesting or refusing to provide insurance to coal companies, or were making clear plans to move in that direction. European insurers scored the highest, with Swiss Re topping the list, followed by Generali, Zurich, Allianz and AXA.US, Japanese and Australian companies all scored poorly. QBE, the only Australian insurer included in the survey, was slapped with a score of zero on both underwriting and divestment.""The scorecard clearly shows that QBE is falling behind its international competitors on climate action,"" Market Forces campaigner Pablo Brait said. ""Major insurers like Axa, Allianz and Zurich have dumped their coal company shares and are restricting their underwriting of coal. QBE continues to do nothing in this area despite climate change-fuelled natural disasters threatening its profits and entire business model.""QBE is regarded as the main Australian insurer active in the underwriting of coal companies. IAG, by comparison, has no exposure to coal on the underwriting side, and has reduced its investments in ""emissions intensive industries"" to 0.25 per cent of total assets.

The Climate Council's Professor Will Steffen said that would be using past accounting systems to apply a future reduction - using ""accounting fiddles to weaken even their pathetically weak target for 2030"".COP24, the major annual summit on climate change is currently taking place at Katowice in Poland.""So it's not clear to what extent there will or will not be rules around the use of surplus credits towards the 2030 targets,"" Professor Jotzo said.""The name of the game really is transparency, and that's the provisions that many countries are aiming to tighten.""As to whether or not counting old credits would be legitimate, he said the 2030 Paris pledges were clear: countries will reduce emissions to a specified level in 2030.""There's really no ifs and buts ... our expectation would clearly be that earlier surplus credits will not be used to justify an underachievement on the 2030 targets,"" Professor Jotzo said.The Labor Party has committed to a 45-per-cent emissions-reduction target by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050, but it won't comment on the question of credits.And the Federal Government hasn't responded to the ABC's request for comment on the matter either.Why it's not fairIf Australia did come in miles ahead in its Kyoto targets, why should those not count towards its Paris 2030 targets?""This is basically an accounting fiddle,"" Professor Steffen said.He described counting that excess towards the 2030 target as ""a loophole"".""That's a tactic that other countries have not done explicitly, because they don't think it's fair,"" he said.Those countries are Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden.He said Australia's Kyoto target was ""completely inadequate"" from a scientific perspective, and ""pathetically weak"".""It was a concession made by the other countries just to get Australia in the tent,"" he said.According to Professor Steffen, Australia's Paris target was equally devoid of scientific merit.""So why should we use yet another fiddle to even get less action on climate change?""The Paris targets are non-binding, but Dr Bruce Mountain, the director of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, said counting credits from the Kyoto targets was fundamentally against the spirit of the Paris agreement.""To be honest, I find the whole discussion somewhat spurious,"" HYPERLINK http://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/pm/will-australia-reach-its-2030-climate-targets-using-a-loophole/10608330he told PM.""It's so obviously contrary to the principle of the agreement.""That we could be even be contemplating this now is unusual and it makes no sense to me.""\l"

Really looking forward to your reply for the education and good of humanity. John Britton, BrinsmeadWater and transport I COMPLETELY fail to understand the short term thinking common in news articles in relation to both transport and water issues.Having heard Sir David Attenborough's G20 speech only reinforces what I think we need to do.Why are we talking of building yet more dams to increase our water holding capacity when we should only be talking about using less water.I'm referring to Australia's 90 per cent of urban/residential/rural-residential population, not farming.The average water consumption in Cairns is 300l per person, per day, which I think is just ludicrous.An entire family can live on that for a week in many countries. The average consumption in Port Douglas is 1200l per person, per day. It's astounding.While the Tablelands average probably cannot be calculated as so many properties have unlimited creek/river/bore usage - which also needs to be changed - I regularly check my metre and have averaged 100l per person, per day, for the last three years.No, we don't smell, and yes, we have a garden. We should all be doing that, before we end up like Capetown, or worse.Same with transport.Why are we talking of spending billions on the Kuranda Range road, when there are already two forms of infrastructure that could be used far more effectively?Others have already suggested using the railway for freight, which makes sense, and could be easily done.Surely the rail could also cater for locals at a discounted rate to save everyone taking their own car?And why can't all of the Kuranda/Cairns commuters go down and back in the Skyrail, filling their empty cars at peak times?A government subsidy would still be cheaper for us than building tunnels. Plus, make carpooling during peak hours compulsory, at least three days a week.

"COP24","Australia","COP24_Australia54","EXPENSIVE ELECTION LOOMS","December 18, 2018 Tuesday","The Australian","Expect Labor and the Coalition to throw cash around It was a nice, if ominous, irony that while Opposition Leader Bill Shorten was inside the Adelaide Convention Centre on Sunday promising more government spending when he becomes prime minister, protesters were outside, and inside, promising to fight the Adani coal mine, and coal mining generally.Elsewhere the MYEFO papers were being printed with duelling spending promises from the government.In each case that was just the beginning of what is likely to be one of the most spendthrift election campaigns in history, because a $10 billion-plus revenue windfall has hit the budget in 2018.The irony? That much of the revenue windfall has come from coal, the object of so much angst, and it is ominous because for that reason there's a good chance we are in for a second dose of what happened between 2004 and 2008.Those years saw a commodity-led budget windfall that produced big budget surpluses as well as big, permanent, increases in spending as the Howard government tried to buy a fifth term.Unfortunately, the increase in revenue proved to be a lot less permanent than the spending, as the terms of trade collapsed, locking in 11 deficits and taking public debt from nothing to $350bn.The current increase in revenue will be temporary as well, not for the same reason as the last time but the effect is likely to be the same, if not worse.The reason tax revenue collapsed last time was the global financial crisis in 2008 followed by the devastating breakdown in commodity prices in 2011-12.This time is likely to be different, but the same: China's economy is in a structural slowdown, as evidenced by Friday's latest batch of data, and the world is moving away from coal.That's not because of protests like the anti-Adani ones in Adelaide on Sunday, but because the Paris Agreement on emissions reduction was further solidified at COP24 in Poland on the weekend and because the cost of renewable energy has fallen to below that of coal.The price of thermal coal has been falling since July after a strong rise in the previous 12 months.Obviously the revenue windfall revealed in MYEFO is not entirely, or even mostly, due to thermal coal, but that's an important part of it.The rest of it is iron ore, coking coal and LNG, exports of which to China have been growing strongly this year, in both price and volume. There is now a question mark over how long that will last. But for the moment, things couldn't be better. Treasury's estimate of nominal GDP - the main driver of taxation revenue - was previously 3.75 per cent for 2018-19. Thanks to the stronger than anticipated terms of trade, that's now much higher, and the deficit is shrinking faster than it did in the early 2000s.As a result of that, the government now has a whopping war chest for the 2019 election and of course the Labor Party has the same chest, plus a bit more because of ""tough decisions"" on dividend franking, negative gearing and capital gains tax.There can be nothing worse for the health of future budgets than the combination of a temporary lift in tax revenue and a federal election, especially one where a Coalition government is well behind in the polls and likely to lose, and is going to bring down a pre-election budget.That's because like the MYEFO, the April budget will contain more actual locked-in spending increases, not just campaign promises - like the pre-election budget of 2007 did - and then on top of that we get the campaign promises of Labor on top of those spending increases in the budget, after they win the election.And then we get the cyclical commodity downturn as China's economy slows, this time with an Australian property collapse and likely household consumption recession, plus a global agreement on carbon emissions, thrown in.It could be a very expensive election indeed.Alan Kohler is the editor in chief of InvestSMART.\l"

We are in deep trouble with climate change.According to the World Meteorological Organization, the 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years, the concentration of carbon dioxide is the highest it has been in three million years and emissions are now growing again.LINDA MOTTRAN: So the only answer, experts say, and its locked in the Paris Agreement, is to phase out the use of fossil fuels by 2050.So what are the prospects?Manuel Pulgar-Vidal is a former president of the UN-FCCC, the Framework Convention on Climate Change, and a former environment minister in Peru.Currently he heads Climate and Energy Practice for WWF International and he joins me from Katowice.Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, thank you very much for joining us.The Trump administration is rolling back climate measures and encouraging fossil fuels, but at the conference the former California Governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, offered some hope about the US.Here he is.ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER: We have leadership in Washington that is backwards, but America as a country did not drop out of the Paris Agreement.The mayors and the governors are still on board, the private sector is in. The financial sector is in, the universities and the academic sector is in.Everyone is still in.We still are marching in the right direction.LINDA MOTTRAM: Everyone is marching in the right direction except the Federal Government.Is he right about that, Manuel Pulgar-Vidal?MANUEL PULGAR-VIDAL: Yeah, hello Linda, morning to you all.Let me say some something about the Trump administration: Despite of the announcement to have the US withdraw with the Paris Agreement, we should keep the long-term vision, and that is happening in America.Two strong things: most of the Americans are with the Paris Agreement - and this initiative by the non-state actors, mostly the business sector, that is called 'We are still in', is showing that the non-state actors' agenda is defining clear (inaudible) targets, and those targets are strongly based on science.Because everybody knows that it is an irreversible and unstoppable process.So I think, Linda, that what we should be pleased to see that when we keep the long term vision, that political difficulties should be seen as a political accident.Let me put the example of the G20.Despite of the opposition of the US, the Argentina presidential- presidency, sorry, of the G20 has gotten a communique, and the communique is strong, it is good, it is enough to continue moving the process forward.LINDA MOTTRAM: But, I mean, China's delegates are saying all the right things, but China's record is mixed - as are many other countries - India, Japan, South Korea, there's some rekindling of the love of coal.Isn't there evidence here that the global effort is at risk of falling apart?MANUEL PULGAR-VIDAL: Yeah, there are for sure some risks.But again, if we are able to keep the idea of a 2050 pathway towards a zero net carbon economy by 2050, I think that we could continue pushing this idea forward.Because as much, Linda, as there are countries that are thinking to withdraw the Paris Agreement, as much as new leadership are emerging - and that is really important.The US used to be, in Obama's time, the leader of this process towards a Paris Agreement, and after that, he was replaced some way by France, by Canada, by the European Union, among some others, and that is what we are going to have.Yesterday I was using this analogy: If we are planning to go from the northern part of Canada to the southern part of Argentina, in the road I am sure that we are going to have some good roads and highways, and some other not so good, some big holes.Probably we are going to have some difficulties with the car.That is the risk that we are going to face in this process. But we should continue keeping the idea of moving the planet agenda forward, because we at the time in which we should implement in Paris and draw out good elements that could keep our optimism to do that.Let me say one more thing: We can see that this COP24 in Katowice in a negative way or positive way, that it is in the most important region for coal workers and coal industry in Poland - and more to the positive way.So in some ways, Linda, what we are doing here in Katowice, it is sending a message to the coal industry that the phase-out of coal, it is irreversible.But on the other hand that we are going to work strongly, in just transition and including social considerations, to that phase-out - because that is the way in which we are going to kick out of the fossil fuels in some time soon.LINDA MOTTRAM: Well, optimism, pessimism, I think there is a lot of swinging between those.I mean, the warnings that we heard from David Attenborough, for example, about civilizational calamity if more is not done.I mean, is it realistic, do you think, that by 2050 we will meet that 1.5 degree goal, or are we going to go well beyond that because at the moment we are on target to go well beyond it?MANUEL PULGAR-VIDAL: I am fully, fully sure that we are going to keep the 1.5 by 2050.But for sure, the point it is if we can go there with overshooting or not overshooting, so that is why we are pushing the agenda as a way to really have a strong reduction of carbon emissions.That is the way.And on the other hand, we don't know exactly what it would happen and what role it could play, that middle technology that is going to emerge for the next 32 years.Thirty-two years, it is a timeframe from now until 2050 in which many things could happen.But I am sure that this awareness and the presence of some elements of science, new financial flows. We are in a strong agenda of the non-state actors.Some new leaders that are emerging, new mobilisation could make us able to really get with success the 1.5 by 2050.LINDA MOTTRAM: The voices of young people are being highlighted.Fifteen-year-old Greta Thunberg stopped going to school for three weeks to protest outside the Swedish Parliament for climate action.Here she is speaking earlier at the meeting in Poland:GRETA THUNBERG: There was some youths in the USA that refused to go to school because of the school shootings, and then someone said 'What if children did that, refused to go to school, but for the climate?'And then I thought it was a very good idea and I thought that hasn't been done before in this purpose.LINDA MOTTRAM: Students here were also on strike in Australia last week on climate.MANUEL PULGAR-VIDAL: Yes, for sure, yes.I think that the voice of youth, it is really important to mobilise political leaders and the strongest leaders towards taking some strong decisions.And remember, Linda, that it is not just about COP, it is about many places, many rooms in different levels in which the politicians should take decisions to address climate change.The COP, it is the most important place to take those kind of decisions - but also on the other hand, the economic sector should continue defining strong targets based on science, and we do need to have the mobilisation of people.And the people and the citizens have their roles to play.The first one it is to bring pressure to politicians and authorities and government; but on the other hand, also to take their behaviour.Because climate change, it is about behaviour, it is about consumers.So the equation it is politicians and authorities in COP, economic sectors and a world and committed citizens.From Poland, Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, who is a former president of the UN-FCCC, and a former environment minister in Peru currently with WWF International.\l"
"COP24","Australia","COP24_Australia56","Writer Stanley Johnson no bush basher","December 8, 2018 Saturday","Newcastle Herald (Australia)","HE looks very much like his eldest son. Or the son looks very much like him. He has the same cheeky schoolboy's face and a mop of hair falling over his forehead.But Stanley Johnson is not just the father of Boris Johnson, former Lord Mayor of London, ex-British Foreign Secretary and a central player in the Brexit maze. Stanley Johnson is also a former politician, an environmentalist and a writer of 25 novels and non-fiction books.Yet this week, the Englishman's snow-coloured hair has been glimmering under the Australian summer sun, as he visited his sister and brother-in-law, Hilary and Peter Heanly, on their farm in a remote valley outside the village of Stroud.""I think this is the most wonderful valley,"" Johnson says, as he gazes over paddocks dissected by a creek.He recounts how he has been going into town to swim in the public pool, he attended the local Carols at the Rotunda, and he loves Stroud's historic buildings.""It gives a real feeling of being an 1850s, 1860s place,"" Johnson says. ""It's a wonderful place to be.""As well as visiting family, Stanley Johnson has been in Australia for work - as a reality television star.""Basically, reality TV is standing around, acting in a normal way,"" he explains.In Britain, Stanley Johnson's face has become almost as widely known as his eldest son's. Last year, he was a contestant on the UK version of I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!, a TV show that involves people of varying levels of fame surviving challenges in a jungle, and the whims of the viewing public.The 78-year-old has returned to the production set in the ""jungle"" near ""Mur-will-um-bah"" (and he pronounces each syllable of the northern NSW town's name as though he is carefully rolling a crystal around inside his mouth), as a guest on the program.""That is the most important place in Australia at the moment,"" Johnson says, ""because that is where most of the eyes of Britain are now focused, because the issue is, 'Who is going to come out of that jungle at the end of this week?'.""Stanley Johnson has appeared in a string of British television reality and quiz shows, including The Real Marigold Hotel, The Chase, ""and, worryingly, I'm on a program called Celebrity Mastermind"". When asked why he appears on so many television programs, Johnson cheerfully replies, ""At my age, you've got to do something. You can't sit in a garden in Stroud, moving cows from place to place!""Johnson's principal workplace has been Britain and Europe. He was a Member of the European Parliament, and he has held high-ranking positions in the European Commission. He has stood on the conservative side of politics. His sons, Boris and Jo, until recently the British transport minister, are Conservative Party representatives.Yet Johnson's politics, and his world view, have been heavily shaped by his passion for the environment. That passion flowed through much of his work for the European Union. That passion has taken him around the globe to remote places, and it has fuelled many of his written words. One of his books, for instance, is titled, Where The Wild Things Were: Travels of a Conservationist.""I probably still think of myself as mainly an environmentalist,"" he says.Johnson has been a regular visitor to this part of the world. As he says, he is ""quite familiar"" with Williamtown airport, and he doesn't need a GPS device or map to find his way to Stroud.And he has been coming to Australia for long enough to chart change.Johnson says he is ""devastated"" to see the nation's population increasing so rapidly, as it approaches 25 million.""How can this be?,"" he asks. ""Don't the people living in this country realise they have a very, very scarce resource base, in terms of the land and the water and forest? And can they really afford to continue with population expansion at this rate?Stanley Johnson dismisses the idea that population growth is needed for an economy to grow: ""In my view, if you can manage to keep a stable population, then the desperate need for continued economic growth is much smaller.""All of this has to be seen in terms of the global environmental constraints here.""Johnson talks about greenhouse gas emissions. He recalls representing the EU at the first meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in the 1980s and is dismayed at how long it has taken to turn words of warning into action. While world leaders meet at the United Nations in Katowice, Poland, Johnson appeals, ""Please let the Australian delegate in Katowice this week make a strong plea for urgent action.""""Actually, Australia's unbelievably well placed, isn't it? Think of the amount of solar panels you could install in this country. If you didn't need to dig up more coal ... you could probably meet most of Australia's energy needs through solar energy.""During our conversation, Stanley Johnson has brought the argument close to home.""I have known the Hunter Valley for 20 or 30 years, and I've driven up through the Hunter Valley,"" he says. ""And I do say to myself, 'How can it be that this perfect valley is now subject to this massive expansion of coal production, at a time when everybody is saying coal is no longer king?'.""OK, there are internal economic pressures, but I go back to what I was saying. If Australia itself was not so gung-ho for economic expansion, those pressures wouldn't be so great.""I wonder how, as a prominent British Conservative, he has reconciled within himself holding some of these views that must be very lonely on his side of politics.""It's an interesting question. I never myself have seen a basic contradiction between the word 'Conservative' and 'intelligent',"" he says, bursting into laughter.However, Johnson goes on to say that the great power of conservative regimes most of the world over is the business forces behind them.""So, yes, I would say I am pretty unusual in this.""Back in Johnson's homeland, there is a lot of disagreement about Britain departing the European Union. This massive continental shift is simply known as Brexit, but there's nothing simple about it. The British people may have voted to leave the EU, but it is not a done deal. So the Brexit debate goes on across the nation; in the UK Parliament, in political parties, and in families, including the Johnsons'.""Well, I'm in a really difficult situation, because I have one son, Boris, who is the leader of the 'Leave' campaign, and I have another son, Jo, who has come out as being the leader of the 'Remain' campaign,"" says Stanley Johnson. He has supported Britain remaining in the EU.The Brexit debate has also applied pressure on Prime Minister Theresa May, prompting talk, not for the first time, that Boris Johnson could be the UK's next leader.The father is diplomatic in the face of that speculation.""If there was a strong sense in the country that we want to have a clean break [from the EU], OK, then I think it might well be that Boris turns out to be the leader of the 'clean breakers',"" Johnson muses. ""If, on the other hand, it turned out there was a strong sense in the country that we wanted to stay in, a 'remainer' might emerge.""But here we are at the start of the season of goodwill to all. So surely the big question of whether Britain should remain in, or leave, the EU will be left off the table at the Johnson family Christmas dinner.""Who will be carving this year?,"" I ask.Stanley Johnson laughs, before he assures, ""Well, I think I'll be carving!""\l"
"COP24","Australia","COP24_Australia57","Attenborough's warning of climate disaster","December 5, 2018 Wednesday","The Australian","KATOWICE: Naturalist and documentary maker David Attenborough said yesterday the world was facing a man-made disaster of global scale.Addressing world leaders at the COP 24 UN climate conference in Katowice, Poland, Sir David said without action the collapse of civilisation and the -extinction of much of the natural world was on the horizon.Launching a multimedia site for the convention, Sir David said people were willing to make sacrifices in their daily lives recognising they too must play their part.Opening the conference, UN Secretary-General Antonio -Guterres said ""for many people, regions and even countries this is already a matter of life and death"".""Climate change is running faster than we are and we must catch up sooner rather than later before it is too late,"" he said.Mr Guterres said the Katowice conference was the most important gathering on climate change since the Paris Agreement was signed three years ago.""We need a complete transformation of our global energy economy, as well as how we manage land and forest resources,"" he said.Mr Guterres had four messages for those attending to negotiate a rule book to bring the Paris Agreement to life.Firstly, science demands a more ambitious response.Secondly, the Paris Agreement provides a framework for action. Thirdly, there was a collective responsibility to invest in averting global climate chaos, to consolidate the financial commitments made in Paris and to assist the most vulnerable nations. Finally, climate action offers a compelling path to transform the world for the better.Mr Guterres said the latest UN Environment Program Emissions Gap Report found the current -nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement would lead to global warming of about 3C by the end of the century. The majority of countries most responsible for greenhouse gas emissions were behind in their efforts to meet their Paris pledges.The report, released ahead of the conference, said while G20 members collectively were on track to achieve the target emission levels in 2020 implied by the Cancun pledges, Canada, Indonesia, Mexico, South Korea, South Africa and the US were either not projected to or uncertain of meeting their pledges.And G20 nations were not on track to meet their unconditional NDCs for 2030 and about half of members' greenhouse gas emissions trajectories were set to fall short. They included Argentina, Australia, Canada, the EU, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and the US. Three G20 members - Brazil, China and Japan - were on track to meet their targets, while emissions from India, Russia and Turkey were projected to be more than 10 per cent below their unconditional NDC targets.It was uncertain whether Indonesia and Mexico were on track to meeting their NDC targets in 2030. Recent studies have cast doubt on China's ability to peak its greenhouse gas emissions before 2030 as it has promised.Nepalese President Bidhya Devi Bhandari said it was incumbent on the international community to ensure that justice is done. ""We feel as if we have been penalised for the mistakes we never made,"" Mr Bhandari said.Not a single G20 nation sent a top-level representative to the COP 24 opening on Monday.Mr Guterres said transformative action was needed in energy, cities, land use, water and industry. He said 75 per cent of the infrastructure needed by 2050 still remained to be built.""How this is done will either lock us in to a high-emissions -future or steer us towards truly sustainable low-emissions development,"" he said.""Governments and investors need to bet on the green economy, not the grey. That means embracing carbon pricing, eliminating harmful fossil fuel subsidies and investing in clean technologies.""It also means providing a fair transition for those workers in traditional sectors that face disruption, including through retraining and social safety nets.""EDITORIAL P15\l"

This movement, started by a single 16-year-old Swedish student, Greta Thunberg, has received the strongest response from Australian young people. I saw this when I met students from Huonville High School and New Town High School last year at the COP24 Climate Change Conference in Katowice, Poland. They spoke with eloquence and passion, their words and actions backed by an overwhelming amount of evidence.One such suite of evidence comes from the LancetCountdown: Tracking Progress on Health and Climate Change, a collaboration of researchers from the world's leading institutions, tracking health impacts and responses to climate change. The key messages of its 2018 report can be summarised in three words: impact, delay, opportunity.We are already experiencing health impacts. More people are exposed to extreme heat, infectious diseases, losses from extreme weather events and food insecurity. More than half of cities in a global survey expect climate change will seriously compromise their public health infrastructure. The Medical Journal of Australia-LancetCountdown report has found Australians are already more vulnerable to dengue fever outbreaks, heatwaves, reduced ability to work due to heat, reduced wheat yields and impacts on mental health.Impacts have occurred with a global warming of 1C. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Global Warming warned of changes that would occur with a further warming of 0.5C by 2100 and the even greater impacts that would occur with global warming of 2C. Given the world is warming at 0.2C per decade, these impacts are not set to start in 2100, but will worsen from now and throughout this century. I graduated from medical school in 2015 and will likely be working beyond 2060. Climate-related health exposures, vulnerabilities and impacts affecting the populations I serve will look vastly different even over the course of my career.There has been an unconscionable delay in the global response to climate change, an issue the world's leaders have been aware of for longer than I have been alive. The carbon intensity of the world's total energy supply has remained unchanged since 1990 and per-person fossil fuel use for road transport is increasing. Burning fossil fuels not only causes climate change, it is the biggest contributor to air pollution. Coal alone is responsible for more than 460,000 early deaths per year due to air pollution. The IPCC Special Report tells us we should be achieving carbon neutrality within 30 years, meaning global emissions need to start reducing now and continue to reduce at a rapid rate. But the UN Environment Emissions Gap Report states that current trajectories show global emissions rising beyond 2030. Australia's emissions reduction target for the Paris Agreement is far from consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5C by 2100 and, with carbon emissions heading in the wrong direction, Australia is on track to overshoot even this weak commitment.However, action on climate change presents the opportunity to improve health. Switching from burning fossil fuels to clean sources of energy and transport will reduce human-caused air pollution, which is responsible for about 2900 premature deaths each year in Australia. Supporting walking and cycling as transport can improve physical activity and encouraging plant-rich diets can reduce agricultural emissions and improve nutrition. These actions can reduce Australia's biggest burdens of disease: heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, bowel cancer, breast cancer and type 2 diabetes. Now is a crucial time. We have seen leadership in our young people, but unfortunately for us, they are not yet the key decision-makers. Australia has delayed action for far too long and we must elect a government committed to action on climate change and improving the health of Australians and people around the world. Next year the commitment period for the Paris Agreement begins and governments must increase their commitments to be in l"

"COP24","Australia","COP24_Australia61","GLOBAL FUND IS FOLLY FOR US","September 30, 2018 Sunday","Herald Sun (Australia)","A few weeks ago in Bangkok, there was a six-day meeting of the world's climate-change bureaucrats to thrash out the details of a new rulebook for the Paris Agreement.In December, world leaders will congregate in Poland for the UN climate-change conference, COP24 as it's known. Like Copenhagen and Paris that went before it, after their posturing speeches and group photograph, the politicians will ""agree"" what's already been agreed by these bureaucrats in Bangkok.Well, that was the plan.But Bangkok went off the rails. Officially it was reported as ""beset with tension"", that key issues were ""stalemated"" and that the future of the Paris deal was ""on the brink"".Central to this lack of consensus was a fight about the proposed rulebook governing the implementation and monitoring of various Paris Agreement commitments. But really, the conflict was about the money.Forget all the language about rising sea levels in the Pacific and saving polar bears. The real purpose of international climate-change agreements is to move money from rich countries like Australia and the US to poor countries in the developing world.The Paris Agreement is not about the environment; it is about deindustrialising the West and imposing a ""moral tax"" on nations that used fossil fuels to build wealth over the past two centuries. The key to facilitating this is the new $100 billion global climate- change fund.At Bangkok, Australia and the US were accused of stalling negotiations on the fund because they (rightly) demanded greater transparency for how their billions would be spent.Like foreign aid, which fails to reach the people who desperately need it, I fear much of the climate-change millions are merely being used to prop up the budgets of poorer countries under the guise of green-religion politicking, hiding more systemic financial problems in their countries.But it gets worse.This week, the climate-change shame police came knocking on Australia's door again. Despite our minuscule contribution of 1.3 per cent of global emissions, as a nation we're now told we're expected to pony up some four billion dollars as part of our promises at the Paris conference in December 2015. Or rather, Malcolm Turnbull's commitments. Remember him?The Abbott government first put Australia's 26 per cent emissions reduction target on the table, but it did so on the advice that we could achieve these reductions without any policy change and without any significant economic damage. It was also on the written understanding that the emissions reduction agreement would include all countries.Three years on, we now know that even existing emissions reductions policy is putting power prices through the roof, sending jobs offshore, and risking blackouts when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine.When circumstances change, smart people change their position. Tony Abbott has said that if we'd known then what we know now, he'd never have agreed to a 26 per cent emissions reduction.Let's never forget that it was the Turnbull government that signed the Paris Agreement and then raced out and ratified it the day after Trump was elected, knowing the US was out. So far, and without much conviction, Prime Minister Morrison has said we're staying in - but that shouldn't mean that we hand over even more money to global green bureaucrats.To big-note himself at the Paris conference, Turnbull promised ""up to a billion dollars"" for this UN green climate fund that was supposed to total $100 billion each and every year. Now, something called the World Resources Institute says this week that Australia should be the sixth- biggest donor to this fund - behind just the US, Britain, Japan, Germany and Canada - because of our wealth and because of our historical contribution to carbon dioxide emissions. And what was initially supposed to be a one-off contribution of billions could even become an annual tax at the Poland summit in December.I can appreciate that Scott Morrison is reluctant to change an international commitment made by his predecessor. But that's a weak reason in my book.It's one thing to stick with Paris, but it's another altogether to keep shovelling out good money after bad to a fund that we don't control.Morrison should send a clear signal that he's in charge here, not the faceless global bureaucrats, by walking away from Turnbull's promise to put a billion dollars in the fund and declare from now on that Australia comes first.PETA CREDLIN IS A SUNDAY HERALD SUN COLUMNIST\l"

The figure has been quoted that 62% of those with one negatively geared investment property have taxable incomes less than $80,000.That is true, however, these so-called ""Mum and Dad"" investors would actually have taxable income well over $80,000 without the negative gearing tax offset.Therefore, the negative gearing tax offset (NGO) is hardly egalitarian. I suspect that we may already be in a recession.This has probably less to do with the current Liberal government and more to do with overseas governments.Certainly, there is little point in ""Seinfeldian"" regulation, simply enveloping risk-averse behaviour already evident in market players.However, when there is a lull in property investment it is a perfect time to make changes to investment taxation policy because investors will have more time to assimilate any changes into their strategies.

No doubt the Mayor made zero mention of wind farms and the damage they do to fauna.A study conducted by Health Infrastructure on redeveloping the current (brownfield) hospital highlights the adverse impacts on patients, staff and residents around the current Tweed Heads Hospital.Build times blow out to years and years of construction works. Local road impacts, including the partial loss of one, some older hospital buildings would have to be kept to link newer builds, therefore building standards are compromised.Allocated budget is eaten up (20%) by engineering a solution out of the Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) etc. meaning a huge chunk ($106.8M) out of the $534M budget.Decanting patients and services from area to area within the built environment of the existing hospital to enable works would be a logistical nightmare.The first 'new building' at the THH would need to be built at 15 levels high in comparison to the Cudgen Road site to obtain the equivalent floor space needed.The Tweed Mayor demands that The Tweed Hospital site be redeveloped.

Labor's selective SLATS summary failed to even mention the word drought which was ravaging more than 80 per cent of Queensland at the time of the report.If this isn't further proof that Labor are drought deniers, I don't know what is. Once again, Labor are hiding the full story and the SLATS report has again failed to explain the full picture of vegetation management in Queensland. The report doesn't even measure regrowth and vegetation rejuvenation which is essential when assessing the real state of the environment. It is clear that Labor are more interested in manipulating the data than achieving sensible environmental outcomes. The LNP understands that landholders are sick and tired of Labor using vegetation management for political gain at the expense of farmers.That is why the Liberal National Party has consistently opposed these unfair and irrational vegetation laws that throw scientific consensus out the window to appease green ideological agendas.

"COP24","Australia","COP24_Australia69","Climate shaming to take billions","September 30, 2018 Sunday","The Courier Mail (Australia)","Existing emissions reductions policy is putting power prices through the roof It's time our Prime Minister walked away from an agreement that is draining cash reservesA few weeks ago, in Bangkok, there was a six-day meeting of the world's climate change bureaucrats to thrash out the details of a new rule book for the Paris Agreement.In December, world leaders will all congregate in Poland for the UN's Climate Change Conference, COP24 as it's known, and like Copenhagen and Paris that went before it, after their posturing speeches and group photograph, the politicians will ""agree"" what's already been agreed by these bureaucrats in Bangkok.Or so that was the plan.But Bangkok went off the rails. Officially it was reported as ""beset with tension"", that key issues were ""stalemated"" and that the future of the Paris deal was ""on the brink"". Central to this lack of consensus was a fight about the proposed rule book governing the implementation and monitoring of various Paris Agreement commitments. But really, the conflict was about the money.Forget all the language about rising sea levels in the Pacific and saving polar bears, the real purpose of international climate change agreements is to move money from the developed world, rich countries like Australia and the US, to poor countries in the developing world.The Paris Agreement is not about the environment; it is about deindustrialisation of the West and imposing a ""moral tax"" on nations that used fossil fuels to build wealth over the past two centuries and key in facilitating this is the new $100 billion global climate change fund.At Bangkok, Australia and the US were accused of stalling negotiations on the fund because they demanded greater transparency for how their billions would be spent. Quite rightly, the growing scepticism of taxpayers in both our countries is forcing a rethink on money being given away, hand over fist, to these global entities for little or no environmental gain.Like foreign aid, which I grow ever more concerned fails to reach the people who desperately need it. I fear much of the climate change millions are merely being used to prop up the budgets of poorer countries, under the guise of green religion politicking, hiding more systemic financial problems in their countries such as lack of governance and corruption.But it gets worse, because this week, the climate change shame police came knocking on Australia's door again. Despite our minuscule contribution of 1.3 per cent of global emissions, as a nation, we're now told we are expected to pony up some $4 billion - that's more than four thousand million of your money - as part of our promises at the Paris Conference in December 2015. Or rather Malcolm Turnbull's commitments, remember him?While it was the Abbott Government that first put Australia's 26 per cent emissions reduction target on the table, it did so on the advice that we could achieve these reductions, without any policy change, and without any significant economic damage.It was also on the written understanding that the emissions reduction agreement would include all countries. Three years on, we now know that even existing emissions reductions policy is putting power prices through the roof, sending jobs offshore, and risking blackouts when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine.We now know, that the emissions commissars will soon turn their attention to culling our animal herds and putting a carbon tax on cars. What's more - and this should be the clincher - we now know, that three of the four biggest emitters will make no commitments whatsoever, to reducing their emissions, leaving Australia in an even worse position than before.Now, when circumstances change, smart people change their position. Tony Abbott has said that if we'd known then, what we know now, he'd never have agreed to a 26 per cent emissions reduction. Let's never forget that it was the Turnbull government who signed the Paris Agreement and then raced out and ratified it the day after Donald Trump was elected knowing the US were out.So far, and without much conviction, Prime Minister Morrison has said we're staying in - but that shouldn't mean that we hand over even more money to global green bureaucrats. To big note himself at the Paris conference, Mr Turnbull promised ""up to a billion dollars"" for this UN green climate fund that was supposed to total no less than one hundred billion dollars every year.Now, something called the World Resources Institute says this week that Australia should be the sixth biggest donor to this fund - behind America, Britain, Japan, Germany and Canada - because of our wealth, and because of our historical contribution to carbon dioxide emissions - and what was initially supposed to be a one-off contribution, of billions, could even be converted to an annual tax at the December meeting in Poland.I can appreciate that Prime Minister Morrison is reluctant to change an international commitment made by his predecessor. But that's a weak reason in my book. After all, just the other day Labor agreed to support the TPP trade deal as it stands now but have already said they'll change it if elected.So, if they can change international commitments made by another government, why can't Morrison move here and be his own man? It's one thing to stick with Paris, and on that I disagree with the PM, but it's another thing altogether to keep shovelling out good money after bad to a fund that we don't control.Mr Morrison should send a clear signal that he's in charge here, not the faceless global bureaucrats, by walking away from Turnbull's promise to put a billion dollars in the fund and declare from here on in, ""Australia comes first"".\l"

Further riots are planned, despite the government saying there would be a new measure to make the ""ecological transition"" more equitable.Already, most countries are falling well short of pledges made in Paris to cut emissions which are themselves well below what scientist-s have said is necessary to keep future temperature rises below even the less-ambitious -target of 2C.The pact on finance that binds the developed and developing world together in taking action under the Paris Agreement is strained.And old arguments about the different responsibilities of developed and developing nations have risen back to the surface and threaten to derail talks in Poland.Above all this, the Katowice gathering, which is due to start on Sunday, is billed as the most importa-nt Conference of the -Parties since Paris and the momen-t the Paris Agreement will be brought to life.To do so, world leaders must concur on the Paris Agreement rule book of how countries will set and measure their ambitions to cut greenhouse gas emissions across time.Success in Poland will kick off a series of rolling five-year reviews in which countries are supposed to progressively increase the actions they will take.The sticking points include how the rules will apply to everyone, whether developed or developing countries, and how vast sums of money will be transferred from developed to developing countries to assist the transition.""To adopt implementing guidel"

Days before the conference began, a cold snap plunged temperatures in Poland to well below freezing and outside the plastic marquee walls there are banks of diesel generators to blast hot air inside.The host city, Katowice, is fully booked to accommodate the tens of thousands of delegates to what has been billed as the most important climate conference since Paris in 2015. It is still possible to get a room at Bytom, about 20km away, where half the town works in the coalmining industry and the centuries-old buildings are cracking under the strain of earthquakes caused by extensive underground excavation.The air stings the eyes and there is an unmistakeable smell of burned coal in the air. But it is overcast and still. Throwing out a solar panel or wind turbine most probably would be in vain.As delegates at COP24 worry about the future of the world, the miners in Bytom worry about their jobs. The Polish trade union Solidarity has issued a joint statement with Chicago-based think tank the Heartland Institute rejecting the science of climate change, which the institute says is ""climate totalitarianism"" propaganda invented by ""the socialist internationalist green movement"".However, inside the conference there is a grinding sense of -inevitability.

This prompted many viewers of the program to call on RMIT ABC Fact Check to investigate Ms Vanstone's claim.The verdictMs Vanstone's claim is misleading.Latest federal government figures suggest that although greenhouse gas emissions have fallen over the past 10 years, emissions started trending upwards again about four years ago.The upturn, since 2014, has coincided with the Abbott government's removal of the carbon tax.Also, while emissions from electricity production have been falling, the decrease has been outweighed over the past four years by rising emissions in other sectors of the economy, such as transport, where emissions are associated with increased LNG production for export.Emissions can be measured in different ways: for example, as total emissions or emissions per capita or per GDP.In the past year, Australia's total emissions have been rising. But emissions per capita or per dollar of real GDP have been falling, mainly due to Australia's rapid population growth.However, it is worth noting that Australia's progress in cutting emissions under its international obligations (the Paris Agreement) is measured by changes in total emissions rather than by other measures.As one expert put it: ""The atmosphere doesn't care how many people are contributing to emissions; it's the total quantity of emissions that matters.""The contextMs Vanstone made her claim during a discussion on Q&A about a protest by Australian schoolchildren titled ' https://www.news.com.au/technology/environment/climate-change/students-expected-to-skip-school-to-attend-strike-for-climate-action/news-story/907d3d23594af8ecb3f88a95ad794747Strike 4 Climate ActionShe was speaking about the climate policies of Australia's two major political parties, and in the broader context of greenhouse gas emissions and their impact on the environment, as perceived by young people.Ms Vanstone did not specify which kind of emissions she was talking about.

She said she had not been expecting to talk about emissions: ""I can't tell you that I had a particular tight construct in my head at the time,"" she said.""I think I was just making a general remark about emissions generally over a long period of time.""Fact Check considers it reasonable to assume that her claim refers to Australia's total greenhouse gas emissions over the past 10 years - the length of time examined by the Government's most recent report on emissions.What others are sayingMs Vanstone is not alone in claiming emissions in Australia are decreasing, though other speakers have been more specific.Liberal senator Linda Reynolds, also on Q&A, said carbon emissions per capita and by GDP were at their lowest levels in 28 years.Federal Environment Minister Melissa Price also highlighted this low in HYPERLINK http://www.environment.gov.au/minister/price/media-releases/mr20181130a.htmla press release announcing the Government's latest quarterly emissions data.Nonetheless, she acknowledged that total emissions had risen over the year to June 2018.Others have also pointed to the rise in total emissions.Labor senator Lisa Singh, another of the recent Q&A panelists, argued that ""emissions have continued to go up since 2011"".And HYPERLINK https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/breakfast/australia-wont-commit-to-increasing-paris-target/10583482on ABC radio the same week, Richie Merzian, the climate and energy director for think tank the Australia Institute said: ""For the last four years, Australia's greenhouse gas emissions have been increasing.""Measuring emissions http://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/climate-science-data/greenhouse-gas-measurementNational Greenhouse AccountsThe accounts track greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 onwards, and fulfil Australia's international reporting obligations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and Kyoto Protocol.Quarterly reports, released as part of the accounts, track total emissions as well as emissions by sector, per capita and per GDP.The HYPERLINK http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/e2b0a880-74b9-436b-9ddd-941a74d81fad/files/nggi-quarterly-update-june-2018.pdflatest report, released three days before Ms Vanstone's Q&A appearance, provides estimates of Australia's national inventory of greenhouse gas emissions up to the June quarter of 2018.The report examines emissions produced by eight sectors: electricity, stationary energy, transport, fugitive emissions (for example, leakages), industrial processes and product use, agriculture, waste, and land use, land use change and forestry.Emissions from electricity production are fallingThe report shows emissions in the electricity sector have fallen by 3.6 per cent in the year to September 2018.This was driven by a 13 per cent reduction in brown coal supply and a corresponding 14 per cent increase in supply derived from renewable sources, it says.But emissions from other sectors, such as transport, have been rising. HYPERLINK http://energy.anu.edu.au/about-us/participants/hugh-saddlerHugh Saddler, an honorary associate professor at ANU's Crawford School of Public Policy, told Fact Check:""Significant increases in emissions from petroleum and diesel consumption in transport, and gas consumption associated with LNG, have outweighed the decrease in emissions from the electricity sector.""What's going on with total emissions?Over the year to June 2018, Australia's total greenhouse gas emissions rose in each quarter, according to the report.Specifically, seasonally adjusted total emissions rose 1.3 per cent in the June quarter and by 0.6 per cent in the year to June 2018.While emissions have fluctuated over the past four years, they have been trending upwards since late 2014, as the graph below shows. The data shows emissions have risen 5 per cent over this time.Emissions touched their lowest point in March 2013, but have since rebounded to 2011 levels.Under the HYPERLINK Paris Climate AgreementAccording to the national greenhouse audit, total emissions are down 11.7 per cent on 2005 (the Paris Agreement base year) and 7.5 per cent since 1990 (the base year for Kyoto Protocol calculations).Why are people saying emissions are falling?As shown above, total greenhouse emissions when measured quarterly over the past year, or by trend data over the past four years, have been rising.So, why are some people arguing that emissions are going down?Because, when emissions are measured per capita or per dollar of GDP, they are lower. This is because Australia is experiencing rapid population growth.The Department of the Environment and Energy highlights this fall in both the preface to its latest quarterly greenhouse report and on its HYPERLINK website.The report states that emissions per capita and the emissions intensity of the Australian economy were at their lowest levels in 28 years, falling 37 per cent and 60 per cent respectively since 1990.Are emissions per capita and per GDP useful measures?Put simply, no.Dr Saddler said focusing on emissions per capita was meaningless, since the measure used in international agreements was the more crucial total emissions.""The atmosphere doesn't care how many people are contributing to emissions; it's the total quantity of emissions that matters,"" he said. HYPERLINK https://www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person67077Professor David Karoly""The Australian per capita share at the moment is higher than any other developed country in the world - higher than the US. Yes, it's coming down, but it is still the highest.""Both Dr Saddler and Professor Karoly confirmed the fall in emissions per capita and GDP were due to rapid population growth in Australia.Experts assess the claimProfessor Karoly said if Amanda Vanstone's claim was made in reference to total Australian emissions, ""they are going up"".He noted that the start of the recent rebound in emissions from mid-2014 coincided with the HYPERLINK http://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/government/repealing-carbon-taxdumping of the carbon tax HYPERLINK http://climate.anu.edu.au/about-us/people/mark-howdenProfessor Mark HowdenHe said an argument could be made that emissions have come down, given they are lower now than at their peak between 2005 and 2008.""However, this is a problematic argument,"" he said.""Under the current mix of policies and economic activities, emissions are clearly not coming down but instead are rising steadily."" HYPERLINK https://people.csiro.au/C/P/Pep-CanadellPep Canadell, a senior principal research scientist in the CSIRO Climate Science Centre, and the executive director of the Global Carbon Project, suggested that 1990 was a good reference year for gleaning a long-term view of changes to emissions.""Good annual data only starts from 1990, which is the reference year of the Kyoto Protocol and why the Government started the good quality data then,"" Dr Canadell said.{\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\parEmissions per capita have fallen 37 per cent since 1990.However, Dr Canadell added:""Given Ms Vanstone's statement is present tense, I disagree [that emissions are falling].

"COP24","Australia","COP24_Australia78","MORE CRACKS IN PARIS PACT","September 17, 2018 Monday","The Australian","Money, power and trust are central to the divide on climateWinter is coming to Poland, where temperatures dip below zero, but the coal-hungry Euro-pean centre has become the last hope to pull progress on the Paris Agreement from the deep freeze.It's not just in Australia that tempers have been flaring over the future of the Paris Agreement to tackle climate change.An emergency meeting in Bangkok ended on September 9 in stalemate as longstanding divisions blocked progress on developing a rule book for how the Paris Agreement will operate.Money, power and trust sit at the heart of the dispute, which will only intensify as governments prepare for the December 3 Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in Katowice, Poland.Behind the scenes, a group of countries led by China has been working to widen the gap on how rules should apply differently to the developed and developing world.This is familiar territory for anyone who has watched the two decades of UN climate change -diplomacy.Developing nations blame the developed world for causing the problem of climate change and -insist on protecting their right to develop.Simple mathematics shows -developed nations cannot solve the problem alone. The $US100bn fund has been the glue that brought developed and developing nations into a single compact. But the devil, as -always, is in the detail.It is usual in global climate change negotiations for talks to go down to the wire.But the 2009 meeting in -Copenhagen has shown that success cannot always be guaranteed. A new level of uncertainty has been added to negotiations by US President Donald Trump's decision to signal his withdrawal from the Paris Agreement.A formal departure cannot be announced until November next year and would not take effect until November 2020. In the meantime, the US -remains active in negotiations.Without the US, ambitions to raise $US100bn a year from 2020 will be exponentially more difficult.Uncertainty has allowed the pathway for the Paris Agreement to begin to unravel on several fronts.The Paris Agreement entered into force on November 4, 2016, after it was adopted to a fanfare of consensus on December 12, 2015.The deal is yet to be operational because agreement must still be reached on the rule book on how it will operate. In its present form, despite all the emotion vested in it, the Paris deal is merely an agreement of -intent.Even if it becomes operational, it will be largely voluntary, relying on international peer pressure to keep participants in check. Countries will be obliged to -report ambitions to keep future global tem-p-erature rises below 2C -but there is no legal mechanism to -enforce their actions.Final details are supposed to be agreed by the end of this year. But after Bangkok, despite some encouraging official pronouncements, that agreement seems as far away as ever.Observers have said publicly that the Paris deal is on the brink of collapse. India's Economic Times laments ""the world is now setting the new norms of not keeping the promises made on global -co-operation"".These developments provide context to debate about the future of the Paris Agreement in Australia, where the focus has been on what level targets should be set to cut future carbon dioxide emissions.Internationally, despite its relatively small contribution to global carbon dioxide emissions, Australia is still playing a very active role in negotiations.In resisting calls from within his party to abandon the Paris deal -because of the cost to electricity prices of a renewable energy transition, Scott Morrison has remained fixed on diplomacy.""I have to consider not just the issue here,"" the new Prime Minister told Sydney 2GB radio host Alan Jones.""In the Pacific, this is an issue which is incredibly important. This issue dominates their thinking and agenda. Now the Pacific is one of the most strategic areas of influence in our world today."" In short, backsliding on the Paris Agreement could have big -regional consequences and frustrate negotiations for free trade with the EU.Despite the criticism levelled at Australia during the Bangkok talks, a spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade says we are committed to the Paris Agreement process.""Australia wants to secure comprehensive and effective -implementing guidance for the Paris Agreement, including robust emissions accounting and transparency rules,"" the DFAT spokesman says.""Australia is aiming for the Paris Agreement implementation guidance to be finalised at COP24 in December (Poland) this year and supports effective assistance, including financial assistance to be provided to developing countries."" Australia has invested more than half of a commitment made in 2015 to spend $1bn across five years (2015-16 to 2019-20) to support developing countries to build climate resilience and reduce emissions.This includes $300 million across four years for climate action in the Pacific. Australia's assistance is grant-based, based on partner country requests, balanced across mitigation and adaptation, and -focused on small island developing states and less developed countries in the Indo-Pacific region.The money is dispersed through multilateral, global, -regional and country-level mechanisms through the Australian aid program managed by DFAT.The truth, however, is that global talks on finance have stalled over whether loans and existing foreign aid should be counted as part of the proposed $US100bn a year fund from 2020.In addition, delivery of funding through the interim Global Climate Fund has been shambolic.Pledges to the GCF have totalled $US10.4bn but only $US3.5bn has been committed. The US withdrew $US2bn promised to the fund when Trump announced his intention to pull out of the Paris Agreement.GCF administrators cannot agree how the fund money should be spent, with the Australian chairman resigning abruptly in July for ""personal reasons"" after an acrimonious meeting.A delegate at the Bangkok meeting was quoted as saying ""GCF is melting down faster than Antarctica"".No one is disputing there is much work still to be done.""Frankly, we are not ready,"" -last year's climate conference president and Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainima-rama declared on the opening day of the Bangkok summit.After the talks the official view was that progress had been -""uneven"", a description that is loaded with peril in the language of these talks.Climate Victoria climate and energy adviser Erwin Jackson says the compilation text that emerged from Bangkok lacks the streaml"

Please include your home address and telephone number. Ross Gittins (Comment, 12/12) is right with his criticisms of the privatisation of government-owned enterprises including electricity. He could have added public transport in Victoria along with a range of in-house government services. Privatisation is promoted by economists and the corporate sector without taking into account a range of issues other than profits for shareholders and excessive pay for executives. It has been shown not to be more efficient and certainly has ignored the environmental impacts of its actions. Surely it is time for politicians and other corporate leaders who base decisions on ideology and not the needs of the community to be held accountable not only at the ballot box but through our legal system. A return to a mixed economy is well overdue and tighter price control and regulation a must.Ray Cleary, Camberwell Some institutions should not have been touchedWith regard to Ross Gittins' article, no doubt Michael Hassett (Letters, 13/12) is correct about Telstra and the downside of its privatisation.But what about the CBA? What were we thinking when we privatised it? It's worth recalling the reasons, against the background of the current banking and financial services royal commission. All Australians had a share in the old CBA until someone decided it was a good idea to parcel up everybody's shares into a number of discrete private shares and sell them off to the rich; one of whom was me. And look where we've ended up.Instead of having a low, or no-profit bank, providing affordable services to all Australians, we have a discrete number of private shareholders divvying up billions of dollars of profit each year, and ripping off large numbers of Australians along the way.Tony Adami, Caulfield SouthGreed should have no part in itI am in full agreement with Ross Gittins that both the Australian and state governments made a massive error in guiding our public-run state institutions down the slippery path of privatisation.

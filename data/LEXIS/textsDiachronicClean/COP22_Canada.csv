Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and many other heads of government were present last year in Paris to sign what has been dubbed the Paris Agreement. It was a big deal.In fact, it was such a big deal that the newly minted Trudeau government spent just under $1 million on Canada's delegation including $130,000 on meals and about $350,000 on hotels.The size of the Paris delegation was around 335 people versus the 225 listed as Canadian participants for Marrakech. (The conference has been under way for a week now but really kicks into gear Tuesday with what are called ""high-level"" events, i.e. events where you can expect the participation of ministers,( HYPERLINK http://cop22.ma/en#programmes/category/undefinedhttp:// cop22 .ma/en#programmes/category/undefinedTrudeau will not be there this year - his presence would have accounted for a big chunk of the Paris Government of Canada delegation - but some opposition MPs will (just as they were last year) including Conservative Ed Fast. There had been some earlier sniping between Fast's office and McKenna's office over the conditions of his participation( HYPERLINK http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/mckenna-unmuzzles-opposition-critic-for-cop22-but-fast-still-isnt-going-to-climate-change-confab-in-marrakechhttp://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/mckenna-unmuzzles-opposition-critic-for- http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/mckenna-unmuzzles-opposition-critic-for-cop22-but-fast-still-isnt-going-to-climate-change-confab-in-marrakechcop22 -but-fast-still-isnt-going-to-climate-change-confab-in-marrakech ) but that has appeared to have been sorted out. In addition to Fast, NDP Linda Duncan and BQ MP Monique Pauz\'e9 are on the official delegation list. Green Party leader Elizabeth May has said earlier she'll have to miss this COP( \~ HYPERLINK http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/mckenna-and-her-critics-now-haggling-over-the-bill-to-attend-marrakech-climate-conferencehttp://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/mckenna-and-her-critics-now-haggling-over-the-bill-to-attend-marrakech-climate-conference ) - she's been to almost all the others - as a result of some demanding travel she's already done this fall with the House of Commons special committee on electoral reform.Now, not all of those who are are on this list of Canadian participants( HYPERLINK http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2016/cop22/eng/misc02p01.pdfhttp://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2016/ HYPERLINK cop22 /eng/misc02p01.pdf ) were able to attend. David McLaughlin, an advisor to Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister, for example, stayed home to finish up work on that province climate change policy ahead of this fall's First Ministers' Meeting on the issue.

The representatives of the Assembly of First Nations, for example, are there independent of official Government of Canada delegation. One would assume the large number of Quebec government politicians and Quebec government bureaucrats are also independent of the official Canadian delegation.That said, the largest group of participants are federal and provincial government employees, deputy ministers, scientists and other bureaucrats who work on environmental issues. Some are over in Marrakech on the federal government's dime; many others paid their own way. Here are some notes on participants:Environment Ministers Shannon Phillips (Alberta), Scott Moe (Saskatchewan), Cathy Cox (Manitoba), Glen Murray (Ontario), David Heurtel (Quebec), Perry Trimper (Newfoundland and Labrador)About 17 representatives of indigenous groups including from the Assembly of First Nations, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the Manitoba Metis Federation, the Metis National Council, the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples, and the Native Women's Association.A youth delegation of five people.Environmental advocates from Climate Action Network Canada, Pembina Institute, Ecojustice Canada, Equiterre, and Environmental Defence.Two mayors: Edmonton's Don Iveson and Montreal borough mayor Real Menard.

"COP22","Canada","COP22_Canada2","Minister of Environment to Attend United Nations Climate Change Conference","November 14, 2016 Monday","Canadian Government News","Regina: The Government of Saskatchewan has issued the following news release: Environment Minister Scott Moe will represent the Government of Saskatchewan at the 22nd session of the Conference of Parties on Climate Change (COP22) in Marrakesh, Morocco. Moe will attend from November 14-18 and take part in sessions on agriculture carbon offsets and carbon capture and storage, advancing the themes of climate mitigation, adaptation and technology.  The conference will allow us to promote how Saskatchewan\' s approach can deliver real global results in addressing climate change, Moe said.  We will share success stories showing how environmental stewardship can be achieved while protecting economic prosperity, such as our commitment to zero tillage, which has transformed our agricultural lands into tremendous soil sinks, absorbing millions of tonnes of carbon every year. Our commitment to carbon capture and storage technology and our aggressive move toward renewable electrical generation technologies are two other key planks in our strategy. With an estimated 2,400 coal plants in development around the world, Saskatchewan maintains that carbon capture and storage technology has the potential to be a global climate change solution. As well, Saskatchewan continues to move toward 50 per cent renewable capacity in its electricity generation mix by 2030, through the addition of wind and solar power, amongst other sources. Moe will also be meeting with Moroccan pulse importers and a durum wheat processor. Morocco is a key market for these Saskatchewan crops, with more than $190 million worth of durum and $5 million worth of lentils exported in 2015. Saskatchewan accounted for 66 per cent of Canada\' s total exports to Morocco in 2015.

You can read it below but in it, McKenna notes that there was never any intention to prevent Fast or other delegates from speaking to the media. ""I understand that the media plays an important role in communicating to Canadians on such important issues as climate change,"" McKenna writes.Nonetheless, she tells Fast that he will be receiving an amended version of a ""Canadian Delegation Agreement"" - a new set of terms he will have to agree to if he chooses to accept the invitation to join McKenna's delegation. (The government will cover up to $4,500 in travel and accommodation costs for those in the official delegation)Fast, in an e-mailed response sent to McKenna's office late Friday afternoon, notes that he did not sign any such agreement as a condition of his being part of the delegation to last year's COP21 conference and ""I have absolutely no intention of signing any document that governs my participation at COP22.""You can read the exchange for yourself.

Catherine McKenna, P.C., M.P.Minister of Environment and Climate ChangeDear Minister,Thank you for your letter of response dated Oct. 28. Unfortunately, you have misunderstood my letter of Oct. 27. I have absolutely no intention of signing any document that governs my participation at COP22.You may recall that last year you also invited me to COP21, for which I was grateful. I don't believe anything in my behaviour or that of other Canadian delegates at that event would have led anyone to believe that we weren't conducting ourselves in a manner that reflected well upon our country. Indeed, my interactions with the media highlighted our Conservative Party's support of your government concluding the Paris Agreement.That is why I find it puzzling that you are still requiring delegates to sign a Canadian Delegation Participant Agreement, albeit revised. Certainly no MP should be required to submit to the authority of the Head of Delegation or have their discretion fettered, especially since you have confirmed that our engagement will be limited to general (public) events hosted by the COP22 organizers.May I respectfully make a suggestion? Drop it. A Participant Agreement is unnecessary.Sincerely yours,The Hon. Ed Fast, P.C., Q.C.Member of Parliament (Abbotsford)Official Opposition Critic for the Environment and Climate Change.

(May, Fast and Thomas Mulcair were among the MPs that joined the Canadian delegation at that summit)Despite those expense caps for MPs, it cost the federal treasury more than $1 million for the travel, hotel and food bill for the 155-member Canadian delegation at COP21 last year.

"COP22","Canada","COP22_Canada15","Opinion: An inclusive approach to Canada's climate change challenges","November 24, 2016 Thursday","Postmedia Breaking News","Earlier this month, leaders from around the world gathered in Marrakech, Morocco at the 22nd annual United Nations of the Parties (COP22), a followup to last year's meeting in Paris. The conference focused on how to achieve continued reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and how to solidify structures to fund adaptation. Yet, given the U.S. election outcome, there was also much informal discussion about how goals could be achieved with less U.S. participation.In this period of uncertainty, it would be easy to lose sight of what climate change means to communities in Canada.This country has experienced some of the most dramatic environmental shifts from climate change globally, particularly in Arctic regions where temperatures are warming more than twice the global average and there are unprecedented rates of summer sea ice loss.It is essential that we take stock of our knowledge, experience and values, and advance with a common vision. Consideration should especially be given to how to ensure that voices of historically underrepresented communities continue to be heard within Canada and beyond.Indigenous organizations, communities and scientists have widely concluded that environmental changes are increasingly affecting health of northern communities, including impacts to food security, mental health, housing and cultural activities. Specifically, travel has become more dangerous with greater unpredictability of hazards, housing overcrowding is being exacerbated by permafrost change and there is mounting pressure on ecological systems and traditional food sources.Environmental changes, however, have been met by initiatives intended to reduce vulnerabilities and build on community strengths. Communities are adapting to environmental shifts aided in part by increasing cooperation and funding from government bodies. Examples of adaptation include community initiatives to monitor for diseases like gastrointestinal illness and policies to fund housing resilient to permafrost changes.Knowledge gained from work in the rapidly changing Arctic has also helped define how climate change is likely to affect communities elsewhere in Canada and around the world. It is expected that, as in the North, climate change will hit marginalized communities hardest. With fewer resources to adapt to environmental changes, health and economic disparities may be exacerbated.Even under hopeful climate scenarios where warming is limited to 1.5 degrees C, it is estimated that temperatures over the Arctic will rise by two to three times the rate of southern Canada. Over the coming century, Canada will increasingly observe impacts of climate change from north to south. Much consideration is already being given to how climate change exacerbates or changes risks of disasters, includingat the annual symposium of the Canadian Risks and Hazards Network( HYPERLINK http://www.crhnet.ca/symposiumhttp://www.crhnet.ca/symposiumIt is crucial that the international community continues working toward goals of limiting average global temperature rise to well below 2.0 degrees C and building adaptive capacities to climate change. Within Canada, we must continue to listen to indigenous communities, minority groups and marginalized populations, ensuring that mitigation policies do not restrict but empower, and that policies enhance community resiliency to future changes.Few countries have experienced the magnitude of environmental changes that Canada has to date. Knowledge developed from successful adaptation programs, Indigenous knowledge and scientific experience researching vulnerability and resilience should be shared. Further, as highlighted in the Truth and Reconciliation report, it is important that we continue to remember and remind others of past failures.We have a shared responsibility to continue to address climate change impacts within and outside our borders, advocating for the underrepresented voices within our country and around the world. Canada is defined not be its neighbours, but by the voices and policies that come from within.James D. Ford is a Canadian Institutes for Health Research Applied Public Health Chair, editor-in-chief of Regional Environmental Change and associate professor at McGill University.

The Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Catherine McKenna, co-chaired the Climate and Clean Air Coalition's (CCAC's) High-Level Assembly and issued the following quotes and photo at the event: Quotes ""We have seen great things happen this year in the effort to reduce short-lived climate pollutants. Canada and its North American partners agreed to drive down black carbon or soot emissions that come from burning fossil fuels and to reduce potent methane emissions from the oil and gas sector, by up to 45 percent by 2025 a reduction equivalent to 3.8- to 4.2-million passenger vehicles not being driven in a given year. More recently, we joined the world in agreeing to phase down climate-warming hydrofluorocarbons, such as those used as refrigerants. Today, we took another important step in reducing methane emissions from oil and gas operations and promoting cleaner fuels and vehicles internationally. ""Taking action on these harmful pollutants will benefit Canadians and communities. Finding solutions to reduce short-lived climate pollutants will also foster innovation and create good jobs in a modern, clean, global economy."" \- Catherine McKenna, Minister of Environment and Climate Change ""I am proud to announce investments with Chile and Mexico to help reduce short-lived climate pollutants. In Canada and around the world, we are adding up wins for the climate and cleaner air."" \- Catherine McKenna, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Quick facts Scientists agree that short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) such as black carbon, methane, ozone, and some hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are responsible for an important portion of the current rate of global warming. Sustained reductions of SLCPs are critical to meeting the Paris Agreement goal of holding global temperature increase to well below 2 \'b0C and of pursuing efforts towards 1.5 \'b0C.

Australia's delegation can fit on two pages, as can China's, which has 38 times Canada's population and immensely greater emissions issues to deal with. France, which hosted last year's conference, has five pages of names. While some Canadian delegates are footing their own bills, federal, provincial and municipal governments will pay the lion's share of costs.The bloated size of the crowd extends a tradition started last year, when 335 Canadians attended the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who is not attending the follow-up event in Marrakech. It may be that that gathering was worth attending, as it supposedly set out a bold new direction for combating man-made climate change and signalled a global commitment to take decisive action. Optics aside, they weren't there to do serious work.The details of a major international agreement, on climate change or anything else, are too complex to be solved in 10 days. The hard work is done well ahead of time, to avoid embarrassing national leaders in front of the cameras, either by problems that have not been resolved or because in the warm glow of the moment they make promises that contradict official policy or ignore the limits of the politically or physically possible.The real issues are best solved by small gatherings of major players and senior aides. In the globalized era of the Internet, expertise can quickly be obtained by phone, email or live chat, a consideration that should have been front and centre given delegates' professed concern about mankind's ""carbon footprint"".The Marrakech summit is intended as a follow-up to last year's meeting, to begin to ""operationalize"" the Paris accord. Does that really require the presence of a small army of bureaucrats, activists, provincial and municipal representatives and security personnel, not to mention labour bosses from Unifor, the Canadian Labour Congress, the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers and the Canadian Union of Postal Workers?If these people are seized by the crucial matter of climate change, why are they not doing the hard unglamorous work of implementation, drinking bad coffee under depressing fluorescent lights in offices back in Canada?To be sure, the $1 million Canada's government spent on Paris, including $130,000 for meals and $350,000 for hotels, is a drop in the $300 billion bucket of federal spending, even if it's a worrying reminder of the disconnect between the public and private sectors, and the gap separating the privileged class from the rest of us, who lack the opportunity to blow thousands of dollars of someone else's cash on a jaunt to Morocco. But the hypocrisy cuts deeper here.Nobody, except, oddly, the participants, could overlook the damage to the planet caused by hordes of hangers-on jetting across oceans and continents to preach restraint. It is just too easy for critics to jeer at this hypocrisy as proof that the alarmists don't really take global warming seriously. Why would any working Canadian leave their car at home and crowd onto a bus for the bleak commute through a wintery morning, knowing environmental evangelists think it's fine to fly 255 Canadians to Morocco for a week in the sun?Donald Trump was elected president because of disgust at displays like this.

In addition, it has taken concrete steps to ensure that 52% of the national energy supply comes from clean sources by the year 2030. By the same token, we have proposed a set of initiatives as part of implementing the Paris Agreement, especially with respect to adaptation and financing. These include the initiative for the Adaptation of African Agriculture.""""Holding this conference in Africa,"" he said, ""is an incentive for us to give priority to tackling the adverse repercussions of climate change, which are growing worse and worse in the countries of the South and in insular states whose very existence is in jeopardy."" ""The environmental issue is a critical problem which must be tackled in the most serious and responsible way,"" he told the assembled world leaders. He continued, ""What is at stake is the very existence of man. It is therefore our joint duty to work hand in hand to protect him. Accordingly, countries must not be pressed from the start into accepting decisions they will be unable to comply with. This is not to say that they reject them. It only means that they do not have the necessary means to implement them.""The King urged ""all parties to work on translating our commitment to the values of justice and solidarity into actions, by:""The time has come to redress the situation,"" the King concluded. ""We have no alternative but to work to make up for lost time, through continued, comprehensive mobilization and positive harmonization, so that the coming generations may lead an enjoyable and dignified life together.""At a press conference earlier this week, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon expressed his gratitude to King Mohammed VI for convening the Marrakesh conference -- and for Morocco's ongoing leadership.

This year, the American delegates are essentially a lame duck offering, as Trump has said he would consider withdrawing U.S. support of the deal Obama signed off on last fall.And that has changed the tone and tenor emanating from COP 22, which began on Nov. 7 and runs until Nov. 18.It has been really a topic of almost every meeting and discussion since the results of the election came out. Yesterday morning was the first session after the results were known and there was a meeting put on by one group that had three panelists talking about the affect of the change of government in the U.S. on climate policy and on COP 22, McMillan said during a phone interview this morning.There were a lot of unknowns but everybody acknowledged that [Trumps presidency] was going to be very important. The U.S., under the Obama administration, had played a crucial role in having the Paris agreement come together. They had taken a leadership role and really rallied other countries, he added.With the new administration, would that change? No one knows for sure, but its something people are talking about at almost every meeting.Although hes not in Marrakech, Peter Tertzakian, managing director of ARC Financial Corp., wishes he were, especially given the Trump factor thats now in play on the global climate change policy stage.Id love to be there to listen to what people have to say because Trump has plainly come out and said hes going to tear up that [Paris] agreement, Tertzakian said.So the Morocco meeting is supposed to start talking about how to cut cheques from wealthy countries for other countries to lower the globes carbon footprint. I dont know what the American representatives at the conference are saying, but they have no mandate to do anything now. So I dont think its going to be a very effective meeting, all of a sudden.The uncertainty that Trumps win has placed on the proceeding at COP 22 are indicative of why Tertzakian says Canada needs to have increased sovereignty and influence over its own energy supply and supply routes.Thats because we dont want to be held hostage by the U.S. policy.

""The business case is very much there,"" she said.""Despite some speed bumps, I think that's what's going to carry a commitment to climate action through - it does have practical benefits, it does put people to work, it does allow for growth in a carbon-constrained world.""In Alberta, the Wildrose Party has renewed calls to fire the province's Oil Sands Advisory Group co-chairTzeporah Berman and fellow group member Karen Mahon, national director of STAND, formerly known as ForestEthics Advocacy, after what it calls active campaigning against Alberta's energy sector.

She said the deal got stronger and better each day and as a result, world leaders are legally bound to work to curb emissions in a meaningful way.And she delivered a four-point plan for our country to meet its targets that includes working outside of the political box, putting a price on carbon, transitioning to a fossil fuel-free energy grid by 2025 and getting information about climate change and environmental policies in front of Canadians.The charismatic leader advocated for peer pressure, global shaming and telling stories of environmental successes.Countries, including our own, will meet their targets only if their feet are held to the fire by a public that cares.And Muskoka has deeply passionate environmentalists who are willing to make some noise.May suggested the media is in a large part to blame for misinformation about the environment and she urged folks to write letters to the editor whenever they read something that is inaccurate or misleading about climate change.Of course, that's always our best advice.

But more than a decade of emissions trading in Europe paints a complex, problem-ridden picture of politics and market failure.The European Union's 11-year-old emissions trading system (ETS), the world's first and largest international cap-and-trade scheme, has served as an exemplary tale of both successes and failures for all new systems, including the one in China set to launch in early 2017.""The EU and China have been working together and sharing experience on market measures for the past five years,"" says Anna-Kaisa Itkonen, a spokeswoman for the European Commission. ""China is keen \'e2\€ \£6 to learn from what the EU has got right and wrong.""Learning from EuropeCap and trade, also known as emissions trading, incentivizes reductions by making businesses pay for their emissions \'e2\€  the more they emit, the more they pay. The ""cap,"" lowered periodically, places a maximum limit on all emissions, and pollution allowances that allow businesses to emit various amounts are then ""traded"" on the carbon market.Experts say the EU's ETS suffers from unambitious reduction targets, an over-allocation of pollution allowances, low carbon prices and a lack of political will to substantially amend the system despite ongoing revisions following COP 21.The power and industry sectors are supposed to decarbonize by 2040 to keep the global temperature rise below 1.5 C, or by 2050 to keep it below 2 C, but at the current rate that won't happen until 2058, according to Femke de Jong, of Brussels-based Carbon Market Watch.""That's too late,"" says de Jong. ""These are symptoms of the failings of the ETS. The revisions aren't enough. It's a very clear sign that the way emissions trading is working now, it's not bringing emissions reductions.""Carbon prices, currently between four to five euros per ton, are supposed to be around 30-40 euros per ton to really incentivize a low-carbon transition, according to de Jong and University College London professor Michael Grubb.""The caps we set were a hell of a lot easier to meet than we thought,"" says Grubb, who teaches international energy and climate change policy. ""As a result, it cost very little to meet them, so those who'd been hoping this carbon price would be a significant driver of change and a good guide to low-carbon investment \'e2\€  it didn't work.""Last year, the EU met its 2020 emissions targets, but many experts including Grubb and de Jong say other policies have likely helped cut emissions, meaning the ETS has not been the ""cornerstone"" of European climate policy, as termed by the Commission \'e2\€  but could still be.""It's been a steep learning curve, and Europe has been making huge strides,"" says Misato Sato, assistant professorial research fellow at the London School of Economics. ""In terms of capping emissions, it's been a success, and the EU's 'learning by doing' approach means it's a work-in-progress that has allowed other countries to improve their own systems.""As a market-based approach, cap and trade is seen as easier and cheaper to implement than carbon tax \'e2\€  imposed on the carbon content of fuels such as coal, petroleum and natural gas \'e2\€  which has been politically controversial in the EU as well as in Canada.Meanwhile command-and-control, which typically makes emitters take specific actions or install specific technologies to reduce emissions, has been seen as too rigid.Jeff Swartz, director at the International Emissions Trading Association, says more than 38 million tons of greenhouse gases are permanently removed annually thanks to the EU's ETS, and that politics is to blame for failures rather than the cap-and-trade approach to climate policy.""Emissions trading is not a bad concept, it's not flawed, it's just a reflection of how much political ambition our leaders are putting on the table,"" says Swartz. ""The more they put on, the stronger the policy will be. The system has the real potential to be the future driver of emissions reductions, not just in Europe but internationally.'Emissions trading internationallyCOP 21 saw emissions trading put back on the global agenda after being discredited due to the ETS's failures and the collapse of COP 15 negotiations in Copenhagen, according to Grubb.The Paris climate change conference emphasized market-based approaches to emissions reductions, which includes cap and trade, says the European Policy Centre's senior policy analyst Annika Hedberg. ""Article 6 in the agreement gave more of a push and bigger momentum for market-based mechanisms,"" Hedberg says. ""It was a step forward in co-ordinating emissions-trading systems worldwide, and this is a good time to look into and try to further develop these systems.""The world's largest polluter, China, which ratified the Paris climate accord alongside the United States last month, is expected to launch its national cap-and-trade system in early 2017 with a three-year first phase.The Chinese ETS is expected to cover about 70 per cent of emissions, compared to the EU's 45 per cent, but will include similar businesses to those covered in Europe, such as electricity generation and heavy industry. Future of cap and tradeOntario's cap-and-trade scheme came into effect on July 1, 2016, with the first compliance period beginning on January 1, 2017.The province plans to link with Quebec and California in 2018.Gary Wheeler, a spokesman for the Ontario's Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change, says the province studied the European carbon market closely before finalizing its ETS rules.""We learned from the EU and incorporated additional measures to address price volatility, including the establishment of a minimum price for allowances sold at auction and the establishment of an allowance reserve to provide additional allowances to capped emitters if needed during periods of high demand for allowances.""Turkey, Ukraine and Washington state are also currently designing cap-and-trade schemes, among many other regions and cities around the world.

"COP22","Canada","COP22_Canada38","Tory MP says costs for food, drink on PM's plane is 'outrageous'","September 29, 2016 Thursday","Chatham Daily News","Passengers who accompanied Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on his first two international trips were apparently well fed.The government has revealed, in response to a written question by the Conservatives, that the cost of food and beverages supplied aboard a government Airbus used for the trips amounted to just over $1,300 per person.Conservative MP Blaine Calkins calls the price tag ""outrageous.""But a spokesman for National Defence, which is responsible for the government's fleet of air craft, says the total includes the actual cost of catering and delivering multiple meals on each round trip, as well as related costs such as disposable cutlery, napkins, dish washing, airport administrative fees and security charges and local taxes.Daniel Lebouthillier said the defence department ""tries to keep costs to a minimum"" when choosing items from a catering company's menu. But the department's options are ""sometimes quite limited"" when dealing with caterers at overseas airports.The total also includes the cost of feeding and watering journalists who covered the trip, which would have been wholly or partially recovered since media outlets pay hefty fees for a seat on the prime minister's plane.Calkins was not mollified by the explanation. More than $1,000 for food and beverages per passenger per trip ""is more than the average Canadian earns in two weeks,"" he said.""Again, I'm just not sure anybody's minding the store when it comes to remembering that it's taxpayers who are on the hook for all these things.""Calkins said the meal tab is part of a ""pattern"" of excessive spending by the Trudeau government, which has been plagued for weeks by the disclosure of generous expenses claimed by political staffers, including the prime minister's top two aides, for relocating to Ottawa and by ministers for limousine and photographers' services. The latest disclosure shows that $72,040 was spent on food and beverages for 55 passengers aboard the prime ministerial plane during a trip to Turkey and the Philippines last November for a G20 summit and an APEC leaders' summit.Another $81,383 was spent on food and drink for 62 passengers - including more than a dozen journalists -aboard the prime minister's plane for a trip later the same month to London, where Trudeau met the Queen, Malta, where he attended a Commonwealth summit, and Paris, where he participated in a United Nations climate change conference\l"
"COP22","Canada","COP22_Canada39","One-on-One with Elizabeth May","November 10, 2016 Thursday","CTV NEWS CHANNEL Television, Inc. POWER PLAY WITH DON MARTIN 17:00:00 ET","DON MARTIN: Well, we're on the eve of the annual United Nations , this one in Marrakesh, but many climate change activists are far more worried about what's happening in Washington as their advocate for environmentalism prepares to leave the White House. Well to put both developments in perspective, Green Party leader Elizabeth May joins us from Victoria. Elizabeth May, there's the promise to cancel the Paris climate change agreement has vanished from Donald Trump's website. Is that an encouraging sign for you?ELIZABETH MAY (Green Party Leader): It may indicate that someone has advised him that he doesn't have the power to do that. So the good news is for people who are concerned about the Paris agreement, there is an exit provision that's legally is binding on the United States, and that will stop Donald Trump from getting the US out of the Paris agreement for a minimum of four years from now. And perhaps some of the people who are advising him are telling him that the US should stay in and play a constructive role, but the good news is even if he wanted to leave, the US, thanks to Barack Obama's quick action in legally acceding to the Paris agreement, the US can't get out, nor can any other country for a minimum of four years from now.MARTIN: All right. Well let's preview the next four years. What do you believe Donald Trump's election has, the impact it has on America's climate change fight?MAY: Well, you know, it's, the realist in me would say he's going to cancel everything that Barack Obama put forward, which was by executive order. People who follow US politics on climate closely will know that the US congress, the house, and senate were not cooperative with President Obama, and so in order to do things to reduce pollution from fossil fuels, he used executive orders that he could do through the US Environmental Protection Agency. That issue actually ended up in the Supreme Court. Judge Scalia was the vote that broke the tie against the EPA, so it's very relevant to climate action that president-elect Trump will get to appoint the next person on the Supreme Court. Not likely to be a vote that would differ from where Judge Scalia had been against climate action, so we've got the Supreme Court to look to, we've got the question of executive orders for things like air quality. But it's not, again, being a realist, it's not game over for US action on climate because so much was being done at the state level by various governors, a lot was being done at municipal levels, and of course there's still the possibility that once briefed on climate science by people who are knowledgeable, a President Trump will realize that he doesn't want to be the only leader of any country on earth that doesn't understand the importance of the issue.MARTIN: Right. But he does seem to be, I don't know if it's campaign rhetoric or not, he says this climate change is a hoax, and he's talking about getting coal mines reopened and fired up again as power a source. Is he one of the horsemen of the apocalypse, in your view?MAY: I'm hoping not. This issue is too important to assume that. I mean I do remember when President Ronald Reagan used to say that acid rain was caused by ducks, and other congressmen and senators from the Ohio valley thought that acid rain was a plot invented by Canadians so we could sell hydro power into the US, that's all true, and yet former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney somehow convinced Ronald Reagan to take real action on acid rain. So we mustn't assume that the Canadian-US relationship on issues doesn't make a difference if Prime Minister Trudeau is able to create a good working relationship with a future President Trump. I know it's hard to get those words out without cringing, but it could happen, and we could play a positive role in making sure he understands the issue. Otherwise, we do know that he'll reopen pressure for the Keystone pipel"

S. secretary of energy, Ernest Moniz, spoke, and he said there is $23 trillion in private investment potential for energy efficiency in the developing world alone.""So many of these things are moving forward in terms of the business consensus ,"" said Phillips.""What that means for us in Alberta, is that we have an enormous amount of opportunity, as soon as we price carbon we open up investment opportunities that were not there previously.""Phillips has spent her time during the international climate change meetings engaging with the World Bank and other investors aboard.""We've really focused on using this time to meet with investors (and) folks from international financial institutions to lay that groundwork for the tremendous amount of investment that we know will flow into Alberta ,"" she said.According to Philips, even subnational governments in the U.

As the roar cycles back and intensifies, it sounds as if the Earth is shuddering to its core. It's a sound that transcends Foon's artistic life.A mainstay of the communal avant-garde scene aligned with Montreal's Constellation Records, Foon has brought majestic melancholy and hope to groups including elegant chamber collective Esmerine and social-justice firebrands Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra.She has also brought her passion for environmental activism to initiatives such as Pathway to Paris, a collective fighting for solutions to climate change, which she cofounded with Jesse Paris Smith (Patti's daughter).Saltland's exploratory 2013 debut, I Thought it Was Us But it Was All of Us, had an open heart and a green mind, with a village of guests nourishing gentle compositions inspired by climate change and urban environmentalism.The tone and discourse are more urgent on A Common Truth, whose complex darkness is almost entirely derived from Foon's cello.""On the first Saltland record, the themes were similar, but the energy was lighter,"" Foon said recently. ""I'm in a different space on this record. Now when I think about climate change, I think: Are we facing the end of the world? Are we facing extinction? We can change the course, but we are in the time right now to change the course.""It's a bit more black and white for me, where we're at now. I definitely feel the state of emergency we're in, and wanted to express that.""The alarm bells sounded on A Common Truth are intensified at a time when progress on environmental issues is under threat by the new White House administration, but the gravitas owes as much to Foon's growing confidence as it does to current affairs.""I made that first Saltland album almost as a challenge to see if I could,"" Foon said. ""It was a challenge just to write songs and sing and write lyrics.... I didn't think of myself as a singer at all. I don't know if I even do now. But before, I felt like I didn't even know what my voice sounded like. Now I know. It's like if you've never looked in the mirror.""On A Common Truth, Foon's mesmeric planetary prayers drift on slowly cresting waves of natural and processed cello, whose kaleidoscopic sounds were heightened by Jace Lasek of neo-psychedelic wizards the Besnard Lakes.Foon's other main collaborator on A Common Truth is less expected, unless you happened to be at La Sala Rossa in 2005 for a one-off show in which the Suoni Per Il Popolo experimental-music festival partnered Foon's Mile End Ladies String Auxiliary with rebel violinist Warren Ellis (Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Grinderman, Dirty Three). The inspired pairing led to an enduring friendship.Foon and Ellis were among the performers at the flagship Pathway to Paris concerts in December 2015, held at Paris's Le Trianon during the United Nations and also featuring the likes of Thom Yorke and Patti Smith. ""A lot of this album was written in the lead-up to that conference, and (dealt with) my worries that the nations weren't going to come together to create the Paris Agreement,"" Foon said. ""(Ellis) was aware of my work and the themes on this album, and was very committed to them as well.""Foon and Ellis built up A Common Truth's four instrumentals with an ocean separating them, but they may as well have been in the same room. There's a rare telepathy between the weeping violin and cello, made possible by artists more concerned with emotion than technical precision.""When we were playing at the Sala, we were talking about intonation and he said, 'You know, intonation is just relative.' I was blown away that he said that as a string player, because I was always so worried about playing in tune and so obsessed about intonation.""He totally twisted my anxieties and put them flat on their head. That's why I love collaborating with Warren in a nutshell: all my angst and anxiety with music, he'll just flip it around and be like, 'But look at this!' ""His way of seeing things is extremely refreshing ... and he has an ability to tap into an emotional depth with music that's unbelievable. There aren't many people who can do that.""Foon said Saltland concerts featuring Ellis are a possibility, although Cave's main creative foil has a calendar year full of commitments with the Bad Seeds (including a sold-out Metropolis show on May 29).Foon is prepared to perform her new material solo, although her own calendar is hardly blank. Among her other activism projects - including the Sustainability Solutions Group and the conservation organization Junglekeepers - Pathway to Paris is an ongoing concern, with Foon promising a major initiative for 2017. After all, the Paris Agreement may be signed, but results aren't a given.""I'm very fearful (for the agreement's future) but, coming back to the intonation idea, you have to flip things on their head. I don't think we can rely on national governments - I think we need to inspire cities to have the power,"" Foon said. ""If cities make plans to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to the Paris targets or beyond, it's extremely powerful. And then you're actually seeing the world change.""Imagine a city that is not reliant on fossil fuels - so cool. Now imagine a lot of cities that are not reliant on fossil fuels.""The climate change problem offers an enormous opportunity to flip things on their head - to stimulate the green economy, to make resilient, beautiful, creative cities. If we can move quickly, I think we could create a really cool world.""

"COP22","Canada","COP22_Canada42","UN climate fest won't reduce demand for oil","November 17, 2016 Thursday","Edmonton Journal (Alberta)","Thursday's forecast calls for sunny skies and a high of 25 C. It should be a splendid day indeed. Not here in Edmonton, silly - in Marrakech, Morocco.That's where a select group of just 225 of Canada's top climate change thinkers - led by federal Environment Minister Catherine McKenna - are gathered this week, along with a cosy crowd of 25,000 other politicians, bureaucrats and activists from around the globe, for COP22.COP22 may tell us the planet is frying, but for these jet-hopping climate change campaigners, it seems there is nothing more abhorrent than staying home and participating via video conference.The latest United Nations climate change extravaganza, to be documented in excruciating detail by more than 1,000 observer organizations and an army of 700 journalists, aims to build on the work done at COP21 in Paris, in December 2015.That's where 195 nations agreed to sign on to a long-term plan to curb carbon emissions in hopes of limiting any rise in global temperatures this century to no more than two degrees Celsius.If bears any resemblance to its predecessors, there will be grand speeches, urgent warnings, angry calls to action and the usual sanctimonious lectures directed at perceived climate change knuckle draggers. Canada used to be one of the biggest bad boys in this regard, but with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau vowing to impose a national carbon tax, we're offthe hook this time.China, the world's biggest emitter by far, continues to build new coal-fired power plants at a rapid clip and has not agreed to cap its emissions until 2030. But western eco-activists are reluctant to criticize China since it is also rolling out renewables at a faster pace than any other country.As for the U.S., it's heading straight to the penalty box this time, after leading the global climate change campaign for years. With president-elect Donald Trump (who dubs climate change a ""hoax"") set to assume office in January, and promising to roll back President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan, many fear the world's second-biggest emitter will ditch its Paris commitments.French President Francois Hollande voiced those fears Tuesday, urging the U.S. to honour the ""irreversible"" Paris agreement, while lavishing praise on Obama's past climate change policies.Whether Hollande's admonitions have any impact on Trump remains to be seen. But in truth, the much-ballyhooed Paris accord was never more than an aspirational document. Although McKenna and others claim it is ""legally binding,"" there are no enforceable penalties for countries that fail to meet their emissions reductions targets. Nor will there be.That's because the world runs on fossil fuels and will for decades to come. Renewable energy advocates don't want to admit that, of course. Hence the constant cheerleading around heavily subsidized wind and solar power.In its annual World Energy Outlook released Wednesday, the Paris-based agency says it expects global oil consumption to peak no sooner than 2040, almost a quarter century from now. Natural gas consumption is expected to jump 50 per cent.While demand for oil to power the world's one billion vehicles may eventually start to slow, the IEA, which provides energy data and research for 29 member countries, says other sources of energy demand are likely to more than offset any drop in gasol"

Caisse Theatre in Bracebridge.Canada still has ""an opportunity to save itself from climate change,"" but it will need to take a brave leadership role, May said.As part of the Canadian delegation, May attended the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in December. She left feeling optimistic.Holding up drafts of the Paris agreement to the full auditorium, May said the deal got stronger and better each day. The final product is legally binding and countries can only change their targets if they set higher standards, she said.""Peer pressure and global shaming are the ways to assure countries meet their targets,"" May said.Canada still has a lot of work to do if it wants to meet its goals, but May thinks it's possible with cooperation and determination:1. Don't let politics get in the way""Canada can do much, much more than what's being considered (from the Paris Agreement),"" said May. ""We shouldn't limit our hopes or expectations to what we think (Prime Minister) Justin Trudeau can do politically. It's time to start doing what's necessary.""2. Put a price on carbonThe Green Party is in support of a fee and dividend carbon system, where companies pay for emissions and the money is distributed to Canadians. There are other options too, like cap and trade or carbon tax, but at the end of the day, May just wants a system that works for the environment.""What matters is we stop subsidizing fossil fuels and put a price on carbon that's meaningful,"" she said.3. Transition to a fossil fuel-free energy grid by 2025Better distribution of hydro-electrical power between provinces is one place to start, said May. Opportunities exist between hydro-rich British Columbia and coal-dependent Alberta, for example.""Then we can focus our efforts on transitioning to electric vehicle-based transportation and move further away from a fossil fuel economy,"" said May.4. Get information about climate change and environmental policies in front of Canadians""Mainstream media has to catch up with the game-changing movements all around the world,"" said May, suggesting the public send letters to the editor as often as possible, in response to news stories.She also said to send in suggestions and ideas to Environment Canada.When it comes to convincing others to be more environmentally responsible, May said, ""Create a narrative and tell a story. Explain how we fought acid rain, for example. Tell them how many new jobs the green energy sector can supply.""\l"

Deron Bilous, who is also deputy government house leader, was responding to questions after his speech to a joint Society of Petroleum Engineers Calgary Section and Economic Society of Calgary lunch. Economic Development Minister Deron Bilous. One questioner expressed concern about the plan to phase out coal-fired power, which is cheap, and dramatically increase reliance on costly renewable power sources: So how can you say that youre concerned with competitiveness when you are doing things that will radically increase one of the input costs for a lot of industries?According to Alberta Utilities Commission data for 2015, 51 per cent of Albertas power came from coal, 39 per cent from natural gas, five per cent from wind, three per cent from biomass and two per cent from hydroelectric projects. Contributions from wind and solar power were negligible.Bilous said 12 of Albertas 18 coal-fired power plants were set to phase out by 2030 because of federal regulations, and the province fast-tracked the phase-out of the remaining six. He said the province hired Terry Boston, a retired U.S. power industry executive who has helped several U.S. states transition off coal-fired power, to ensure consumers arent gouged.He transitioned 26,000 megawatts off of coal to renewables, and did it successfully, and did it in a way that consumers and industry werent gouged, the minister said.Gas to growI appreciate that coal is the cheapest form of energy.... But I do think we are not only in Canada but worldwide seeing a trend away from coal-fired electricity, Bilous said. And the cost of renewables has over the past 10 years come down significantly. I think they're going to continue to come down.In an interview with the Bulletin afterwards, Bilous made it clear that gas will be a big winner in the provinces climate plan. He pointed out the share of the provinces electricity generated from gas is to grow to 70 per cent by 2030 from 39 per cent in 2015. The remaining 30 per cent of Alberta power is to come from renewables by 2030.Natural gas is absolutely a critical part of our phasing out coal, he said. Natural gas will remain a priority industry for us, not only within Alberta to heat our homes, to turn on the lights, but [were] also looking at opportunities to get our natural gas to other markets.He added: Natural gas is a key component to our climate leadership plan. And frankly, it is absolutely a key component to us meeting our electricity needs.Trump the exception? U.S. President Donald Trump has indicated Washington will abandon its commitments under the international agreement reached at the 2015 United Nations in Paris.Bilous replied the Trump administrations plans are in contrast with the direction of some U.S. states, Canadas federal government and many other countries, including China.He said Ottawa isnt only sticking to its pledge under the Paris agreement, but is also pressing on with its internal carbon strategy. The federal government has made it clear it will impose its own carbon mitigation rules on provinces that dont come up with their own plan.In fact, Bilous said the threat of having a federal plan imposed on the province was one reason Alberta adopted its own plan: We very much wanted a plan to be created here in Alberta that was Alberta specific.

Long synonymous with coal-fired power, China is the worlds biggest greenhouse gas emitter.Interestingly, a year ago I was speaking at another conference. And of course people said:  Why are we phasing out coal? Why are we imposing an emissions cap and doing all of these things when of course China has all these coal-fired facilities? Bilous recalled. And at that point I said China has already flagged to us that climate and the environment is a priority for them.The difference between a country like China and [a] country like Canada, is that when they decide they are changing direction, they can pivot on the dime, he said of the Communist dictatorship.

The Holy See released the encyclical as world leaders prepared for the United Nations (COP21). It took place in Paris last December. The encyclical had a significant impact on the discussions there.COP21 drew attention to our moral duty to hear both the ""cry of the earth and the cry of the poor."" The conference received like-minded statements from the heads of other religious traditions. For the first time, world leaders agreed to limit carbon emissions to safe levels and to help poor nations affected by climate change.We must confront climate change for what it is - an environmental crisis requiring urgent action. We must alter our behaviour. As Pope Francis stated in the encyclical, ""As often occurs in periods of deep crisis which require bold decisions, we are tempted to think that what is happening is not entirely clear ... things do not look that serious and the planet could continue as it is for some time.""""Such evasiveness serves as a licence to carrying on with our present lifestyles and models of production and consumption.""Our national and provincial governments must take bold action. We must build an economy that addresses our moral duty to care for the poor. Future generations need a habitable planet.In the encyclical, Pope Francis affirms those who are committed to caring for God's creation in our homes and in our parishes. For the past 10 years, John Dorner has served as the volunteer co-ordinator of Creation Care Ministry within the Archdiocese of Ottawa. He promotes awareness of today's ecological crisis and the means by which parishes and individuals may heal the earth and build hope for the future.Since the release of LaudatoSi', the Archdiocese of Ottawa has posted on its website a resource entitled Care for God's Creation - A Guide for Parishes. It provides many ideas for prayer, education, action and advocacy, which parishes, families and individuals can apply to help build a new culture consistent with the call to care for our common home.Many of our parishes in the Ottawa archdiocese are committed to building the new culture called for by Pope Francis in his encyclical. Most parishes have reduced their carbon emissions by changing to lowenergy lighting. Several parishes have implemented changes based on energy efficiency audits and ""green audits"" provided by the interfaith group Faith and the Common Good.This year, Sheng Shen (Holy Spirit) Chinese Parish and Paroisse Sainte-Genevi\'e8ve together with St. Luke's Anglican Church received the Greening Sacred Space Award. The award recognizes the inspiring work of faith communities that show care for God's creation.Ottawa's St. Joseph and Orleans' Divine Infant parishes were among recipients of the award in previous years.So much is possible. For example, last year Holy Cross Parish started a sustainable organic garden initiative that provides food to those in need. This intergenerational project involves seniors from the parish and students from nearby Holy Cross Elementary School and St. Patrick High School.As archbishop, I encourage Ottawa parishes to find ways to develop a new culture that looks after the poorest and most vulnerable peoples on earth. We are interconnected with all life. Our lifestyles matter.What we purchase; how we travel; how we manage our energy, our air, our water, our soil and our waste have an impact on creation. Laudato Si' - On Care for our Common Home is an exceptional, easy-toread document. I invite you to read it and to live out its message.- Terrence Prendergast is the Archbishop of the Catholic Archdiocese of Ottawa !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2016 Sun Media Corporation. All rights reserved.\l"

The day's talking point, Bill C-4, was up for a vote that afternoon.That was all quite fitting, considering the South Okanagan-West Kootenay MP was first welcomed to Trail as a federal-hopeful during a dinner at the Local 480 hall last fall.On that occasion, the Canadian and American labour leader, Leo Gerard, (President of United Steelworkers) introduced the NDP candidate to local constituents.Now, one year into his federal term, the MP was voting to repeal Bill C-4, which Cannings says was union bashing legislation passed by the former government.""The Liberal government is very popular and was elected with a lot of promises,"" Cannings began.""We are the progressive opposition so my role and the rest of our caucus is really to remind them of those promises. In some cases, we've been quite happy, today we are voting on Bill C-4, which is some really regressive anti-labour laws the Conservatives passed ... that made it more difficult for people to form a union and easier for companies to disband unions,"" he added.""Basically it was harassing unions to do so much paperwork they wouldn't have time for anything else, paperwork for things above what any other group or public organization has to do. The Liberals and NDP were very keen on getting rid of it, and so I am happy about that.""After winning the SOWK riding with 37 per cent of the vote last Oct. 19, Cannings' ensuing first year has been a bit of a roller coaster ride with long and challenging days.But he wouldn't have it any other way.""On a personal level it's a very steep learning curve, a series of learning curves, really,"" he shared.""Whether it's working in the riding, the House of Commons, or on committees - there is a big manual for all of it, but you really have to learn by doing,"" he continued.""That's been very interesting for me, I've enjoyed every minute of it ... every hour is different and there is never a dull moment.""Some days are more stressful than others, but at the end of each day, the job is a privilege, said Cannings.""It's challenging and a long work day but I really have enjoyed the year.""And with the highs, like the Wednesday repealing of a bill, he says there are some low points as well.Lack of progress on climate change and climate action is a concern Cannings hears day after day in the SOWK riding.""I've been disappointed in the government's response to that,"" he explained.""How slow it's taking and that they are actually moving forward on the old Conservative Action Plan - we aren't going to meet our Paris targets, which is really unacceptable.""Prime Minister Justin Trudeau rode a wave of popularity to France last winter for the 21st United NationsClimate Change Conference. There was plenty of fanfare and selfies mixed in with promises on Canada's future gas emission targets.Since then, Cannings says the matter has fizzled.""There was a surge of optimism early on, I was happy to see Canada go to Paris in such a positive way,"" he said. ""But very disappointed how slow things are going and how really mediocre the Liberals' goals and aspirations are - we are disappointed but still holding out hope that things will pick up.""Another pressing topic especially looking into next year, is softwood lumber.""This is a very big issue in the forestry industry in our riding and across the country,"" he said. ""Again the Liberals had a full year to do something. As time goes on it gets harder to get a deal with this crazy election in the States.""\~\l"

Among them was an agreement by Attijariwafa Bank, one of Morocco's biggest banks, to buy Rwandan bank Compagnie G\'e9n\'e9rale de Banque Limited (Cogebanque), a deal worth around $41 million. Morocco's Office Cherifien de Phosphate (OCP), the world's leading phosphate exporter, also committed to build a plant in Rwanda to ""produce fertilizers adapted to local soils,"" as reported in Reuters. While in the country, King Mohammed VI also paid his respects to the victims of the Rwanda genocide at Kigali Genocide Memorial.On October 23, King Mohammed VI arrived for a three-day visit to Tanzania, where he and Tanzanian President John Pombe Magufuli chaired the signing ceremony of 22 bilateral agreements in the capital of Dar es Salaam. While the agreements focused on a range of economic and development issues, including infrastructure development and energy policy, the King also launched the building of the King Mohammed VI Mosque in response to a request by Mufti Sheikh Abu-Bakr Ibn Zubayr Benali, President of the National Muslim Council of Tanzania, offering 10,000 copies of the Koran to the Council. The gesture follows the King's commitment to expanding Morocco's tolerant and moderate form of Islam.The East Africa tour comes just a few months after King Mohammed VI announced his intention for Morocco to rejoin the African Union (AU). Some thirty countries have already voiced their support for Morocco's bid, including Benin, Gabon, Liberia, Senegal, Egypt, and Ghana, to name just a few. Another East Africa visit, to includeEthiopia -- the home of AU headquarters -- is scheduled to take place following the 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP22), which the Kingdom is hosting in Marrakech from November 7-18.Since ascending the throne in 1999, the King has made Africa a foreign policy priority, visiting 35 African countries and signing more than 320 bilateral agreements. Beyond his many trips, in late 2013 the King established a program to train imams from across the continent. In March 2015 in Rabat, he formally opened the Mohammed VI Institute for the Training of Imams, Morchidines, and Morchidates, which has already welcomed students from Mali, Tunisia, and France, among other countries. In April 2015, Morocco signed a memorandum of understanding with the Millennium Challenge Corporation ""with the goal of reducing poverty in Africa, including a focus on promoting adoption of new technologies and innovative business models to promote entrepreneurship."" The King has also vowed to represent Africa's interests on climate change policy at the COP22 summit.Ambassador Michael Battle at the US Department of State has said of Morocco's diplomatic efforts, ""Morocco is setting the pace by showing how African countries which are prosperous can be responsive to African countries which are in the process of becoming prosperous."" In a recent article highlighting Morocco's growing role in Africa, J. Peter Pham, Director of the Atlantic Council's Africa Center, wrote, ""US policymakers would do well to 'triangulate' -- or, at the very least, better coordinate -- their efforts with those of African allies like Morocco that are already providing home-grown solutions to the challenges faced by the continent, its nations, and their peoples today.""""The United States is lucky to have such a close and longstanding friend and ally, Morocco, expanding its influence and relationships in Africa, a continent on the rise and likely to be at the crux of future policy debates,"" said former US Ambassador to Morocco Edward M.

That's the kind of heat needed to get the oil out of the oil sands, she said, or the heat needed to make cement or in steel manufacturing.""We can address all of those needs with different biomass technology,"" said Wood-Bohm, executive director of Emissions Reduction Alberta's Biological GHG Management Program, Sustainably sourced biogenic carbon from municipal wastes, agriculture and forestry could play a critical role, she said, while also supporting rural economies.And, linking big data, GIS, drones and other hightech tools to the drive for non-fossil carbons brings both fresh opportunities and potential risks for forest ecosystems, timber communities and traditional pulp and dimensional labour markets, the UNBC press release noted.For her Prince George audience, Wood-Bohm said she was ""pretty heavily focused"" on residue, like slash piles or mill waste.While she believes the forestry community is ahead of the game and makes efficient use of mill waste for electrical energy generation, some companies have said they're open to other approaches.Locally, she said Canfor has ""a really exciting opportunity"" through a recent agreement with Licella to manufacture a biocrude and potentially make higher value use of the residue steam.""That would be using waste residue to manufacture something which looks and feels and behaves just like crude oil and can be refined in a conventional refinery to a suite of products including high-value commodity chemicals and fuel,"" she said.The proposed low-carbon district energy system for Vancouver offers a good example of the discussions that are happening, she said, calling it a neat idea with potential benefits that also presents real challenges.""Financing is really difficult to get when the policy appears to change,"" she said. ""We're seeing the establishment of what should be long term policy signals and that then allows the company to have more financial flexibility to get the investments that they need to make change.""She said the talk is timely as countries met in Morocco in this month following up on the United NationsClimate Change Conference in Paris earlier this year.""We've got this backdrop now of a global community that accepts that climate change is real and we need to do something about it if we don't want to deal with catastrophic impacts,"" she said, adding she especially thinks a younger generation - like UNBC students at her lecture - need to be part of the discussion.""They come with fresh ideas and a creativity that we sorely need and so I'm always happy to talk about what our work has shown as examples and to get their perspectives on how to move forward."" \l"

The landmark pact, which calls for limiting global temperature increases this century to well below two degrees Celsius, comes into legal force only after 55 countries representing 55 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions formally ratify.The timing of Trudeau's meeting with premiers is in flux, but it does not appear likely to take place before Canadian representatives are back at a UN climate conference in Marrakech, Morocco, Nov. 7-18, to discuss implementation of the Paris accord.The Marrakech meeting, known as COP22, is not considered a leader-level summit and Trudeau will not attend, the sources said.Canada has a consistent history under successive Liberal and Conservative governments of making international carbon-cutting promises that it fails to honour, first under the 1997 Kyoto accord and then again under the 2009 Copenhagen agreement.The Liberal government of Jean Chretien ratified the original Kyoto climate accord despite having no idea how to meet emissions-cutting pledges, a fact later acknowledged by Chretien's former chief of staff, Eddie Goldenberg. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2016 Osprey Media Group Inc.

"COP22","Canada","COP22_Canada66","Great powers remain at odds; U.S. and China maintain some relationships, but they are clearly at odds on many issues","May 28, 2016 Saturday","Kingston Whig-Standard","Rivalries between and among great powers have been grist to the mill of historians for centuries. In ancient times, it was Greeks versus Persians and Romans versus Carthaginians. In early modern times, the clashing imperial ambitions of Spain, France and Great Britain were at the centre of political events. In the first half of the 20th century, Germany found itself pitted against the United States, Great Britain and France. The second half of the century was dominated by a cold war aligning the United States and its allies against the Soviet Union and its allies, and producing proxy wars in Central America, Southern Africa, Central Asia and Southeast Asia.The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 apparently led some to believe that the era of contending great powers had come to an end. This certainly seemed to be the view of the distinguished American writer Francis Fukuyama, who proclaimed ""The end of history."" It also seemed to be that of the United States government, whose spokespersons began to speak of ""a new world order."" Unfortunately, they were wrong. Even an event as momentous as the fall of the Soviet Union was insufficient to totally alter the nature of international relations. Yes, the so-called bipolar world came to an end, but nation states continued to pursue their interests with or against each other. And nowhere is this more evident than in the policies and actions of the great powers.The two most significant powers on the world stage today are the United States and China. While they manage to maintain a mutually advantageous economic and commercial relationship, they are clearly at odds on many issues. Some of these are of very long duration. For many years, the United States has been highly critical of China's human rights record, and this is a question that can give rise to tensions in the bilateral relationship as it did at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. The Chinese, for their part, are profoundly hostile to the United States' continuing political and military support for Taiwan, which they regard as a form of totally unacceptable interference in their internal affairs.Other contentious issues have arisen in the China-United States relationship in recent years. Perhaps the most difficult and most dangerous concerns North Korea.That country's regime not only has the worst human rights record in the world, it is also the most threatening nuclear weapons proliferator. Its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile tests, accompanied by boisterous hostile rhetoric, have made it a source of serious security concerns for the United States and its Asian allies. The United States has been at the forefront of efforts (sanctions, boycotts) to cripple the regime of Kim Jong Un and to put an end to its nuclear adventures. China has been far more circumspect in its attitude toward North Korea for two main reasons. First, it fears that a collapse of the Kim regime would result in a vast flow of Korean refugees into China. Second, it is also deeply concerned that an eventual reunification of North and South Korea would bring to its borders a country firmly allied to the United States and host to tens of thousands of American troops. North Korea thus continues to be the subject of often testy diplomatic exchanges between the United States and China.China's maritime boundary claims in the East China Sea and the South China Sea are also sources of friction. While the United States generally tries to stay clear of the issues at stake in these claims, it is aligned with or allied to most of the countries involved in these disputes with China. What is more, the United States is vehement in asserting the right of freedom of navigation through some of the waters claimed by China, and has sent warships to affirm that right. These assertions and activities have been denounced by China as provocations, and China's increasingly aggressive actions in its littoral seas can only lead to more difficulties in the bilateral relationship.More generally, China and the United States are engaged in a competition for preeminence in the Asia-Pacific region. For many decades after the Second World War, the United States was the unrivalled power in the region. Its alliances, its naval deployments, its military bases and its economic penetration of so many countries meant that the United States could regard the Pacific Ocean as a mare nostrum. That total dominance has, however, been somewhat undermined by the rise of China as a political, economic, naval and military power over the past 20 years. The Chinese certainly make no secret of their desire and intention to challenge the position of the United States in the region. That challenge prompted President Obama to decree a ""pivot"" to Asia in American foreign policy, involving the deployment of more economic, diplomatic and military resources to the area. Both countries have also intensified their economic competition, with the United States spearheading the negotiations of a Trans-Pacific Partnership while China set about creating an Asian infrastructure bank.What is true of relations between China and the United States is also true of their relations with other major powers. China has what can best be described as an acrimonious relationship with Japan. Their disputes range from issues relating to the control of islands in the East China Sea to long-standing but acute differences arising from Japan's invasion and occupation of China during the Second World War. Nationalists on both sides of these divides are ever ready to exploit them to their advantage, to the detriment of regional stability. China also has a major territorial dispute with its neighbour India resulting from their brief war in 1962. India demands the return of territories occupied by China at that time. China refuses and lays claims to the entire Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh on the grounds that it was once part of south Tibet. While economic ties between the two countries have grown exponentially in recent years, their political relations continue to be marred by disputes that have festered for more than 50 years.The United States, for its part, enjoys what can only be described !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2016 Osprey Media Group Inc.

"COP22","Canada","COP22_Canada71","Liberals busy giving out cheques; Billions: Trudeau government outpaces previous Tories when it comes to funding announcements","November 21, 2016 Monday","The Vancouver Province (British Columbia)","The Trudeau government has just marked its 3,000th spending announcement and, in doing so, has shown itself to be much more adroit in getting its MPs to hand out cheques than its predecessor.The majority Harper government of the 41st Parliament didn't make its 3,000th announcement until nearly two years into its mandate, on March 11, 2013. During the four-year 41st Parliament, Conservative MPs made 7,307 spending announcements, a total that Liberal MPs, at their current pace, should easily eclipse early in the third year of their mandate.That said, the Harper Conservatives moved more money out the door even though they made fewer announcements. By end of day on Friday - 396 days since last fall's election - Liberal MPs had made 3,030 announcements funding projects worth a combined $18.9 billion. It took the Harper Conservatives just 72 days after the May 2, 2011 election for that government to eclipse $18.9 billion in spending announcements.The spending announcement figures are culled from a database maintained exclusively by the National Post that draws from the thousands of press releases issuedby the government over the last eight years in which government MPs and ministers take credit for the allocation of a grant, contribution, or loan from the federal treasury. And it is always government MPs who get their names on the press releases when a cheque is handed out. Opposition MPs are never mentioned even when the project to be funded is in an opposition riding.The 3,000th announcement from the current government occurred Thursday when Environment MinisterCatherine McKenna, at the COP22 climate change conference in Marrakech, Morocco, announced $3 million to the World Bank Transformative Carbon Asset Facility. Other recent spending announcements include $54 million in aid forHaiti, announced Friday by International Development Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau during a visit to Portau-Prince.But the Trudeau government, like the Harper government before it, has plenty of money for smaller projects. For example, Liberal MP Nick Whalen had a few cheques to hand out Friday in the Newfoundland and Labrador community of Torbay, including one for $150,250 for the local Kinsmen's club to build a splash pad for kids.The money is drawn from a $300-million Parliament-approved pool of money for projects to mark Canada's 150th anniversary in 2017.The fund was established by the Harper Conservatives in its 2015 budget and was, at the time, denounced by Liberal MPs Adam Vaughan and Judy Sgro as nothing more than a ""slush fund"" for Conservative MPs.But once in office, the Liberals kept the Canada 150 fund going.The National Post database has logged 155 Canada 150 spending announcements worth a combined $27.9 million for projects in Liberal ridings. Just 15 announcements worth a combined $876,000 have been announced for projects in ridings held by Conservatives and 21 Canada 150 announcements worth $1,078,780 have been announced for NDP ridings. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2016 Postmedia Network Inc.

Trump believes that man-made global warming is a ""hoax"" perpetrated by China and other countries wanting to steal American jobs.Trump opposes carbon taxes and wants to notch up production of America's oil resources to reduce imports from the Middle East and Venezuela. And he plans to scrap U.S. President Barack Obama's deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping to shut down American coal-fired power plants while allowing China to commission several new coal-fired power plants each week.In emitter No. 3, Vladimir Putin's Russia, environmental matters don't appear on the radar screen.In India, population growth, corruption and a rich-must-pay attitude means continuing emissions growth.So the four countries responsible for more than half of global emissions are going to raise, not lower, them. Adding other countries with no intention of playing the COP game - including most of Asia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Valenzuela - means emissions from countries representing over two-thirds of global emissions are going to go up, not down.The Africans' only objective at COP 22 was to convince others to buy carbon credits in return for their promises to plant or avoid cutting a few trees, with dubious results once the cash is paid.So who's left to save the planet from the predicted global warming Armageddon?Just the European Union, Japan and Australia, with a combined global emission share of 15 per cent.And, of course, Canada, with our minuscule 1.6 per cent emission share.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has anchored part of his ""Canada is back"" rhetoric to fighting global warming.

The proposition is simple: if Canadas fossil fuel capital can do this, then surely you can too, he told the more than 800 delegates attending the convention. This also comes at a time when the leaders of France and Italy are considering their own coal phase-out requirements, convention delegates heard. Albertas Climate Leadership Plan was released in November 2015 with the backing of both industry and environmental groups. The plan, which includes an emissions limit for the oilsands, a carbon price across all sectors and an energy efficiency program, is now law with the approval last week by the legislature.Six months after the 2015 election, Alberta went from being a laggard and international whipping boy on climate to being one of the most progressive jurisdictions acting on the issue in the entire OECD (Organization for Economic Development and Co-operation), said Whittingham. The province, he added, has gone from being part of the problem to being part of the solution and a critical piece of the puzzle. Thats because while the previous Progressive Conservative government had failed to address the elephant in the room  absolute greenhouse gas emissions, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley and Environment Minister Shannon Phillips tackled the elephant head on by setting an absolute emissions limit of 100 megatonnes of greenhouse gases from the oilsands, he said. Some will argue that its too high and I can show you scars on my back from the environmental community of those who share that space, he said. To those who argue it is too high, my reply is simple, he said. Show me any other jurisdiction thats taken a major pool of carbon, whether its oil, gas or coal and said \£6 this going to give us certainty; its going to have an emissions limit and then once it hits that limit we are keeping it there, said Whittingham. No other jurisdiction has done that and moreover, its a precedent that the rest of the world can build upon. This week, as a member of an advisory team to Royal Dutch Shell Plc, he will be meeting in The Hague with the entire Shell executive team to talk about what happened in Alberta and how it is a precedent they should be advocating for in other energy-producing jurisdictions.Whittingham also acknowledged that some in the energy industry believe that the emissions limits are too low and the CEOs who stood on stage with Notley have scars similar to his. But what weve done is provide certainty around the biggest issue in the oilsands: greenhouse gas emissions, he said. We have taken that elephant in the room head-on \£6 and now this helps with social licence; undoubtedly, unquestionably, said Whittingham. The climate leadership plan is robust, it is comprehensive, it has already shifted the debate around the oilsands and Alberta doing its fair share to address climate change and now [it is] getting noticed for the right reasons, he said. We heard that in spades in Paris [the United Nations ], he said. Lets face it. The premier [Notley] is our biggest source of soft power that this province has right now. The Alberta plan, though, is facing a backlash, convention delegates heard. The backlash is strong, is well funded and is rife with inaccuracies and frankly, outright lies, said Whittingham, adding that the importance of countering those claims with facts and practical solutions that can be supported with research and analysis cannot be overstated.

As for the U.S., it's heading straight to the penalty box, after leading the global climate change campaign for years.With president-elect Donald Trump (who dubs climate change a hoax) set to assume office in January, and promising to roll back President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan, many fear the world's second-biggest emitter will ditch its Paris commitments.French President Francois Hollande voiced those fears Tuesday, urging the U.S. to honour the ""irreversible"" Paris agreement, while lavishing praise on Obama's past climate change policies.Whether Hollande's admonitions have any impact on Trump remains to be seen. But in truth, the much-ballyhooed Paris accord was never more than an aspirational document.Although McKenna and others claim it is ""legally binding,"" there are no enforceable penalties for countries that fail to meet their emissions reductions targets.Nor will there be. That's because the world runs on fossil fuels and will for decades to come. Renewable energy advocates don't want to admit that, of course. Hence, the constant cheerleading around heavily subsidized wind and solar power. Yes, renewables are growing faster as coal-fired power plants are phased out in places such as the U.S., Canada, Europe and China. But fossil fuel consumption is also growing and won't plateau for decades to come. Don't take it from me. Consider what the International Energy Agency, or IEA, has to say.In its annual World Energy Outlook released Wednesday, the Paris-based agency says it expects global oil consumption to peak no sooner than 2040, almost a quarter of a century from now. Natural gas consumption is expected to jump 50 per cent.While demand for oil to power the world's one billion vehicles may eventually start to slow, the IEA, which provides energy data and research for 29 member countries, says other sources of energy demand are likely to more than offset any drop in gasol"

The most recent Environment Canada inventory assessed the country's carbon dioxide equivalent emissions at 732 million tonnes in 2014 - and slowly rising.""Most Canadians recognize the need to mitigate climate change and limit the increase in the global average temperature, but the magnitude of the challenge is less well understood, with a requirement for very deep emissions cuts from every sector by mid-century,"" says the 87-page plan, released Friday at an international climate conference in Morocco.

Until the U.S. vote, the prime minister might have expected to find some lingering buzz from President Barack Obama's historic visit to the island this spring. It was part of a thaw in the relationship between Cuba and the U.S.But in Havana, excitement has given way to trepidation. Uncertainty as to whether Trump will follow up on his predecessor's overtures has replaced momentum. On the campaign trail, the president-elect blasted Obama's visit to Cuba.Later this week Trudeau will land in Peru for the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit.The organization's 12 member countries recently negotiated the Trans-Pacific Partnership.But the American election has sapped the impetus for the ratification of the massive free trade agreement. Last week, Obama formally abandoned plans to submit the deal to Congress for ratification before the end of his term in January. Trump wants no part of the TPP.The president-elect's shadow loomed large over this week's international climate change summit (COP22The accord's signatories - including Canada - argue that the changing of the guard in the White House will not diminish the political will to act in concert on climate change. Time will tell whether they are whistling past the graveyard of the Paris accord.A pivotal part of the infrastructure of the accord was an alliance between China and the U.S. They jointly agreed to a reduction in their carbon emissions. But Trump is not expected to hold to the American side of the bargain.On the heels of the U.S. election, Trudeau reaffirmed Canada's intention to lead a military deployment in Latvia as part of NATO's latest strategy to deter Russia. In Moscow, Trump's victory has been interpreted as an encouraging sign that could lead to NATO being forced to reconsider the deployment.A bit more than a week after Trump's victory, it has already become conventional wisdom that his installation in the White House will at least complicate, if not derail, Trudeau's Liberal agenda. There is truth in that.Under Stephen Harper, Canada took credit for playing host to the secret meetings that led to the U.S.-Cuba rapprochement.The Conservatives set the climate change targets that Trudeau is seeking to achieve as part of the obligations Canada contracted under the Paris agreement.One of the distinguishing features of Harper's foreign policy doctrine was his strong stance against Russian President Vladimir Putin's military goals. Trudeau's Latvia deployment fits into that doctrine, as does the ratification by the Liberals of the Canada-Ukraine free trade agreement initially negotiated under the Conservatives.And then, what would Harper - as a staunch champion of Israel - have made of the anti-Semitic undertones of some of the rhetoric of Trump's campaign?On Wednesday, interim Conservative leader Rona Ambrose offered her caucus a few positive thoughts about Trump's victory. But when all is said and done, the president-elect poses a greater threat to Harper's trade and foreign policy legacy than Trudeau ever did.Chantal H#233;bert is a national affairs writer.

I was at the Major Economies Forum with China, the EU, South Africa, UK, Japan and France, and everyone is absolutely committed to climate action, she told a media conference call on Thursday from the 22nd United Nations Conference of the Parties (COP 22) in Marrakech, Morocco. McKenna added: Canadians know that climate change is among the greatest challenges of our time, and they also recognize the opportunity it brings. According to the environment minister, companies such as Suncor Energy Inc., TransCanada Corporation, Enbridge Inc., ATCO and TransAlta Corporation have representation at COP 22, as they understand the benefits of Canadian leadership within a global conversation on reducing emissions, protecting the environment, and enhancing Canadas competitiveness and access to global markets in a low-carbon economy. We are in a transition period. We all know that and the world knows that. We have committed to action. We have put a price on carbon pollution and every province by 2018 must have a price on pollution. We will be announcing additional measures in the lead up and at the [next] first ministers meeting, and we know we need to do more. However, she added, the transition to a low-carbon economy will not occur immediately. Therefore, the federal government must take thoughtful action to ensure it is working with business, environmentalists, indigenous leaders, and all Canadians. We are going to come back [to COP]  as every country is going to come back  in five years, because we know we need to improve. But the market is clearly moving in a direction of a low-carbon future. Earlier this week, the federal government announced that it will contribute $14 million to reduce short-lived climate pollutants such as methane through partnerships with Mexico and Chile, assisting these countries to adopt clean technologies and employ Canadian expertise to reduce methane emissions ( HYPERLINK http://www.dailyoilbulletin.com/article/2016/11/15/albertas-climate-plan-controls-competing-business-/DOB, Nov. 15, 2016 ). As part of Canadas commitment of $2.65 billion over the next five years to help countries and communities worldwide pollute less, be better equipped to resist the effects of climate change, and make positive contributions to a global clean economy, funding to Mexicos oil and gas sector will reduce gas flaring from  plant operations, which is responsible for harmful emissions causing climate change and air pollution. In Chile, the funding aims to capture methane as it escapes from decomposing landfill sites, as well as diverting organic matter from the waste through composting. We are working extremely closely with all the countries in the world, because we know that we all need to do our part, McKenna said on Thursday. I have had a number of very good bilateral meetings with small island states and countries that need our support, and I am proud that Canada is stepping up, and we are stepping up at home. She added: When it comes to particular projects, we have an environmental assessment process, we announced transitional measures that will rebuild confidence in our environmental assessment process. With all projects, we take into account the emissions, and we make decisions based on science, evidence and facts, and when it comes to all projects, they also need to fit in with our climate plan  they need to take into account those emissions. On Wednesday, McKenna, along with Marie-Claude Bibeau, minister of international development and La Francophonie, also announced that Canada will invest nearly $1.8 billion to mobilize private-sector support for developing countries efforts to transition to cleaner, more sustainable economies.Leveraging private-sector investments in areas such as clean technology, climate-smart agriculture, sustainable forestry, and climate-resilient infrastructure, Canada will deliver support via a range of trusted partners  multilateral development banks with demonstrated expertise in innovative finance solutions to address climate change.Canadas bilateral support will focus, in particular, on female empowerment, and it will align with a commitment to support the UNs sustainable development goals.In supporting a wide range of partners and programs, Canada is ensuring that the worlds poorest and most vulnerable have access to the right tools and opportunities to make a difference, Bibeau stated in a news release. With this investment, Canada is not only helping developing countries transition to low-carbon, climate-resilient economies, but we are also advocating for the empowerment of women and girls.Marrakech is hosting the first COP meeting since delegates reached last years Paris Agreement, which strives to limit global warming to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels and calls for a transparent system to account for climate action while strengthening countries abilities to deal with climate impacts, recover from climate impacts, as well as support nations in building clean, resilient economies ( HYPERLINK http://www.dailyoilbulletin.com/article/2015/12/14/environmentalists-support-paris-agreement-call-can/#axzz45Wlyst75DOB, Dec. 14, 2015). \l"

BOWLING ALLEYThe Trudeau government has just marked its 3,000th spending announcement and, in doing so, has shown itself to be much more adroit in getting its MPs to hand out cheques than its predecessor.The majority Harper government of the 41st Parliament didn't make its 3,000th announcement until nearly two years into its mandate, on March 11, 2013. During the four-year 41st Parliament, Conservative MPs made 7,307 spending announcements, a total that Liberal MPs, at their current pace, should easily eclipse early in the third year of their mandate.That said, the Harper Conservatives moved more money out the door even though they made fewer announcements. By end of day on Friday - 396 days since last fall's election - Liberal MPs had made 3,030 announcements funding projects worth a combined $18.9 billion.It took the Harper Conservatives just 72 days after the May 2, 2011, election for that government to eclipse $18.9 billion in spending announcements.The spending announcement figures are culled from a database maintained exclusively by the National Post that draws from the thousands of press releases issued by the government over the last eight years in which government MPs and ministers take credit for the allocation of a grant, contribution, or loan from the federal treasury. And it is always government MPs who get their names on the press releases when a cheque is handed out. Opposition MPs are never mentioned even when the project to be funded is in an opposition MP's riding.The 3,000th announcement to be registered in the database from the current government occurred Thursday when Environment Minister Catherine McKenna, at the COP22 climate-change conference in Marrakech, Morocco, announced a contribution of $3 million to the World Bank Transformative Carbon Asset Facility.Other recent spending announcements include $54 million in aid for Haiti, announced Friday by International Development Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau during a visit to Port-au-Prince; a new container terminal at the Port of Montreal built with a $44-million contribution from the federal government, opened Friday by Transport Minister Marc Garneau; and $1.5 million to expand a national diabetes prevention program, announced by Health Minister Jane Philpott last Monday.But the Trudeau government, like the Harper government before it, has plenty of money for smaller projects, the kind that helps a local MP get noticed back home. For example: ..In tiny Tyne Valley, P.E.I. (pop. 266), the Liberal MP Bobby Morrissey provided a grant of $158,173 that will help, among other things, upgrade a bowling hall, beloved by the community as ""a popular local venue for a variety of community events and ... home to several bowling leagues,"" according to a press release...Liberal MP Nick Whalen had a few cheques to hand out Friday in the Newfoundland and Labrador community of Torbay, near St. John's, including one for $150,250 for the local Kinsmen's club to build a splash pad for kids. ..Liberal MP Rene Arsenault, who knocked off Conservative incumbent and cabinet minister Bernard Valcourt last fall in the northwestern New Brunswick riding of Madawaska- Restigouche, brought home cheques for 25 maple syrup producers in his riding. The producers split more than $7 million in federal loans announced by Arsenault on Nov. 7. The money for Torbay's splash pad and Tyne Valley's bowling hall were drawn from a $300-million Parliament-approved pool of money to fund all sorts of projects to mark Canada's 150th anniversary in 2017.The fund was established by the Harper Conservatives in its 2015 budget and was, at the time, denounced by Liberal MPs Adam Vaughan and Judy Sgro as nothing more than a ""slush fund"" for Conservative MPs to dip into to improve re-election chances.But once in office, the Liberals kept the Canada 150 fund going and have been busy dipping into it.In their first year in office, the Trudeau Liberals have made 207 announcements that draw money from the Canada 150 fund and the vast majority has gone to fund projects in ridings held by Liberal MPs.The National Post database has logged 155 Canada 150 spending announcements worth a combined $27.9 million for projects in Liberal ridings. Just 15 announcements worth a combined $876,000 have been announced for projects in ridings held by Conservatives and 21 Canada 150 announcements worth $1,078,780 have been announced for NDP ridings.Louis Plamondon is the only BQ MP to have seen any Canada 150 cash come his way.

"COP22","Canada","COP22_Canada90","Albertas Climate Plan Controls For Competing In A \u732 Business-As-Usual U.S. Situation: Phillips","November 15, 2016 Tuesday","Daily Oil Bulletin","Alberta did not write its action plan on climate change based on an ambitious U.S. climate agenda, and even if President-elect Donald Trump does not pursue progressive federal-level measures in his own country, the provinces oilsands emissions cap already controls for competitiveness in an American business-as-usual situation.On the oilsands emissions limit, that was something industry had asked for, they did not ask for it in the context of robust U.S. leadership on climate  they asked us for those initiatives in the context of essentially the status quo or  business as usual in the United States, Environment and Parks Minister Shannon Phillips told a media conference call on Monday from the 22nd United Nations Conference of the Parties (COP 22) in Marrakech, Morocco. That part moves forward, and it moves forward because we still get to have conversations with communities, our neighbouring provinces, and with others around the responsible extraction of our energy resources.According to Phillips, who is also the minister responsible for the climate change office, Albertas shift away from coal is part of an international movement. Across North America the economics of coal-fired power generation remains challenged because of the low price of natural gas, along with renewable energy. Subnational jurisdictions in the U.S. continue to see the economic logic of coal alternatives, regardless of their theoretical views on climate change.We also see many initiatives at sub-national levels in the United States  Washington State, California and the Eastern Seaboard states. In many ways, it moves forward because there is so much momentum around global action on climate change.In regards to carbon pricing, Phillips said the Peoples Republic of China is moving into a cap-and-trade system next year, which reinforces that carbon pricing is increasingly something that much of the world is doing. From our perspective on carbon pricing, Canada remains a leader and we will continue to be a leader through the carbon-pricing leadership committee with the World Bank and with others. Ernest Moniz, U.S. Secretary of Energy, spoke at the ongoing COP 22, telling delegates that energy efficiency holds a $23 trillion private-investment potential in the developing world alone, noted Phillips. She said her province wants to ensure it is open to the job creation, diversification and other benefits that arise from a leadership position on carbon, given the business consensus and global consensus on the issue.What it means for us in Alberta is that we have an enormous amount of opportunity. As soon as you price carbon, you open up investment opportunities that were not there previously. That is why we have been spending some time at the World Bank with private-sector investors and others. Marrakech is hosting the first COP meeting since the Paris Agreement at COP 21, in which delegates reached an agreement that strives to limit global warming to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels and calls for a transparent system to account for climate action while strengthening countries abilities to deal with climate impacts, recover from climate impacts, as well as support nations in building clean, resilient economies ( HYPERLINK http://www.dailyoilbulletin.com/article/2015/12/14/environmentalists-support-paris-agreement-call-can/#axzz45Wlyst75DOB, Dec. 14, 2015).We have really focused on ensuring that we are using this time to meet with investors, meet with folks from international financial institutions, and others, in order to really lay that groundwork for the tremendous amount of investment we know will flow into Alberta as a result of these actions, Phillips said, adding subnational governments are discussing climate action and opportunities at the subnational level.A lot of folks know what we are up to [in] Canada and around Alberta specifically in terms of carbon pricing and recycling those revenues to lower- and- middle-income folks, into efficiency and renewables, cleantech and so on. That story has largely been told, and we are continuing to tell it. At the current COP meeting, governments can recommit to the new agenda of rapid implementation, not least in pressing forward with adequate support for vulnerable countries to take their own action. On Monday, for example, the federal government announced that it will contribute $14 million to reduce short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) such as methane through partnerships with Mexico and Chile.These pollutants are powerful greenhouse gases that also have negative effects on peoples health, Catherine McKenna, minister of environment, stated in a news release. This investment will help grow a global clean economy and will benefit Mexicans, Chileans, and Canadians as it will make the air cleaner, protect our health, and slow warming on the planet we all share and for which we all care. Assisting countries to adopt clean technologies and employ Canadian expertise to reduce methane emissions, in Mexicos oil and gas sector the funding will reduce gas flaring from  plant operations, which is responsible for harmful emissions causing climate change and air pollution. In Chile, the funding aims to capture methane as it escapes from decomposing landfill sites, as well as diverting organic matter from the waste through composting.This weeks funding announcement is part of Canadas commitment of $2.65 billion over the next five years to help countries and communities around the world pollute less, be better equipped to resist the effects of climate change, and make a positive contribution to a global clean economy. \l"

A draft assessment of the LNG project, whose major partner is Malaysia's state-owned Petronas, was released in February by the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency.The agency found that the project was ""likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects,"" although it said mitigation measures would result in no serious harm to fish habitat.Carbon dioxide emissions will reach 5.3 million tonnes a year from the LNG plant, according to the draft report, not including another 6.5 million to 8.7 million tonnes produced from natural gas collection and transportation.""This will increase the B.C. and national emission totals by 8.5 per cent and 0.75 per cent respectively, based on 2011 levels,"" said an early project assessment.

The report, Climate Change and the Preparedness of Canadian Provinces and Yukon to Limit Potential Flood Damage, surveyed 103 government representatives across 91 provincial and territorial ministries, departments and agencies between December 2015 to April 2016. Assessments focused on the preparedness of provinces and Yukon to limit flood damage relative to current and future major rainfall events, across 12 categories of assessment, including flood-plain mapping, land-use planning, public health and safety, and emergency preparedness and response. Using a scale from A (strong flood preparedness) to E (weak flood preparedness), the average score of the 10 provinces and Yukon is C-, suggesting there is considerable opportunity to limit future flood risk. Areas where the provinces and Yukon are not doing well include engagement with home and commercial property owners to identify and mitigate flood risks. Also, survey respondents often expressed frustration with municipalities that frequently override direction from the provinces to limit new development in flood-prone areas, thus putting homes and businesses at risk. ""The financial and social costs to Canadians will mount if preparedness to extreme weather events, and in particular flooding, continues to receive limited attention. Premiers are showing leadership on carbon pricing. Now, they need to build upon this commitment by embracing adaptation to address extreme weather and flooding with equal enthusiasm -- this would be a strong position to lead with at COP 22 in Morocco,"" said Blair Feltmate, head of the Intact Centre and a professor in the School of Environment, Enterprise and Development at Waterloo. Based on feedback from those surveyed, the report recommends immediate actions to improve flood preparedness: 1. Chief Adaptation Officer: Provinces and Yukon should create the position of chief adaptation officer (CAO). The CAO, with direct accountability to the premier, would identify areas of strength and weakness in reference to flood preparedness and actions to mitigate risk. 2. Audited Flood Preparedness Reports: On a multi-year cycle, such as every five years, provinces and Yukon should issue audited public reports that document the state of flood preparedness. 3. Land-use Planning: Provinces and Yukon should mandate the restriction of new development in flood-prone areas, or at a minimum, that development in such areas be made flood-resilient. Where development already exists in known flood-prone areas, they should take action to limit potential flood damage. Municipalities should not be able to override direction from the provinces or Yukon that restricts development in flood prone areas, or that mandates flood resilient design. 4. Build Back Better: Where practically and actuarially cost-effective, infrastructure should be re-built to meet new and future-projected flood risks. Founded in 2015 with a gift from Intact Financial Corporation, Canada's largest property and casualty insurer, the Intact Centre helps homeowners, communities and businesses to reduce risks associated with climate change and extreme weather events.

While the global climate change treaty is now legally in place \'e2\€  obliging the world to bring in measures starting in 2020, to limit the global temperature increase to no more than two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels \'e2\€  the prospect of Republican candidate Donald Trump being elected is causing alarm. ""It would take some steam out of the process, definitely,"" said Steven Guilbeault, who is the senior director of Quebec based environmental group Equiterre and a veteran observer of more than a dozen UN climate conferences. There are also warnings Canada's domestic climate change plans could be put at risk if Trump takes power.""If the U.S. stops these forward motions against climate change, then Canada is going to be in a really difficult situation,"" said Laura Dawson, director of the Canada Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington and an expert in trade and international agreements.""I think anything is possible and probably the extreme options are equally likely,"" Dawson told CBC News. Trump has been bluntly skeptical of global warming for years. He promised in a campaign speech at a Petroleum Conference in Bismarck, N.D., last May that he would scrap the Paris climate deal. ""We're going to cancel the Paris climate agreement \'e2\€ \£6 and stop all payments of the United States tax dollars to UN global warming programs,"" Trump vowed. Trump has often used Twitter to express his views on climate change. Under President Barack Obama the U.S. has made climate change a priority, playing a key role in crafting the Paris climate agreement. In November 2014, Obama signed a landmark pact with China that put the world's two largest emitters in lockstep to cut carbon emissions. The U.S. vowed to cut emissions by 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2025, while China agreed for the first time to cap its emissions by 2030.The deal broke the logjam in climate talks and paved the way for the Paris agreement. In September both China and the U.S. formally ratified the deal, prompting the rest of the world to follow. The next step in the process is the Marrakech Climate Conference (COP 22) starting Monday, where more than 190 countries will negotiate the next steps for the deal.Growing nervousnessAs officials, negotiators and environmentalists head to Morocco, the possible effect of the U.S. election results on the negotiations is making some people nervous. ""But some of them might say, 'Well listen, if the historical largest emitter of greenhouse gas isn't doing anything about it, why should we developing countries do something about it?' It would be a setback on the international scene.""There are several ways Trump could legally abandon the Paris agreement if elected. He could pull out of the 1992 UN Convention on Climate Change that is the umbrella agreement for the Paris deal within a year of taking office.He could also wait until the end of his first term to use a provision in the Paris agreement to pull out of the pact. Or he could simply ignore the plans Obama has made to cut carbon emissions, ensuring the U.S. doesn't meet its promises.Canada could be left 'high and dry'That would be a huge setback to the work Canada and the U.S. have done jointly on climate change over the last few years, according to Dawson. ""I'm concerned that Canada is going to be left high and dry, if there is a Trump presidency, on energy policies,"" she said. The two countries have signed a list of deals to cut emissions, including an exchange of hydro power to help U.S. states get off coal. They also share targets to cut methane emissions and plan to reach a goal of 50 per cent clean power by 2025. Ontario and Quebec now jointly share a cap-and-trade system with California. In fact, the Trudeau government's climate strategy and the energy policies of provinces like Ontario are based on the expectation that their largest trading partner will soon have a price on carbon as well.Dawson said that if Canada ends up with higher energy costs than the U.S., businesses will think twice about locating here when they can ignore climate policies that Canada holds dear. China weighs inThe potential Trump effect on global climate change initiatives also prompted a rare comment on the U.S. election from China.""If they resist this trend, I don't think they'll win support of their people, and their country's economic and social progress will also be affected,"" said China's top climate negotiator, Xie Zhenhua. ""I believe a wise political leader should take policy stances that conform with global trends.""One of the largest environmental groups in the U.S. says China's comments are a big deal.""I think that is quite a rare moment where another country would comment on the dynamics of an election,"" said Jake Schmidt, senior adviser to the Action Fund of the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""The reality is the business community wants this, that the investor community is already moving in this direction,"" he said. Combined with pressure from other countries, Schmidt hopes those forces would encourage even a climate change skeptic to ""see the light and stick to the agreement."" \l"

"COP22","Canada","COP22_Canada105","Today's letters: Punishing consumers for energy conservation","October 14, 2016 Friday","Postmedia Breaking News","Energy-conservation, competition go togetherIn the battle against climate change, we are properly encouraged to conserve energy, which should be good for both the environment and our wallets. Alas, when it comes to electricity and water, two essential services, governments have proven either incompetent or irresponsible in managing costs to consumers.In my household, we have shifted electricity use to off-peak hours as much as possible. Meanwhile, what has happened to off-peak hydro rates? They have increased from 2.7 cents per kilowatt/hour in May 2008 to 8.7 cents per KW/hr in May 2016. That's a whopping 222-per-cent increase in eight years, well beyond the rate of inflation during the same period. I am not making these figures up. My source is the Ontario Energy Board.Water rates have gone up 14 per cent over the past three years. Not as bad as hydro, but still well beyond the rate of inflation.Meanwhile, over the past several years we have seen long-distance telephone rates go down to the point where we don't even think about their cost, which used to be prohibitive for all but the wealthy at one time. How did this come about? The answer is technology and the elimination of monopolies.Given the monopoly enjoyed by local and provincial governments for the supply of water and electricity, perhaps the time has come to unleash the power of competition and let the market do what it does best. Government should get out of the way and limit itself to enacting regulations to ensure fair competition and protection of consumers. That is its proper role. It has certainly proven unable to control costs.Tony Manera, KanataWhen cyclists should ride single fileCyclists, ride single file; it might save your life! Knowing the rules, whether you're a cyclist or driver, is important if injuries and deaths are to be avoided.Recently, I was on McCordick Road near Kemptville, a two-lane highway, with several other cars, when we came upon a group of four cyclists riding side-by-side.

"COP22","Canada","COP22_Canada106","View From The Hill","November 16, 2016 Wednesday","CTV NEWS CHANNEL Television, Inc. POWER PLAY WITH DON MARTIN 17:00:00 ET","DON MARTIN: Welcome back. Canada's getting squeezed on environmental policies. The government tries to pre-emptively fend off the Trump's presidency protectionism. That and this week's summit on the opioid crisis are today's big issues for the MP panel. Adam Vaughan is a Liberal MP from Toronto; Candice Bergen, a Conservative MP from southern Manitoba; Jenny Kwan, an NDP MP from Vancouver. Welcome to the show. Nice to have you guys back.JENNY KWAN (NDP - British Columbia): Good to be here.ADAM VAUGHAN (Liberal - Ontario): Good afternoon.MARTIN: This COP22 is going on, the UN Climate change conference. There's, they're saying that we're not true, truly green because we're developing our oilsands and there's a number of environmental groups that are trying to do this. Meanwhile, we discovered that Canada has one of the larger delegations there, 225 Canadians. That's more than China or France, and a lot of other countries. I guess those aren't exactly seamless topics, but I guess I'm trying to get a sense here, Candice, how green can Canada go if we're going to be up against a neighbour that's thinking brown fields are progress?CANDICE BERGEN (Opposition House Leader): Well, I think the Liberals had not really thought ahead as far as natural resources, the environment, how that really goes hand in hand and when we're talking about with a North American strategy. Now that we have President-Elect Trump, who has been very clear on the development that he's going to be encouraging and allowing it with natural resources, the Liberals have got to press reset here in Canada. And there are ways that they can do it. We can have responsible natural resources development. We can have champions of our natural resources and have a competitive edge here in Canada, if the Liberals would reverse some of their policy. For example, carbon tax which is going to make us hugely uncompetitive. But it seems like they're a little in, in awe right now, and they, they, I don't think they realize what's hit them. So, certainly, you know, they've sent a big delegation to the, to the conference, and they're probably getting pushed on, on the, on the left on that issue. But this isn't about politics. This is about jobs and jobs in the, in Canada. So they have to press reset and they have to re-look at their policy when it comes to natural resources development.MARTIN: Okay. I'll get yours in a minute, Adam, but do they have to put the reset button? Is that necessary because of the Trump victory, at all, Jenny?KWAN: Well, I would say that, on the contrary, more than ever, I think that the prime minister needs to stand firm and to be clear to work with the international community. Climate change is real. Climate action is necessary. The prime minister was in the international stage and he said Canada is back. So he needs to put teeth behind those words. And by the way, even though he's saying that, though, he adopted the Harper targets. It's not good enough. We need to do better. You need to actually show action with your words, and I think that's what people are calling for.MARTIN: Adam, can we afford to go beyond the Harper targets, and can we afford a carbon tax?VAUGHAN: You know, the issue and the statement that has been framed by what we say, quite often, is that the environment and resource development must go hand in hand for Canadians to have confidence in the process, but also if we're going to get product to market. And so, you know, the criticisms at Marrakech, they're probably based on the reputation that we earned over the last ten years, which is not a good one, and it did stand in the way of us getting product to market. We have to find a way to get to it market in a responsible way, in a way that, that has social license, and in a way that, that also moves the economy forward. If we can do that, and we think we have the plan to get that done, I think the criticism will disappear as the market activity increases. And we will be in a position to fight, fight climate change, but to do it in a responsible way that doesn't hurt the economy. That's the plan. There's no need to reset it. Our responsibility now is to, is to see that through.MARTIN: You don't see a l"

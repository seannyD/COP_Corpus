Attention has been lavished on the new commitments - or, in the case of Australia, old non-commitments - of leading carbon-emitting countries. The final communiqu&#xE9; underscored the need for a global approach. Ambitious promises were made to increase the finance available for adaptation measures, especially in developing countries.But COP26We know what we need to do, and we know how to do it, too. The problem is how to pay for it. The global transition to a low-carbon economy will not come cheap. Who will finance the technological innovations? Who will fund the transition to agricultural sustainability? Who will pay for the retraining of old industries and the development of new ones? Who will support the developing countries who are the least responsible, but the most vulnerable? Who will pay for the rainforests and the reefs and the cultures now on the brink of collapse?COP26 recognised that the climate emergency was essentially an economic emergency. But it stopped short of asking where the money was going to come from.The most powerful lever of social and collective action we have is taxation. A progressive taxation system can reduce social inequality and support policies that reflect our collective needs and aspirations rather than just our individual wants and desires. But not everyone is paying their fair share.Multinational enterprises (MNEs) and their affiliates are now responsible for one-third of global output, half of global exports, one-third of all GDP and one-quarter of all employment. But the levers that might have controlled these vast enterprises - local unions, environmental regulations, and national laws - are increasingly impotent. At the drop of a hat or an unwelcome legislative change, MNEs can threaten to move their operations elsewhere. Profit shifting, forum shopping, regulatory capture, and tax havens are in their DNA. In the words of Drahos and Braithwaite, two Australian scholars who have studied the complexities of global regulation for decades, it has become a race to the bottom.As a result, MNEs pay significantly lower taxes than other corporations - let alone the rest of us. A financial shortfall of billions of dollars ends up in the pockets of Facebook, Amazon, Exxon, Nestl&#xE9; and the rest. Earlier this year, the G7 reached an agreement to ensure MNEs pay a minimum tax rate of 15 per cent - still no more than half the average corporate figure. And this was nothing more than an in-principle agreement among seven countries (not including Australia).READ MORE:Doug Dingwall: The biggest problem with the government's climate change programs Richard Mathews: Why diplomats are worried about climate change COP26 is over. What now for the planet, Australia and Canberra? The issue is that changing how we tax highly mobile entities like MNEs is what is known as a collective action problem. The whole world has to act as one, otherwise money will simply slip through the net like water. At best, a global treaty is a long way off; at worst, it's a pipe dream.Which is where COP26 dropped the ball. At the most momentous global conference for years, it could have sheeted home responsibility for climate change not just to individual nations, but to the corporate fiefdoms whose independence from state control is akin to that of feudal lords. MNEs are responsible for around 20 per cent of global emissions. Increasingly these are produced in developing countries, which bear the brunt of the damage while reaping few of the benefits. If the conduct of MNEs poses a major challenge, environmentally and legally, to a successful climate transition, then reorganising the global tax system might be a crucial way of addressing it.Linking global taxation to the global climate emergency would make a big difference. It would place at the very top of the global agenda taxation reforms on which experts have been struggling to gain traction for years. It would justify progressive economic transformation in the context of the greatest collective action problem in world history. The influx of tax revenues could be specifically earmarked for the global costs of financing adaptation and mitigation strategies, supporting workers, communities, industries and ecosystems around the world.COP26 presented a perfect opportunity to look beyond the language of the nation-state and identify the role of MNEs in climate change. At the same time, it could have secured the financial resources that in years to come will prove the real stumbling block. Coupling the environmental responsibility of MNEs with its own economic solution - call it ""mnemonics""! - would have killed two giant birds with one stone. It would have been the wake-up call we so desperately need.But, like the dog in the night-time, COP26 did not bark.Professor Desmond Manderson is director of the ANU's Centre for Law, Arts and Humanities.\l"

Climate change issues are likely to hit African countries the hardest though the continent is the least responsible for driving climate change. We asked Mouhamadou Bamba Sylla the AIMS-Canada Research Chair in Climate Change Science at AIMS-Rwanda, who is a lead author to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Report 6 for Working Group 1, what the conference meant for African countries.What was the agenda that African countries took to COP26?According to the HYPERLINK https://africangroupofnegotiators.org/African Group of NegotiatorsClimate responsibility: Developed nations have to take their responsibilities and lead the way to reaching zero net emissions by 2050.Climate finance and adaptation: Developed nations have to mobilise enough funds to finance adaptation in developing countries that are adversely affected by climate change. Finance architecture and transparency mechanisms should be put in place.Transfer of technologies and capacity building: Developed nations must transfer sound environmental technologies to African countries for effective climate adaptation, mitigation and transition.Which of their agenda items did they get through?It's hard to say. There were a lot of announcements. For example many nations agreed to ""phase down"" fossil fuels in general. These are just promises and they will remain so unless they are included in their https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcsNationally Determined ContributionsCOP26.We are very far from net-zero emissions, which is a carbon neutral world, by 2050. The recently released HYPERLINK https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/IPCC working group 1 reportTherefore, the level of commitments made at COP26 is a total failure. HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/documents/310475Glasgow climate pactDeveloped countries refuse to take any historical responsibility for the cost of losses and damages from the impacts of climate change, such as hurricanes and sea level rise.Therefore, the financial outcome of COP26 is a glass half full, but it's not far from a failure.Whose agenda did African countries come back with?It's hard to determine, as there were a lot of compromises. But they certainly did not come back with their own agenda fulfilled. Many obstacles due to the high costs, the pandemic, the travel restrictions and other logistical challenges meant that African voices were marginalised.How much damage or good will somebody else's agenda cause to African countries?A lot of damage. Africa is home for most of the least developed countries. These countries are not well equipped in terms of funds and infrastructure to face the adverse impacts of climate change. The recently HYPERLINK https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-working-group-i/released IPCC reportThe report also states that every fraction of degree matters as it leads to discernible changes in these hazards. Right now after Glasgow, the HYPERLINK best estimate is that the world is on course to reach 2.4?C of global warming. This is very far from 1.5?C. Africa needs to raise its voice in such a way it will be put at the centre of the negotiation process.Is there room for improvement and where?The contributions and national commitments at COP26 are purely voluntary. The agreement is not binding. There are a lot of improvements to make if COP wants a stronger agreement.Africa needs more coordination and more science.

"COP26","Australia","COP26_Australia10","The good, the bad and the ugly of COP26","November 23, 2021 Tuesday","Newcastle Herald (Australia)","After a massive two weeks of discussions and negotiations, the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow wrapped up earlier this month. There was a huge build up to the event, with Prince Charles calling it ""the last chance saloon"" for climate action, and Boris Johnson saying ""if Glasgow fails, the Paris Agreement fails"". I was fortunate enough to represent the alternative government - and the Hunter region - at COP26. In my opinion, the conference had elements of the good, bad, and ugly.pat conroyThe good news was that 140 nations increased their 2030 emissions reduction commitments. If these are implemented, global warming would be kept to about 1.8 degrees above pre-industrial levels. The bad news is that under Mr Morrison, Australia was the only developed country not to increase its 2030 commitment. Despite this being the main goal of COP26, Scott Morrison ruled out doing that before the conference even began. Which brings me to the ugly.The Prime Minister's inaction has not only exposed the Liberal-National government as climate laggards, it is having real-world economic consequences in our region. Australia now faces the risk of carbon border tariffs for our minerals, farm and manufactured exports, including from the Hunter.This will make our exports more expensive and hence less competitive against other nations. This means less exports and less jobs. made it clear that the Hunter region needs a Federal Government with a real plan to develop new industries as the world reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Coal exports are a major source of economic opportunity and jobs in our region and will remain so for decades to come. However, COP26 saw over 190 countries and organisations pledging to phase out coal-fired power generation.This will have significant impacts on demand for thermal coal, which dominates Hunter coal production. With 80 per cent of global GDP decarbonising, it is a shift being driven by the boardrooms of Beijing, Tokyo, and Seoul and in Japan, South Korea and India, not by decisions in Canberra.While Mr Morrison likes to brag about his 'don't-do government' it is the responsibility of the federal government to ensure that regions like ours are not hung out to dry as the global economy changes.We need a government with a clear plan to drive investment in the new industries that can provide thousands of well-paid, secure new jobs in the Hunter. Our region has the skills, the talent, the trained workforce, the transport links and the infrastructure to build entire new industries like hydrogen, green steel, green ammonia and battery manufacturing.We have done it before after the shutdown of local steelmaking two decades ago. And we can do it again, but we desperately need a federal government with the plans, the policies, the funding and the commitment to our region to make it happen. Scott Morrison treats the Hunter as a backdrop for his latest fly-in, fly-out fluorovested photo opportunity. Those of us who live and work here know his marketing slogans, political rhetoric, and broken promises won't build a strong future for our region.I am proud to represent a coal mining region in the Australian Parliament. I am grateful for the sacrifices coal miners have made and the wealth their hard work has provided and continues to provide for our region and the nation. They deserve better than a Prime Minister who treats them as pawns in his political games. The key question for the Hunter is not whether this change is coming. The question is what will the federal government do to support the regions that have powered our country for generations, and build the new industries that will ensure future prosperity for the Hunter?The Morrison-Joyce government can't be trusted to manage economic change they deny will happen. If Mr Morrison really cared about coal miners he would do three things: be honest with them about what is coming; develop a real plan for our region; and ensure coal mining jobs in the meantime are good paying and secure tackling the scourge of labour hire and sham casuals.Under Anthony Albanese and Labor's $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund and $20 billion Rewiring the Nation plan, the Hunter has a strong future as the world moves to tackle climate change. COP26 proved to me we desperately need a new government in Canberra to ensure the Hunter grows and thrives as the world moves to a low-carbon future.Pat Conroy is Shortland MP and Shadow Minister Assisting for Climate Change.\l"

Most of the 120 world leaders and their entourages attending have found rooms in Glasgow or Edinburgh, although there are reports some delegations are staying nearly 150km away. But everyone else has been scrambling.Glasgow has had the house-full sign out for more than a year and for months Edinburgh has also been full, with the only rooms available in that city - a 45 minute train commute - around $600 a night.But climate activists and others on more modest budgets, have been securing rooms in towns a 100 kilometres away, relying on train and bus transport to attend official events.However, those plans have been thrown into disarray after the RMT union, which represents train drivers at ScotRail, have voted 86 per cent for strike action during COP26 over pay and conditions.

Prince Charles called it ""the last chance saloon"" for climate action, while Boris Johnson declared: ""If Glasgow fails, the Paris Agreement fails.""The UN Secretary-General, US President Joe Biden and a host of other world leaders sang from a similar hymn sheet.Part of this hype is the UK, as host, pressing for success. But COP26 has undeniably added import as it marks the effective beginning of the Paris Agreement as the new framework for global climate action. It also occurs in the context of mounting evidence for urgent climate action this decade, and growing expectations worldwide for serious climate ambition.As hard as Britain and others have tried to confect a new ""deal"" in the offing at COP26 that secures commitments from countries to steer the world on a path to reach the 1.5 degree temperature goal that will ensure we avoid the worst impacts of climate change, such an outcome was never really in prospect. Blind Freddy could see that wishing and willing an end to coal use by 2030 was not achievable, certainly not without heroic diplomatic and financial efforts.The problem with over-hyping is you set yourself up to fail. As leaders and ministers have departed, there is a narrative of disappointment emerging from Glasgow. Unfortunately, this undercuts what has been achieved and undermines the historic Paris Agreement, just as it begins in earnest.The 2015 Paris deal compelled countries to progressively ratchet up their climate action and ambition, with reviews every five years. To kick-start the agreement, in 2020 (pushed back to this year because of COVID-19) parties agreed to see whether they could put more ambition on the table than what they committed to in 2015. They did not agree to come back five years later with commitments at a scale that would have everything done and dusted in year one of the agreement. The significance of Paris is that action will beget further ambition over time as learning, co-operation and confidence grows.In this context, the results leading up to and at COP26 are remarkable and were, frankly, unimaginable even three years ago as I was leading Paris Agreement negotiations for Australia. More than 120 countries have now committed to net zero emissions by 2050 with many setting ambitious targets for 2030. The International Energy Agency has just estimated the additional commitments for COP26 - including the agreement on methane reductions by 2030 - put the world on track for a 1.8 degree temperature rise. While not 1.5 degrees, the achievement needs to be celebrated.Without COP26With this threshold crossed, the Prime Minister - to his credit - has ended the major domestic climate wars and created the pathway for further and earlier ambition and stronger policies. I am confident we will see more conspicuous action sooner - witness the new EV policy - than many think, and certainly over this critical decade.Without COP26Equally remarkable at this COP is the growing commitment by business. The standout announcement is the commitment by more than 220 asset managers - representing $130 trillion under management - to align their investments with net zero by 2050. This world of opportunity will drive climate action, which again is something to celebrate.Furthermore, the $100 billion climate finance commitment from developed countries to developing countries in support of their climate action and ambition will likely be fulfilled at Glasgow. This is a big deal for developing countries and will further spur their commitment to the Paris Agreement.Far from failing, Glasgow has given life to the Paris Agreement. Without losing sight of the need to turn words into deeds and to keep striving for more and sooner global action given the urgency of the climate challenge, this should fill us with hope.Patrick Suckling was Australia's ambassador for the environment, is a senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute and senior partner at Pollination, a specialist climate advisory and investment firm.\l"

We are the world's fourth largest energy exporter, after Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States.Since 2005, we have reduced emissions faster than any other major commodity exporting nation in the world. Our emissions are now more than 20 per cent below 2005 levels and have fallen faster than many similar developed countries, including Canada, Japan, New Zealand and the United States, and faster than the OECD average.Ahead of and during COP26, Australia worked closely with our Pacific family to raise the important role of our oceans in addressing the impacts of climate change, to secure outcomes on climate financing and support for building climate resilience, particularly for vulnerable countries in our Pacific region, and to ensure they have access to low emissions technologies to support their development and future prosperity.At COP26Australia's 2030 target is fixed and we are committed to meeting and beating it, as we did with our Kyoto-era targets.The Government particularly welcomes outcomes on international carbon markets (Article 6) and a standardised transparency framework, which was a major focus for Australia.Transparency is the key to accountability and to translating ambition into achievement. This goes to the heart of the Paris Agreement, which relies on all countries delivering on their commitments to achieve a global net zero outcome.Australia's emissions reporting and transparency is the gold standard and we expect all major emitters to display similar levels of transparency.Through the $104 million Indo-Pacific Carbon Offsets Scheme, we are working with our regional partners to build the capability of their emissions accounting and reporting capabilities.Strong transparency and integrity standards are vital to ensuring carbon markets deliver real and verifiable emissions reductions.Australia has doubled its climate finance commitment to $2 billion over the next five years. More than 70 per cent of our support is focused on climate resilience and adaptation.At COP26Australia joined the Glasgow Breakthroughs Initiative, which sets global goals to make clean technologies the most affordable and accessible option before 2030. This initiative is a strong international endorsement of our practical, technology-led approach.A focus on reducing the cost of low emissions technologies to parity with existing approaches is the only way to make net zero practically achievable for all countries. To that end, the Australian Government will invest more than $21 billion in the next generation of low emissions technologies, to drive up to $120 billion of total public and private investment in Australia by 2030.Under our Plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, we will act in a practical, responsible way to reduce emissions and build on our track record of achievement - reducing emissions while growing our economy, maintaining affordable, reliable energy and ensuring our regions remain strong.

This was set up in 1992 to organise a global response to what most people then called the ""greenhouse effect"". It's COP26 simply because this is the 26th meeting.The location of COP meetings changes each time. The last meeting was in Madrid in 2019. There was no COP in 2020 due to COVID-19. The most important COP so far was the 2015 meeting in Paris, which HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreementagreed to ""limit global warming to well below 2?, preferably to 1.5?, compared to pre-industrial levels"".It's possible to set a target like this because scientific research has recognised a HYPERLINK https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-atmospheric-carbon-dioxideclose relationship between the amount of carbon dioxide in the global atmosphere and its average temperature.In order to achieve the target of ""well below 2?, preferably 1.5?"" the Paris Agreement HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreementcommitted to ""reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible to achieve a climate neutral world by mid-century"".The main task for COP26 is to follow through on this commitment and produce realistic plans to reduce global carbon emissions to levels that hold 21st-century global warming as close to 1.5? as possible.As you can imagine, getting 197 different countries, all with their own circumstances and interests, to agree to such plans isn't exactly straightforward: after all, it took 23 years to get to the Paris agreement. Most famously, Donald Trump withdrew the US from the Paris agreement when president, although it returned after Joe Biden's election. So there is some uncertainty about how successful COP26 will be.The main method for reducing emissions is the Nationally-Determined Contribution (NDC) of each country: these are individual countries' climate action plans. For example, the UK's HYPERLINK https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uks-nationally-determined-contribution-communication-to-the-unfcccmost recent NDC commits it to reducing emissions by at least 68% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.The main problem facing COP26 is that the combined NDCs of all the parties aren't enough to meet the 1.5? target of the Paris agreement. If you combine all the current plans and promises contained in the NDCs, they would lead to a global temperature increase of 2.4? by the year 2100 and if you look at actual emissions now, they would lead to a global temperature increase HYPERLINK https://climateactiontracker.org/global/cat-thermometer/of 2.9? by 2100.So there is a need for much-improved NDCs, plus effective ways to ensure that countries actually cut all the emissions they pledged to. One of the most important ways is for wealthy countries to provide https://theconversation.com/wheres-the-money-climate-fight-podcast-part-1-transcript-169287financial support to enable less wealthy countries to cut emissions, which was an important part of the Paris Agreement but hasn't been fully acted on yet.Why this mattersCOP26 matters because the window is quickly closing on the Paris Agreement's 1.5? target: if emissions don't fall very rapidly, very soon, too much carbon will have been added to the atmosphere to keep the temperature from rising higher. Current emissions need to be HYPERLINK https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/halved by 2030 to have about a 50:50 chance of keeping to 1.5?. The longer the world delays before cutting emissions, either the harsher the cuts will need to be to meet the target, or the target will be missed altogether.The Paris Agreement matters because a HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/what-will-the-world-actually-look-like-at-1-5-c-of-warming-687631.5? world is safer than a 2? world. For example, the proportion of the global population exposed to severe heat at least once every five years is almost three times higher at 2? compared to 1.5?.

Today, the discussion revolves around environmental, social, and governance, green energy, decarbonisation and fossil fuels. You may ask, 'why go there'? Because I sniff an opportunity.While coal is seen as the demon, other fossil fuels including crude oil and liquefied natural gas are also in the sights of those actively demanding net zero emissions targets. I am no expert, but then again neither were most of the negotiators at COP26. Their backgrounds are mostly political and very few would have had any experience in running a commercial business. The costs associated with attaining zero emissions targets for CO2, which is less than 0.05 per cent of the Earth's atmosphere, will be too large to be absorbed by companies. They will be passed on to consumers one way or another and become deeply embedded into operating cost structures with longer-term inflationary implications. Shareholders will also share some of the burden.Investors are abandoning the fossil fuel energy sector, spurred on by climate change euphoria and the urge to participate in the flavour of the month - ESG investment and ""green"" energy. All the while they are being egged on by the opportunistic exchange-traded fund industry.Oil and gas and thermal coal stocks have endured consistent and persistent selling for months, which will ultimately dry up when portfolios are rebalanced. When all those not wishing to invest in the sector have achieved their goal, the opportunity will present. Today's situation reminds me of what happened to the tobacco industry some 30 to 40 years ago. In the post anti-tobacco campaign era, Altria, the parent company of Philip Morris, was founded in Virginia in the US in 1985 and was one of the most successful stocks listed in the US over the next 30 years. It spun off the successful Philip Morris International business in 2008. The tobacco industry was in decl"

Yet big environmental meetings usually have big carbon footprints. The United Nations' COP26, which started in Glasgow on Sunday, will be no exception.In the past three UN climate conferences, emissions from long-distance travel averaged 85 per cent of the total. Inevitably, travelling back and forth to the venue also creates emissions. Some of the 30,000 or more visitors will have to commute tens of kilometres every day, though cruise ships have been hired to ease the shortage of hotel rooms.Accommodation is, after flights, likely to be the biggest cause of carbon emissions for COP26. It usually accounts for about half the domestic total, though a homestay program should reduce the total.Heating is a significant factor here. Moreover, some meeting venues have low ratings for energy efficiency. Historically, the need to heat temporary structures - often with diesel generators - racks up emissions. Britain intends to use waste oils, like old chip fat, as a green alternative.Summit organisers often prefer to exclude some embarrassingly large categories of carbon costs when they talk about an event's footprint. In 2016, France boasted that its carbon footprint for COP21 amounted to 9600 tonnes of carbon dioxide ""on national territory"" - equal to the annual emissions of just 800 French people. This excluded international flights.Leaders negotiate important deals most effectively face-to-face. And a virtual preparatory meeting in June suffered from time-zone mismatches and tech hitches.But there is a good argument for restricting numbers tightly.

The world will move to a new-energy economy. It will move to a decarbonised net-zero economy. And the pace of that and the way that journey \'e2\€ \£6 is travelled by countries will be different. In different countries they've got different challenges and they will find their different ways to that same destination.""And to think that aspiring to that goal means that every single country has to get there the same way. I don't think that's realistic. And frankly, I think it's a bit naive."" The British Prime Minister said on Sunday night that while reasonable progress had been achieved at the G20, ""there is a huge way still to go"".""If Glasgow fails, then the whole thing fails,"" Mr Johnson said. ""Right now the Paris Agreement, and the hope that came with it, is just a piece of paper. We need to fill that piece of paper to populate it with real progress."" The US President, facing increasing domestic pressure over his climate change agenda, said it was ""disappointing"" Mr Xi and Mr Putin had not attended the G20 and COP26 summits in-person. ""(They) basically didn't show up in terms of any commitments to deal with climate change,"" he said.""And there's a reason why people should be disappointed in that. I found it disappointing myself.""The proof of the pudding will be in the eating. I think you're going to see we've made significant progress and more has to be done. But it's going to require us to continue to focus on what China is not doing, what Russia is not doing, and what Saudi Arabia is not doing."" Mr Morrison, who arrived in Glasgow on Sunday night (Monday AEDT), will join more than 100 leaders at a two-day summit in setting the COP26 agenda and -delivering national statements outlining their climate change policies and targets.He was due to use his speech overnight to explain Australia's plan to reach net zero by 2050 and updated emissions projections showing the country was on track to beat its Paris commitment.Before travelling to Glasgow, Mr Morrison and Energy Minister Angus Taylor ruled out Australia supporting higher methane -emissions-reduction targets or agreeing to a phasing out of coal-fired power generation by the end of the decade.G20 countries including India, Australia, Russia, China, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and South Africa were understood to have reservations about some of the climate agenda being pushed by the US, Britain and the European Union.More than 20,000 people have assembled in the Scottish city for the COP26 summit, where Mr Johnson had hoped to usher in a new era of global co-operation on emissions reduction and climate change.Mr Morrison was due to hold a roundtable with South Pacific leaders overnight, his first -opportunity to hold in-person talks with island leaders since the pandemic struck. He was also due to meet Israel Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Vietnam Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh - both relatively new leaders in key strategic countries - after visiting the BAE Systems shipyard to inspect British Hunter-class frigates, the same model that will be built in Adelaide.As expected, G20 leaders broadly agreed meaningful action was required to limit -global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, ""also as a means to enable the achievement of the 2030 agenda"". But a standoff pitting the US, Britain, France and the EU against China, Russia, Brazil and India led to a substantial rewriting of the G20 communique's climate change section.The final communique, released late on Sunday, revealed a softening in language around targets for net-zero emissions by 2050, with carbon-neutrality goals watered down to say ""by or around mid-century"".Despite calls to end coal-fired power generation by 2030, G20 leaders could only agree that countries ""commit to phasing out investment in new unabated coal power generation capacity as soon as possible"". A vague reference was -included on ending inter-national public finance for new coal generation abroad by the end of the year.Mr Biden's Global Methane Pledge, which he will officially launch at COP26, also fell flat with G20 leaders. It said the world's leading economies would ""acknowledge -methane emissions represent a significant contribution to climate change, and recognise, according to national circumstances, that its reduction can be one of the quickest, most feasible and most cost-effective ways to limit climate change and its impacts"".Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who attended the G20 summit, said: ""Why do you believe 2050 is some magic figure. If it is an ambition of the -European Union, it is the right of other countries also to have -ambitions \'e2\€ \£6 No one has proven to us or anybody else that 2050 is something everyone must subscribe to."" In Australia, Anthony Albanese said Mr Morrison would be exposed at Glasgow for a lack of policy on his own net-zero target by 2050.

Yancoal and New Hope (Bengalla) also peaked in early October, and have followed very similar patterns to Whitehaven all year.Although BHP refuses to comment on market speculation, reports are circulating that BHP is having second thoughts about selling its Mount Arthur mine, given the strong prices for its product. BHP chairman Ken MacKenzie told the company's annual general meeting earlier this month that ""all options"" were on the table, which was interpreted as including retaining the mine.With climate activists angry that the Glasgow meeting ended with a pledge to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal - as evidenced by the Blockade Australia protests in Newcastle - the Times of India is reporting that China and the United States, not India, were responsible for the change in language. The Times quoted a government source who said: ""It was the chair of the COP 26, Alok Sharma, who had asked India to introduce the new text on the floor. However, we did not introduce the term 'phasing down'. It came from the US and China.

He apologised for Donald Trump withdrawing from the Paris accord and said the US remained committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent to 52 per cent by 2030 over 2005 levels, and he remained committed to getting something through Congress.This, he said, would ""demonstrate to the world the United States is not only back at the table, but hopefully leading by the power of our example"".No concrete targets""I know it hasn't been the case and that's why my administration is working overtime to show that our climate commitment is action, not words.""The COP26 Chinese President Xi Jinping did not attend Glasgow but issued the conference a written statement devoid of any new commitment.""Ancient Chinese believe that successful governance relies on solid action,"" it said.""I hope all parties will take stronger actions to jointly tackle the climate challenge and protect the planet, the shared home for us all.""Mr Johnson and his allies want COP26 to agree on ambitious 2050 and 2030 emissions reductions targets because the consensus is that only this level of commitment can restrict global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius - the now-agreed threshold above which climate change becomes catastrophic.French President Emmanuel Macron said ""the largest emitters whose national strategies do not match our strategy of 1.5 ... must scale up"".But key polluters Russia and Brazil were among the absentees - although Brazil issued a press statement saying it had boosted its 2030 emissions reduction target from 43 per cent to 50 per cent, from an unclear basel"
"COP26","Australia","COP26_Australia26","COP26 raises 2030 pressure on PM","November 15, 2021 Monday","Australian Financial Review","The Glasgow climate deal requiring all nations to annually ""revisit and strengthen"" their climate targets means the global pressure on Scott Morrison to commit to taking faster action on climate change will intensify as a result of COP26. In principle, this would mean formally scaling up Australia's 2030 targets ahead of next year's federal election. While reinforcing global support for a net zero world, COP26 has also shown that achieving a global consensus about the pace of decarbonisation remains challenging, given the wide range of interests and costs involved for different nations. Hence the last-minute watering down of the Glasgow Climate Pact text, with a ""phase-out"" of coal being replaced with a ""phase-down"". India and China's determination to continue to emulate the Western model of cheap fossil-fuelled development has scuppered Boris Johnson's ambitious pursuit of a global deal that would make coal-fired power history.The government now says it will simply update Australia's emissions projections without setting new benchmarks. The aim here is to turn the pressure back on Labor to set out its position on 2030, as it promised to do after . This underscores how the government's climate agenda is operating to a political timetable and purpose, as shown by the decision to release its politically managed net zero modelling late last Friday afternoon. A government serious about the policies needed to reach net zero by 2050 should have treated the modelling's publication as a major announcement and an opportunity to verify the credibility of its ""technology, not taxes"" road map. Instead, Energy Minister Angus Taylor tried to turn the modelling into an election billboard. What the modelling supposedly shows is that without the government's technology-driven approach, consumers and companies would be hit with a carbon tax of about $400 a tonne in the 2040s to reach net zero by 2050. This is the apparent trap for a scare campaign against Labor for wanting to bring back the carbon tax, or perhaps widen the emissions safeguards mechanism that the government says is a proxy carbon tax.Mr Morrison has stressed that Australia had to commit to net zero so as not to be left behind in the lower carbon future. But this has not been backed with a genuine policy framework or mechanism - such as a revenue-neutral carbon tax or price. Australia's outsized net zero challenge is to decarbonise its fossil fuel-based economy and seize the emerging clean energy opportunities. Glasgow shows there will not be one pathway to net zero for all nations. The government's technology-led approach has managed to get a majority of the Nationals inside the 2050 tent and avoided the risk of blowing up the Coalition. But the scale of the transition Australia must make compared with much of the rest of the world means the least-cost and most efficient policy options for carbon-neutrality should not be ruled out for political reasons. Carbon pricing, like nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage, needs to be on the table. Alas, the government is more interested in turning climate policy into an election wedge, perpetuating the culture war politics that have held Australia back from adequately tackling the challenge.\l"

Israel's energy minister Karine Elharrar arrived to take part in the world's largest climate summit, the UN Climate Change Conference - known as COP26 - in Glasgow on Monday, but was unable to get into the venue.Ms Elharrar, who uses a wheelchair, waited outside the venue for two hours, hoping to enter before giving up and returning to her hotel 80km away. It was highly embarrassing for the organisers of COP26, whose website states that ""the venue, events and exhibits are wheelchair accessible"". ""It is sad that the UN, which promotes accessibility for people with disabilities, in 2021 does not provide accessibility to its events,"" Ms Elharrar tweeted. ""Hopefully the lessons will be learned so that tomorrow green energy promotion, removal of barriers and energy efficiency will be the things I will deal with.""Fortunately she attended the conference without any problem on Tuesday, with a personal apology from British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. I don't claim to understand the challenges faced by people with disabilities on a daily basis, but I've recently experienced some of them with my partner currently using a wheelchair. It has been an eye-opener.Australia is no doubt more accessible than many places thankfully, but even in a modern city like Perth there are avoidable problems.Like the lack of a dropped kerb near an ACROD parking spot, forcing people to wheel down the street to get on to the pavement. Or the cafe that decides to use its accessible toilet as a storeroom. Experience has shown it's a good idea to recce places beforehand or stick to where you know. But of course people shouldn't have to do that in order to feel comfortable, included and to go about their everyday life. It applauded the progress made to date in Australia, such as the introduction of minimum accessibility standards for all new housing builds.But PwDWA said: ""Despite the progress that has been made, people with a disability continue to experience barriers to inclusion in all aspects of their life course"".

So was the climate summit a success?","November 14, 2021 Sunday","Analysis and Opinion","It was ""our last chance to avoid the worst effects of climate change"",\~according to COP26 president Alok Sharma and ""the most important international meeting of the century"", according to climate councillor Lesley Hughes.Some were so quick as to declare it a failure before it even started, but as the meeting got going, serious progress was made.So HYPERLINK https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-14/cop26-climate-deal-reached-with-coal-compromise/100618866now that COP26 has wrapped, was it a success?Views from those involved vary widely, but\~here's what's clear: Not enough has been done to stop warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius, or even the catastrophic 2C threshold.But more importantly, the world is moving faster to reduce emissions now than it was a couple of weeks ago. And those actions are now set to accelerate.So the big question is this: Did COP26 keep the chance of stopping warming at 1.5C alive?Before the Paris Agreement was signed, the world was on a trajectory to about 4C of warming by 2100. Such a world would be literally unlivable for billions of people around the world. It was a path towards planetary collapse.Through commitments made under the Paris Agreement, the world came to COP26 with 2030 commitments that would see the world warm by about 2.7C by the end of the century.Still catastrophic, but it was a pathway that bought us time to take stronger action.Through the COP26 HYPERLINK https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-01/australia-climate-change-reputation-ahead-of-cop26-warming-talks/100579386although Australia was not one of them.If nations come good on those commitments, then warming may only reach about 2.4C by the end of the century, according to leading analysts, Climate Analytics.Still not enough, but there are other reasons for optimism, and maybe even some relief.""Glasgow has not closed the emissions gap in 2030, which is vital to keeping 1.5C alive, but it has set up an urgent process to address this gap, inviting countries to submit more ambitious national climate targets by the end of 2022,"" Bill Hare, senior scientist\~and chief executive at Climate Analytics, said.That ""urgent process"" is one of the most important outcomes of the meeting.Acceleration of the Paris AgreementAnother piece of analysis during COP26 gave people around the world a rare shot of hope: Assuming nations' less concrete longer-term commitments, including Australia's net-zero by 2050 target and India's similar target for 2070, warming could peak at 1.9C and drop to about 1.8C at the end of the century, according to researchers at The University of Melbourne.""We would have to do more in 2030 to limit warming to 1.5C,"" said the University of Melbourne's Malte Meinshausen, who led the research.But finally there's a projection that sees warming stay under 2C.However, that assumes a lot of work will be done to implement those long-term targets, which for some countries so far seem barely consistent with their plans for 2030.That won't happen without a lot more work on increasing and then implementing 2030 targets.So\~that's where one crucial aspect of the Glasgow Climate Pact comes to life.The Glasgow Climate Pact, agreed to by every nation including Australia, requests countries strengthen their 2030 targets to align with the 1.5C goal next year.""There is now clearly a consensus that this is not something that can be left. That\~it's an urgent tissue,"" Howard Bamsey, who was previously Australia's chief climate negotiator, said.The pact also sets up working groups and work programs to drive ambition in those targets. There is no question now that there is global consensus to drive ambition forward this decade to keep 1.5C alive.""It keeps the hope alive, which is the important thing,"" Professor Hughes from the Climate Council said.According to Kaveh Guilanpour, from the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions in the US, the test of whether COP26 was a success will be how promises are turned into reality.""We need to move from a conversation only about 'how much?' toward one that is also about 'how?'.\~COP26Breakthrough language and side-agreements lay groundwork for real actionInternational climate diplomacy is an incremental game. And some incremental gains here have many excited about what they will achieve in the coming years  possibly turning ""how much"" into ""how"".For the first time, this COP's decision singles out coal and fossil fuels. It might seem strange, but fossil fuels were not mentioned in the Paris Agreement.It calls for nations to both phase down unabated coal power, and ""inefficient fossil fuel subsidies"".""Post-Glasgow, we can rid ourselves of the pretence that fossil fuels can be part of the solution to the climate crisis,"" said Richie Merzian, a former climate negotiator for Australia, now at The Australia Institute.Domestically, that has big implications, says Howard Bamsey, and will be the basis for stronger international agreements in coming years.""You've got Australia agreeing to an outcome that uses the term 'phase down'\~of coal. It legitimises a discussion of that topic which has been taboo until now,"" he said.""This will provide the groundwork for some progress on the Australian domestic scene which has been a total mess.""Media commentary has focused on the fact that HYPERLINK https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-14/cop26-climate-deal-reached-with-coal-compromise/100618866this wording has been weakened from a draft of ""phase out"" to ""phase down"", but Mr Bamsey and Professor Hughes both said having either form of words in there is a big deal.""Regardless of whether you say 'down' or 'out', moving beyond coal and removing fossil fuel subsidies  \~It's another part of the pact that puts considerable pressure on the Morrison government  on all politicians before the next election  that transitioning out of fossil fuels has to be part of any credible policy,"" Professor Hughes said.""We all wanted more than that,\~but at least coal has been identified as the toxic substance that it is.""Outside the official negotiating stream at Glasgow, a range of strong and promising commitments were made, which could help make promises a reality.More than 100 countries, not including Australia, agreed to slash methane emissions. And 190 countries, again not including Australia, agreed to phase out coal power and end public funding.And more than 100 countries, including Australia, signed a pact to end deforestation.The last positive outcome, which many thought was unlikely to be achieved, was the so-called ""Paris rule book"" was finalised, paving the way for global emissions reductions through carbon trading. And according to early analysis, it looks like it has avoided the issue of ""double counting"", where countries can sell carbon credits as well as counting them as part of their own achievement.""That's a very good outcome,"" Mr Bamsey said.The UK will see the meeting as a success, with COP26 clearly contributing to the fight to halt the climate crisis.But not everyone is so pleased.The developing world needs global emissions to be reined in, but they also need money to pay for their own reductions (called ""climate finance""), and they have demanded compensation for the damage they're seeing caused by climate change (called ""loss and damage""), which has been caused by rich nations.There was progress made on climate finance, but the overdue goal of reaching US$100 billion\~a year by 2020 has still not been met. And little progress was made on loss and damage.""COP26 will be remembered as a betrayal of global south countries  abandoned to the climate crisis with no money for the energy transition, adaptation or loss and damage,"" Sara Shaw from Friends of the Earth International said.Jagan Chapagain from the International Federation of Red Cross had a similar view.""We are particularly disappointed that COP26 did not deliver the finance needed to support communities at the frontl"

This is why interim targets and supporting frameworks matter - because, just like commitments to technology and other programs, they affect hurdles rates for investment and the cost of capital.Interim targets signal whether the proverbial can (and cost) is kicked down the road - back ending change comes with higher costs for business, our regions and taxpayers.No question, the private sector will gallop ahead because the economics and commercials make sense. We have seen this recently from both the BCA and the Climate Leaders Coalition, a group of 33 CEOs of major Australian companies.This is what looms over the deliberations at COP26.Governments may find this hard to swallow, but the climate genie is out of the bottle and their role is now to accelerate orderly change because reluctance will simply increase the transition costs for the economy. Without co-ordination and planning, the country will be less prosperous than would be the case if with a clear framework to allow the most efficient transition.The real risks for business and net zero now lie less with governments but with the speed with which finance is moving.

They expect those managing their retirement savings to do the same, he says.In the three months to the end of September, the wealth manager received $290 million of new cash, an increase of 80 per cent on the same period a year earlier.""What I find fascinating is that we had new members from all age demographics, and from every state and territory,"" McMurdo says.\l"

They want to accelerate the transition to net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest.Wikramanayake is leading the GFANZ work stream to mobilise private capital for critical climate solutions in emerging markets.As well, she has an eye to building Macquarie's franchise in India through her involvement in the Climate Finance Leadership Initiative.This project is using India as a pilot study for bringing together local and international financial institutions and corporates to identify climate finance priorities.Wikramanayake, who usually has a cameo role at Macquarie conferences, this week interviewed Natarajan Chandrasekaran, chairman of the Board at Tata Sons, which, as a steelmaker and power supplier, is at the forefront of decarbonising Indian heavy industry and boosting renewable power.\' I know how passionate you are'Chandrasekaran was full of praise for Wikramanayake's work in helping formulate strategies for achieving lower carbon emissions and her passion for working to shape policies.""I want to tell you how pleased I am to be able to come together with you,"" he said.""Having known you now for some time and having had a number of interactions, I know how passionate you are about this particular theme and initiative, not only at the policy level but working together at the operating level to make things happen.""Both of us share the passion of not only making this movement, but also wanting to see a number of actions on the ground.""But the strongest praise for Wikramanayake came from Sharma, who is a former British energy minister, and the man appointed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to make COP26 a success.He said her work with the CFLI and former Bank of England governor Mark Carney, who is the COP26 finance adviser, were critical to mobilising money to finance lower carbon emissions in emerging markets.""That's why I think the work that you are leading as one of the strands of GFANZ to get that money mobilised in developing countries is going to be really important.""I would argue that actually it is one of the most important pieces of the delivery from GFANZ to get that money mobilised in developing countries.""\l"

Otherwise the planet is on track for ""catastrophic"" warming of at least 2.7C this century.\~\~ However, under a scenario of very low emissions, Earth is still likely to reach 1.5C but the IPCC believes it will still be possible to drop back below that after a few decades.\~\~ WHY HALF OF ONE DEGREE MATTERS?\~\~ Australia is already feeling climate change in the form of higher temperatures and more extreme weather.\~\~ Fractional degree increases have been linked to more frequent and severe bushfires, droughts, cyclones and storms, coastal inundation.\~\~ Globally, 2C would expose 37 per cent of the world's population to severe heatwaves at least once every five years, compared to 14 per cent at 1.5C.\~\~ It would expose 61 million additional urban dwellers to drought.And small island states and low-lying countries would sink further into the rising sea, among many other devastating effects. \~\~ THE OBJECTIVES OF COP26:\~\~ Countries have been urged to present ambitious 2030 emissions reductions targets by phasing out coal, rapidly switching to electric vehicles, limiting deforestation and investing heavily in renewable energy.\~\~ Another key objective is for developed countries including Australia to honour a decade-old pledge to provide $100 billion annually to help developing countries deal with climate change and decarbonise.\~\~ WHAT WILL AUSTRALIA OFFER?\~\~ Mr Morrison will go to COP26 with a new promise that Australia will achieve net zero emissions by 2050, apledge matching those offered by some other countries several years ago.\~\~ Australia's position is short of what international allies wanted - a much stronger formal commitment to cut emissions by 2030.\~\~ Mr Morrison will provide ""updated projections"" showingAustralia is on track for a 30 to 35 per cent reduction by the end of the decade.\~\~ That's below what the IPCC says the nations of the world must achieve - an overall45 per cent cut in order to keep warming to 1.5C.\~\~ Mr Morrison's plan to achieve net zero was released on Tuesday.It said Australia wouldcontinue exporting coal and gas ""through to 2050 and beyond"", for as long as demand continues.\~\~ Emissions will be reduced through a focus on clean hydrogen and a $20 billion investment in low-emissions technologies to build a greener economy that willcreate 62,000 new regional jobs while saving existing industries.\~\~ Mr Morrison has ruled out new taxes and mandates, and the net zero commitment will not be enshrined in law.\~\~ The modelling that underpins emissions abatement strategies, including carbon capture and storage, has not yet been released.\~\~ Australia is the world?s largest coal exporter and second-largest gas exporter.\l"

Saudi Arabia and China are among countries reportedly accusing the UK and its allies of proposing goals and actions that go beyond the 2015 Paris Agreement.On Thursday (AEDT), US climate envoy John Kerry and his Chinese counterpart, Xie Zhenhua, HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/policy/energy-and-climate/us-china-spring-surprise-with-wide-ranging-climate-tie-up-20211111-p597wpunveiled a joint initiative to co-operate in all areas of tackling climate change, which might help shake up the negotiations.Energy Minister Angus Taylor rejected perceptions that Australia was among the big emitters resisting progress, after news reports suggested Canberra would feel pressure from a proposal that countries would have to set new 2030 emissions-cutting targets next year.""Australia is an active and constructive participant in the negotiations to ensure a positive outcome for COP26,"" he said.

But a final summit declaration that only encouraged countries to revisit their targets next year, rather than requiring them to do so, would anger the green movement.Greenpeace International chief Jennifer Morgan, for example, tweeted that a ""polite request"" was ""not good enough"", and would amount to ""an agreement that we'll all cross our fingers and hope for the best"".The talks were taking place in ""a spirit of co-operation and consensus"" but reaching a meaningful deal would be ""challenging"", Mr Sharma said.If Britain and the US are to prise poorer countries away from any blocking effort by Beijing, they will need to provide more money to help nations adapt to climate change, and to comply with reporting requirements on emissions cuts.""The scale of financial support is in the trillions [of dollars] for countries' needs across mitigation and adaptation,"" said E3G analyst Iskander Erzini Vernoit. ""The ability of developed countries to step up the financial offer will be key to getting other countries back to the table in a more committed sense.""Mr Sharma said he had ""asked developed countries to be flexible"" on questions of finance.

This is like suggesting that in response to COVID-19, doctors had said we must all be vaccinated by the end of 2022, and our governments agreed to that but had no requirements to get there. We would have been free to wander about saying we had a target and a long time to get there, with some desultory token action, wondering why things got worse.What the ""doctors"" say about the climate risk is that the targets for stopping emissions must be met in the next 10 years, starting with strong action now, or it's over - just can't get there. What a pity that the consequences of failure here cannot be seen in the same way as the impact of COVID-19.

"COP26","Australia","COP26_Australia45","COP26 agreed rules on trading carbon emissions - but they're fatally flawed","December 17, 2021 Friday 4:50 PM EST","The Conversation - United Kingdom","One surprise from COP26 - the latest UN climate change conference in Glasgow - was an agreement between world leaders on a new set of rules for regulating carbon markets. This would allow countries to trade the right to emit greenhouse gases.Carbon trading is part of how countries intend to meet their obligations for reducing emissions under the Paris Agreement. Unfortunately, the manner in which countries agreed these rules may hobble the Agreement in its goal of averting catastrophic warming.Carbon markets were central to the design of the Paris Agreement's predecessor, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which created three different mechanisms for trading carbon. Developing countries had become accustomed to attracting investment via one called the ""Clean Development Mechanism"" (CDM) which allowed industrialised countries to invest in projects to reduce emissions in developing countries and count them against their own targets under the Kyoto Protocol. Many industrialised countries wanted to retain this sort of flexibility in how they met their own treaty obligations.As a result, most governments were keen to keep carbon markets as part of the Paris Agreement. In Paris in 2015, the bare bones of mechanisms similar to those in the Kyoto Protocol were agreed, but without the details needed to put them into practice.Why then did it take six years to agree the rules which would govern these markets? This was more than the four years it took countries to do the same in the Kyoto Protocol and, in effect, they were recreating the same mechanisms. The problems in reaching an agreement this time were three-fold, and they weren't satisfactorily resolved in Glasgow.Going backwards from KyotoVarious states, and many environmental campaign groups, suspect that carbon markets weaken the overall effort to reduce emissions. As climate change has accelerated over the past decade these concerns have become more acute. Why trade emissions if everyone is trying to get them to zero? There is HYPERLINK https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/abdae9/metaconsiderable evidence HYPERLINK 85% of projects funded by the CDM hadn't reduced emissions. There are also fundamental design issues in the Paris Agreement that make setting up carbon markets under it much more difficult. The Kyoto Protocol expressed the obligations of industrialised states to reduce their emissions as targets. These could be translated into a fixed number of emissions allowances that provided carbon markets with a clear set of accounting rules and indicators of market demand.No such set of rules exists in the Paris Agreement. Instead, all states submit their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) - national plans for reducing emissions. They may or may not have an emissions target and they vary in how they account for emissions or which sources of emissions they include in their plans. How can a market function if there is no clear way of measuring what is being traded? And how should a country trading with another adjust its own NDC to avoid double-counting, when the design of each country's NDC varies so much?And what should countries do with all the credits created in the Kyoto Protocol's system? Should they just be rolled over to be used in the new markets? Should they be simply abandoned? Or is there some way of allowing them in but controlling their use? A lot of CDM credits in particular remain, and they could flood the new markets and undermine the integrity of the NDCs.A cop outIn the first week of COP26, it looked like these issues would continue to dog the negotiations. India supported unrestricted use of CDM credits in the new mechanism while the Solomon Islands (representing the Least Developed Countries group) opposed using them at all. In week two, these issues were either fudged or hastily agreed. The HYPERLINK https://www.ieta.org/page-18192/12124951carbon traders were happyCOP26The Glasgow decisions on both Article HYPERLINK 6.2 and HYPERLINK 6.4 of the Paris Agreement are extraordinarily unclear compared with the equivalent ones for the Kyoto Protocol. Specialists in this field are still decoding precisely what they mean in practical terms. It's likely that states will be able to use this opacity to double-count and claim credit for the same emissions-reducing activities.Countries are supposed to set new NDCs regularly. At the same time, countries will be negotiating individual emission trades. The possibility for a country to game its NDC - making it appear more ambitious than it really is by counting already agreed trades within them - is impossible to avoid. It's hard to see how this doesn't fundamentally weaken the ambition of countries when updating their NDCs.Monitoring how these mechanisms work in practice and whether they have the desired effect will be important over the coming years. While heralded at the time as a breakthrough in implementing significant tracts of the Paris Agreement, the Glasgow pact on carbon markets might instead be remembered as its undoing.Don't have time to read about climate change as much as you'd like?Get a weekly roundup in your inbox instead.

It also calls on the world to ""accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels"".Removing those references would render the Glasgow summit a disaster, particularly given the chapter was already criticised for being too weak.""That gives you a sense that there is not yet, at this conference, a consensus that we need to collectively ramp up our ambition,"" said Archie Young, the COP26 lead negotiator.Concerns about countries, including China, watering down the final language come only a day after the industrial giant surprised the summit by agreeing to a set of actions with rival US to counter climate change.The nations pushing for the deletion, known as the Like-Minded Developing Countries, argue the chapter is unfair to poor countries. Bolivia's chief negotiator and the LMDC's spokesperson, Diego Pacheco, accused rich nations of trying to ""transfer"" responsibility for historic pollution to those with less responsibility.""History matters and history is very important to understand and to put in the context of the discussion on ambition,"" Pacheco said.Asked whether a summit declaration that did not explicitly commit to phasing out fossil fuels was meaningless, COP26 President Alok Sharma told reporters to ""wait and see"" what the updated document looks like when released on Friday morning, local time.Sharma warned the summit was entering its final day with a huge gulf between countries on key issues such as how much financial support the developed world should offer developing nations to deal with climate change.""There is still a lot more work to be done and COP26 is scheduled to close at the end of tomorrow. So time is running out."" So far, the talks have not come close to achieving any of the United Nations' key priorities of cutting carbon emissions by about half by 2030 to limit temperature rises to 1.5 degrees.

The UK's presidency of the 26th UN climate change summit yielded mixed results, from the first mention of fossil fuels in a UN climate declaration and an agreement on rules for trading emissions credits internationally, to the blocking of a funding facility which would compensate developing countries for loss and damage caused by climate change.While delegates have left Glasgow, the UK's responsibilities as COP president are far from over. Before handing over to Egypt for COP27 in November 2022, a series of high-level decisions are needed to ensure the UK keeps the electric vehicle pedal held firmly to the floor.I'm a scientist on the Climate Change Committee - independent advisers to the UK government on net zero policy. We advised the UK to bolster its domestic targets and policies for reducing emissions to set an example going into COP26. This included a recommendation in December 2020 to revise the UK's nationally determined contribution (or NDC) to emissions reductions by 2030.Now we've published HYPERLINK https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/cop26-key-outcomes-and-next-steps-for-the-uk/further advice on what the UK government must do over the coming year to ensure that momentum from COP26 is not lost. This includes working with other nations on a number of fronts from improving flows of financial aid to developing countries, strengthening commitments to cut emissions by 2030 and building international cooperation on compensation for loss and damage.Glasgow to Sharm El-SheikhOne thing the UK hosts did well at COP26 was to HYPERLINK https://www.carbonbrief.org/guest-post-how-cop26-finally-recognised-the-latest-ipcc-climate-scienceacknowledge the stark reality of the latest climate science. While COP26 affirmed the importance of keeping the target of limiting global warming to 1.5\'b0C alive, current policies mean the world is set to pass it in the next decade, reaching 2.7\'b0C by the end of the century.To move the dial, the UK must pressure G20 nations to set stronger commitments in 2022 to cut emissions by 2030, and develop policies which could deliver them. The country's HYPERLINK own pledge is to cut emissions by 68% on 1990 levels by 2030. This is already about as ambitious as the Committee on Climate Change thinks it can realistically be while remaining credible. But it can be strengthened in other ways. For instance, this NDC could be made legally-binding. The government could also rule out meeting its target with the use of offsets, like promises to plant trees elsewhere to compensate for keeping oil and gas fields open. It could count contributions from actually reducing emissions, and removing CO? from the atmosphere with trees or carbon capture and storage technology, separately. The NDC could also include targets for individual sectors of the economy, using the government's own HYPERLINK https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/net-zero-strategynet zero strategy.Rich countries should look beyond cutting emissions domestically to consider targets for reducing emissions from the goods and services they import. In the UK, these consumption emissions are larger and falling slower than emissions generated domestically. Quantifiable targets for adapting to the effects of climate change within the country would also be useful.The UK could put half of its climate finance contributions to developing countries towards projects which help countries adapt - something which has been HYPERLINK neglected for too longThe government can also accelerate its own cuts to emissions by phasing out the ""inefficient fossil fuel subsidies"" mentioned in the Glasgow Climate Pact text. By maintaining a low price for carbon in the UK's emissions trading scheme, the government is effectively subsidising the continued burning of fossil fuels. No fossil fuel subsidy should be considered efficient and therefore worth keeping.Boris Johnson's administration could HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/skills-shortage-could-undo-uk-governments-net-zero-plans-170806boost skills trainingIt could also supplement its current plans by helping people make changes to their diets, implementing measures to reduce aviation demand by improving rail travel, for instance, and axing road building projects that are not compatible with net zero emissions. Independent, evidence-based committees like ours can track the delivery of commitments by governments and report on their policies and progress. We recently launched the International Climate Councils Network to coordinate action worldwide. We hope this can help build strong and enduring international partnerships that tell governments what they need to do and how to do it.Piers Forster receives funding from UK and EU research councils.

""Global warming is not a problem that will be fixed with the tools that caused it,"" he tells SmartCompany. Ilea Buffier, director of Evalua8 Sustainability, a tech company that helps businesses reduce their carbon footprint, says she didn't have huge expectations from the conference. However she remains ""eternally optimistic"", pointing out some considerable wins that came from the event. For example, the international financial standards board set up an international sustainability standards board, which will bring in financial-style accounting standards to carbon accounting. That will bring greater accountability and stronger benchmarks, meaning businesses can no longer get away with 'greenwashing', or claiming to be more environmentally sound than they actually are. It also means larger businesses will have to report on the HYPERLINK https://www.smartcompany.com.au/sustainability/three-ways-businesses-sustainable-beyond-net-zero/credentials of their SME suppliers, putting pressure on small businesses to clean up their own act, and meaning those already doing their bit will be more likely to secure contracts. ""That's really going to filter down and affect everybody, including small businesses,"" Buffier says. But perhaps more importantly, COP26 brought the conversation about climate change to the front pages of the papers and to the forefront of everyone's minds. ""When world leaders come together to discuss an issue, everyone is compelled to listen,"" Cicada Innovations chief executive Sally-Ann Williams tells SmartCompany. It got individuals and business owners thinking about what their role is in tackling climate change, she adds. That is momentum we can build upon to continue to influence politicians and large carbon-emitting companies. ""We just need governments to follow suit,"" Heuzenroeder says. The role of startups and SMEs In many ways, for the tech companies and SMEs that have been working on tackling climate change, much of what happened at COP26 doesn't change a thing. Heuzenroeder says it's not the government that will move the needle here, but small businesses and the consumers that use their purchasing power to back those doing the right thing. [related-story id=""220903""] On a practical level, SMEs are more adaptable to change than larger organisations, and it's much easier for them to conduct a CO2 audit or offset their carbon footprint. ""Reaching net-zero is a relatively simple process for them to undertake."" As Buffier points out, businesses also have their own consumer power. They can take climate impact into account when choosing their own suppliers, big or small, opting for green energy providers for example. Williams notes that many businesses have been doing their bit in one way or another since way before this conference, and they will continue to. SMEs are collectively the biggest employers in Australia. They may not have the individual power of larger corporations, but together they have some clout. The tech and business communities are super-conscious of their role and their influence in shaping the future, ""despite the government's ambivalence,"" Williams says. Equally, neither business owners nor individuals need the permission of a bunch of pollies in Glasgow to act, she adds. ""The question is will we choose to do so? We don't need permission, just conviction.""\l"

I've attended many United Nations climate change conferences, but this fortnight felt different. The feeling of momentum was palpable. Countries that in past years fought tooth-and-nail against stronger action stepped up with new commitments. Many of them joined an array of new partnerships and alliances struck in the first week. As I write, negotiators are locked in tense talks to try and land the final COP26 agreement. But whether the summit succeeds or fails doesn't depend solely on the decisions reached this week. From the outset, COP26 was seen not as an end point, but a kickstart to a decade of truly transformative action. Only in coming years will we know if the event was a real game-changer for the planet, or just empty promises and spin.: a journey, not a destinationThe UK government, as the conference hosts, knew early on that most countries would bring new climate ambition - known in COP-speak as ""nationally determined contributions"". But it also knew these pledges would never be be enough. For COP26First were a series of side deals to kick things along. These came in the form of a new global pledge to reduce emissions of methane - a highly potent greenhouse gas - as well as deals on coal phase-out, deforestation, climate finance and more.Second, countries would have to further ratchet up their commitments in coming years. That means the final negotiated outcome of , due on Friday Glasgow time, must require nations to make immediate further increases in emission-reduction ambition. As I write, that outcome is uncertain at best. HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Overarching_decision_1-CMA-3.pdffirst draft of the final agreement urges countries that didn't bring a new and stronger 2030 target to Glasgow - such as Australia - to do so within a year.Read more: Take heart at what's unfolded at COP26 in Glasgow - the world can still hold global heating to 1.5?Perhaps unsurprisingly, Australia is among a group of nations working to have that part of the text softened, or removed from the final agreement entirely. That is a worrying sign, though there will be many other countries fighting hard to ensure it stays in.Negotiators have spent countless hours arguing over the minutiae of the final text, and there's still a way to go yet. But if the final agreement is too weak, the 1.5? goal is at serious risk.The draft wording is weaker than that sought by a group of 50 of the world's most climate-vulnerable countries, HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/the-fate-of-our-planet-depends-on-the-next-few-days-of-complex-diplomacy-in-glasgow-heres-what-needs-to-go-right-171501which want national commitments to be reviewed and strengthened each year between now and 2025. However, the wording is still stronger than many observers anticipated.And while COP26Australia outdid itselfBeing an Australian at international climate talks is rarely a comfortable experience. Australia long ago cemented its reputation as a drag on global climate cooperation - known for its weak targets, obstructive approach and demands for special treatment. However, even seasoned observers have been taken aback by Australia's actions before and during COP26Australia went to Glasgow as just about the only developed country without a new and significantly stronger 2030 emissions reduction target.The Morrison government then proceeded to use the Australia pavilion inside the COP venue to promote the interests of fossil fuel companies such as Santos.Australia also refused to sign up to two signature deals at COP26 - the global pledge to cut methane emissions, and one to HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/end-of-coal-in-sight-at-cop26/phase out coal-fired power.

This time, signatories included big coal-using nations such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Poland, the Ukraine and South Korea.One energy-related announcement in Glasgow was particularly important for Australia. Japan and South Korea, the second and third biggest buyers of Australian liquified natural gas (LNG) both signalled their desire to HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/korea-japan-signal-rush-to-exit-lng-but-woodside-boss-still-upbeat-20211109-p5974fshift to hydrogen and renewables.This development, among others, makes one thing abundantly clear: the world is moving fast while Australia stands still. Sooner rather than later, Australia will feel the cost of its inaction - not just in the hit to our international reputation, but in foregone economic opportunities in the clean industries of the future.'Try harder. Try harder'International climate talks can feel far removed from the urgent reality of the climate crisis. But at every COP, someone invariably manages to cut through the noise with a brutally honest and rousing contribution.This year it was Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley, who at the outset of the conference HYPERLINK https://www.news18.com/news/buzz/barbados-pm-mia-mottley-climate-change-speech-glasgow-cop26-biden-modi-johnson-4402184.htmlexcoriated leaders for failing on the promises of the Paris Agreement.Mottley's commanding eight-minute speech was a show-stopping moment.

The company had pledged to be net zero by 2030. ""Now I'm making my company, if you like, the one out the front, with the arrows in the back. People like you can shoot them,"" he said.Last Sunday, Dr Forrest announced Fortescue Future Industries would build a $1 billion electrolyser factory in Gladstone for hydrogen projects in Australia and for exports, with a $114 million commitment for the first phase.Dr Forrest was also by the side of NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet and Energy Minister Matt Kean on Wednesday to announce the government's $3 billion hydrogen strategy, including financial incentives for companies, which he says might tempt Fortescue Future Industries to build a green hydrogen plant in the state.The Fortescue boss said ""blue hydrogen"" projects - powered by coal or gas - might still be hydrogen, ""but it's got carbon all through it"".""Like clean coal or cancer-free cigarettes, these are misleading sound bites by industries wanting to keep their social licence to operate,"" he said.

All 197 participating countries adopted the so-called Glasgow Climate Pact, despite an 11th hour intervention by India in which the final agreement was watered down from ""phasing out"" coal to ""phasing down"". In an emotional final speech, COP26 president Alok Sharma apologised for this last-minute change. His apology goes to the heart of the goals of COP26 in Glasgow: the hope it would deliver outcomes matching the urgent ""code red"" action needed to achieve the Paris Agreement target. HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/news/un-secretary-general-cop26-must-keep-15-degrees-celsius-goal-aliveurged countries to ""keep the goal of 1.5? alive"", to accelerate the decarbonisation of the global economy, and to phase out coal. So, was COP26 HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/cop26-goals/stated goals, the answer is yes, it fell short. Two big ticket items weren't realised: renewing targets for 2030 that align with limiting warming to 1.5?, and an agreement on accelerating the phase-out of coal. But among the failures, there were important decisions and notable bright spots. So let's take a look at the summit's defining issues. Weak 2030 targetsThe goal of the Paris Agreement is to limit global temperature rise to well below 2? this century, and to pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5?. Catastrophic impacts will be unleashed beyond this point, such as sea level rise and more intense and frequent natural disasters. But HYPERLINK https://climateactiontracker.org/publications/glasgows-2030-credibility-gap-net-zeros-lip-service-to-climate-action/new projections from Climate Action Tracker show even if all COP26 pledges are met, the planet is on track to warm by 2.1? - or 2.4? if only 2030 targets are met. Read more: COP26 HYPERLINK announcements, this nation's 2030 target HYPERLINK https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/NDCStaging/Pages/All.aspx.remains the same as in 2015. If all countries HYPERLINK https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/australia/targets/adopted such meagre near-term targets, global temperature rise would be on track for up to 3?. Technically, the 1.5? limit is still within reach because, under the Glasgow pact, countries are asked to update their 2030 targets in a year's time. However, as Sharma said, ""the pulse of 1.5 is weak"". And as Australia's experience shows, domestic politics rather than international pressure is often the force driving climate policy. So there are no guarantees Australia or other nations will deliver greater ambition in 2022. Phase down, not outIndia's intervention to change the final wording to ""phase down"" coal rather than ""phase out"" dampens the urgency to shift away from coal.India is the world's HYPERLINK https://www.carbonbrief.org/the-carbon-brief-profile-indiathird-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, after China and the United States. The country relies heavily on coal, and coal-powered generation is expected to HYPERLINK https://www.iea.org/reports/coal-2019grow by 4.6% each year to 2024.

Carbon capture and storage is a controversial proposition for climate action. It is not proven at scale, and https://bv.fapesp.br/en/publicacao/157440/an-assessment-of-ccs-costs-barriers-and-potential/we don't yet know if captured emissions stored underground will eventually return to the atmosphere. And around the world, HYPERLINK https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01175-7relatively few large-scale underground storage locations exist. And it's hard to see this expensive technology ever being cost-competitive with HYPERLINK https://blog.csiro.au/2020-gencostcheap renewable energy.In a crucial outcome, COP26 also finalised rules for global carbon trading, known as Article 6 under the Paris Agreement. However under the rules, the fossil fuel industry HYPERLINK will be allowed to ""offset"" its carbon emissions and carry on polluting. Combined with the ""phasing down"" change, this will see fossil fuel emissions continue.It wasn't all badDespite the shortcomings, COP26 led to a number of important positive outcomes. HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma3_auv_2_cover%20decision.pdf45% by 2030, relative to 2010 levels.What's more, Article 21 of the Glasgow Climate Pact nature and ecosystems, including protecting forests and biodiversity. This comes on top of a side deal struck by Australia and 123 other countries promising to end deforestation by 2030.The pact also urges countries to fully deliver on an outstanding promise to deliver US$100 billion per year for five years to developing countries vulnerable to climate damage. It also HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2021_L16_adv.pdfemphasises the importance HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/enhanced-transparency-framework#eq-9of transparency in implementing the pledges.

As two major powers in the world, China and the US shoulders special international responsibilities and obligations.""We need to think big and feel responsible. We need to work hard to promote world peace and development. We need to actively address climate change through cooperation, bringing benefits to both our two peoples and peoples around the world.""The announcement is a huge boost to the United Nations talks and is a sharp contrast to US President Joe Biden's blunt criticism of China over climate change only last week.Xie said Beijing and Washington would work together on emissions reductions, and share technology and expertise on clean energy, decarbonisation and electrification to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.The climate envoy described climate change as an ""existential crisis"" and said agreement between the US and China on how to deal with global warming far outweighed their differences on the issue. Biden's own climate envoy, former Secretary of State John Kerry, framed the surprise agreement as a major milestone which would give the COP26 talks much-needed momentum.""The two largest economies in the world have agreed to work together to raise climate ambition in this decisive decade,"" Kerry told reporters in Glasgow.""Our teams have worked together for months, and we have worked in good faith. We have found common ground.""Kerry described the joint-declaration was a ""roadmap for our present and future collaboration"" on climate change.""It declares specifically and identifies the need to accelerate the transition to a global net-zero economy,"" Kerry said.""Secondly, it commits to a series of important actions, not out in the long-term but now, in this decade where it's needed.""Releasing the joint declaration, Xie said the statement was the result of the ""spirit and instructions of our two presidents"" and the product 30 virtual meetings between teams of Chinese and American officials, as well as meetings in Shanghai, London and Washington, before finally reaching an agreement in Glasgow on Wednesday afternoon local-time.""To ensure a successful COP26 and to facilitate an outcome that is both ambitious and balanced, we will stick to the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and take into consideration the respective national circumstances,"" he said.""We have reached a consensus regarding either the Paris framework and also the Paris temperature control goals as well as climate finance. We are committed to work jointly and with other parties, facilitating the finalisation of Paris Agreement rulebook in order to build global carbon markets also and also enhance transparency.""He added that China and America had reached consensus over 2030 targets, Paris climate control goals and the contentious area of finance for developing nations.He noted that the US states had developed a plan to reduce methane emissions and said the China will follow suit.

"COP26","Australia","COP26_Australia61","Third COP26 draft agreement ensures rich nations deliver on climate promises","November 13, 2021 Saturday","ABC Premium News (Australia)","The latest draft of the COP26 UN climate talks features a proposal to make sure rich countries deliver climate finance to the world's poorest nations in future years, after past promises remain unfulfilled.The new draft agreement also maintained a core demand for countries to set more ambitious plans to tackle global warming and asked them to phase out inefficient subsidies for the fossil fuels heating the planet.Rich nations, whose emissions are responsible for the majority of human-caused climate change, failed to meet a long-held promise to deliver US$100 billion (A$137bn) a year by 2020 to support poorer countries' efforts to cope with the effects of global warming.That has cast a shadow over the summit, making other negotiations on carbon markets and strengthening climate targets harder to unblock, with some poorer nations saying they cannot cut emissions faster unless they get more financial help.The draft proposal, one of many drawn up by Britain to be published at the end of COP26, asks a UN committee to report next year on progress towards delivering the $100 billion, and proposes government ministers meet in 2022, 2024 and 2026 to discuss climate finance.The regular check-ins would attempt to keep up pressure on rich countries to fulfil promises to mobilise the cash. The British proposal also asks countries to increase their contributions to deliver the $100 billion.Rich countries expect to deliver the US$100 billion in 2023, although some have suggested it could be met next year.A second draft document published on Saturday morning local time would kick off talks among countries to set a post-2025 target on climate finance.The US$100 billion target should be delivered each year from 2020 to 2025, after which a new one is supposed to kick in.The second proposal asks countries, civil society groups and the private sector to weigh in next year on the new goal, and would launch a work programme to develop the post-2025 target, led by a developed country and a developing country, from 2022-2024.African countries have said the new goal should reach US$1.3 trillion (A$1.7tn) by 2030 to reflect the spiralling costs of worsening droughts, floods and other climate-related disasters in the world's poorest nations. That is aside from potential economic losses from crop failure or climate-related disasters.ABC/Reuters\l"

Australia will be strongly represented at the conference, no matter by which senior Australian representative,"" she told ABC Radio.""One thing we are absolutely committed to is setting out our long-term emissions reduction plan prior to the COP and that is what we are focused on as a government.""This is true, but the importance of to the world, and to Australia's key allies cannot be overstated.The talks are seen as the last chance for the world to come to an agreement on emission reductions that may put it on track to hold warming to 1.5 degrees, after which scientists fear tipping points may be triggered that could lead to the climate spiralling out of control.At present about 100 world leaders are expected to attend the talks, and the schedule has been structured specifically to make it easier for leaders of major economies to do so.COP26 co-hosts Italy have scheduled G20 talks to be held in Rome on October 30 and 31 specifically so that leaders can fly directly to Glasgow for the start of the conference.In Glasgow, the British government is hosting leaders' meetings on November 1 and 2 to bookend the Rome talks.Britain and the United States, Australia's allies in the new AUKUS security pact, have both made it clear that they consider success at COP26 to be a top priority.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson used his address to the United Nations General Assembly last week to urge world leaders to make it a success.""In just 40 days' time, we need the world to come to Glasgow to make the commitments [to keep warming to 1.5 degrees],"" he said.He has personally invited Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian leader Vladimir Putin to attend.COP meetings - the acronym stands for Conference of Parties, referring to signatories of the UN's climate treaty - are held annually and are not normally attended by the majority of world leaders.But leaders do normally attend those meetings at which key negotiations over national emissions targets are to take place.Former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd attended talks in Bali in 2007 to recommit Australia to the Kyoto Protocol and the Copenhagen summit in December 2009 where a new level of global ambition was agreed upon.Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull travelled to France in 2015 to commit Australia to a climate treaty that became the Paris Agreement and to lock in Australia's goal of reductions fo 26 to 28 per cent of emissions.The Morning Edition newsletter is our guide to the day's most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights.

It is also not yet known if the leaders of a handful of other high-emitting nations, including Russian leader Vladimir Putin, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi or Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro will attend the conference, which typically attracts over 20,000 dignitaries, diplomats, negotiators, scientists and activists.In his final major speech before the talks begin, the incoming COP president, UK cabinet minister Alok Sharma, appealed directly to world leaders to attend.""COP26 is not a photo op, nor a talking shop,"" he said on Tuesday.""It must be the forum where we put the world on track to deliver on climate and that is down to leaders.

To ensure they have a presence, some Pacific island nations will be represented by a delegation of five Political Climate Champions, who include Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown, Fiji's Deputy Prime Minister Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum and Tuvalu's Minister for Finance and Climate Change Seve Paeniu.

Negotiation can be viewed as ""back-and-forth communication designed to reach an agreement when you and the other side have some interests that are shared and others that are opposed"". Although we negotiate every day, doing so successfully is often challenging because the context is always different: what you stand to gain or lose, the people involved and their chosen tactics will all differ from one situation to another.Multi-lateral negotiations which involve a large and diverse group of countries - especially those covering such complex issues as - are particularly challenging. Psychological factors must be taken into account for this type of negotiating scenario, where the outcome is so important to the future of the entire global community.Previously, negotiation research has mainly focused on HYPERLINK https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001985011730130X?via%3Dihubstrategies and tacticsOne HYPERLINK https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103119304524recent study showed how a co-operative tone of conversation increases the chance of a favourable deal and improve relationships. It does not have to be a choice between maximising your own success or having a satisfied opponent. A conversational strategy can help negotiators achieve both.Managing emotions is also key to negotiation tactics. Anger HYPERLINK https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749597897927059can often harm negotiations HYPERLINK zero-sum bias, where some parties see negotiations in purely competitive rather than co-operative terms. This way of thinking causes people to believe that for one person to gain something, someone else must lose something equivalent, which can lead to an antagonistic negotiation.Successful negotiators usually recognise the importance of psychological factors, and are able to tailor their tactics to the various obstacles. It is crucial to build rapport with other parties, and establish more co-operative approaches so that both sides can achieve a win-win solution. This is borne out through long-term relationships rather than one-off wins, as most negotiations occur within ongoing relationships. The challenge of COP26 negotiationsThere are HYPERLINK https://sdgacademy.org/several obstacles that make international negotiations on climate change extremely challenging - but there are still clear reasons to play the game. Although climate action is a long-term process - and we are unlikely to see improvements for decades - global leaders know that short-term inaction, while easier, may be a very costly gamble. This is delayed gratification - resisting the temptation of a smaller but more immediate pleasure to obtain a larger, valuable and long-lasting reward later on. A series of HYPERLINK classical studies revealed that overcoming such resistance is far from easy for most people. There will always be the temptation to give up on climate action, given the enormous uncertainties of the associated costs and gains, and the huge challenges involved.Other issues also influence the tactics of the negotiators from each nation.

Developing nations may claim that climate change was ""caused"" by rich developed nations and so the onus is on them to find a solution.Some countries, especially small island states, are particularly vulnerable to climate change and quite reasonably fear that they will disappear under rising oceans in just a few decades. Other countries face severe and repeated droughts, while tropical areas suffer unprecedented rainfalls. In parallel, countries sitting on large reserves of fossil fuels claim the right to use and profit from their own resources, but others argue for an equal share of atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions or simply insist on renewable alternatives.These multiple asymmetries can lead to very HYPERLINK https://www.tandfonl"

Because if we don't really take the decisions that are vital now, it's going to be almost impossible to catch up"".Britain's COP26 minister Alok Sharma last week said more than 100 leaders had confirmed they would attend, but Mr Morrison joins Chinese President Xi Jinping as an unconfirmed starter.Prince Charles worried, though, that the leaders who did go to COP26 would ""just talk"", when ""the problem is to get action on the ground"".The government is planning to deploy the royal family en masse at COP26, including not only Prince Charles - with his decades-long track record of environmental activism - but also the Queen, and Prince William and his wife the Duchess of Cambridge.The Queen will attend a diplomatic reception, while the two princes will address the gathering and hold personal meetings with world leaders.Speaking from his arboretum, Prince Charles used the interview to reveal his personal commitment to the cause, saying he now ran his 51-year-old Aston Martin on ""surplus white wine and converted whey from the cheese-making process"".He also said he refrained from eating meat and fish two days a week, and dairy once a week, lambasting the ""endless perverse subsidy regimes"" for intensive agriculture.Asked whether he would get on planes less often, he said he hoped ""flying will become easier and more sustainable, rapidly"".Prince Charles revealed strong sympathy with the frustration of activists like Greta Thunberg and Extinction Rebellion.""These young [people] feel nothing is ever happening, so of course they're going to get frustrated. I totally understand because nobody would listen, and they see their future being totally destroyed,"" he said.But he urged protesters not to ""do it in a way that alienates people"".""I totally understand the frustration; the difficulty is how do you direct that frustration in a way that is more constructive than disruptive. The point is that people should notice how despairing young people really are.""He praised the business community for running ahead of government on the energy transition, but said public support was needed to ""unlock the vast amount of money and investment opportunity"" from the private sector.Prince Charles said it was gratifying but not satisfying to now find himself on the right side of the green argument, after many years of satire.""Having been rubbished and ridiculed for so long, they suddenly want me to help them,"" he said.

"COP26","Australia","COP26_Australia67","Failure of G20 bodes ill for COP26 conference","November 9, 2021 Tuesday","The Weekend Advertiser","Ray's reasoning As I write this, the COP26 climate conference is not yet over. I will save my commentary until it concludes, but my early misgivings about it succeeding to save the world from climate catastrophe were not allayed by the recent G20 meeting in Rome, which was billed as being about the world's climate and health.Though it did offer some meagre help to the global south in the form of increased COVID19 vaccine supplies, it failed to agree on climate goals. As many of us had hoped it would be the harbinger of pre-Glasgow good news, its failure will be my topic this week.The G20 was planned to lay the groundwork ahead of the COP26 UN summit in Glasgow, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.However, the official statement released afterwards didn't even mention net zero by 2050. Nor was there any target set for phasing out coal. The ABC noted that this was a ""clear nod"" to big carbon polluters China and India.Even British PM Boris Johnson said the G20 meeting didn't bode well for COP26. He said that promises were ""starting to sound hollow"" and that the commitments were ""drops in a rapidly warming ocean"".To make the G20 outcome even gloomier, Prime Minister Scott Morrison used his final G20 remarks to defend our climate policy amid tense international scrutiny, the Guardian Australia said. His final remarks at the summit argued against the abolition of fossil fuels, for example, The Saturday Paper reported.He also pushed back against mandating action by other countries; the SMH noted, and stressed technology would solve climate change, comparing the mostly as-yet uninvented tech variously to smartphones, silicon chips, and COVID-19 vaccines. He rejected calls to set the date on ending coal-fired power stations.In more detail, the G20 summit wound up with a communique that did not include a firm commitment to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and had only a vague commitment to ""phasing out investment in new unabated coal power-generation capacity ... as soon as possible"". To our shame, Morrison pushed back at co-ordinated global efforts to phase out fossil fuels.In his final remarks at the G20, Morrison defended his government's climate policies in the face of sustained domestic and international criticism.While several G20 countries, including the US and UK, have pushed Australia to step up its ambition for 2030, Morrison told his peers: ""Australia has already reduced its emissions by more than 20 per cent on 2005 levels, which is more than most of the countries sitting around this table.""He said Australia was investing heavily in the development of new technologies ""to achieve the goals that our own modelling shows will move the dial and make a net zero economy achievable, not just in Australia, but in India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Brazil and South Africa"".Morrison also told his G20 peers that Australian investments in technology are focused on storage, sequestration, industrial processes and climate adaptation. He said many of the technologies existed now, but he acknowledged that some of the methods preferred by Australia in its net zero strategy were not yet in existence, the Guardian Australia reported.While experts say the transition to carbon neutrality requires not only technological solutions to lower emissions but also clear targets, policies and mechanisms that allow price signals facilitating efficient investment during the transition, Morrison declared in Rome that ""technology at cost and scale is the answer"".A number of countries, including Australia, resisted firm pledges to phase out coal. The draft communique only committed nations to ""phase out and rationalise"" fossil fuel subsidies by 2025 and curb coal power. But this was far less than hoped.Indeed, Morrison signalled that Australia would have a significant problem with communique language hastening the demise of the coal industry. China and India were also among the countries opposed to specific commitments.While the government's political mantra for its climate policies is ""technology not taxes"", its preferred approach to managing the transition is bankrolled by significant taxpayer-funded expenditure. How the media fails to use this to point out that the ""technology not taxes"" mantra is built on such a massive lie is quite beyond me. Let's hope the voting public wakes up before the next federal election.\l"

The amount of CO? produced when a given fuel is burned is largely a function of the elements it's comprised of. Natural gas is mostly carbon and hydrogen. This combination has a very high energy content relative to other fuels, and so, it produces relatively less CO? emissions for each unit of energy burning it generates. Impurities such as sulphur, which are common in coal, increase how much CO? is generated for each unit of heat. This means even the highest quality coal produces double the CO? emissions of natural gas per unit of energy.Energy demand is closely linked with productivity. As economies like China and India rapidly grow and develop, their energy demand is expected to HYPERLINK rise in tandem. But their ability to follow the UK in switching from coal to natural gas as a primary source of electricity generation is limited because they have comparatively less natural gas.

Here's what they had to say about the deals that were made. (This page will be updated as reactions come in.)Deals and targetsA starting point for future action.The Glasgow Climate Pact is not perfect, but still strengthens the Paris agreement in several ways. Acknowledging that there is no safe limit for global warming, the Pact resolves to limit global warming to 1.5\'b0C, instead of the Paris text of ""well below 2\'b0C"". Crucially it also delivers a strong framework for tracking commitments against real-world progress. The summit was pitched as the last chance to ""keep 1.5\'b0C alive"" - holding temperatures to less than 1.5\'b0C above their pre-industrial levels. 2020 was also supposed be the year when developed countries would provide at least US$100 billion a year of financial aid to help developing countries adapt to mounting storms and droughts - a pledge that still has not been met - and the transition to clean energy was supposed to start being rolled out.Perhaps concerned that national targets collectively were nowhere near good enough to keep 1.5\'b0C alive - we were heading for HYPERLINK more like 2.4\'b0C at best HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/claims-of-cop26s-success-have-been-unpicked-but-political-journalists-have-repeated-the-spin-171619press-friendly announcementsThese were further supplemented by the ""race to zero"" initiatives, a series of announcements by states, cities and businesses on a range of decarbonisation approaches.While these are genuine attempts at climate action, success hinges on whether these developments can swiftly make into raised national commitments within the next year.

Like Flannery, Kelly is long on doom and the default position of both and all in the global warming activists' camp is to demand that Western nations suspend the powerhouses of their economies - the coal and gas-fired plants - and inflict brutally high prices for unreliable solar and wind energy on their citizens.China, meanwhile, is building more coal-fired plants to power manufacturing, outsourced from the West because energy prices have made it too expensive, to build things in nations that have drunk the green Kool-Aid.Humans, whom the Extinction Rebellion mob would like to see become extinct, are responsible for about 0.0016 per cent.If anyone at COP26Australia gets thrashed by the ignoramuses, even though it not only meets but beats its targets without extra taxes or mandates.Not only was COP26 a flop like the previous 25 COPs, even the ""big"" story such as the soft US-China accord was not much more than a recycling of the Obama-Xi deal to ratify the Paris Agreement five years ago.But what the heck, COP27 will be held at Egypt's Sharm el-Sheikh resort next year, an altogether more pleasant place than Glasgow and COP28 is scheduled to take place in the UAE (not such a great place).

HYPERLINK https://www.oecd.org/trade/topics/export-credits/arrangement-and-sector-understandings/The arrangement for officially supported export credits came into existence in 1978, when a small number of OECD countries wanted to establish a framework that would create a level playing field, and encourage competition among exporters based on quality and prices of exported goods and services. As a result, limitations have been created on the financing terms and conditions when participants provide officially supported export credits or tied aid. Some of the rules of the arrangement are sector-specific but, generally speaking, the arrangement applies to all officially supported export credits with a repayment term of two years or more. It does not apply to military equipment or to agricultural commodities. Five years ago annex VI was introduced to the OECD arrangement, creating stricter terms and conditions for the officially supported export credits relating to coal-fired electricity generation projects. It intended to encourage both exporters and buyers to move towards high-efficiency technologies by placing a limit on credit support for coal-fired power plants.

That's a first, it's a start. But unfortunately it's now attached to weasel words,"" said Richie Merzian, a director at the Australia Institute and former COP negotiator.Both UN Secretary General Antonio Gueterres and Organisation for Economic Cooperation & Development Secretary General Mathias Cormann have used COP26 to call for the phase-out of all harmful subsidies to fossil fuel production and consumption.But US climate envoy John Kerry on Friday (Saturday AEDT) backed the new formulation.""It's unabated coal. We're not talking about all [coal], we're not talking about eliminating it. We're talking about the capacity for capture, if you can do it,"" he told the conference.Meanwhile, the demand that countries come to COP27 in Egypt next year with beefed-up commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions further by 2030 - an initiative of which Australia has reportedly been wary - was also diluted.In the first draft earlier this week, countries were ""urged"" to scale up their commitment next year; now, they are ""requested"" to do so.That winds back the lexicon to the standard Paris Agreement formulation, which the British government had earlier indicated was insufficient, and which Greenpeace International executive director Morgan described as little more than ""a polite request"".A Chinese official told the COP that countries should be allowed to ""decide on their own roadmap and timetable for their national policies and actions"".Clash of ambitionsThe negotiations were meant to wrap up at 6pm British time on Friday (5am Saturday AEDT), but will now spill over into the weekend as negotiators try to find a landing zone that satisfies all parties.Britain is trying to muscle up the agreement, looking to inspire confidence among business and civil society that governments are working at pace and with commitment. Its aim is to foment policies and actions that might keep global warming to below the potentially catastrophic threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius.A report from environmental monitors Carbon Action Tracker earlier this week suggested that countries' pre-COP26 policy settings would put the world on course for warming of 2.7C by 2100. The level of 2030 commitments on offer at the summit would reel that in only to 2.4C.The momentum appears to be shifting away from Britain's level of ambition, but environmental groups say they are still pressing to reverse that.""There's wording in here worth holding on to, and the UK Presidency needs to fight tooth and nail to keep the most ambitious elements in the deal,"" Ms Morgan said in a Greenpeace statement.""Negotiators in Glasgow simply have to seize the moment and agree something historic, but they need to isolate the governments who've come here to wreck progress.""The Saudi Arabian climate envoy told the conference floor on Friday (Saturday AEDT) that the Glasgow summit could reach ""a good outcome"" if the concluding document ""keeps faithful to the Paris Agreement"" - code for avoiding new text on fossil fuels or targets.But Norwegian climate and environment minister Espen Barth Eide told the conference that ""ambition must be the essence"".""We know that we have to act in the 2020s, otherwise adaptation will simply be way too costly for many of the nations assembled here,"" he said.In a positive intervention, Marshall Islands climate envoy Tina Stege told the conference that ""this is a text that takes us in the right direction"".Mr Merzian said there had been progress in the argy-bargy between rich and poor countries over finance to help the developing world cut emissions and adapt to climate change, which had threatened to derail agreement on the more political elements of the text.""It's looking good enough for now,"" he said, noting that the issue would be carried over to next year's COP in Egypt where it would be the top priority.The summit still appears to be short of a $US100 billion goal for annual support for mitigation measures, which has now become a more distant target. But funding has been unlocked for adaptation, and the issue of compensating vulnerable countries for climate-related loss and damage is on the table.\l"

While national governments and their negotiators remain willing to listen to the interests of fossil fuel lobbyists, the COP process will continue to be riddled with loopholes that will derail the achievement of real targets. Five big loopholes come to mind. 1. Subsidies and financeMuch has been made of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), a global coalition of financial institutions which aims to accelerate the decarbonisation of the economy. But many of its efforts will be undermined while governments continue to subsidise the fossil fuel industry.

Moreover GFANZ is voluntary, when we need commitments to be binding. It also includes banks who have recently provided https://www.ran.org/the-understory/the-net-zero-banking-alliances-40-billion-exxon-problem/US$575 billion (A$787 billion) in fossil fuel finance to some of the world's biggest polluters.Governments should not wait for future COPs to address this issue.

But the outcome of COP26 shows that the issue of who is responsible and who should pay for the consequences of climate change can no longer be ignored. However, even the annual climate funding that has been pledged doesn't include any money allocated for loss and damage.Who should pay?The idea of HYPERLINK https://direct.mit.edu/glep/article/16/4/111/14859/Framing-Climate-Change-Loss-and-Damage-in-UNFCCCpaying for loss and damage HYPERLINK https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/attribution scienceLoss and damage in GlasgowHeading into the Glasgow summit, delegates were mindful of the growing adaptation needs of developing countries.

Recent HYPERLINK http://www.climate-loss-damage.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LD_NDC_PB.pdfanalysis showed an increasing number were talking about loss and damage in their plans.

But much of this came from outside the negotiating rooms.The negotiators working on loss and damage conducted their talks late into the night to flesh out what the HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/santiago-networkSantiago Network - a new way of offering technical assistance to developing countries - should be doing to support countries in a practical way.

"COP26","Australia","COP26_Australia84","COP26 offers a glimmer of hope","November 15, 2021 Monday","Sydney Morning Herald (Australia)","It is easy to point out the holes in the deal struck in Glasgow on climate change, but the outcome offers at least a glimmer of hope and keeps the pressure on both political parties to revise Australia's weak emissions reduction targets for 2030.This first major meeting of heads of government on climate since the Paris Treaty in 2015 was always going to be a messy event. The 197 governments were distracted by the rivalry between China and the US and, of course, the global pandemic, which has caused huge economic and social damage, especially in the developing world.Pessimists can justifiably complain that political leaders copped out and produced a fairly empty deal that will not stop global temperatures rising more than 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. Scientists say if we miss that target the world will suffer a catastrophic increase in droughts, hurricanes, rising sea levels and the disappearance of the Great Barrier Reef.The meeting failed to generate enough cash for research into new emissions reduction technologies and aid to developing countries. After an 11th hour rebellion by China and India, the final declaration calls for the ""phasing down"" rather than the ""phasing out"" of coal. The fossil fuel industry has been given wiggle room to argue, as Australia's Nationals do, that it still has a long-term future.The big disappointment is that many important countries, including Australia, have resisted calls to dramatically strengthen their emissions reduction targets for 2030. The Morrison government refused to increase the commitment Tony Abbott made in Paris of a cut of 26 to 28 per cent in emissions below 2005 levels, although it said it projected a cut of 35 per cent. Even that projection is weaker than other developed countries or the combined pledges of Australian state governments. Global environmental groups singled Australia out as a laggard, or ""colossal fossil"".Yet for all its faults, the COP26 deal was important. After action on climate change went backwards in the Trump era, the meeting has decisively shifted political momentum in the right direction. President Joe Biden has championed the cause of climate change and, while China's Xi Jinping did not attend COP, China issued a joint statement with the US in support of stronger action. India signed up for net zero, albeit only by 2070. The language on coal is weak but it is still the first time countries have accepted it is on the way out. There has also been a sea change in the attitude of business, which is now leading rather than delaying emissions reduction.One crucial aspect of the final declaration urges countries to update their 2030 pledges at the ministerial meeting in Cairo next November, rather than waiting five years as envisaged under the Paris Treaty. This keeps the pressure on Australia, which came to Glasgow empty-handed except for some talk of the Australian Way (through unspecified technology) and its pledge of net zero by 2050.Both major political parties now must decide whether it is in Australia's long-term interests to persist with our weak 2030 target. When he finally announces Labor's climate change policy for the next federal election, Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese faces a huge call on whether to go further than Prime Minister Scott Morrison. If the ALP takes a more ambitious approach to cutting emissions the campaign could become a repeat of the climate wars of the past decade. The ALP might lose coal seats in Queensland, while if the Coalition tries to wedge the ALP too hard it could lose seats in Sydney and Melbourne, with their strong environmental votes.Australian politics has been stuck in this dead-end for a decade but COP26 has made it clear that the diplomatic cost of our inaction is rising.

This is not a call to unilaterally end coal production but rightly recognises that decarbonisation must be balanced with the needs of many developing nations for affordable and reliable power.""Net zero emissions does not mean no emissions. In addition to meeting Asian demand for high-quality thermal coal, we will continue our investment in the Low Emissions Technology Australia [LETA] fund to progress carbon capture and storage technology, to ensure where coal is required in a carbon-constrained world it can be used with minimal greenhouse gas emissions.""Yancoal chief David Moult said there was no change to his belief that demand for coal would remain robust in the decades ahead.""For several years now, Yancoal has openly acknowledged that a change in the global energy mix is inevitable as the world transitions towards a lower carbon economy, and that resource companies must work to mitigate and manage climate change impacts.The recent COP26""Despite the anticipated increase in the proportion of renewables and other non-fossil-fuel energy sources in the global energy mix, which Yancoal supports, the reality is that the demand for both thermal coal and metallurgical coal will remain relatively robust over the next few decades.""We believe the Australian coal mining industry has a key role to play in the energy transition by continuing to supply high-quality coal, which has a lower emissions profile than other exporting countries and which ensures that our customers are able to provide affordable, reliable and modern energy.""This will be partly underpinned by the ongoing demand generated from high efficiency, low emissions power plants across Asia.""New Hope chief executive Reinhold Schmidt said his business would respond to the demands of customers, who in recent months have paid record prices for Australian thermal coal.""The outcomes of COP26 confirm our assessment that there will be an energy transition which will take some decades to play out. There will be an ongoing demand for thermal coal, particularly in Asia, which demand can be met by the high-quality, low-emission coals that we produce,"" he said.""We are a business that responds to market needs and our stakeholders.""Australian Conservation Foundation spokesman Gavan McFadzean said Australia's stance on climate change was becoming increasingly distanced from the nation's closest allies such as Britain and the United States.""Australia has once again been part of the problem, not the solution.

We should be leading from the front, not lagging from the very back.""The reference to phasing down ""unabated"" coal-fired power leaves open potential for coal-fired generators to continue operating with abatement measures in the event such measures become financially viable in future.Carbon capture and storage has to date proven financially unattractive when attached to coal-fired power stations at locations such as NRG Energy's WA Parish Power Station in the United States, but the coal industry continues to fund further research and development, including into whether the low-emissions Allam cycle can be converted from gas to coal.""Abatement pathways include retiring inefficient plants, co-firing low-carbon fuels such as ammonia or hydrogen and retrofitting CCS,"" said Prakash Sharma from resources industry intelligence firm Wood Mackenzie.Whitehaven hopes to produce higher volumes of semi-soft and hard coking coal - otherwise known as metallurgical coal - for steelmaking in future through development of new mines at Vickery in NSW and Winchester South in Queensland.Mr Flynn said those plans were not derailed by the Glasgow pact, adding: ""Importantly, the pact does not call for the same phase-down of metallurgical coal, which will be essential to meet ongoing global steel demand to support development, and will become a growing proportion of our business.""\l"

Mr Cannon-Brookes and Andrew ""Twiggy"" Forest are lead investors in the $20 billion Sun Cable project which plans to sell solar power to Singapore via a cable from what would be the world's largest solar farm in the Northern Territory, as well as ventures to make solar cells cheaper and more efficient.To deepen its emissions cuts Atlassian, a software giant, plans to shift to 100 per cent renewable energy by 2025, make its data-centres more efficient, reduce business travel and develop more efficient buildings for its staff around the world.""COP26The commitment comes as another group of Australian chief executives calling itself the Climate Leaders Coalition commits to strong decarbonisation efforts by 2030, signing on to a roadmap to act as a guide for business leaders to reduce emissions.The CLC was founded with the B-Team Australasia, a regional arm of a group of ""purpose driven"" business leaders created by Sir Richard Branson.""We need the collective wisdom of governments, corporations, academics, not-for-profits, small businesses and the entire community to solve this challenge with practical solutions.

The US said those involved accounted for 70 per cent of global GDP and half of all methane emissions.Their biggest win was signing up Brazil, the world's largest methane emitter. Other backers included Canada, New Zealand, Britain, Argentina, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Absentees included Australia, Qatar, Brunei, China, Russia and India.Energy Minister Angus Taylor told a group of journalists, environmentalists and businesspeople in Glasgow that Australia did not want to set specific targets for particular emissions.""We've got a net-zero goal for 2050 for the whole economy. We're not setting sector-specific targets, and we're not setting gas-specific values, we're pursuing the entirety,"" he said.""The number that counts is the CO2-equivalent concentration in the atmosphere, that is what counts. ... Specific gases, they contribute to that overall outcome ... [but] the overall outcome [is what] we continue to focus on.""Australian climate campaigners condemned the government's decision not to join the pledge.""It's a really excellent initiative and I wish Australia was a part of it. Cutting methane emissions is one of the most effective things we can do over the next few decades,"" said Simon Bradshaw, head of research at the Climate Council, who is in Glasgow.""Regrettably we've ruled it out, and that will help cement our reputation as a bit of a handbrake at these talks.""The Australian Conservation Foundation's clean energy campaigner Suzanne Harter said even a fossil-fuel producer such as Australia could still mandate actions such as detecting and repairing leaks at coal and gas operations, or recovering vented gas.""The federal government's refusal to budget on methane cuts is irresponsible and based on their own party bickering rather than a genuine assessment of what's possible,"" she said.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said methane emissions had accounted for 30 per cent of global warming since the industrial revolution, and were 80 times more powerful at trapping heat than carbon dioxide emissions.Although they were among the most potent greenhouse gases, they were also among the easiest to curb, she said, so they were useful in making early progress towards 2030 and 2050 emissions reductions targets. ""We have to cut emissions faster, and methane is one of the gases we can cut the fastest,"" she said. ""Cutting back methane emissions ... is the low-hanging fruit.""The pledge requires countries to work together to cut methane emissions by 30 per cent from 2020 levels, rather than each country having to meet that target individually.Ms von de Leyen said the EU would next month introduce regulations to measure, verify and report methane emissions, detect and repair leaks, and put limits on venting and flaring.""We are making COP26 the moment when the world moves from aspiration to action,"" she said.Mr Biden said his administration would work to reduce methane losses from oil and gas pipel"

The claim from Anthony -Albanese and Penny Wong that -climate change is the ""No 1"" issue for Pacific islanders is rubbish. Just like Australians, the No 1 issue in the Pacific is economic -security - secure jobs, reliable -energy and internet connection, putting food on the table and housing.Combating family violence, better hygiene, improving education outcomes and access to basic health services to treat preventable diseases and extend the average life of islanders are also top priorities.Climate change is a significant concern for small island states, particularly low-lying atoll -nations like Kiribati and Tuvalu, which have learned to live with storm surges and flooding.Many of those climate change exposed countries have signed up with China. Kiribati last year agreed to a Beijing-funded airstrip upgrade.China is the world's biggest polluter and refuses to meet -demands from advanced nations to scale back its coal-fired generation.Under no circumstances will China and India agree to be -competitively disadvantaged and put at risk millions of -people who have been pulled out of poverty.Solomon Islands, Kiribati and other Pacific governments are not signing up to Xi Jinping's global agenda because of climate change.

"COP26","Australia","COP26_Australia91","Climate gulf between politics and science; The Age's View","April 23, 2022 Saturday","The Age (Melbourne, Australia)","Poll after poll shows more Australians than ever are concerned about climate change and want greater action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and global heating. And they have good reason to be. This summer, even in a cooler La Nina year, temperature records were broken and residents of northern NSW became climate refugees as they fled their inundated homes during record-breaking floods.From the fierce black summer bushfires two years ago to the recent bleaching - again - of the world heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef, it's clear that catastrophic climate change is underway and harming Australians here and now. It's happening from the Pilbara town of Onslow, where super heating in January equalled Australia's hottest ever temperature of 50.7 degrees celsius, to Doon Doon in NSW, which broke records with more than a metre of rain in two days.Yet many Australian voters feel cognitive dissonance when they contrast the climate election promises of the two major parties with the urgent calls from scientists for quick, deep emissions cuts by 2030. Nowhere has the divergence between scientific evidence and political ideology been more painfully clear than in Australia's decade-plus climate war.The Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change says global emissions must be halved by 2030 to have any hope of limiting global warming to, or close to, 1.5 degrees. It's stark and simple. What is the ""fair share"" of this emissions budget for Australia? Replicating the same methodology that the federal government's Climate Change Authority used in its advice ahead of the Paris conference, two recent University of Melbourne reports determined that if Australia is to stay within its 1.5 degree budget it would require a 75 per cent emissions reduction on 2005 levels by 2030, with net zero by 2035.Before the COP26There's also considerable political support from the government for emissions intensive fossil fuel industries. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has promised $250 million subsidies to Australia's two oil refineries and $660 million to accelerate fracking in the Northern Territory's Beetaloo Basin. This vast spend dwarfs the coalition's commitments for clean energy projects. It also stands in contrast to what the International Energy Agency (IEA) says is needed: no new oil and gas fields or coal-fired power stations can be created if the world is to stay within less dangerous global heating limits. Already, that hope is fading.As for Labor, it promises to set an emissions reduction target of 43 per cent by 2030 and increase the share of renewables in the national electricity market to 82 per cent. This is less than the 45 per cent cut Labor promised under Bill Shorten ahead of the 2019 election and shows the chilling effect that electoral loss had on the party's climate ambition. The 43 per cent figure has been forged through the process of political expediency, but will not reduce emissions quickly enough, according to the scientific evidence.Despite the IEA's ""no new coal power"" plea, Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese has committed a Labor government to support new coal mines, matching the pro-mining stance of the Coalition in a push for blue-collar votes.Since the last election, climate change has accelerated and the economy, industry and public attitudes have shifted. In 2019, the Business Council of Australia in 2019 described Labor's 45 per cent emission reduction pledge as ""economy wrecking"". Now it supports an even-greater 50 per cent emissions reduction by 2030 and global forums like COP26 have increased the pressure on climate laggards to act.Neither of the major parties have the emissions reduction policies the scientists say we need, but Labor would be less of a climate wrecker than the Coalition. The Coalition and Labor may struggle to form government on their own, meaning the Greens or independents could hold the balance of power after this election. Climate action would then become a bargaining chip.\l"

But our conversation quickly veers off from green to greens.Scotland boasts more than 500 golf courses - more per head of population than anywhere else in the world. And Gallagher, growing up in the heart of the country near Stirling, made sure he didn't miss out.""What we would do as kids, we'd get up and play in the summertime, when it gets light very early,"" he reminisces.""We'd get up and play before the greenkeeper came. We'd play nine holes. We had a bag of clubs and everything, we just avoided paying.""Then he remembers he's talking to a journalist. ""I shouldn't admit that, should I?"" he chuckles.Practice paid off: he had a single-digit handicap in his youth. Now, he seldom if ever plays, and reckons his handicap would probably be in the 20s.These days he has other things on his mind, like steering an oil and gas company through the existential crisis of the energy transition. And it's that, rather than the lure of the links or the call of family, that has brought him to Scotland.I meet him at Australia's pavilion in the cavernous main hall of the COP26 venue, where Santos has set up a model of its $US165 million ($220 million) Moomba carbon capture and storage (CCS) project being developed with Beach Energy in South Australia.The project's controversial status among green groups back in Australia - they fear it is unproven, unreliable, and will extend the life of fossil fuels - has carried over to Glasgow, where some activists have questioned its inclusion in a government showcase stand.Technology battleAlso exhibiting at the Australia pavilion alongside Santos is Fortescue Future Industries, whose founder Andrew Forrest is a champion of renewables-powered hydrogen, and who disparages CCS in all its forms as an unworkable route to net zero.But Gallagher is adamant Moomba will deliver the goods. ""Capturing carbon from other industries, transporting it somewhere to store it, that doesn't stack up economically. But that's not what we're talking about here,"" he says.""We're talking about decarbonisation of oil and gas assets. And we've been injecting gas and reservoirs for more than 50 years all over the world very successfully. There are hundreds if not thousands of cases where that happened.""Previously, the gas was stored then later withdrawn again, to manage supply. ""What we're talking about now is keeping it there. Very straightforward.""And he's happy to keep https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/fortescue-santos-clash-over-hydrogen-20211027-p593oiagreeing to disagree with ForrestHe suggests green hydrogen has higher water usage, and higher electrolyser costs, than making it with natural gas.""I think what you'll find is it's more likely to be blue hydrogen, or clean hydrogen, that gets the market up and running on a global basis,"" he says.To him, the argument can be settled just like it is in the gadget market: all the technologies should compete, and the best one will win. What about inferior VHS beating superior Beta in the videotape era, I ask? He laughs. ""They all lost to digital in the end.""At COP26""There's always a lot of enthusiasm around conferences, right? It's really what that enthusiasm level is like two, three months from now,"" he warns.""But certainly what I'm hearing at the conference is a lot of increased understanding of what these technologies are, and how far they've gotten or not, and what the readiness of the various technologies are.""Perhaps less welcome to a natural gas producer is the US-led Global Methane Pledge, signed by more than 100 countries, which aims to HYPERLINK cut methane emissions by almost a third in the coming decade.Energy Minister Angus Taylor refused to sign Australia up, saying the government would not set targets for specific gases or sectors.""I don't think that's a reflection on the gas industry at all,"" Gallagher says. Santos has young infrastructure and high standards, he says, so its ""fugitive emissions"", or methane leakage, is low.""Whereas a lot of countries that would operate to lower standards or have older equipment, will have more leakage throughout their systems,"" he says.""We measure the emissions across our facilities, and we publish all that stuff in our annual climate change report. And they're very low levels, very low indeed.""Tartan tiesA big benefit of being at COP26, Gallagher says, is the chance to test his strategy with an exacting audience, and also to have conversations on climate issues that just don't happen anywhere else.""I'm having meetings here with Australian companies in the context of COP26, whereas if I met them in Australia we wouldn't be talking about these issues, or not as intensely as we've focused on them here.""The COP tour of duty ends with a trip to Edinburgh to watch the Wallabies play Scotland at rugby. For Gallagher, this might be an even more challenging assignment than COP.His company is sponsoring the Aussies, but even after more than two decades Down Under his loyalties lie with the land of his birth.

It was a rare and significant opportunity - the result of tireless lobbying - and during the time that we had we were united in conveying several key messages to the party room.Firstly, that Australian agriculture cannot accept another 'Kyoto' (COP3) outcome, with the 20 years of damage it has inflicted on farmers who significantly and disproportionately delivered on our nation's carbon reduction commitments.During that time, vegetation management laws in Queensland have been radically amended more than 40 times - locking up land and preventing active management, resulting in thickening vegetation that chokes, rather than protects, healthy ecosystems.Secondly, we agreed that our industry must be recognised and included in any future government policy for the work that farmers have done and for the future opportunities we have in front of us. Agriculture and regional Australia have a powerful and positive story to tell on climate - both in terms of what has so far been achieved and what they still have to offer.We are the only industry to have tangibly and demonstrably reduced emissions since COP3 and we can continue to be a strong part of Australia's ongoing contribution to this issue.However, for that to happen we must be equals in the conversation - counted in, not carved out, as some have suggested doing.Australian agriculture, with support from science and the broader community, has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to lead the world and announce its intention to do so on the international stage at COP26 in Glasgow. We know it's possible, we have the evidence to support it - now we need governments to back us.Finally, Fiona and I conveyed to the Federal Nationals our shared belief in AgForce's AgCarE program as a system that allows farmers to retain control of their ecosystem services, while improving the environment, and increasing their agribusiness' resilience.My own family-run operation participated in the initial AgCarE pilot and, as a result, I now know that our cattle breeding, trading, and fattening business sequesters more carbon than it emits. Participation in AgCarE has given us renewed confidence in our operation, enabled our family to understand where we can do even more on climate, and opened our eyes to future opportunities available to us.If COP26It's time we launched a new, compelling narrative - one that becomes woven into the fabric of every Australian's consciousness and celebrates the combination of our unique landscapes, powerful agriculture industry, and strong regions.That focuses on the truth behind our incredible industry's role in enhancing our landscapes, our environment, and our communities.- Georgie Somerset, AgForce general president\l"

These commitments were well below those of other developed nations.The text also calls on countries to accelerate the phase out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels. Australia will fight to keep the current vague wording, which doesn't set time frames or specific targets.British prime minister Boris Johnson has returned to the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow - urging nations for a final push to ""pull out all the stops"" as the final negotiations begin.Energy Minister Angus Taylor has made it clear that the government is supportive of coal and fossil fuels and blue hydrogen - using hydrogen from fossil fuels - as well as renewable energy.Once Canberra has analysed and responded to the draft - like the near 200 COP member countries - specific emphasis and wor-ding can change and the final ""cover statement"", could be watered down.The UN wants to keep countries on track to try and prevent global temperature rises going above 1.5C this century. Scientists say even with all of the commitments made this year, including a flurry in the past fortnight, that global warming will be 2.4 degrees higher by the end of the century and urged even more urgent action to cut fossil fuels.The text recognises that limiting global warming to 1.5C by 2100 requires rapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions, including reducing global carbon dioxide emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 relative to the 2010 level and to net zero around mid-century.Countries that haven't submitted new or updated nationally determined contributions for 2030 must do so by November 22 next year. It is proposed that world leaders meet next November and then every year to fine tune their pre-2030 ambitions.Money for developing countries to try and mitigate climate change and make them more resilient is to go beyond the current target of $100bn a year and there is scope for much larger support from 2025.India had asked that there be $1 trillion a year support for developing countries.

Previous announcables have been repackaged to persuade voters less is more when it comes to saving the planet. COP26 was always going to be about 2030, not 2050. That was reiterated yet again by Wednesday's annual UN Emissions Gap report.The Morrison government's failure to even consider increasing Australia's short term target to match the latest projections of a 35 per cent reduction by 2030 is a travesty and a sop to the Nationals. The lame excuse this wasn't taken to the 2019 election is so obviously fallacious as to be risible. The LNP mocked Labor for its commitment to net zero by 2050 during that campaign. It has now adopted the same target.If you believe the PM and the Climate Minister it's possible to achieve a climate nirvana with no taxes, no cost to the community and no pain and all gain.Unfortunately the modelling to back these assertions up is only going to be released ""eventually""; presumably after the election.While commitments to driving down the cost of greenhouse friendly new technologies and to accelerate their deployment are not without merit, we can't punt humanity's future on blind faith all will be saved by a ""technological crunch"".The onus is now on the ALP to release a credible policy based on real action rather than a blind faith in technologies that don't exist and may never come to fruition.It's not good enough to say, as Mr Albanese effectively did on Tuesday, ""they're the government, they're the ones that need a plan, we'll announce something after Glasgow"".

Back then, it was enough to agree that global warming had to be kept below 2 degrees Celsius.The UN has since said the catastrophe kicks in at 1.5C, and Johnson's mission was to get the world to accept that the doomsday machine was getting menacingly larger.This he seems to have done - at least until China expressed reservations late on Tuesday (Wednesday AEDT).The next job was to sharpen the tools needed to defuse the climate doomsday clock. At the very least, this meant a target of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050; but far better - since the world has already warmed by 1.1C from pre-industrial times - a 2030 target that gets most of the way there.This he partly seems to have done. Not all countries have gone hard on 2030 but most have made a 2050 pledge, though big-emitting China is going for 2060 and India for 2070.But the consensus founders when it comes to exactly what is required to hit those targets, and whether anyone is really yet doing enough to get there.So Johnson and his stalwart new accomplice, Joe Biden, sought to move this debate on from the realm of grand abstraction to the realm of the tangible and practical.They tried to rev up technology partnerships with the private sector, and funding commitments, and side deals or mini-deals - anything that would, as EU boss Ursula von der Leyen said, make the leap from ""aspiration to action"".India came to this party, softening the impact of its 2070 punt into the outfield by laying down some highly specific targets for 2030.Even so, climate activists and fellow nations are having to take a lot of countries' commitments and pledges on trust.And trust remains a problem: another issue that Johnson did not iron out is the dissatisfaction that poor-country leaders expressed - in highly emotive and moralistic terms - about the $US20 billion shortfall in rich nations' Paris pledge to fork over $US100 billion a year to support the developing world's energy transition.The private sector is piling in, though, and over the next few days it will be the finance and energy industries' turn to unveil initiatives, campaigns, deals and projects.Meanwhile, in the background, negotiators will be looking at the unfinished business of Paris - trading in carbon credits, and how often commitments should be assessed and scaled up - ready for a week of painful l"

It has been called out,"" said Australia Institute director Richie Merzian.The Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA) announcement came as negotiators from 197 countries wrangled over whether the summit's closing statement would include, for the first time, a commitment to ""accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels"".COP26 host Britain is keen to retain this text, but as negotiations reached crunch point on Friday (AEDT), Saudi Arabia, Russia and India looked set to put the kybosh on it.Its likely deletion will disappoint environmental groups, who will have to take solace from the BOGA launch plus the various anti-coal pledges from the COP's first week.The group of countries signing up to BOGA includes some with large reserves such as Greenland, Denmark and Costa Rica, alongside France, Ireland and New Zealand. Portugal and Italy have taken out lower-tier membership, and Quebec, Wales and California have joined at a sub-national level.Welsh climate minister Lee Waters said even if COP26 failed to deliver, ""this alliance shows that action is possible  the point of this is to create momentum"".Denmark's Climate & Energy Minister Dan Jorgensen said he was talking to more countries about signing on. Without specifically referencing Australia, he said any oil and gas exporter with a 2050 net-zero target should be looking to join.""How can you defend wanting to be carbon-neutral in 2050 ... but still be wanting to produce oil and gas and selling it to others?"" he said. ""That, in our view, does not add up.""Denmark was once among Europe's largest oil producers, and Mr Jorgensen admitted that his country's decision to stop issuing exploration licences had been difficult and expensive. It had required heavy investment in retraining workers and in building offshore wind capacity.Costa Rican environment and energy minister Andrea Meza Murillo said her government had withstood two decades of pressure to exploit its oil reserves. ""It's not an easy conversation in any country,"" she said.Simon Bradshaw, research director at the Climate Council, said that like BOGA, the PPCA initially included few major coal producers or consumers.""Cut to 2021, and the list of countries committing in various ways to phase out coal includes Vietnam, Indonesia, Poland and South Korea,"" he said. ""The rest of the world is moving while Australia is standing still.""But Mr Merzian said the overall effect of the various alliances and groupings was that momentum was ""moving in the right direction, and it's all moving in the same direction"".Australia Institute analysis suggests coal, oil and gas production must fall globally by 69 per cent, 31 per cent and 28 per cent, respectively, in the next nine years if global warming is to remain within 1.5 degrees Celsius this century.But although the coal output of Britain, the US, Canada, Norway and Australia is expected to drop 30 per cent in that time, their collective production of oil is set to rise by 33 per cent and gas by 27 per cent.""This is a grand transition of extreme complexity,"" he said.

The question is what the mix is going to be. The more mitigation we do, the less adaptation will be required and the less suffering there will be.""On those key metrics, the years since have been wasted, despite the success of the 2015 Paris talks in delivering an agreement on a course of action the world might follow to save itself.Big visions, small gainsCarbon emissions have continued to rise steadily upwards, as has warming, as has extreme weather, as has ocean rise and acidification.Depending on which analysis you trust most, when the latest climate summit began, the world was headed for catastrophic warming of 2.7 degrees, should governments act on their pledges. In the final hours of negotiations it is headed for catastrophic warming of just over or under 2 degrees.It might still come down further.But with the last hours of negotiating to come, it seems clear the central goal of COP26 - to halve emissions by 2030 so the world has a hope of reaching net zero by 2050 and in turn, perhaps, stabilise the climate at 1.5 degrees - will not be met.And whatever the final outcome of the talks, the terms of the terrible equation Holdren laid out a decade-and-a-half ago have now shifted.Due to past and ongoing failure on mitigation, there will now necessarily be far more suffering than there needed to be, and in the corridors of COP26, that fact is etched into the faces of delegates, particularly those from the global south.There will also need to be faster mitigation and more expensive adaptation. Meyers points out that if we'd started acting decisively to drive down emissions as recently as 2018, we would have needed a 7 per cent cut in emissions each year to be on a 1.5 degree path. But we didn't, and now we need a 10 per cent cut each year, a figure that grows every month of inaction.We can now add the trillions of dollars needed for developing nations on the climate frontl"

In fact, we'll have 50 per cent of all new cars sold in NSW being electric by 2030,"" he said.The COP electric vehicles pledge is one that the UK, as the host country, pulled together.DFAT has been contacted for comment. Other states are also looking to sign the pledge.The NSW government announced on Wednesday it would spend another $105 million to spur the uptake of electric vehicles among councils, taxi companies and other fleet operators by offering to cover part of the extra costs over conventional cars. The state has committed almost $600 million to drive the uptake of electric vehicles.Earlier this year, the NSW government announced it would abolish stamp duty on electric vehicles and offer drivers other incentives to increase their uptake to ensure more than half of all new car sales by 2031 were electric.Mr Kean's action stands in contrast with that of the federal government, which has not made clear whether it will sign the pledge. Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced on Tuesday the federal government would HYPERLINK https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p596zhboost investment in charging infrastructure, particularly in regional Australia, to help manage the transition towards a 1.7 million electrified national fleet.Mr Kean said he was looking forward to working with his federal counterparts, but they could be doing more to support the electric vehicle industry.""They can put a lot more money up to ensure that everyone can benefit from owning an [electric vehicle]. They can also do things like providing subsidies or waiving taxes for people who buy an [electric vehicle], and the final thing they can do is look at tail pipe emissions standards,"" he said on Sky News. ""We want to ensure people are getting access to cheaper vehicles that are cheaper to run as well, and our policies are designed to do that.""The motor industry has hit back at the federal government's new electric vehicle strategy, saying there were large gaps in the policy that need to be addressed.Domestic sales of electric cars have risen at record levels in the past six months amid state government incentives, but come off a very low base. New car sales data released in August showed 8688 battery and plug-in electric vehicle were sold in the first half of 2021.Electric Vehicle Council chief executive Behyad Jafari said NSW had recognised that once a car was sold it stayed on the road for 15 to 20 years, and therefore reaching net zero by 2050 required action today.The Victorian government has a $100 million electric vehicle road map.Get daily updates on the climate summit that will shape our future.

A school building crafted from bamboo. A Brazilian favela converted into an ""urban ecovillage"" that generates 100 per cent of its own energy and converts organic cooking waste into cooking gas.These are some of the 17 sustainable projects presented in the Build Better Now ""virtual pavilion"" run by the UK Green Building Council (UKGBC) as part of COP26, which began in Glasgow last weekend.Only one Australian building made the cut: the Woodside Building for Technology and Design at Monash University's Clayton campus, in Melbourne.From outside, the five-storey, 19,000 square metre structure - the only building in the southern hemisphere to achieve Passive House status - looks like a series of perfectly arrayed, elegant modernist boxes. Rust-hued sun blades and variegated window casements add visual interest as the daylight moves across.Nothing much screams ""green"" - but look closer.Hermetically sealed (a defining condition of Passive House certification), the interior is arrayed around a monumental, full-height void created by 24-metre-wide trusses, with two-storey top-lit atriums to provide natural light throughout the day.Acoustically isolated learning spaces occupy the first three floors; academic and research activities are carried out on the top two.The vast, open learning spaces in the centre of the building capture the heat of humans and disperse it throughout the building when required; informal, small-group learning areas are spread around the periphery, requiring less intensity from the building's systems and benefiting from solar penetration via a precise 50 per cent window-to-wall ratio. (Except the north facade, which is completely solid and highly insulated.) Those sculptural sun blades are actually operable louvres that radically reduce the energy demands of cooling and dehumidifying.""The combination of active and passive environmental strategies defines the building's expression and operations while assisting Monash University intelligently, and lead its 2030 Net-Zero Initiative with unique, purpose-defined architecture,"" says Andrew Cortese, managing partner of Grimshaw, the Sydney-based practice behind the building's design.""Yes, it's a classic, modernist building,"" concedes engineer Jeff Robinson of Aurecon, the company that delivered Woodside, which houses the faculties of technology and design. ""But the building envelope and its performance has been parametrically modelled to meet the Passive House standard. By controlling solar gain, we get very comfortable, high-performance spaces with much smaller mechanical plant.""Woodside has won a slew of Australian Institute of Architects 2021 awards, including the Victorian Architecture Medal, Melbourne Prize and Educational Architecture Award. On Thursday night it took out the institute's top national honour, the Sir Zelman Cowen Award for Public Architecture, and its highest award for sustainability.Its inclusion in the Build Better Now virtual pavilion puts it alongside a net-zero housing estate in Nottingham, England, a Dutch bridge made from laminated timber, and a Swedish cultural centre made from conifers sourced from local sustainable forests and 100 per cent powered by hydro-electricity.What's interesting is that many of these structures don't read as ""green"" - they're too intent on reducing carbon emissions to worry about virtue signalling. (Those that do flaunt natural materials like mud and bamboo do so as part of their structural and sustainable integrity.)The building industry is estimated to be responsible for 40 per cent of global CO emissions. And yet, we keep building.While calls to slow down construction in favour of repurposing existing structures get louder (and this year's Pritzker Prize is going for the first time to one such practice, HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/life-and-luxury/design/architecture-s-top-prize-recognises-surprising-claim-to-fame-20210416-p57jw0Lacaton & Vassal of FranceWhile world leaders try to align on global environmental policy at COP26, businesses threatened with early extinction are taking the lead.The HYPERLINK https://www.ukgbc.org/UK Green Building CouncilThe built environment ""has a crucial part to play"" in tackling climate change, says the council's chief executive, Julie Hirigoyen.""Everyone on the planet has a stake in our buildings and cities,"" she says.

Fossil fuels and their use have enabled parts of the world to attain high levels of wealth and wellbeing.""Yadav said ""targeting any particular industry is uncalled for"" and stressed developing countries were entitled to use fossil fuels given developed nations had used them for decades and were responsible for historic emissions.The agreement, already being called the Glasgow Climate Pact, calls upon nations to phase out ""inefficient fossil fuel subsidies"" and recognises the need for ""a just transition"" from fossil fuels. Mr Sharma said he was ""deeply sorry"" about the last-minute changes on the wording about coal.His voice breaking with emotion after hearing from vulnerable nations which expressed their anger over the changes to the text, he said: ""May I just say to all delegates I apologise for the way this process has unfolded and I am deeply sorry.""The pact speeds up the so-called ""ratchet mechanism"" of the Paris Agreement by calling on countries like Australia that have not increased their 2030 targets to do so as soon as possible before the next COP summit in Egypt next year.It calls on all nations to revisit and improve the emission reductions targets and strategies annually and report their progress via ministerial meetings.Asked by the Herald what the consequences should be if a country like Australia ultimately ignored the request to come back in 2022 with higher 2030 emission reductions targets, Mr Sharma said:""All countries have signed up to this and at the end of the day this is an international agreement and each country will be judged by whether or not they stuck to the commitments they've made."" Climate activist Greta Thunberg, whose urgent calls for action were often quoted by negotiators inside the ""blue zone"", expressed her disappointment and determination in a tweet after the result.""The COP26And she reposted a message sent last week midway through the summit: ""Unless we achieve immediate, drastic, unprecedented, annual emission cuts at the source then that means we're failing when it comes to this climate crisis. 'Small steps in the right direction', 'making some progress' or 'winning slowly' equals losing.""The final pact text ""expresses alarm and utmost concern that human activities have caused around 1.1 degrees of warming to date . . . and that carbon budgets consistent with achieving the Paris Agreement temperature goal are now small and being rapidly depleted"".It also emphasises the need for rapid reductions this decade if 2050 targets are to work, and completes key elements of the so-called Paris rule book, governing how a global carbon market can operate.Even before the Indian intervention delegations had expressed serious misgivings about the final document, most said they believed it was a realistic compromise that drove forward efforts to curb climate change.""Obviously, we know the old adage that in negotiations you can't let perfect be the enemy of the good,"" said United States climate envoy John Kerry. ""And this is good. It's a powerful statement."" Developing nations failed in their effort to have the pact include a mechanism for wealthy countries to pay for the damage already occurring in climate vulnerable states.The move to pay for damages was opposed by powerful countries that are progressive on other climate related matters, such as the United Kingdom and the US.""The needs of the world's vulnerable people have been sacrificed on the altar of the rich world's selfishness,"" said Mohamed Adow, director of energy and climate think tank Power Shift Africa.""The outcome here reflects a COP held in the rich world and the outcome contains the priorities of the rich world. They claim to want urgency on emissions reductions, yet they continue to expand fossil fuel production within their own borders.""Simon Bradshaw, head of research for the Climate Council, said the direct references to fossil fuels and the mechanism to increase the tempo of emissions reductions were significant.""The new commitments that countries brought to Glasgow are not enough to get on the path to limiting warming to 1.5 degrees, but the real measure of success will be whether it has succeeded in kickstarting a decade of truly transformative action . . . on that front there are reasons for hope.""He said Australia had eventually backed the pact, despite earlier opposing some of the language, but it had isolated itself at the talks.""The federal government showed up empty-handed to a pivotal moment in the fight for our future. They've let down our Pacific neighbours, as well as Australians who do not deserve to endure more frequent and severe bushfires, floods, droughts and heatwaves,"" Dr Bradshaw said.\l"

The panel brought together leading voices across the agricultural commodities sector to exchange views on some of the thorniest issues in the industry - from climate change to accessible technological innovation to economic inclusion.\~\~ Photo - HYPERLINK https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1695674/RT2021.jpghttps://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1695674/RT2021.jpg\~\~ Logo - HYPERLINK https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1160778/RSPO_Logo.jpghttps://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1160778/RSPO_Logo.jpg\~\~ Panellists opened with their views on , highlighting that forests and land use have never been more prominent during the summit where over 100 world leaders pledged to end and reverse deforestation by 2030. Directly impacting commodities like palm oil - often seen as a driver of deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions - COP26 underscored the vital need for solutions like RSPO and other voluntary initiatives.\~\~ Protecting human rights and labour rights The first deep dive addressed the complex issue of human rights and labour rights, where panellists emphasised that human rights and labour rights' violations cannot be separated from environmental issues, and they remain some of the toughest challenges facing agri-commodity industries.\~\~ Panellists highlighted the importance of standards, such as RSPO's, ""as guidance for a rights-based approach across supply chains,"" Janhavi Naidu from the Earthworm Foundation said. ""We focus on translating the agenda, visions and expectations set by RSPO and similar standards into resources and actionable solutions. This is because actors require guidance, time and investment to be able to scale just labour practices.""\~\~ Echoing this sentiment, Alison Ward from CottonConnect added, ""Ensuring just treatment of workers requires strong investment in each step of the supply chain, local intervention and engagement. In the textile sector, this means brands and companies meeting farmers, ginners and spinners to understand their concerns and investing adequate resources to address them."" She shared examples of building trust in cotton growing communities in India and Pakistan to ensure that their health and safety needs are met, inspired by similar work in the palm oil sector.\~\~ Appropriate uses of technology Panellists also explored the importance of leveraging innovation and technologies to address climate challenges. Technology can help provide greater transparency and traceability in the palm oil supply chain and enable businesses to uphold their sustainability commitments. RSPO has been at the forefront of developing solutions to strengthen the credibility of its certification scheme.\~\~ Rod Taylor from the World Resources Institute (WRI) cited one example, GeoRSPO, which integrates RSPO concession maps with the Global Forest Watch platform. He explained ""Global Forest Watch feeds directly into GeoRSPO by combining satellite imagery and cloud computing to show land use change in a user-friendly manner... it helps companies manage deforestation risk in their supply chain and integrate risk management and reporting into a single system"".\~\~ Wendy Carrara from Airbus elaborated, ""We have invested 20 years of research and development on a verification tool that promotes traceability to plantations, raises alerts on deforestation and correlates it with supply chain data. Altogether, this ensures the responsible sourcing of palm oil. Satellite images are analysed using biophysical parameters to create a base map against which monitoring can be done at scale and with local precision"".\~\~ Supporting rural livelihoods The final deep dive discussion covered how achieving climate resilience through certification like RSPO not only delivers benefits for the planet, but for people too. Achieving climate resilience in the sustainable palm oil sector is not merely an ecological imperative - it can also generate social empowerment by strengthening workforce capacity, creating jobs and fostering economic development.\~\~ Justin Adams from the Tropical Forest Alliance advocated for integrating livelihoods into climate action: ""There is a clear recognition of the importance of the social dimension in achieving environmental goals; climate goals are central but just one dimension to optimise. We need ecopreneurs in the landscape to drive real change"". Rod continued by highlighting that the big picture solution is to optimise existing resources like land through sustainable practices, stabilise existing resources, and make farming more lucrative, topped with incentives to reward good stewardship.\~\~ Despite the challenges ahead, the past few years have seen closer integration of environmental and social goals - key to securing a sustainable and resilient future across the palm oil sector. Panellists closed on an optimistic note by saying that organisations like RSPO are critical because they bring communities together to solve problems. ""It goes beyond simply increasing the volume of Certified Sustainable Palm Oil and towards creating a sustainable palm oil ecosystem; all of us have a role to play in achieving this"", said Justin.\~\~ About RSPO: The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) was formed in 2004 with the objective of promoting the growth and use of sustainable oil palm products through credible global standards and engagement of stakeholders. RSPO is a not-for-profit, international, membership organisation that unites stakeholders from the different sectors of the palm oil industry including oil palm producers, palm oil processors or traders, consumer goods manufacturers, retailers, banks and investors, environmental or nature conservation NGOs, and social or developmental NGOs.\~\~ This multi-stakeholder representation is mirrored in the governance structure of RSPO such that seats in the Board of Governors, Steering Committees and Working Groups are fairly allocated to each sector. In this way, RSPO lives out the philosophy of the ""roundtable"" by giving equal rights to each stakeholder group, facilitating traditionally adversarial stakeholders in working together to reach decisions by consensus, and achieving RSPO's shared vision of making sustainable palm oil the norm.\~\~ The seat of the association is in Zurich, Switzerland, while the secretariat is currently based in Kuala Lumpur with satellite offices in Jakarta (ID), London (UK), Zoetermeer (NL), Beijing (CN) and Bogota (CO).

"" HYPERLINK https://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/boris-johnson-hails-scott-morrison-s-heroic-net-zero-policy-20211026-p5932e.htmlThey've done a heroic thing""I hope they will be joined by lots more countries in that region for the COP summit.""In climate circles though, Morrison's commitment was widely viewed as the very least he could do, done at the last possible minute.""Seen from the UK, Australia is claiming a leadership position on climate change - unfortunately the league table it's leading is that of climate bullshitters,"" said one well-positioned observer, honorary research fellow at the Grantham Institute at the Imperial College London, Richard Black.So why was Johnson so effusive?Johnson has a lot invested in the success of COP26It will be evidence that despite Brexit, the United Kingdom remains a key global player rather than a diminished one.Should the talks fail, Johnson as host will bear a large portion of the blame. With that in mind it made perfect sense that Johnson was so effusive in praise of Morrison, whatever the merits of Australia's climate contribution.At their best, international talks like this are settled well before negotiators and heads of state lob in to grip-and-grin for cameras.The Paris Agreement might have been drafted at a COP conference in December 2015, but its success was all but guaranteed a year earlier in secret talks between the United States and China.Former US president Barack Obama, shaken by the failure of the Copenhagen talks at the start of his term, was determined that Paris would be a success and directed his climate envoy Todd Stern to begin discreet talks with China.For nine months, negotiations dragged on before Obama and Xi shocked the world with a joint announcement. The US would set new emissions reductions targets and China would agree to cap their emissions by 2030.With the world's two superpowers, and two greatest greenhouse gas polluters, determined to act, Paris was locked in.But the world has changed and the object of Glasgow is different. At Paris, the world promised it would begin reducing emissions in an effort to keep warming well below 2 degrees and as close to 1.5 degrees as possible. At Glasgow, nations must demonstrate that they are on track to doing so, and that they can keep to the voluntary reductions targets they have already set and increase them as needed.Today the cautious trust that Xi and Obama once shared has evaporated in the geopolitical rivalry between the two nations.Xi will not attend the talks and nor will his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. COVID-19 has not only distracted leaders from climate but contributed to an energy crisis that has led to a surge in coal and gas production.Though under President Joe Biden, the US has not only rejoined the Paris Agreement, but become a global leader on the climate effort, Biden is being undermined in his efforts to reduce domestic emissions by the stubborn resistance of two Democrats whose votes are necessary to pass massive spending bills.On Friday morning Australian time, China announced its updated climate targets under the Paris Agreement, to the general disappointment of observers.It contained little more than a previously declared effort to see emissions peak by 2030 and hit net zero by 2060.Thom Woodroofe, a former climate diplomat and a fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, described China's announcement as a ""missed opportunity"" to seize global climate leadership as the COP talks began. He added that if China was serious about hitting its 2060 net zero goal it cannot wait until the second half of this decade to start phasing out domestic coal use.Helen Mountford, vice president of climate and economics with the World Resources Institute, a US think tank, was also faint in her praise, describing China's plan as a ""modest improvement"" over previously announced targets.Before these talks begin, there has been no grand bargain.In this environment as Johnson heads to Rome for G20 talks convened by Italy - the co-host nation of COP26 - what he needed most was momentum, or something that looks like it.And this is where the soaring praise for Australia's 2050 net zero commitment comes in.But as the Grantham Institute's Richard Black put it so bluntly, not everyone sees Australia's goals in such a positive light.Morrison's decision to bring to COP a projection that Australia will beat its previous commitment of reducing emissions by 26-28 per cent by 2030 wins little praise in a world where organisers are calling for 50 per cent cuts by that date. And besides, if Australia is so sure of beating its target why not make a formal commitment?But scepticism towards Australian commitment on climate exists well beyond headl"

But a separate pledge, championed by US President Joe Biden, to slash methane emissions by 30 per cent this decade was not agreed to by Australia.Dr Pulch said it was a disappointing result but still showed progress in the right direction.""[Coal's phasing down] was not what we would have supported but it is a step in that direction and it is a signal,"" he said.""If you look at this country, all the big business groups have stepped up and said 'we would like, as a country, to do more'.""However, the major trading bloc is unlikely to sign any free trade agreements with Australia without first seeing a strong 2030 target.Dr Pulch said the EU doesn't budge on excluding climate change targets, adding that trade agreements need to pass through its parliament, which is heavily influenced by environmental parties.""Our approach has always been substance before speech so there are a few areas where we need to make more progress still,"" he said.""The fact that Australia signed up to [a] 2050 [net zero target] I think was a very important step in that regard, and crucial.""With planning already underway for the next COP summit in Egypt next year, Dr Pulch is hopeful the world is in a good position to continue setting the bar higher.""[Glasgow] achieved a few very important things and on others, it set the tone for the next COP 27 to pick up and continue,"" he said.\l"

He said the world's remarkable success in developing coronavirus vaccines was ""cause for optimism"", and that the challenge of climate changes ""will be met in the same way"".""It will be met by those who frankly are largely not in this room. It will be our scientists, technologists, engineers, entrepreneurs, industrialists and financiers that actually will chart this path to net zero,"" Mr Morrison said.""It is up to us as leaders of -governments to back them in."" With a key goal of the summit to deliver a $100bn climate finance fund for developing countries, Mr Morrison announced Australia would lift its $1.5bn commitment over the next five years to $2bn.He unveiled the promise after a meeting with Pacific Island leaders from Fiji, Tuvalu and Palau, saying Australia wanted to cut out red tape and help countries most exposed to global warming ""in our backyard"".""It will also drive private sector-led climate solutions that support clean technology, jobs and growth across our region."" ""Australia stands with our Pacific family in our joint commitment to scale up mitigation and ensure adaptation support."" Fiji Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama commended Mr Morrison's 2050 net-zero commitment but urged him to develop a ""concrete plan to halve emissions by 2030"".Mr Morrison also welcomed Fiji as Australia's first partner in its new Indo-Pacific carbon offsets scheme.In his opening speech, Mr Johnson referenced climate activist Greta Thunberg's criticism of leaders offering ""blah, blah, blah"" instead of real action, saying COP26 had to be ""the moment we get real about climate change"".""We have the technology, and we can find the finance \'e2\€ \£6 the question for us today is whether we have the will,"" he said.Mr Johnson said future generations of children would ""not forgive us"" if COP26 was the ""historic turning point where history failed to turn"".

Mediation between different parties can help people on all sides reach an outcome they're relatively happy with.In our branded uniforms, we were a visible point of contact for hundreds of people attending protests in the city's streets and squares. Our team members were involved in situations which could have deteriorated without mediation. In one instance, we relayed messages between XR activists and police officers which helped to de-escalate an unexpected stand-off near a motorway junction. We listened to the frustrations some people had about who was being heard (and who was not) at the climate talks. We helped campaigners who had walked all the way from Germany proceed with their protest even though they had not given prior notice to the council and the police. Deeply frustrated with the initial bureaucratic response, they left COP26 feeling that they had been able to represent children and families back home. We also found ourselves in some of the sharper incidents across COP26, like when the police decided to contain or ""kettle"" some activists.Mediation is not always appropriate for handling these situations. Some activists, clear-eyed about the possible consequences, including arrest, will decide to escalate the situation anyway. There are signs that increasing numbers of people are ready to escalate matters, by doing things like HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/tyre-extinguishers-activists-are-deflating-suv-tyres-in-the-latest-pop-up-climate-movement-178911temporarily disabling SUVs HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/04/protesters-block-oil-depot-near-heathrow-as-action-enters-fourth-dayblocking fuel depots HYPERLINK https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/4946-how-to-blow-up-a-pipel"

So what will the negotiators in Glasgow be debating?Up for discussion HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement/key-aspects-of-the-paris-agreementlandmark Paris AgreementA persistent source of disagreement concerns how international carbon markets should work - Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. These markets would allow countries to receive credits for reducing emissions in excess of their targets, which could then be sold to countries struggling to meet their own commitments. Implementing carbon markets is HYPERLINK https://www.carbonbrief.org/in-depth-q-and-a-how-article-6-carbon-markets-could-make-or-break-the-paris-agreementvery difficult. Developing countries worry that these markets will allow rich countries to avoid painful emissions reductions at home while making marginal contributions to abate emissions abroad through buying credits. Poor countries argue that developing countries could use the same emission cuts they sell as credits towards their own domestic reduction targets, effectively counting them twice. Carrying over old credits accumulated under the previous system of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol might also allow emerging economies such as Brazil and India, and carbon-intensive economies such as Australia and Russia, to meet future reduction targets without much additional effort. This clashes with the spirit of the Paris Agreement to increase ambition over time. Difficult negotiations are also expected over how to support poorer countries to develop sustainably. The Paris Agreement recognised the existential threats to climate-vulnerable countries from mounting floods and droughts. HYPERLINK Loss and damage provisionsAnother contentious issue will be the delivery of HYPERLINK https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/100_billion_climate_finance_report.pdfUS$100 billion (\£374 billion) annually in climate finance.

Our opponents are more united than expected. It's hard to see how Team Australia will even try to catch up in the second half.COP26 has been a conference of wins and losses. Australia came into this event ranked at the bottom of the climate action ladder out of nearly 200 countries.On the global playing field, our strongest allies may soon become rivals, as Australia continues to distance itself from the rest of the pack.The United States has led a coalition of 190 countries and organisations to consign coal to history.Australia, on the other hand, is opening more than 100 new fossil-fuel projects off the back of this conference.The United Kingdom has pledged to slash emissions by 68 per cent this decade - that's more than half of Australia's formal target.Even if Australia was to slash its pollution by one-third by 2030, the science tells us it is nowhere near enough.So how is Australia being viewed here in Glasgow?Let's start with the Australian pavilion, which this week has been abuzz with presentations from Energy Minister Angus Taylor and four carefully selected businesses.The most prominent display has been by Santos - a fossil-fuel company whose unproven technology has been on show for the world to see.The Santos carbon capture and storage model was so large it had to be wheeled away out of sight, where it should remain.Next door to the so-called Australian pavilion is the zero methane section.The irony is not lost on the many hundreds of people who walk past each morning.Australia's pavilion sticks out like a sore thumb, although I will be first to admit - it's got the best coffee in the entire centre.But once you've had that first sip of caffeine, it becomes ever so clear that our federal government has come to Glasgow linking arms with a fossil-fuel company.It is spruiking a technology aimed at extending the life of gas, while our pavilion neighbours are offering solutions to curb the dirty fossil fuel.READ MORE:Australia snubs global pact to end coal production EVs to be 'new normal' by 2030 under plan backed by Australia Jack Waterford: PM's performance at COP26 demeaned all Australians The PM's 'Australian way' was better as an airl"

But having been here for two days, it's clear the event itself actually adds to the problem.The brutal truth is that a serious gathering of world leaders and their negotiators has been hijacked by a grotesque mix of rent seekers, hangers-on and political wannabes.Some at least arrive with best of intentions, but their presence will have no impact on whether Glasgow ends up a success or failure and undermines the sustainability principles they repeatedly urge others to follow. The vast majority of the 30,000 attendees do not need to be here and the United Nations and United Kingdom should never have encouraged them to come.This is not a summit in the traditional sense. In Glasgow, world leaders are only a small slice of a climate carnival best described as part-trade fair and part-public relations opportunity.Nowhere is this more apparent than in a cavernous hall hosting dozens of unique \' pavilions' occupied by countries and organisations keen to spin a positive version of their climate credentials. Renting the space costs tens of thousands of dollars and construction costs hundreds of thousands more.An uninformed visitor to many of these pavilions could be forgiven for thinking the host countries are saving the planet through innovation, when they are instead digging up fossil fuels and burning them at record rates. It is the definition of greenwashing.Some pavilions aren't exactly beacons of environmental sustainability, either. The so-called Science Pavilion, hosted by the World Meteorological Organisation, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and UK Met Office, features a long panel of 20 large television screens which display a glittering sign reading \' You can make the change'. They are hardly leading by example. Qatar, a major fossil fuels producer, has a grand setup featuring models of energy-efficient stadiums to be used for next year's FIFA World Cup. Why?Australia has a pavilion, too, boasting glossy booklets, information on businessman Andrew Forrest's green hydrogen crusade and details about a proposed cable linking a huge solar farm in the Northern Territory to Singapore. There's also a large exhibit from oil and gas giant Santos spruiking carbon capture and storage, which has raised a few eyebrows.The broader Glasgow venue is so big it takes 15 minutes to walk from one end to the other, and the United Nations and United Kingdom have accredited so many guests that a stack of temporary buildings - most made from white plastics - have had to be constructed to fit everyone in. Many have noted the alarming amount of plastic packaging at food stalls, although they are at least serving coffee in reusable cups.Elsewhere, celebrities dash around as if the conference is one giant red carpet.

The initial step came with the 1997 signing of the Kyoto Protocol, which saw countries commit for the first time to reducing emissions.After the failure of the 2009 Copenhagen summit, which collapsed when developed countries baulked at having to curb the use of fossil fuels, agreement was reached on cutting emissions this decade at the 2015 Paris Agreement.Many consider Paris to be the ""crowning achievement"" to date for collective action.The Paris Agreement was signed by more than 190 countries, which each promised to cut their long-term emissions to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees, and preferably no more than 1.5 degrees, above pre-industrial levels.Australia agreed to cut its emissions by 26 per cent to 28 per cent by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.Those numbers are what is known as Australia's ""nationally determined contribution"", or NDC.Critically, countries promised to update their contributions to the Paris Agreement every five years and explain how they were being implemented.How is the world tracking against Paris?The latest scientific consensus is that the gap has widened, making it more urgent that countries lift their emissions reduction efforts.According to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's August report into the latest science, the planet has already warmed 1.1 degrees since pre-industrial times and is now on a steepening trajectory towards 1.5 degrees, which is regarded as the threshold at which climate changes become permanent and intensifies.According to the panel's central scenario, the 1.5 degree threshold will be reached early next decade, cutting the time for action to less than 10 years, according to scientists.What is Glasgow expected to achieve?So far more than 125 countries have confirmed they will attend, and many, including across most of the developed world, have vowed to lift their 2030 Paris targets.But big names are missing. China's Xi Jinping has not yet said whether he will attend, while Russia's Vladimir Putin has already said he would not. Nor will New Zealand's Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, or Japan's leader, Fumio Kishida.Other feared no-shows include India, Indonesia, Brazil and Mexico, which would take out some of the world's biggest and fastest growing emitters.This makes it very possible that while many countries will arrive with upgraded 2030 targets, COP26 will again fall short of what is needed in aggregate to prevent temperatures from spinning out of control.Former climate sceptic and Glasgow host Boris Johnson has four main goals for the two-week summit, which he listed last month as ""coal, cars, cash and trees"".Not only does the UK Prime Minister want to make this year's summit the one that ""ends coal"", he has put adaption and finance on the agenda.The first involves working out how to cope with climate impacts that cannot be avoided. The second will see pressure put on advanced economies to help developed economies cope by coming good on their promises a decade ago to provide $US100 billion a year.What will Australia take to Glasgow?Morrison, who is due to leave at the end of the week for Scotland, is working to get agreement from the Nationals to commit Australia to a target of ""net zero by 2050"".The Prime Minister is also expected to take updated government forecasts for Australia's emissions trajectory through to 2030, which will show it beating the Paris Agreement pledge of 26 per cent to 28 per cent.After the world's leaders arrive and give their speeches during the first two days of this year's COP, officials will get to work on some of the more technical, unfinished business of previous COPs and any new initiatives or ideas.Among them are talks on finalising Article Six. Also known as the ""Paris rule book"", this aims to establish rules about how countries and companies trade their emissions reduction units or credits. This has ramifications for Australia's own emerging market for carbon credits, known as Australian Carbon Credit Units, or ACCUs, which are issued by the government's Clean Energy Regulator for abatement and other actions that capture or reduce carbon emissions.\l"

There will have been plenty of negotiators - not to mention journalists - who will have needlessly waited up all night.In fact, COP26 HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Overarching_decision_1-CMA-3.pdftext itself either. As the host and chair of the summit, it is the UK's responsibility to pull together all the negotiating texts which have been submitted and agreed over the last week into a coherent overall agreement. But the widespread consensus among delegates I have spoken to is that the draft they have produced is not sufficiently ""balanced"" between the interests and positions of the various country groupings. And for the chair of such delicate negotiations, that is a dangerous sin. Let's recap. This COP (the conference of the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change) is the designated moment under the 2015 Paris Agreement when countries must come forward with strengthened commitments to act. There are two main areas for this. One is emissions cuts by 2030, the so-called ""nationally determined contributions"" or NDCs. The other, for the developed countries, is financial assistance to the least developed nations.The problem facing the COP is that we know already that, when added together, countries' emissions targets are https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/09/cop26-sets-course-for-disastrous-heating-of-more-than-24c-says-key-reportnot nearly enough to keep the world to a maximum warming of 1.5\'b0C above pre-industrial times, as the Paris Agreement aims for. And the financial promises don't even reach the US$100 billion (\£374.1 billion) a year that was meant to be achieved in 2020, let alone the much larger sums the most vulnerable countries need. So what have the poorest countries - and the vociferous civil society organisations demonstrating in Glasgow - been demanding?First, that NDCs should be strengthened before the scheduled date of 2025. And second, that HYPERLINK https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02846-3at least US$500 billionUrging - not requiringSo what does the UK draft text say? It merely ""urges"" countries to strengthen their NDCs, proposing a meeting of ministers next year and a leaders' summit in 2023. But ""urges"" is UN-speak for: ""You may do this if you wish to, but you don't have to if you don't."" That is not enough to force countries to get onto a 1.5?-compatible path. The text must require them to do so. On finance, the text is even weaker. There is no mention of the US$500 billion demand, although it does call for adaptation funding to be doubled. There is no mention of using the HYPERLINK https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2021/08/23/how-the-world-can-make-the-most-of-new-special-drawing-rightsspecial drawing rightsOf course, developing countries do not expect to get all their own way in the negotiations. But commenting on the overall balance of the text between different countries' positions, one European delegate said to me: ""This looks like it could have been written by the Americans.""It is of course true, as Alok Sharma emphasised in his afternoon press conference, that the text can still be changed. There are several issues on which negotiations are continuing and the text has yet to reflect their progress. Sharma has asked all parties to send in their suggested amendments to the draft and to meet him to discuss their reactions. He will find himself asked for a lot of meetings. But it matters how this early text is drafted, for two reasons. First, the lack of balance means that it is the least developed countries which will have to do the most work to change it. In Paris the French presidency worked the other way round. They drafted an ambitious text and dared the biggest emitters to oppose it. Second, the perceived imbalance could affect the trust in the British hosts. Sharma has built himself a strong reputation over the past couple of years preparing for the COP. He will not want to lose that in the crucial last days ahead.This story is part of The Conversation's coverage on COP26, the Glasgow climate conference, by experts from around the world.Amid a rising tide of climate news and stories, The Conversation is here to clear the air and make sure you get information you can trust.

"COP26","Australia","COP26_Australia137","Could energy crisis derail COP26 talks?","October 25, 2021 Monday","Herald Sun (Australia)","There are fears governments might go slow on renewables in the face of rising power prices, writes DAVID MILLS SOARING gas prices in Europe threaten to trigger food shortages, factory closures and massive job losses, and could get even worse as the weather gets colder, experts have warned.Gas prices have increased by 600 per cent in some countries, causing supply problems for a wide range of industries, including retail, food and agriculture.Some have likened the current situation to the oil shocks of the 1970s. Others say it has the potential to become an even bigger global problem. The crisis is a ""salient reminder that you can't just turn off one part of your energy system and hope for the best"", the head of one of Australia's largest resource industry organisations has argued.Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association chief executive Andrew McConville said the crisis ""highlights that the development of alternative sources of energy is complex and takes time, and we're not at that point yet where there is like-for-like replacement for the energy that comes from hydrocarbons"".In the UK, a comparatively windless few months caused a massive drop in energy production from turbines, sending prices up and forcing a greater reliance on already scarce supplies of natural gas. The energy regulator also took the dramatic step of firing up an older coal-fired power station.Meanwhile in China, a spike in the cost of coal is also prompting increased demand for gas, further exacerbating global supply issues.With energy prices at record highs, 12 provinces have introduced power rationing for businesses and factories, while Beijing has ordered an immediate increase in coal mining.Some commentators have argued China's ban on Australian coal imports has only made their problems worse.One week out from the start of the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, the global energy issues have caused some to question whether there should be a rethink on the rush to embrace renewables such as wind and solar.In Australia, outspoken senator Matt Canavan has cited Europe's energy woes as a reason for his opposition to net-zero targets.The head of the International Energy Agency Fatih Birol has said suggestions the crisis was caused by the transition to renewables were wrong.But he also conceded concerns about renewables ""may become a barrier to the policies we need to enact to make the energy transition work"" if they became ""the dominant voice"".Mr McConville said the energy crisis had the potential to influence negotiations in Glasgow.""My hope is that it underscores the importance of hastening slowly,"" he said. But the current crisis was also a ""reasonably short-term problem. It's one of supply in its purest form,"" he said.Australia was somewhat ""insulated"" from the global volatility in resources other than oil because of our sovereign production capabilities, he said, whereas Europe had become increasingly exposed to price fluctuations as it had moved away from long-term contracts for gas.More and more gas was being traded at spot prices, Mr McConville said. In an influential analysis of the current energy crisis, Nikos Tsafos from the Center for Strategic and International Studies in the US said the supply shortfall was ""being used as a political excuse by both sides of the aisle"".Mr Tsafos said an electricity system run on intermittent energy sources was ""bound to be volatile and produce enormous short-term stress"".But he also pointed out Europe's energy crisis was affecting all countries on the continent, regardless of the level of renewables in their system.Greg Bourne, a former President of BP Australasia and adviser to Margaret Thatcher who is now a member of the Climate Council, rejected the suggestion that Europe's energy crisis was in some way caused by its embrace of renewable energy.""Europe is coming out of an economic depression, effectively,"" he said. ""We've been in Covid and obviously the economic activity was suppressed by that. What we're seeing now is the bounce-back. Demand now suddenly exceeds supply."" Mr Bourne said he doubted the crisis would affect negotiations at COP26. ""One swallow doesn't make a summer,"" he said. ""People see this for what it is - short-term volatility."" But the crisis did illustrate the need for resilience to be built into the energy supply system, he said.""Whether it be energy or food supply, building resilience into a system is really important,"" Mr Bourne said.""Europe does have system resilience but even the best of systems under the largest of stress will have hiccups,"" he said.""Absolutely that will be the case.""SEND US YOUR VIDEO ABOUT HOW YOU ARE HELPING THE ENVIRONMENT missionzero2050.com.au\l"

"COP26","Australia","COP26_Australia140","PM will not go to COP26 policy poor","October 19, 2021 Tuesday","The Examiner Newspaper","Friday's announcement that Prime Minister Scott Morrison will definitely be attending next month's COP26 climate summit in Glasgow is the clearest evidence yet the Liberals believe they are on the cusp of striking a deal with the Nationals over a net-zero-by-2050 emissions target. It would be inconceivable, after all the speculation about Australia's likely position and the PM's reluctance to commit to Glasgow, for him to turn up empty handed. While some world leaders have been prepared to cut Mr Morrison some slack while he gets the recalcitrant - and obsessively self-interested - minor party on board, that was never going to last for ever.If the Prime Minister were to go Glasgow with nothing more in his backpack than a ""preference"" for net zero by 2050 and our already inadequate 2030 targets he would get a mauling from the global media and from the leaders of many other nations.On Thursday, prominent Australian businessman and green hydrogen advocate Andrew Forrest used his National Press Club address to urge the Liberals to go it alone on net zero - thereby risking a Coalition split - if the Nationals won't sign up. He also took aim at renewable energy sceptic Bridget McKenzie and said he had recently spoken to Barnaby Joyce about the issue.His comments came on the same day Reserve Bank deputy governor Guy Debelle warned Australia risked a ""capital strike"" by foreign investors if it did not do more.Mr Debelle's analysis echoed remarks made by the Treasurer Josh Frydenberg in a speech on September 24. While the Prime Minister's shift towards net zero by 2050 is as welcome as it is overdue it should not be allowed to overshadow the fact that the debate has moved on in recent months, with 2030 emerging as a possible tipping point.Australia's current targets, set as part of the Paris Agreement during the Abbott era, are manifestly inadequate and are in need of urgent revision - particularly given many analysts say we are already on track to exceed them despite a lack of federal government leadership. And, with Australians set to go to the polls within the next few months, Labor also has to come clean on what it thinks a desirable 2030 target should be as well.Editorial\l"

Livestock have high carbon footprintsIt is not very efficient to feed plants to livestock when we could eat the plants directly ourselves. Even though cows, sheep and goats can eat grass, unlike humans, they still need lots of land for grazing which could otherwise store more carbon dioxide as natural forests, grasslands or bogs, or in some cases be used to grow plant crops for human consumption. These animals also produce substantial amounts of methane in their digestive systems, which is a powerful greenhouse gas. The carbon footprint of beef and lamb is roughly three times higher than that of pork, poultry or farmed fish per 100g of protein, and HYPERLINK 24 times higher than pulses such as beans and lentils. Livestock produces just HYPERLINK https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaq021618% of global caloriesSmall amounts of meat and dairy have a role in sustainable food systems, while some plants have quite high environmental impacts and some nuts use HYPERLINK https://newrepublic.com/article/125450/heres-real-problem-almondslots of water. But in general, even meat with the lowest carbon footprints still has higher emissions than the highest emitting plant-based foods which are high in protein.2. Reducing livestock production would protect natureFarmland takes up https://ourworldindata.org/land-use50% of Earth's habitable land, and the vast majority of that farmland is used for livestock and their feed. Farming is the leading cause of natural habitat loss, which is the biggest threat to wildlife. HYPERLINK https://www.worldwildlife.org/magazine/issues/summer-2018/articles/what-are-the-biggest-drivers-of-tropical-deforestationBeef production is the top driver of tropical forest loss.Eating more meat means that more natural habitat needs to be cleared and deforested, and the diets of people in high- and middle-income countries can be HYPERLINK key drivers of global deforestation3. Meat production has quadrupled since the 1960sSince 1961, meat production worldwide has quadrupled as meat supply per person has almost doubled (from 23kg to HYPERLINK https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/meat-supply-per-person?tab=chart&country=%7EOWID_WRLmore than 43kg) and the human population has more than doubled (from 3 billion to 7 billion).The number of animals slaughtered each year has consequently skyrocketed. The number of chickens killed each year has increased tenfold since the 1960s (from 6.6 billion to 68.8 billion), pigs have almost quadrupled (0.4 billion to 1.5 billion) and cows have increased from 0.2 billion to 0.3 billion. Meat consumption is also very unevenly distributed. Just as richer countries tend to have higher greenhouse gas emissions, they also tend to eat more meat. For example, the average US citizen is supplied with HYPERLINK https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/meat-supply-per-person?tab=table124kg of meat a year4. More sustainable means more healthyHealthy and sustainable diets HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/28/healthy-diet-means-a-healthy-planet-study-showsbroadly overlap: diets with small amounts of red and processed meat, and high in vegetables, wholegrains and pulses.

"COP26","Australia","COP26_Australia143","\u8216 The biggie' for business at COP26 wasn't saving forests","November 5, 2021 Friday 03:04 PM GMT","AFR Online","Glasgow | The planes, trains and motorways out of Glasgow began to fill up on Thursday evening. World leaders had jetted out of the COP26 climate summit on Tuesday; now it was the turn of the massed ranks of business and finance execs to quit the tent city on the banks of the River Clyde.The summit, which aims to get the world to net-zero greenhouse emissions by 2050 and to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees, will reconvene for its second week with only negotiators, NGOs and the occasional minister still inside the cavernous premises.Come Monday, the exodus means Glasgow's SEC Hydro will feel tangibly thinned out. By consensus, the business presence at this COP has been far larger, and far more senior, than ever before.And that is changing the way a Conference of the Parties (COP) works, and what it might deliver. If this is the ""last chance saloon"", as Prince Charles said, puts it, then business arrived with full saddlebags, ready to rumble.Something has shifted in the business world. The capital is flowing into the energy transition; investors are holding companies to account for their environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance; and the risks and costs of going green are shifting in the climate's favour.""The challenge used to be, how to get mainstream investors to think about ESG issues. That was an uphill battle, and here at this COP you can see that the battle has been won,"" says Fiona Reynolds, CEO of the UN agency Principles for Responsible Investment.The question is whether businesses, financiers and investors can now, in turn, shift government.The corporate crowd used to come to the second week of COP, trying to jockey for outcomes from the inter-governmental negotiations. This time, though, business executives have come the first week with the leaders to drive the terms of debate from the start.They unleashed a blizzard of announcements, pronouncements and denouncements. Pledges, promises and commitments. Initiatives, investments and ideas. Sums of money that were counted in billions of dollars, and by Wednesday even in trillions.Energy Minister Angus Taylor says the growing business presence has given the COP process a whole new feel. ""It changes the dynamic a lot because it's about solving problems, not talking about problems. That's what business people generally prefer.""""That change in focus, certainly from the Australian perspective, has been very, very welcome. And I think it's important that at future COPs, there should be more and more of this,"" he said.Old COP hands say chief executives used to turn up mostly at side events. Now, like Fortescue Metals Group chairman Andrew Forrest, they appear on centre stage with US President Joe Biden.Peter Flavel, the Adelaide-born CEO of British bank Coutts, says that at one business event he attended he asked the five other big-bank bosses if they'd been to a COP before. The answer: not one of them had, but the time had come.Andrew Liveris, the Australian former Dow Chemicals CEO and chairman, says that's because previous COPs had a ""negative vibe"" for business.""CEOs have to be judicious with their time. They want to come somewhere where they feel they will be listened to, and there'll be action from it. Pretty much every COP, with the exception of Paris [in 2015] has not had a reputation for engaging in business in a meaningful way, or for getting anything done,"" he says.But with investors, and even Millennial employees, breathing down their necks, the CEOs were pushed onto planes.""You have to be here, you can't not show your face - it's what investors and stakeholders want to see,"" says the CEO of one major Australian company.But it's not just guilt that has driven CEOs to brave the queues, the cold and the sketchy food. There is a more wholesome combination of self-interest, and enlightened self-interest. The pure self-interest comes from the deals and networking opportunities that come from having so much political and economic power concentrated in such a small space.""It's like a mini-Davos, you can meet so many people,"" says one CEO.David Griffin, boss of Australian company Sun Cable, puts it more pragmatically: ""COP has been a great opportunity to talk to suppliers, off-takers, multiple governments and investors, all under one roof ... It's very efficient.""Santos CEO Kevin Gallagher says the Glasgow atmosphere has brought out something different in his discussions with fellow business leaders.""I'm having meetings here with Australian companies in the context of COP26, whereas if I met them in Australia we wouldn't be talking about these [climate and energy] issues, or not as intensely as we've focused on them here,"" he says.Flavel says even if businesses are focused on deal-making, it brings its own greater good: ""There's a network effect going on here, when you're in a room with your competitors, when you see you're all on the same or similar path.""The more enlightened self-interest is that business cannot push headlong into the energy transition without governments smoothing the road. So the corporate titans came to COP to lean on the politicians and officials who are supposed to be clearing the obstacles.""The pressing point is speed at which all this needs to happen, and what will hold things back is regulation,"" says one Australian business adviser at COP.""Finance has been committed here at COP, there have been great financial commitments. But the gap, potentially, is countries identifying where the regulatory hurdles are; because we all know that fixing those can take years to work through the system.""Not every business had the same agenda. Forrest and his ally, former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, came to disparage carbon capture and storage (CCS) and its promise of blue, or abated, hydrogen. Santos' Gallagher, on the other hand, sprang to its defence.Views differ on how far, and how fast, the transition needs to go, and which technologies and tactics will, or should, prevail.But most businesses agree on a couple of things. They want a carbon price that will create the incentives required. They want targets and deadl"

Really smooth.LAURA TINGLE: Despite the Prime Minister's attempts last week to reposition on electric vehicles with inner city Melbourne MPs, the Government is now sending very different messages to different voters.BARNABY JOYCE: All those people in Glasgow just laying poo on the people in the Hunter Valley. All those billionaires in their corporate jets.LAURA TINGLE: But as often happens with such massive international meetings, things didn't quite go to plan.ALOK SHARMA, PRESIDENT COP26: I also understand the deep disappointment, but I think as you have noted, it's also vital that we protect this package.LAURA TINGLE: Two crucial developments in the dying days of the conference have shored up Scott Morrison's domestic position on climate. A last-minute intervention on coal by India which changed the wording of the final communique from speaking of the 'phasing out' of coal to the 'phasing down' of coal. There was also a watering down of a proposal for nations to come back with more ambitious emissions reductions targets next year, instead of in five years\' time and with a crucial rider.A draft version of the Glasgow agreement circulated on Wednesday urged countries that hadn't upgraded their 2030 targets to do so by the next meeting in November next year. But in the final agreed text, paragraph 29 had changed. Now, only requesting that parties revisit and strengthen their 2030 targets, taking into account national circumstances.REPORTER: Are you ruling out a more ambitious 2030 target for COP27 if you're elected?SCOTT MORRISON: All that happened at COP26 was all countries noted a request to revisit these things, but I've been very clear about what our target is and that we will meet and beat it.ANTHONY ALBANESE, OPPOSITION LEADER: I find it completely extraordinary that 24 hours after the Federal Government signed up to having a higher 2030 target in 2022, they've walked away from that commitment that they voluntarily signed up to in Glasgow.LAURA TINGLE: The upshot is that whatever the communique says, the Government is now claiming legitimacy for its unchanged 2015 emissions reduction targets of 26 to 28 per cent when the goal for Glasgow by major developed economies was twice that and it is claiming that the coal industry has nothing to fear.SCOTT MORRISON: To all of those who are working in that industry in Australia, they'll continue to be working in that industry for decades to come because there will be a transition that will occur over a long period of time. And I make no apologies for Australia's standing up for our national interests, whether they be our security interests or our economic interests.LAURA TINGLE: The PM is now in full campaign mode on the unofficial hustings again in Western Sydney today.REPORTER: Do you regard yourself as the underdog at this election?SCOTT MORRISON: I think that's fairly clear.LAURA TINGLE: Campaigning, of course, means setting up differences between yourself and your opponents and for the PM, seeking to exploit what focus groups are saying is a frustration with intervening governments after two years of lockdowns.SCOTT MORRISON: We're not going to legislate them and regulate them and force them to do things. I think Australians have had a gutful of governments telling them what to do over the last couple of years. The Labor Party loves telling people what to do and the only thing they like doing more than that is taxing then.LAURA TINGLE: Labor have long said it would wait for two things before setting out its own climate change policies - the Glasgow conference and the release of the Government's economic modelling. The modelling was released on Friday and met with widespread derision for its lack of detail. As the Prime Minister says, the modelling is based on the private sector doing things, not the Government. As a result, it is a forecast, not a plan. As we have previously reported, 15 per cent of the reduction in emissions by 2050 come from unspecified further technology breakthroughs. It is also built on a voluntary carbon price of between $24 and $400 a tonne.REPORTER: Prime Minister, this net zero modelling released on Friday appears to show to get to net zero you need a carbon price of between $24 a tonne and $400 a tonne. What's the difference between that and a carbon tax?SCOTT MORRISON: Well, what we have is the cost of abatement that is run through our Climate Solutions Fund.REPORTER: Doesn't that pass cost on?SCOTT MORRISON: No, there's no carbon tax in Australia and there won't be one because we are for technology, not taxes.REPORTER: But that's funded through tax, isn't it? Ultimately, when you are putting out these incentives...SCOTT MORRISON: We're not putting a tax on Australians to do that. Not at all.Talk of another budget before a poll has pushed election speculation into May but the option of a March election on the back of a mini budget contained in a late mid-year budget review in January is still an option if things go well for the Government. At least that would mean just four more months of high-vis jackets on news bulletins every night.\l"

This marginalisation of the oceans largely continued at COP26. Almost four decades ago, 168 states signed up to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea ( HYPERLINK https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdfUNCLOS). Under this treaty, they must address CO? in the oceans consistent with (but distinct from) their obligations under the climate regime.Ocean acidification (OA) is caused by excess CO? in seawater. Atmospheric concentrations of CO? have now reached https://keelingcurve.ucsd.edu/414ppm (from about 280ppm in 1750) and the oceans are a major sink, having absorbed nearly HYPERLINK https://www.un.org/depts/los/global_reporting/WOA_RPROC/Chapter_05.pdfhalf of all anthropogenic emissionsBut rising levels of CO? in the oceans change the acidity of seawater, measured as pH.

Although the Paris Agreement sets a target of limiting average global warming to well below 2? above pre-industrial levels (and aims to keep it at 1.5?), it does not set a target for limiting ocean pH change. HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cop26_auv_2f_cover_decision.pdfGlasgow Climate PactRead more: COP26What the law of the sea saysUnder part XII of HYPERLINK UNCLOS, which has been accepted by all states as part of customary international law, states must take all measures necessary to ""prevent, reduce and control"" marine pollution from any source. States also have a general obligation to protect and preserve the marine environment. Carbon dioxide can be classed as pollution under UNCLOS, and therefore states have an obligation to avoid or control it. UNCLOS requires states to prevent pollution from land-based sources and from the atmosphere. ... adopt laws and regulations to prevent, reduce and control pollution of the marine environment from or through the atmosphere arising from their territory or vessels under their control. However, this is a due diligence obligation: it relates to conduct (effort) rather than result. Article 212 does not specify what states must do to meet their obligation, but stipulates they should take into account internationally agreed rules and standards. International standardsApart from emissions from vessels, there is no agreement on what these internationally agreed rules and standards are.It can be argued the climate regime constitutes these standards, and if states comply with their commitments under the Paris Agreement they have met their obligations under Article 212 of UNCLOS. Supporters of this position assert it is unreasonable to expect states to go beyond their commitments under climate agreements, particularly when UNCLOS provides no additional guidance.On the other hand, if it can be shown that commitments under the Paris Agreement are clearly insufficient to ""prevent, reduce and control"" ocean acidification, it would be anachronistic to say compliance with those standards constitutes ""due diligence"" under UNCLOS.I argue the latter - the due diligence obligation under Article 212 of UNCLOS is not met by compliance with climate regime commitments, except where those commitments expressly relate to ocean acidification or CO? reductions. This conclusion is arguably supported by the UN's 2015 adoption of the HYPERLINK https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal14Sustainable Development Goal 14: Life in the Oceans. One of the goal's HYPERLINK https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal14targets calls for states to explicitly address ocean acidification. This recognises that commitments under the Paris Agreement do not adequately address the issue.COP26 confirmed the climate regime is the main forum for addressing the consequences of climate change. But it is not the only game in town or the only legally relevant regime. UNCLOS requires states to protect the oceans. These obligations must be expressly considered and incorporated into commitments made by states, including New Zealand and Australia, in international climate agreements and their actions to implement these at the domestic level. COP27, to be held in Egypt next year, provides the next opportunity to address ocean acidification and to support a more integrated approach under both the climate change regime and the law of the seas.\l"

It's very profitable at the moment but it is going to run off,"" she said. ""So the people of Newcastle, we the people of Australia, need new industry. We need reskilling for jobs.""Macquarie retains small but shrinking investments in coal, but announced last year plans to reduce this to zero by 2024.Speaking at the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia conference in Sydney yesterday, Wikramanayake said the next 10 years were crucial to addressing climate change, and developing decarbonisation solutions required three to six times more capital invested each year.""Climate change is one of the most critical and complex challenges of our time. When history judges our generations, this will be one of the biggest issues we will be held to account on,"" she said. Wikramanayake said she was optimistic following COP26 but progress had reversed. ""Emissions globally had come down a lot in COVID,"" she said. ""But now, fast-forward six months on, and we are back again. It's surged to peak emissions ... emissions [are] not just high but rising very fast.""Fossil fuels still make up 80 per cent of global energy consumption and Wikramanayake said it was unrealistic for this to change overnight. She said renewables would continue to grow market share but the transition must be done with respect for all affected communities.""People need energy and if we end up creating energy scarcity we could end up losing the mandate for the transition,"" she said. ""We can't ... [say] shut down all the gas, shut down all the oil."" She said fossil fuel usage will rise before falling in the long term. ""We are going to have a pick-up in fossil fuel energy but it's ... pushing the journey to renewables along.""Wikramanayake said the global response to climate change would continue to create opportunities for investors who identify the right companies and industries.Macquarie has invested billions of dollars in the green energy transition since the early 2000s and Wikramanayake called on other investors to follow suit, saying regulatory and technology settings make ""this a good investment area"".\l"
"COP26","Australia","COP26_Australia156","COP26: how the world's militaries hide their huge carbon emissions","November 9, 2021 Tuesday 12:41 PM EST","The Conversation - United Kingdom","Climate change leadership requires more than stirring speeches. It means facing up to hard truths. One truth that governments around the world are struggling with is the immense contribution their militaries are making to the climate crisis.For example, the US Department of Defense is the largest institutional consumer of fossil fuels in the world - and the largest institutional emitter. Two of us worked on a HYPERLINK 2019 study which showed that if the US military were a country, its fuel usage alone would make it the 47th largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world, sitting between Peru and Portugal. In other words, the US military is a more consequential climate actor than many of the industrialised countries gathered at the COP26 summit in Glasgow.Despite the outsized role of militaries, we know surprisingly little about their emissions. This is remarkable given their reach and fossil fuel dependency. Some scientists HYPERLINK estimate that, together, militaries and their supporting industries might account for up to 5% of global emissions: more than civilian aviation and shipping HYPERLINK https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sectorcombined.One reason we know so little is due to militaries being one of the last highly polluting industries whose emissions do not need to be reported to the United Nations. The US can take the credit for that. In 1997, its negotiating team won a blanket HYPERLINK http://www.ipsnews.net/1998/05/climate-us-exempts-military-from-kyoto-treaty/military exemption under the Kyoto climate accord. Speaking in the Senate the following year, the now special presidential envoy for climate, John Kerry, hailed it as "" HYPERLINK https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-105shrg46812/html/CHRG-105shrg46812.htma terrific job"".At present, 46 countries and the European Union are obliged to submit yearly reports on their national emissions under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The 2015 Paris Agreement removed Kyoto's military exemption but left military emissions reporting voluntary. Our HYPERLINK http://www.militaryemissions.org/research into this military emissions gap has for the first time shed light on the dire state of global military emissions reporting. Under-reporting is the norm, as is data that is inaccessible, or aggregated with non-military sources. For example, Canada reports its emissions under multiple IPCC categories, reporting military flights under general transport, and energy for bases under commerical/institutional emissions.Military emissions reporting by the many countries that do not have to report annually to the UNFCCC is even worse. This includes countries with massive military budgets, such as China, India, Saudi Arabia and Israel. HYPERLINK https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2021/world-military-spending-rises-almost-2-trillion-2020nearly US$2 trillionThis vast military imprint on the Earth's atmosphere is not on the formal agenda of COP26. However, hopes are that it will be for COP27 next year, as countries begin to wake up to their huge military carbon bootprint. In June, the military alliance NATO HYPERLINK https://ceobs.org/did-nato-members-just-pledge-to-reduce-their-military-ghg-emissions/announced that it would set concrete targets for it ""to contribute to the goal of Net Zero emissions by 2050"". Meanwhile, countries like Switzerland and the UK, which have passed domestic legislation setting net zero targets, are finally having to face up to the uncomfortable truth that their defence ministries are the largest institutional emitters within government.While military emissions are gaining attention, the culture of military environmental exceptionalism that birthed it will continue to drive the long war that militaries have been quietly waging on the climate. For all their spending power and political influence, militaries are behind the curve on sustainability. This was clear from NATO's additional 2021 pledge to develop a carbon counting methodology for its members to use - an area where militaries are lagging behind other major sectors.Which emissions should militaries count? Should such accounting exercises focus exclusively on fuel use and energy consumption? Or should the operation of the massive, global supply chains - like those run by the US government's HYPERLINK https://www.dla.mil/Defense Logistics Agency HYPERLINK https://6fefcbb86e61af1b2fc4-c70d8ead6ced550b4d987d7c03fcdd1d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/cms/reports/documents/000/004/811/original/CDP_Supply_Chain_Report_Changing_the_Chain.pdf?15758826305.5 times higher than an organisation's own operational emissions. And what about overseas operations, whether overt or covert, or the wider climatic costs of HYPERLINK https://ceobs.org/how-does-war-contribute-to-climate-change/war and peace, such as landscape degradation, deforestation or rebuilding?Western governments, including institutions like NATO, are busy positioning themselves as HYPERLINK https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_184999.htmleaders on the security implications of the climate crisis. Their credibility on climate security, and on climate action more broadly, will be contingent on their willingness to first face up to some difficult truths about their own contribution to climate change. It will also require far more openness and transparency. Both will be vital for delivering real change, rather than more weapons-grade greenwash.There should be no illusions as to the scale of the challenge governments face. War is a dirty business. Militaries are institutionally complex, and procurement cycles last decades, which can ""lock in"" emissions. Things will not change overnight, but what they do not count, we can't see.

While there's still a way to go, progress so far gives some hope the Paris climate agreement struck six years ago is working. Major powers brought significant commitments to cut emissions this decade and pledged to shift toward net-zero emissions. New coalitions were also announced for decarbonising sectors of the global economy. These include phasing out coal-fired power, pledges to cut global methane emissions, ending deforestation and plans for net-zero emissions shipping.The two-week summit, known as COP26, is a critical test of global cooperation to tackle the climate crisis. Under the Paris Agreement, countries are required, every five years, to produce more ambitious national plans to reduce emissions. Delayed one year by the COVID pandemic, this year is when new plans are due. Pledges made at the summit so far could start to bend the global emissions curve downwards.

But the Earth system reacts to what we put in the atmosphere, not promises made at summits. So pledges need to be backed by finance, and the necessary policies and actions across energy and land use. A significant ambition gap on emissions reduction also remains, and more climate action is needed this decade to avoid catastrophic warming.

From the participants' perspective, what, actually, was this COP all about?Sitting in the upstairs room of the Australia pavilion, Ian Learmonth, CEO of the Clean Energy Finance Corp, and Darren Miller, boss of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, agreed that one subject in particular had come up again and again: hydrogen.""We've been talking about hydrogen for decades, but it feels like never has there been so much energy, effort, capital and technological ingenuity put into it,"" Learmonth told an Australia-organised panel.Almost every country's pavilion ran an event on hydrogen. Many had their hydrogen strategy or plan pinned to the wall. And even when the topic wasn't hydrogen, somehow it always came up.Great white hopeThe COP was overshadowed by a growing fear that governments couldn't or wouldn't agree to do enough, nor quickly enough, to arrest runaway global warming. From within that anxious pall, hydrogen - whether grey, blue, turquoise or green - emerged as the great white hope.Although hydrogen is hard to compress and transport, and can be leaky and flammable, the planet-friendly menu of use-cases is compelling.

Emissions in the US, EU and India are also expected to rise.The figures exclude international transport, including air travel.The researchers have warned that if emissions continued at 2021 levels, there was a 50 per chance that the 1.5 degree threshold would be breached in 2032.In order to reach net zero emissions by 2050, carbon pollution cuts at a similar scale to those during the pandemic would need to be replicated every year.""This highlights the scale of the action that is now required, and hence the importance of the COP26Meanwhile, a separate report from research firm Climate Resource says pledges made at the summit have for the first time put the planet on a path to limiting global warming below 2 degrees this century.That marks a significant shift from just two weeks ago, when the UN's latest analysis of commitments made by signatories to the Paris Agreement predicted temperature rise could reach 2.7 degrees by the end of the century.The Climate Resource forecast is largely the result of policies announced since then by the world's largest emitters, China and India.India this week announced it would pursue net zero emissions by 2070, while China - whose president Xi Jinping didn't show up to Glasgow - made a modest update to its previous climate action commitments.China has promised that emissions will peak before 2030, en route to carbon neutrality before 2060.Back in Australia, The Reserve Bank and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority have flagged the global transition to lower emissions will have an impact on the economy, urging financial institutions to properly assess the underlying risk.In a statement on Thursday, both regulators claimed climate abatement policies would impact the value of certain assets and income streams, which will heighten financial stability risks.IN OTHER NEWS:Man linked to Cleo case taken to hospital Eyes on the road: How garbage trucks will use AI to fix worst potholes Broadcaster Alan Jones leaving Sky News ""APRA and the RBA recognise that actions to minimise the environmental impact of their own operations are important and will contribute to broader climate goals,"" the statement reads.""Both APRA and the RBA have been building capacity to conduct analysis and research on these issues, and are actively considering the steps that can be taken to achieve their respective mandates in view of climate-related risks.""The two regulators are currently conducting climate change modelling and its potential impact on the economy.\l"

It is true that with Xi Jinping and possibly Narendra Modi too busy rearranging their stamp collections to attend, the organisers might as well stage Waiting for Godot. But while Vladimir's weary admission in Godot that ""I get used to the muck as I go along"" perfectly encapsulates the numbness BoJo's big show elicits, it would be wrong to dismiss the event as just another display of performance art. After all, in the theatre, the play eventually ends, allowing normal life to resume. In contrast, for all of their hypocrisy, the commitments extracted at Glasgow will have enduring impacts as governments, pummelled by armies of angry activists, create rods for their own backs. Already, well-funded plaintiffs are clogging the world's courts demanding that governments meet emissions reductions targets set years ago; if Glasgow results in even more ambitious promises being legislated, as seems likely, the lawfare will only escalate, further reducing the ability of governments to balance costs and benefits in the face of enormous uncertainties about what is feasible and what isn't. The problem is that potentially reasonable policy objectives have degenerated into all-or-nothing slogans, such as ""net zero"", that are worthy imitators of Mr Micawber's much-ridiculed maxim: ""Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen nineteen and six, result happiness; annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds nought and six, result misery."" And as if rampant Micawberism weren't bad enough, those slogans, along with climate change more generally, have acquired the status and motivating force of political myths. To say that is not to suggest that climate change is a fiction - political myths may mangle the facts, but they are not necessarily fables, fairytales or legends. Rather, they are narratives, often capable of being reduced to catchphrases, that galvanise political actors by investing an event, prediction or cause with cosmic significance, crowding out competing considerations. Those narratives' extraordinary effectiveness is hardly news. In the Republic, which was written 2400 years ago, Plato notoriously recommended myths to rulers as a means of enforcing social cohesion, while Pierre Bayle, the author of the monumental Historical and Critical Dictionary (1697), claimed that monarchs would find nothing that could better divert ""unruly and inconstant"" populaces from their real problems (or create more jobs for those he mockingly called ""diviners"") than apocalyptic projections and ""vain imaginings"".But a long l"
"COP26","Australia","COP26_Australia175","What COP26 is and why Australia has 'failed the brief'","October 29, 2021 Friday","Canberra Times (Australia)","It's been described as the world's ""best last chance"" to solve the climate crisis but there's many other reasons billions of people eagerly await the outcome of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference in Scotland.Better known as COP26 (26th Conference of the Parties), or the Glasgow summit, the international climate change forum is the first to occur since the global pandemic began.After being called off last year, COP26 will mark more than five years since an historic agreement in Paris' COP21 was reached between countries to curb emissions, namely fossil fuels, by the middle of the century.Leaders will need to show what they've done since COP21 to limit rising global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius and set ambitious mid-term targets to achieve by 2030.But it will also be a chance for nation heads to discuss updated targets, following new evidence showing the rising urgency of climate change's impact.By the conference's end, it's hoped there will be a ""Glasgow Agreement"" that would set a higher bar for emissions reductions across the international community.What is the COP26 Glasgow summit and why are we having it? In 1995, in a freshly-reunited Berlin, the United Nations held its first conference of the parties that agreed to the Framework Convention on Climate Change - more commonly referred to as COP.It was a chance for countries around the world to come together and discuss the scientific warnings about a warming planet and what implications that might bring for the future.Fast forward 26 years and some of those warnings have now become reality.Each year since, bar 2020 due to a deadly global pandemic, COPs have been held to assess the impacts of climate change as the situation deteriorates and more recently, set out paths and targets to curb greenhouse gas emissions.The 26th summit in Glasgow, however, is particularly important.READ MORE:Scott Morrison's plan for net zero makes less sense the deeper you look Canberra's European ambassadors urge Australia to make stronger 2030 climate targets ahead of Glasgow summit Net zero: Emissions, low targets put Australia 'dead last' on climate action It will be the fifth conference since countries signed on to the momentous Paris Agreement at COP21.It marked the first legally-binding global treaty on climate change, which set out low but clear targets to curb emissions by 2050 and stop rising global temperatures.The Glasgow summit will be a chance to take stock of what countries have done since then to reach them.Richie Merzian, the climate change director at progressive public policy think tank The Australia Institute, said having more than a hundred world leaders join to discuss climate change showed how significant the next two weeks will be.""The ambition is that getting all the leaders in the same room means that you can actually have a serious conversation about everyone taking on more action,"" Mr Merzian said.Why is it considered the world's ""best last chance"" at climate action? While the 2015 Paris Agreement was promising forward momentum for global climate action, it was criticised for setting the bar on emissions reductions far too low.In the six years since, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), considered the global authority on the subject, has released two assessments and a special report on rising temperatures.The latter report, published in 2018, revealed an increase of just 1.5 degree Celsius by the end of the century was still possible.While no amount of average temperature rise was good news for the planet, the 1.5 degree target would reduce the chances of extreme weather and rising sea levels threatening human health and wellbeing.But to reach that, emissions would have to be reduced by 45 percent from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching net zero around 2050.The race has since become even more urgent.The IPCC's report this year showed the 1.5-degree Celsius mark was expected to be reached or exceeded before 2040 - shaving a decade off earlier estimates.Which inevitably leads us to...How do Australia's plans stack up on the world stage? To put it bluntly, not great.Prime Minister Scott Morrison managed to wrangle out a net zero emissions target by 2050 after fierce debating within the Liberal Party and its Coalition junior partner, the Nationals.It means that Mr Morrison will take a goal to achieve net zero by 2050 that is not legally binding, won't cut fossil fuels, relies on unproven technologies and makes no changes to the existing 2030 target.Instead, Mr Morrison will tell the world stage Australia will ""meet and beat"" its promise to cut 26 to 28 per cent of emissions by 2030 on 2005 levels.Mr Merzian said Australia, which already has a bad reputation on climate change, will look like a national version of a coal lobby.""Australia's contribution to Glasgow is disappointing,"" Mr Merzian said.""The homework was clear - bring a new commitment for 2030. Australia has failed on that brief.""The federal government has also ruled out reductions to methane emissions by 30 per cent at the decade's end - a pledge led by our ""forever friend"" US.To compare, the conservative British government has committed to cut emissions by 68 per cent by 2030.US President Joe Biden has brought the world superpower back into the treaty and pledged a 52 per cent cut.Mr Merzian said Australia's targets meant we were among climate conservative peers, like Saudi Arabia and Russia, who are also among the world's largest fossil fuel exporters.""If you compare Australia to developed, like-minded countries, then it's bringing one of the worst plans to the table,"" he said.""If Australia wants to become besties with Saudi, besties with Russia, then it's made the right moves.""What happens after the summit ends? By mid-November, the world will hopefully have a plan.Country leaders and diplomats will return to their countries and get to work before doing it all again for next year's COP27 in Egypt.But in between the COPs, monitoring will occur to ensure countries are remaining on target.""Then there'll be another COP and another one, and another one, because we're not solving climate change now at the speed that we need,"" Mr Merzian said.""So we'll have to keep grinding because as the UK says, it's the best last opportunity.""\l"

Developed countries agreed to raise US$100 billion a year by 2020. The most recent data only goes up to https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/statement-from-oecd-secretary-general-mathias-cormann-on-climate-finance-in-2019.htm2019, but it shows that just under US$80 billion was raised that year. ""It's likely that we will continue to see consistent growth in climate finance mobilised over the last decade,"" according to Alina Averchenkova, distinguished policy fellow at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change, London School of Economics and Political Science. But as for meeting the 2020 target, ""Our assessment was that we're likely to come up short.""This is a big problem. Climate finance is supposed to help countries like Bangladesh and Mozambique, which are among the world's poorest and most vulnerable to climate change, weather stronger storms and droughts. Since fossil fuels powered the extraction of wealth from these countries over centuries, there's arguably a moral obligation for developed nations to help poorer countries develop sustainably by transferring money and green technology.Failing to deliver the necessary aid on time could push the goal of net zero global emissions by 2050 out of reach, and fatally undermine faith in the world's effort to stem climate change. But developed countries must do more than simply meet the target. Thanks to the reporting of Maryam Charles, we'll hear from two residents of Zanzibar about why some climate finance can leave people feeling worse off. Some projects funded through climate finance end up depriving local people of an income, such as mangrove forest protection in Tanzania that can deny people access to a natural resource they rely on, says Jessica Omukuti, Fellow in Climate Finance at the University of York and a research fellow on inclusive net zero at the University of Oxford. ""At the international level ... there's really very little thought about what 20 square miles of mangroves means for a [Tanzanian] household,"" Omukuti says.Frustration with the UNFCCC process for remedying loss and damage due to climate change is driving some people to seek compensation by other means - by suing the states and companies most responsible for the crisis. Harpreet Kaur Paul, a PhD candidate in climate justice at the University of Warwick, says that ""if domestic courts start finding corporations which disproportionately contributed to the crisis have responsibilities to redress them"", it may make developed countries at COP26 ""come to a political agreement about meeting financing needs"".The Climate Fight podcast series is produced by Tiffany Cassidy with reporting in this episode from Maryam Charles in Zanzibar.

It's a fair bet that both France and China would welcome the opportunity to lead a pile-on - though Xi Jinping won't be in the room.Mr Morrison's decision comes after a remarkable week on the climate change front here and overseas. Both Prince Charles and the Queen, usually extremely wary of becoming involved in the domestic politics of any nation, expressed concern about his possible absence from Glasgow.And, on Thursday, prominent Australian businessman and green hydrogen advocate, Andrew Forrest, used his National Press Club address to urge the Liberals to go it alone on net zero - thereby risking a Coalition split - if the Nationals won't sign up. He also took aim at renewable energy sceptic Bridget McKenzie and said he had recently spoken to Barnaby Joyce about the issue.Mr Forrest had literally put his money where his mouth was earlier in the week when he backed plans by both the NSW and Qld governments to develop multi-billion dollar ""green hydrogen hubs"".His comments came on the same day Reserve Bank deputy governor Guy Debelle warned Australia risked a ""capital strike"" by foreign investors if it did not do more.It echoed remarks made by the Treasurer Josh Frydenberg in a speech last month.""We cannot run the risk that markets falsely assume we are not transitioning in l"

What we're saying is we don't need Congress. We can do it without Congress,"" she repeated.Instead of relying on the CEPP, the administration could reduce emissions by shifting towards electric vehicles, phasing out super pollutants such as HFCs, and making substantial across-government investments in clean energy technologies such as offshore wind and solar, to name but a few.Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry will be fronting Biden's Cabinet team in Glasgow. They'll be there to explain how the country will realistically hit its goals of further reducing emissions by 2030.

In other words, does China's party-state, quasi-Communist model offer the most desirable path forward? Or is the US model of democratic capitalism the better option?By contrast, destructive competition between the US and China would have dire consequences for the climate. First, it would make the international flow and diffusion of green technologies difficult.For example, the US controls advanced semiconductor technologies required for electric vehicles (EVs) while China is leading the world in EV battery technologies. If the nations began restricting tech exports to each other, advancement in electric vehicles would significantly slow.Read more: What is COP26 and why does the fate of Earth, and Australia's prosperity, depend on it?It may also become more complex to establish global standards for new major clean energy technologies such as offshore wind systems.

With a reduced market size, new climate technologies and products would then take longer to become affordable, slowing their global uptake.Second, an effective system for global climate governance requires most nations, if not all, to participate.

"COP26","Australia","COP26_Australia193","World will be watching crucial COP26; Explainer","October 16, 2021 Saturday","Sydney Morning Herald (Australia)","There is plenty to be achieved at the climate change global summit in Glasgow at the end of this month. Environment editor Nick O'Malley reports.It was NASA scientist James Hansen who introduced the wider world to the threat of climate change. His testimony before a US Senate committee in 1988 shook Washington and became a driving force of the global movement to address the threat.That same year, the UN formed the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It was to provide the world with detailed assessments of the science of climate change, to chart the risks and lay out possible responses. Its assessments of global warming were to become the largest scientific peer review process in history. Based on the IPCC's advice, the world negotiated the UN Framework Convention of Climate Change (UNFCCC), which was launched in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.Today, the UNFCCC has 195 national signatories, whose representatives normally gather annually at what is now known as the COP, the Conference of the Parties. COP1 was held in Berlin in 1995. This year COP26 will be held in Glasgow from October 31 to November 12, the event delayed for a year due to the pandemic. The meetings are usually attended by about 10,000 diplomats and negotiators, scientists, activists and people from civil society groups. The significant COPs such as those held in 1997, 2009, 2015 and this year - those at which key commitments are to be renegotiated - generally attract world leaders as well. Prime Minister Scott Morrison yesterday announced he would be going to Glasgow.This year's meeting will be like a UN general assembly crossed with the Davos meeting of the World Economic Forum. Organisers expect more than 100 leaders to attend, along with members of the British royal family as well as corporate heavyweights and celebrities.To many observers, COP26 is the most crucial yet because it will test whether the framework for co-operative emissions reductions agreed to in Paris can, in fact, curb climate change. According to the IPCC, the world has warmed more than 1 degree above pre-industrial levels. Under the Paris Agreement, the parties to the COP undertook to hold warming to under 2 degrees. The same assessment says that to limit warming to 2 degrees we must achieve net zero emissions by 2050, and about 50 per cent by 2030.Thirty years on from Hansen's testimony, The New Yorker magazine asked him if he had a message for the next generation. His response was blunt. ""The simple thing is, I'm sorry we're leaving such a f---ing mess.""The first major climate treaty was thrashed out at the Second Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, the meeting at which the Conference of the Parties was created. The central aim of the UNFCCC was to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations ""at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system"".While this aim has not been realised so far, the COPs were the forums to try to make it happen. The first agreement made under the auspices of the UNFCCC was the 1997 Kyoto protocol, in which 36 developed nations agreed to reduce greenhouse gases during a set period (2008 to 2012) by 5 per cent compared to 1990 levels. Acknowledging that developed nations had already benefited from industrialisation, it allowed for poorer nations to continue to build their carbon-intensive economies. As a result, while signatories to Kyoto reduced their emissions in keeping with the agreement, global greenhouse gas emissions continued to rise, jumping by 32 per cent between 1990 and 2010, according to an IPCC report.A new approach was needed.Have other COPs succeeded?By the most crucial measure - therate at which the world is warming - the process has not yet worked, but it has brought the world to agreement on the scale of the problem and a course of action.Some meetings, such as the gathering in Copenhagen in 2009, have been standout failures. There, divisions between developed and developing nations became even more entrenched, as the former decl"

The Prime Minister made it clear ahead of his arrival that Australia's commitments to reduce emissions would not change for 2030, and committing to net zero emissions by 2050 was predicated on both the significant advancement of existing technologies and the emergence of as-yet-unknown technologies.From the lectern, he chose to deliver a defensive speech, high on nationalism despite the global context.Prospective technological developments were billed as ""the core of the Australian Way"", the slogan developed in domestic political negotiations between the Liberals and Nationals proved\~to be an awkward transplant for\~the international stage.\~The speech was low on urgency: ""Technology will have the answers to a de-carbonised economy, over time,"" Mr Morrison\~told other world leaders.While lacking haste, it was not short of boasts.We're ""ahead of the pack"" on emissions reduction, he said, and will be ""far exceeding our Paris commitment"".He cited the 20 per cent cut thus far as notable progress on the target of a 26 to 28 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030.However, Mr Morrison's take on Australia's efforts\~ignores the low level of ambition that target represents, compared to other developed countries, when it was set six\~years ago.It rings even more hollow when you consider Australia was given exemptions\~under the Kyoto Protocol to continue to increase its emissions when other nations began cutting theirs.World leaders say Australia has not made a safe betIn stating his case for some kind of Australian exceptionalism, the Prime Minister spoke loudly, despite the twin microphones before him.His voice seemed to rebound across the room as he talked around  \~but not directly to  \~the fact that Australia would not commit to greater emissions reduction this decade.The forceful faith in technology-not-yet-known, in decades beyond the end of this one, was in stark contrast to the tenor of those leading the meeting.From the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, there was a plea for immediate action.""Countries must revisit their national climate plans and policies. Not every five years. Every year. Every moment.""Speaking for the host nation, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson reflected the urgency, albeit in terms that could only be described as, well, Johnsonian.""We're in roughly the position  as James Bond,"" he said, ""strapped to a Doomsday device  \~while a red digital clock ticks down remorselessly to a detonation that will end human life as we know it.""""This decade. The science is clear: We only have a brief window left before us to raise our ambitions and  \~to meet the task, that's rapidly narrowing.""And, from Australia's near neighbours in the Pacific, the message was even blunter.""Empty promises of mid-century ambition are not enough,"" Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama said.In failing to offer more action this decade  the main objective of COP26  \~Scott Morrison needed to make a case for Australian exceptionalism.In some sense he succeeded, but not as hoped.""The Australian Way"" seems to have highlighted that this nation, as in past COP meetings, is acting as a brake on climate action, not a ready participant.Which makes it all the https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-02/india-commits-to-net-zero-2070/100587092harder to convince 'developing' countries  \~which includes the likes of China and India  \~to follow suit.Scott Morrison will depart Glasgow with Australia's six-year-old 2030 target unchanged. He may be able to brush off the criticism Australia is copping at COP26, but it is likely to follow him.Frank Bainimarama, the strong man and powerful voice of the Pacific, made it clear that success in limiting climate change should not be left to chance.""We have moral authority,"" he said.

It's surged to peak emissions ... We're back up with emissions not just high but rising very fast.""Fossil fuels still make up 80 per cent of global energy consumption and Wikramanayake said it was unrealistic for this to change overnight. She said renewables would continue to grow market share but the transition must be done carefully and with respect for all affected communities.""People need energy and if we end up creating energy scarcity we could end up losing the mandate for the transition,"" she said. ""We have to be realistic. We can't get going around and saying shut down all the gas, shut down all the oil.""She pointed to the Biden administration's moves to ramp up domestic production of oil and gas following the Russia-Ukraine war to illustrate fossil fuel usage will rise before falling in the long term. ""We are going to have a pick-up in fossil fuel energy but it's also, in parallel, pushing the journey to renewables along.""Wikramanayake said the global response to climate change had created ""tectonic shifts"" right through the economy, which would continue to create opportunities for investors who identify the right companies and industries.Macquarie has invested billions of dollars in the green energy transition since the early 2000s and Wikramanayake called on other investors to follow suit, saying regulatory and technology settings were combining to make ""this a good investment area"".""We've been doing this, it just needs to scale up a lot, lot more if we're going to meet the challenge of sorting this out.

The new commitment Australia announced at Glasgow - getting to net zero by 2050 - came after a protracted series of negotiations with the Nationals, who steadfastly refused to support a stronger interim emissions targets for 2030.The draft text calso called on countries to ""accelerate the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels"".Previous climate summit decisions and the Paris Agreement itself do not so much as mention fossil fuels, focusing instead on emissions.Observers told AFP this was a ""significant first mention"" for fossil fuels, and one negotiator said they were confident the reference would appear in the final text, ""in some form or another"".Asked for a response to the COP26 draft statement, the Minister for Indusry, Energy and Emissions Reduction, Angus Taylor, said ""Australia is an active and constructive participant in the negotiations to ensure a positive outcome for COP26.""COP26 which highlighted our strong record of achievement. While ambition is important, action and outcomes are what matters,"" Mr Taylor said.The Climate Council said the draft COP26 statement was ""relatively strong"".""For the first time, we have a decision text that explicitly calls on countries to phase out coal and phase out fossil fuel subsidies,"" said Climate Council researcher Dr Simon Bradshaw, who is in Glasgow for the summit. Pressure on the Australian government to commit to serious emissions action this decade ""is only going to grow in the wake of ,"" Dr Bradshaw said.CHINA AND UNITED STATES VOW TO WORK TOGETHER ON CLIMATE summit.""This document contains strong statements about the alarming science, the emissions gap, and the urgent need to accelerate action to close that gap,"" US special envoy John Kerry told reporters in a surprise announcement.""It commits to a series of important actions now this decade when it is needed."" The plan is light on concrete targets but heavy on political symbolism at a conference that began with the US and China - the world's two biggest emitters - seemingly at loggerheads.Last week US President Joe Biden criticised the decision of China's President Xi Jinping not to attend the Glasgow summit, saying China ""walked away"".China hit back at the time, but ties appear to have thawed ahead of long-awaited bilateral talks next week.On Wednesday both US and China envoys stressed their countries' collaboration, saying they had agreed to put other differences aside to work on climate.""Both sides recognise that there is a gap between the current effort and the Paris Agreement goals so we will jointly strengthen climate action,"" Beijing's longtime climate envoy Xie Zhenhua said.A document outlining the agreement includes a focus on lowering methane emissions, which Kerry described as the ""single fastest and most effective way to limit warming"".It says the two sides will meet regularly to ""address the climate crisis"". The document also stresses the need to boost emissions efforts in the short term, with scientists warning that emissions efforts before 2030 are crucial for halting catastrophic global warming. The declaration said both countries ""recognise the seriousness and urgency of the climate crisis"".""They are committed to tackling it through their respective accelerated actions in the critical decade of the 2020s,"" the document said.China and US are the two largest emitters in the world and together account for nearly 40 per cent of all carbon pollution.The US has already said it plans to be carbon neutral by 2050, while China announced its intention last month to reach net-zero emissions before 2060.UN chief Antonio Guterres welcomed the US-China pact.""Tackling the climate crisis requires international collaboration and solidarity, and this is an important step in the right direction,"" he said on Twitter.ADAPTATION AND FINANCE ISSUES IN DRAFTCOP26 The agreement - or ""cover decision"" - published by the UK Cop26 presidency, will have to be negotiated and agreed by countries attending the talks.The text called for nations to ""revisit and strengthen"" their decarbonisation plans by next year and said that limiting heating to 1.5C ""requires meaningful and effective action by all parties in this critical decade"".Several large emitters missed the 2020 deadl"
"COP26","Australia","COP26_Australia200","Carbon offsets cannot be the cheap and easy way to net zero","March 23, 2022 Wednesday","Australian Financial Review","Energy transition The only genuine way businesses can meet their investors' ESG expectations is by making real cuts to their carbon emissions a priority.After the meeting of the United Nations climate change conference (COP26) in Glasgow last year, the price of high-quality carbon offsets soared, signalling a brave new era of emission reductions. A centrepiece of that is the development of a global carbon market.In Australia, attention is now on the price of carbon units and the developing market for carbon trading.Carbon prices fell sharply this month after the federal government announced a policy change, which had the effect of releasing contracted supply onto the market. Yet spot carbon prices remain about double what they were a year ago.We expect policy and commercial factors to continue to put upward pressure on the market.Carbon offsets are designed to negate or net out emissions that occur elsewhere in the economy.COP26, numerous listed companies had grasped this point and committed to zero net emissions by 2050. Others have built net zero by 2030 into their planning.The operative word here is ""net"". It's going to be challenging to get to zero emissions, and companies will probably still be emitting some carbon by 2050. So while most emissions reductions need to be achieved through abatement, there will be a need to offset emissions by generating or accessing activities that store carbon.As worthy as it is, merely committing to net zero by 2050 is the easy part. The hard part is the delivery. It requires planning, investment - and cost. Much more than lip service is required of company boards and management if they are to meet the environmental, social and governance obligations increasingly being imposed on them by investors, employees and other key stakeholders.Business has taken a lead in our market. The sharp rise in the spot price of Australian Carbon Credit Units - each ACCU indicating the offsetting of one tonne of carbon - from less than $15 two years ago to about double that flows largely from a sharp increase in corporate demand.However, carbon offsets should not be seen as the easy way out to meet net zero commitments.The only genuine way to achieve net zero is to explore all other ways of cutting emissions before turning to offsets.In the reductions sphere, investors want businesses to make cutting their emissions a priority. They demand companies do what they can to avoid carbon-intensive activities - unnecessary travel, wasteful energy use, and so on. They also want them to replace fossil fuel-based energy with a combination of energy efficiency and renewable energy.The second piece - carbon abatement - occurs as business re-engineers its processes to reduce emission, for example by reducing fugitive gas leakage from pipel"

Australia has roughly a third of the world's uranium, but local interest in ""yellowcake"" had waned along with softer international demand since the Fukushima nuclear power plant explosion in Japan a decade ago.Some professional investors see uranium as a re-emerging potential power source in the rush to decarbonisation. Investment bank Morgan Stanley is bullish on the commodity with a $US49 a pound target for 2024 - it is currently around $US40. Uranium-powered nuclear stations create carbon free energy, a factor that may well become a crucial piece of the energy jigsaw as planners try to match political promises set to be made at the Glasgow climate conference starting on October 31.Over the last 12 months uranium spot prices have rise strongly, moving from under $US30 at the start of the year, though retracing a little in recent days. Moreover, a powerful lift in the share price of leading uranium players such as ASX-listed Paladin Energy suggest that changed attitudes among leaders of developed economies is underpinning the renewal of investor interest. Paladin Energy is now valued at more than $3bn and is up fivefold over the last 12 months, and a string of smaller uranium players are also making big profits for investors.Perhaps the biggest swing factor in changing attitudes has been Japan, the source of the last major nuclear accident which in turn flattened the uranium for almost a decade. Just days ago Japan's new prime minister, Fumio Kishida, repositioned the government suggesting ""it is crucial we restart our nuclear plants"".Meanwhile, almost in unison a string of developments in Europe combined to force a very recent reappraisal of uranium as a commodity with a changed future. In the UK, where 20 per cent of power is nuclear, PM Boris Johnson is set to rebuild the nation's nuclear energy commitment prior to the Glasgow conference. The UK government is expected to match a private consortium's funding to build 16 new ""mini reactors"" in conjunction with the Rolls Royce Group. In France, where 70 per cent of power comes from nuclear, last week President Macron confirmed the role of nuclear in the country's long range electricity plans and announced a $US1bn plan to build the first mini reactor. Even in Germany, the centre of antinuclear activism for decades, things are changing rapidly. On October 14 a set of 25 leading public figures launched a campaign for the country to change course and reverse a plan to close all of its nuclear power stations. The group says Germany is in danger of missing its climate targets if the ""2022 nuclear phase out plan"" goes ahead.For analysts the key issue of whether nuclear power and uranium really will have a renaissance as countries try to match emission obligations.Tim Buckley of the Institute for Energy Economics remains unconvinced: ""All energy prices are lifting just now but nuclear power is a terribly expensive form of power with huge construction costs that only a country such as China is willing to make.""Vivek Dhar, mining and energy commodities analyst at Commonwealth Bank, issued a very sceptical report on the sector earlier this year but is keeping an open mind.""I haven't crunched the numbers in terms of the incremental demand from these new policy announcements, but if nuclear power manages to gain traction as a viable solution to decarbonisation in the power sector, it can lead to more economies embracing the technology,"" Dhar suggests.\l"

A centrepiece of that is the development of a global carbon market.In Australia, attention is now on the price of carbon units and the HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/policy/energy-and-climate/glasgow-could-be-a-turning-point-for-carbon-credits-20211028-p5942ideveloping market for carbon tradingCarbon prices fell sharply this month after the federal government announced a policy change, which had the effect of releasing contracted supply onto the market. Yet spot carbon prices remain about double what they were a year ago. We expect policy and commercial factors to continue to put upward pressure on the market. HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/policy/energy-and-climate/want-to-buy-carbon-offsets-you-ve-got-to-get-past-this-woman-first-20220319-p5a620Carbon offsets are designed to negate or net out emissions that occur elsewhere in the economy. Before COP26, numerous listed companies had grasped this point and committed to zero net emissions by 2050. Others have built net zero by 2030 into their planning.The operative word here is ""net"". It's going to be challenging to get to zero emissions, and companies will probably still be emitting some carbon by 2050. So while most emissions reductions need to be achieved through abatement, there will be a need to offset emissions by generating or accessing activities that store carbon.As worthy as it is, merely committing to net zero by 2050 is the easy part. The hard part is the delivery. It requires planning, investment - and cost. Much more than lip service is required of company boards and management if they are to meet the environmental, social and governance (ESG) obligations increasingly being imposed on them by investors, employees and other key stakeholders.Business has taken a lead in our market. The sharp rise in the spot price of Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs) - each ACCU indicating the offsetting of one tonne of carbon - from less than $15 two years ago to about double that flows largely from a sharp increase in corporate demand.However, carbon offsets should not be seen as the easy way out to meet net zero commitments. The only genuine way to achieve net zero is to explore all other ways of cutting emissions before turning to offsets.In the reductions sphere, investors want businesses to make cutting their emissions a priority. They demand companies do what they can to avoid carbon-intensive activities - unnecessary travel, wasteful energy use, and so on. They also want them to go further and replace fossil fuel-based energy with a combination of energy efficiency and renewable energy.The second piece - carbon abatement - occurs as business re-engineers its processes to reduce emissions - for example, reducing fugitive gas leakage from pipel"

"COP26","Australia","COP26_Australia204","My people beg Australia to quit coal","December 9, 2021 Thursday","Sydney Morning Herald (Australia)","The Fijian Prime Minister writes on the disappointments of COP26 - and on some of the breakthroughs.Less than one month ago, I returned from COP26 - one of the most critical global climate meetings in a generation.The Fijian delegation went to Glasgow with the interests of the Pacific and Small Island Developing States at the centre of our approach. We knew from experience that we were involved in a long-term process.But we also knew that COP26 needed to resolve, as a matter of urgency, a number of issues that were holding up progress on both mitigation of climate change and adaptation to its impacts.While we were pleased that the parties agreed to keep warming to under 1.5 degrees, we are deeply concerned the pledges made so far will not take us there. It is also clear that many, including Australia, have placed far too much emphasis on net zero by 2050, given that the best hope for limiting temperature rise to below 1.5 degrees is contingent on what we do between now and 2030.The agreement in the Glasgow climate pact to review and upgrade 2030 targets by 2022 was therefore one of the most welcome outcomes of . All signatory parties will have to bring greater ambition and more robust policies to COP27 next year, particularly the largest emitters - and Australia is in the top 20 of global emitters.We encourage Australia to reconsider its comments it will not revisit its 2030 targets. The opportunity to contest this was during , not after it. While did not achieve the commitments we need on the whole, it did provide the language and decisions needed to increase pressure on those who continue to shirk their share of the burden.We also need to see more ambition from the Australian government on its dangerous addiction to coal. We understand the place coal occupies in the Australian economy, history and culture but we need to explore how we take this option off the table. Australia is not only in an influential position to phase out coal globally; it could become a centre for energy innovation with its abundance of renewable energy potential.The impacts and costs of climate change are all too real for Pacific islanders, and we can't escape the science. In light of this reality, Fiji went to Glasgow with some very specific objectives on financing for adaptation. We had struggled to get developed countries to follow through on their commitment to mobilise $100 billion a year by 2020. Since Glasgow, we now have an agreement for independent monitoring of those commitments to ensure we achieve the $100 billion target as soon as possible.In that vein, I commend Australia for its new Indo-Pacific Carbon Offset Scheme (IPCOS). Trading in carbon credits will help fill the gaps in financing for adaptation. It is not a long-term solution, nor is it an alternative to action to drive down emissions, but it has merit.Australia's IPCOS will mean that Fijian resource owners and investors in renewable energy can generate carbon units that can be sold to Australian companies at an attractive price. Empowered by the legal framework established by our new Climate Change Act, this creates strong incentives to keep natural resources intact in Fiji and attract investments in nature-based solutions. We are also very pleased that Australia pledged to increase its climate finance commitment by $A500 million for the Pacific and south-east Asia.Agreements like this recognise that, ultimately, the stakes are the same for all of us - survival, plain and simple. Just as we are moving communities to high ground to escape sea-level rise, we keep hold of the moral high ground, and we believe that requires us to do more. We are one of the first countries - if not the first - to adopt a Climate Change Act which means government ministries must now seriously consider the climate impact of every program, every initiative and every expenditure.A growing majority of governments and businesses have discarded the tired notion that economic progress and environmental protection are at odds. Profitable business, strong economies and effective climate action go hand in hand. By taking advantage of the market potential that lies in carbon neutrality, government and business can drive faster decarbonisation - and help avert climate catastrophe.It is time to create a new era for the planet we call home. Political leaders - if they are worthy of the term - have critical levers for change at their disposal. Businesses, state and local governments, local communities, civic organisations, organised labour, faith communities and people everywhere must also champion change. If we can muster courage and good will - and if we seriously consider the price we will pay if our efforts fall short - then I trust we will prevail.Frank Bainimarama is the Prime Minister of Fiji.

Public investment in science is intended to improve understanding about our world and support beneficial societal outcomes. However, for climate change, the science-society contract is now broken.

It's always just been part of what we do.""""Seeing Dad working at a power station all his life, I'm really proud of that.

""There's a bit of a misnomer that tech doesn't happen in the country,"" she said.""There are just as many clever people who have a lot to give to industry in the country as there are in other places, but they might not have had the opportunities.""Aussie Broadband was already in the Latrobe Valley. But it has grown markedly during\~the pandemic, as demand for telco services have risen.It is part of a substantial shift in employment, years in the making.The closure of Hazelwood Power Station led to the creation of an aggressive and innovative state government program to boost local businesses.The Latrobe Valley Authority was originally given a quarter of a billion dollars to fund new projects and help workers transition to jobs in them.Chief executive Karen Cain said\~with its strong networks and relationships, her local team had helped the process along with ""latitude"" to try unproven things.One quick success was training former power station workers in solar panel installation.The longer work is in retooling the community for a HYPERLINK life beyond coal.""I've worked here for 26 years now and the pride and understanding of the contribution that this community has made to the state and beyond has been very important,"" she said.With coal's end date looming, no-one wants to see a transition like the traumatic decades after privatisation last century.Ms Cain said the grief of that time  \~triggered again by the accelerated closure\~of Yallourn  remained a barrier to the change required by global factors like COP26.""People are now more confident about the future\~for a whole range of reasons,\~and there's now a level of good acceptance about what is happening,"" she said.""But it's about where the opportunities are, taking a strengths-based\~approach about what we're good at.""Transition of power to new industriesChris Barfoot toiled for the State Electricity Commission of Victoria for more than three decades.At one point, Mr Barfoot,\~his father and\~ grandfather worked\~in the power stations at the same time.As a lifelong Morwell resident, Mr Barfoot has witnessed\~the community shift to acceptance of the looming end of coal power.""We're seeing this forced transition\~which is now occurring, as we're seeing the criticality of the climate change issues that are occurring,"" he said.""Also, [there is] simply the competition in terms of pricing on renewables, and also the age of the stations.""Are we seeing the acceptance of the inevitable?

He is also under pressure to lift Australia's existing goal of cutting pollution by 26 to 28 per cent by 2030, although that will be much harder to find agreement on.Warning the world was at a ""critical juncture"", Sharma said embracing net zero by 2050 was not enough. He cited the UK's goal of slashing dangerous carbon emissions by at least 68 per cent by 2030 and Japan's promise of a 46 to 50 per cent cut.""Australia is a major world economy,"" Sharma said. ""And if you compare to where other major world economies are, I hope that we could get to 45 to 50 per cent from Australia.""That would mean they'd be comparable with other major economies in the world.""Labor took a 45 per cent target by 2030 to the 2019 federal election - a policy the government claimed would take a ""wrecking ball"" to the economy. Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese has since called Labor's pledge ""a mistake"".But the NSW Liberal government last week promised to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent by 2030, building on the same policy unveiled by the Victorian Labor government earlier this year. Sharma said he has had candid conversations with the Australian government over the need to make much deeper cuts before the end of the decade.""I say to them basically what I say to everyone, which is that we need to do more. If we want to ensure that we are at a point of net zero by the middle of the century, then we have to have ambitious 2030 emission-reduction targets which align with that goal.""A report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in August found a 45 per cent cut by 2030 was essential to meeting the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees. ""But on the current trajectory, we will see an increase of 16 per cent in emissions by 2030 rather than a reduction,"" Sharma said.A spokesperson for the Prime Minister said Australia would take part in the COP26 summit and had a strong record of ""meeting and beating"" its emissions reduction commitments.""We are working closely with the UK on the technology advances that will be needed for the world to transition to a net zero economy. Technology not taxes is the way to tackle climate change, keep the lights on and keep people in jobs. This will continue to be at the heart of Australia's response.""The government has promised to release an updated 2030 projection and its long-term strategy ahead of the Glasgow meeting.The more ambitious action from NSW and Victoria could help the government lift its 2030 target of a 26 to 28 per cent cut to something approaching 35 per cent, but the politics within the Coalition is fraught and most cabinet ministers still do not know what Morrison is planning just three weeks out from the Glasgow summit.Sharma said the urgency of the climate crisis warranted bold decisions from Australia.""Australia is a great friend, and I really want one of my closest mates to come to my party and I want them to sing the same songs,"" he said.""And that in a climate context means more ambition on cutting emissions and it means more support in terms of financing for developing countries.""Asked whether it was possible to achieve net-zero emissions without a price on carbon - which Morrison and Albanese are opposed to - Sharma stressed the international landscape was shifting rapidly.""I mean, even China now has an emissions trading scheme,"" he said.""It is internationally acknowledged that countries are going to have to domestically and internationally address the whole issue of carbon pricing and carbon leakage - every country will have to get there.""And so my advice to any country is to start to think about this now.""Sharma also thanked the Morrison government and Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor for assisting Pacific islands attendees with travel to the Glasgow event.More than 20,000 people are expected to arrive in the Scottish city during the first two weeks of November.Johnson recently said the gathering would be held ""in the full glare of the global spotlight"".""And when the summit ends, when most of the world has committed to decisive, game-changing action, it will be clear to all which of us has lacked the courage to step up,"" he said.""The world will see, and your people will remember, and history will judge.""Get a note direct from our foreign correspondents on what's making headl"

Given that most coal plants in the developing world are relatively new, retiring them early also risks heavy financial losses for their owners. The idea of a just transition (though subject to debate) in the coal power sector would involve supporting miners and other workers to retrain and use their expertise to contribute to new or established low-carbon sectors, including renewable energy. Industrial strategies that follow this path could avoid some of the worst deprivation which has HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/ending-coal-use-blighted-scottish-communities-a-just-transition-to-a-green-economy-must-support-workers-170003blighted coal communitiesThere are no insurmountable technical barriers to replacing coal in power generation either.

"COP26","Australia","COP26_Australia210","COP26: How will the Oz soft-shoe climate shuffle be received?","October 24, 2021 Sunday 05:00 AM GMT","The Sydney Morning Herald (Australia) - Online","In 1997 leaders from around the world met in Kyoto, Japan, to sign an agreement on curbing emissions to fight climate change. In its 20 pages there is a passage that became known as ""the Australia clause"".Article 3.7, which the Howard government's environment minister Robert Hill pushed for during the Kyoto talks, allowed Australia to reach the targets set for it by including in the carbon ledger emissions saved due to new state laws preventing farmers from clearing land, rather than by significantly reducing emissions.No one can deny that Australia kept its side of the bargain struck in Kyoto. But just on a week before the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow begin, the nature of that bargain is precisely what worries those organising the talks. If the 2015 Paris Agreement's vision of holding warming to 1.5 degrees is to stand a chance of being met, it will not be enough to observe what one senior United Nations official calls the ""creatively ambiguous"" letter of the deal; nations will have to live up to its spirit. And for Australia and others, that means committing to deeper emissions cuts.""We are on the verge of the abyss and we cannot afford a step in the wrong direction,"" said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres when asked five weeks ago about the prospects for the Glasgow talks. ""I'm not desperate, but I'm tremendously worried.""When it was signed, the Paris Agreement went nowhere near meeting its declared targets. Instead nations agreed to commit to their voluntary targets known as Nationally Determined Contributions that ""reflect the highest possible ambition"".Then, as years went on, they were expected to increase those targets. If nations lifted their targets, the world might hold warming to 1.5 degrees.Yet so far Australia has made no move to rachet up the pledge Tony Abbott made at the Paris talks to reduce Australian emissions by 26 to 28 per cent by 2030. Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce says it is unlikely that his party would support an improved commitment, even as Prime Minister Scott Morrison continues negotiations with Joyce and his party room over what commitments the Coalition can accept.Despite this uncertainty, a broad picture of what Australia might offer the world is emerging from the political white noise, and the world is taking notice.The Australian government's ""preference"" for hitting net zero by 2050 now appears likely to become a firm commitment, with Morrison telling colleagues he plans to forge ahead even without the support of a small group of Nationals critics.But the 2050 target is just the price of admission, says Professor Frank Jotzo, director of the Centre for Climate and Energy Policy at the Australian National University; it is the lowest hurdle a nation can clear to be taken seriously at the talks.In Glasgow the focus will be on 2030 targets. Most observers now believe that Morrison will travel to Glasgow armed with evidence that Australia is likely to beat its 2030 target by a healthy margin, potentially bringing its reductions close to 40 per cent.Would such a projection satisfy Australia's international peers? Not all of them, says Jotzo, also a lead author on the key climate reports prepared by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.Jotzo says Australia is already out of step with what many other nations have pledged.As Alok Sharma, the British cabinet minister who is president of the COP26 talks, puts it, the Group of 20 wealthy nations emit 80 per cent of the world's greenhouse gas pollution and are the key to preventing catastrophic climate change.Among G20 nations, Australia has the second-highest per person emissions after Saudi Arabia and will be among the last to commit to net zero. It has among the weakest 2030 targets and will be one of the few not to increase them.Jotzo also notes that in having such high per capita emissions, Australia has greater opportunity for reductions.

Patrick, the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said there's a tinge of disappointment around the outcomes from Glasgow. How do you read the summit agreement?PATRICK SUCKLING, FMR AMBASSADOR FOR THE ENVIRONMENT: I think it's a significant step forward. I mean, more needs to be done but significant things have been achieved at COP. So I think the Prime Minister has been a little bit unkind to himself. I mean, number one, ambition has been significantly raised in terms of climate action. Ambition, not only at the lead up to the COP but at the COP, 90 per cent of global GDP is now covered by net zero commitments. LEIGH SALES: If the world abides by what's been agreed at Glasgow, how much warmer will the planet be by say 2100? It sounds like you think that 1.5 degrees is still achievable?PATRICK SUCKLING: Yes, 1.5 degrees is definitely achievable and some analysis around the COP said that already from the commitments made, about 2.4 degrees was achievable, if not 1.8 degrees. So given that this is the first year actually of the Paris Agreement kicking off and this is a critical decade of climate action, I'm pretty confident the 1.5 degree pathway is still achievable, especially as the COP has asked countries to come back next year with new plans, and further ambition, more actions in addition to the kind of commitments there are a range of initiatives, as you know, the methane pledge, the deforestation pledge but very significantly, this COP in my experience as ambassador, way more than ever before, the presence of business and the business community understanding the imperative of climate action but also understanding the opportunities, the economies moving in that direction and businesses is at the COP like never before. In fact, standout outcome from business was 220 asset managers aligning $130 trillion to net zero emissions which in itself will drive significant action faster and further.LEIGH SALES: The summit document calls for a phasing down of coal. It says nothing about gas and oil production. What's the significance of that?PATRICK SUCKLING: The significance of phasing down coal is that's never been explicitly mentioned before though. Of course, the Paris Agreement by implication means that fossil fuels or unabated fossil fuels have to go and that's the change you're seeing in the global economy. Over time, coal will go, the curtains are closing on coal. Everybody recognises that and this summit made that much more explicit for the first time ever in agreed text.LEIGH SALES: Is it fair to say that at this point, whether the world will make significant progress on global warming is going to come down to the actions of a relatively small number of powerful nations, chiefly China, India and the US?PATRICK SUCKLING: The big emitters matter, obviously. The US and China are a good 40 per cent of global emissions and the agreement that they made at COP is significant in of itself given the hostilities between them and strategic competition between China and the United States but the agreement that they made on climate change is a major step forward. But everyone has to play their part and everybody coming to the COP and underlining the urgency of climate action and underlining their own commitments, reinforces global resolve, including for the big emitters.

But the truly dangerous radicals are the countries that are increasing the production of fossil fuels. Investing in new fossil fuels infrastructure is moral and economic madness,"" he continued. ""Some government and business leaders are saying one thing - but doing another. Simply put, they are lying."" Addressing the world's population, he said: ""Demand that renewable energy is introduced now - at speed and at scale.""The IPCC report said actions such as drastically cutting fossil fuel use, growing forests and eating less meat were needed to contain global warming to 1.5C above\~\~pre-industrial temperatures.Despite climate change warnings issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) since 1990, global emissions have continued to rise in the last decade, reaching their highest point in history.The result: global emissions are on track to blow past the 1.5C warming limit envisioned in the 2015 Paris Agreement and reach some 3.2C by century's end.""We left COP26 in Glasgow with a naive optimism, based on new promises and commitments,"" Guterres said.""But current climate pledges would (still) mean a 14 per cent increase in emissions. And most major emitters are not taking the steps needed to fulfil even these inadequate promises.""At this point, only severe emissions cuts in this decade across all sectors, from agriculture and transport to energy and buildings, can turn things around, the report says. Even then, governments would also need to bolster efforts to plant more trees and develop technologies that could remove some of the carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere after more than a century of industrial activity.""It's now or never,"" IPCC report co-chair Jim Skea said in a statement with the report \- the last in a three-part series by the IPCC, with the next review cycle not expected for at least another five years.While other recent IPCC reports addressed the latest findings in climate change science as well as ways for the world to adapt to a warmer world, Monday's tackled ways of curbing emissions \- making it one of the more contentious reports of the pack for governments.Some scientists described the process as ""excruciating,"" and the IPCC was forced to delay the report's public release by six hours on Monday.Final approval of the report's key summary for policymakers - which requires sign-off from all countries - followed a marathon weekend overtime session as government officials quibbled over the wording.""Different countries have different interests,"" IPCC co-author and climate scientist Jan Minx.

It also increases vulnerability to tropical cyclones, storm surges and coastal flooding.Maina Talia, secretary of the Tuvalu Climate Action Network, said the survival of his homeland of three reef islands and six atolls, halfway between Australia and Hawaii, depended on the world's willingness to end its addiction to fossil fuels.""It is also imperative that rich polluting countries like Australia significantly increase financial assistance to help us adapt to the impacts of climate change that are already here,"" he said. Australia has formally committed to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 26-28 per cent by 2030 on 2005 levels under the Paris agreement, but the government says it is on track for a cut of 34 per cent on current settings.While Labor has set a target for cuts of at least 43 per cent in the same timeframe, a new report released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report this week said the world needed a 45 per cent reduction in emissions by the end of the decade and is on track for a 14 per cent increase.The next COP - in 2023 - will be hosted by the United Arab Emirates.\l"

This year it is all about keeping them.Climate and sustainability consultants say six months ago the most frequently asked question by corporate Australia was what commitments they should be making in the lead-up to the United Nations climate change conference () in Glasgow.Fast forward six months, under increasing scrutiny and pressure from internal and external stakeholders, the conversation and tone has changed.""It's all about delivery,"" says Andrew Charlton, who spearheads Accenture's sustainability services.Given that most environmental targets are long-term, companies are being pressured to chunk them down into near-term demonstrable milestones.""Investors, activists, customers and staff are demanding to know what a 2050 target looks like in two years' time,"" PwC ESG leader Liza Maimone says.To appreciate just how far the needle has moved on climate action, Climate Energy Finance director Tim Buckley points to Origin Energy boss Frank Calabria's decision in February to close the nation's biggest electricity generator, the Eraring coal-fired power plant, seven years early in 2025.The announcement generated a mere whimper of media attention and government response compared with the furore surrounding AGL's flagged closure of the Liddell power plant back in 2019. Energy Minister Angus Taylor was not even consulted.At the same time, energy security concerns arising from the Ukraine-Russia conflict have accelerated the decarbonisation plans of companies like Visy Industries, even as it sends oil and gas prices through the roof.""It's a real point of inflection as they make this shift from commitment to delivery and the first step is how do we get a handle on the picture of where we're at, how we're going to measure it, and then report,"" Charlton says.Once ESG commitments are ushered out of the boardroom onto the factory floor, execution gets granular and often boring. It entails tweaking or embedding a myriad of mundane changes into existing operations and transformation agendas.""We're entering a phase of realism,"" Charlton says.Companies are becoming more sophisticated in the way they think about ESG.Although climate is the sexy topic de jour and every CEO is expected to have a view, a position and a commitment, some companies, upon conducting their materiality matrix, are finding that climate does not necessarily occupy the top right-hand corner, or that it's not alone there.Healthcare companies, for example, may have a relatively low environmental footprint but a high social impact because of the size of their workforce and duty of care to vulnerable people.Maimone agrees that companies are becoming better at assessing material issues and being able to tell that story. But given the magnitude of the global energy transition, she's yet to encounter an entity for which climate didn't rank in the top three strategic priorities.""Climate is going to be an economy-wide impact, so it can't be discounted,"" Maimone says.""This is the next industrial revolution. [It will] shift our entire economy and way of doing things.""You very quickly get to a highly complex problem for which we don't have all the solutions today. It can only be solved with great collaboration and partnerships.""Mainstream acceptance of climate change as a transformational economic disruption facing business and public policymakers has heightened calls for ESG expertise on boards.A cursory glance through the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Report of the ASX 200 will show climate risk and ESG repeatedly raised as leading strategic risks and opportunities. Which begs the question, is there corresponding depth of boardroom experience?EY's climate change and sustainability services partner Adam Carrel says what is readily available is almost exclusively focused on disclosure.He is concerned about ""a huge gap in ESG corporate education"".Maimone agrees that a gap exists when it comes to base-level ESG skills and capability across corporate Australia. It will require significant investment to get it on par with current levels of digital competency.In the meantime, how companies respond to climate-related interrogations will have far-reaching consequences, according to Stewart Investors' senior investment specialist, Pablo Berrutti.""Many global investors right now see the ASX as a market highly exposed to climate change risks, and will be watching closely to see how companies, as well as our national policy settings, are responding,"" Berrutti says.Executives argue that a lack of globally consistent ESG reporting standards are preventing them from effectively articulating their climate transition plans and performance. It is directing money into the wrong assets, BHP boss Mike Henry warned The Australian Financial Review Business Summit earlier this month.In a scathing assessment of ESG reporting methodologies, Professor Robert Kaplan, a doyen of balanced scorecard reporting, points out that attempts to aggregate heterogeneous, diverse metrics into a common ESG performance statement introduces highly subjective judgments fraught with personal assumptions, bias, and error.""Each of ESG's three domains has unique measurement opportunities and challenges, a nuance that ESG advocates rarely acknowledge,"" he says.As a result, ESG in its current form is more a buzzword than a solution to expanded demands for information on corporate performance.Kaplan's warning is starting to resonate.At a meeting earlier this month, the International Federation of Accountants discussed the possibility of fast-tracking its COP26 commitment to develop a consistent and rigorous set of sustainability reporting standards from the current patchwork.AFR\l"

""We are extremely proud that, after... research, trials and value-chain collaboration, its potential has been recognised with this historic market approval.""Studies show a quarter-teaspoon of Bovaer per cow per day consistently reduces enteric methane emissions by about 30 per cent for dairy cows and up to 90pc for beef cows. Methane has a global warming potential 28 times greater than carbon dioxide, which is why reducing methane emissions was identified at COP26 as one of the most significant short-term means of tackling climate change. More than 100 governments pledged to cut methane emissions by 30pc by 2030, as part of the Global Methane Pledge.The European Commission's confirmation of approval noted the innovative feed additive was safe for use without impacting the quality of dairy products and was the first of its kind to be available within the EU.\l"

But the truly dangerous radicals are the countries that are increasing the production of fossil fuels. Investing in new fossil fuels infrastructure is moral and economic madness,"" he continued. ""Some government and business leaders are saying one thing - but doing another. Simply put, they are lying."" Addressing the world's population, he said, ""Demand that renewable energy is introduced now - at speed and at scale.""The IPCC report said actions such as drastically cutting fossil fuel use, growing forests and eating less meat were needed to contain global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures.Despite climate change warnings issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) since 1990, global emissions have continued to rise in the last decade, reaching their highest point in history.The result: global emissions are on track to blow past the 1.5C warming limit envisioned in the 2015 Paris Agreement and reach some 3.2C by century's end.""We left COP26 in Glasgow with a naive optimism, based on new promises and commitments,"" Guterres said.""But current climate pledges would (still) mean a 14 per cent increase in emissions. And most major emitters are not taking the steps needed to fulfil even these inadequate promises.""At this point, only severe emissions cuts in this decade across all sectors, from agriculture and transport to energy and buildings, can turn things around, the report says. Even then, governments would also need to bolster efforts to plant more trees and develop technologies that could remove some of the carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere after more than a century of industrial activity.""It's now or never,"" IPCC report co-chair Jim Skea said in a statement with the report \- the last in a three-part series by the IPCC, with the next review cycle not expected for at least another five years.While other recent IPCC reports addressed the latest findings in climate change science as well as ways for the world to adapt to a warmer world, Monday's tackled ways of curbing emissions \- making it one of the more contentious reports of the pack for governments.Some scientists described the process as ""excruciating,"" and the IPCC was forced to delay the report's public release by six hours on Monday.Final approval of the report's key summary for policymakers - which requires sign-off from all countries - followed a marathon weekend overtime session as government officials quibbled over the wording.""Different countries have different interests,"" IPCC co-author and climate scientist Jan Minx.\~""Everyone wants to make sure that their concerns are addressed ... but scientists have the last word.""with Reuters\l"

"COP26","Australia","COP26_Australia230","\u8216 A matter of survival': What's COP26?","October 15, 2021 Friday 05:53 PM GMT","The Sydney Morning Herald (Australia) - Online","It was the NASA scientist James Hansen who introduced the wider world to the threat of climate change. His testimony before a US Senate committee in 1988 shook Washington and became a driving force of the global movement to address the threat.That same year, the United Nations formed the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It was to provide the world with detailed assessments of the science of climate change, to chart the risks and lay out possible responses. Its assessments of global warming were to become the largest scientific peer review process in history. Based on the IPCC's advice, the world negotiated the United Nations Framework Convention of Climate Change (UNFCCC), which was launched in Rio in 1992.Today, the UNFCCC has 195 national signatories, whose representatives normally gather annually at what is now known as the COP, the Conference of the Parties. COP1 was held in Berlin in 1995. This year COP26 will be held in Glasgow from October 31 to November 12, the event delayed for a year due to the pandemic. The meetings are usually attended by around 10,000 diplomats and negotiators, scientists, activists and people from civil society groups. The particularly significant COPS such as those held in 1997, 2009, 2015 and this year - those at which key commitments are to be renegotiated - generally attract world leaders as well. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has announced he will be going to Glasgow.This year's meeting will resemble something like a UN general assembly crossed with the Davos meeting of the World Economic Forum. The COP has not yet said which leaders have confirmed their attendance but organisers expect more than 100 will be there, along with members of the British royal family, corporate heavyweights and celebrities.To many observers, COP26 is the most crucial yet because it will test whether or not the framework for co-operative emissions reductions agreed to in Paris can, in fact, curb climate change. According to the IPCC, the world has warmed more than 1 degree over pre-industrial levels. Under the Paris Agreement, the parties to the COP undertook to hold warming to under 2 degrees. The same assessment says that to limit warming to 2 degrees we must achieve net zero emissions by 2050, and around 50 per cent by 2030.Thirty years on from Hanson's famous testimony in Washington, HYPERLINK https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/listening-to-james-hansen-on-climate-change-thirty-years-ago-and-now The New Yorker magazine asked him if he had a message for the next generation. His response was blunt. ""The simple thing is, I'm sorry we're leaving such a f---ing mess.""So, how did we get here? And what needs to be achieved at Glasgow?How did we get here?The first major climate treaty was thrashed out at the Second Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 - the meeting at which the Conference of the Parties was also created. The central aim of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations ""at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic (human-induced) interference with the climate system"".While this aim has not been realised so far, the COPs were the forums to try to make it happen.The first agreement made under the auspices of the UNFCCC was the 1997 Kyoto protocol, in which 36 developed nations agreed to reduce greenhouse gasses during a set period (2008 to 2012) by 5 per cent compared to 1990 levels. Acknowledging that developed nations had already benefited from the process of industrialisation, it allowed for poorer nations to continue to build their carbon-intensive economies. As a result, while signatories to Kyoto managed to reduce their emissions in keeping with the agreement, global greenhouse gas emissions continued to rise, jumping by 32 per cent between 1990 and 2010, according to a 2019 IPCC report.A new approach was needed.Have other COPs succeeded?By the most crucial measure - the rate at which the world is warming - the process has not yet worked, but it has seen the world agree on the scale of the problem and a course of action.Some meetings, such as the gathering in Copenhagen in 2009, have been standout failures. There, divisions between developed and developing nations became even more entrenched, with the former declining to set concrete reduction levels by 2020 and the latter insisting on their right to carbon-intensive growth.In the dying hours of two weeks of negotiations, the US delegation couldn't even find key players from the major developing nations bloc, let alone negotiate with them. At the last moment US president Barack Obama, still as much a global superstar as politician after his startling election victory the year before, flew in, hoping to force a useful outcome.In her memoir, then-secretary of state Hillary Clinton recounts discovering that China was hosting a secret meeting attended by leaders of high-emitting emerging economies including from India, Brazil and South Africa.She recounts racing down long corridors with Obama, their staff in tow, before ducking into the meeting room as White House press secretary Robert Gibbs tangled himself up with Chinese security guards at the door. Those inside were stunned. Despite her breezy description of diplomatic derring-do, all that came of the Copenhagen COP was a political statement affirming the need to keep warming to 2 degrees, with no attendant commitments as to how that might be done.After Copenhagen, crucial years were lost as emissions continued to rise. COP meetings rolled on and something like a consensus formed that the replacement for the expiring Kyoto Protocol would be negotiated in Paris in 2015.What was agreed in Paris (and what's the \' ratchet effect')? Two principles were made central to the talks in Paris, both designed to help overcome the critical gulf between richer and poorer nations: all nations would commit to voluntary emissions cuts but wealthier countries would help pay for the developing world to meet their targets and adapt to a warmer world.Developed nations agreed to make their emissions peak as soon as possible, and then decl"

But this year, the government turned to another great Aussie export to win hearts and minds: the flat white.For the first time, Australia hosted a ""pavilion"", becoming one of 80-plus countries, organisations and campaigns to set up a showcase and meeting space in the venue's vast exhibition hall.The Australian pavilion was set up as a mini-cafe, with promotional videos dominating one wall, a few companies touting their wares around the edges, and - most importantly - a coffee machine and barista in one corner.It instantly became a magnet for the Aussie crowd. On a given morning, you might see OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann having a quiet coffee with Rio Tinto chief executive Jakob Stausholm, or globetrotting businessman Andrew Liveris bumping into Santos CEO Kevin Gallagher.When he wasn't meeting Joe Biden or Al Gore, Andrew Forrest and his Fortescue Future Industries team were a near-permanent fixture at one end of the pavilion, next to a Tardis-like installation they had produced to help promote Twiggy's green hydrogen campaign.Australia's band of COP-attending environmentalists, including Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, also dropped in, though some raised an eyebrow at Santos' carbon capture and storage exhibit.High Commissioner to the UK George Brandis kept a stately eye on proceedings, while Energy Minister Angus Taylor held meetings or gave presentations in the private room upstairs.Gradually, though, the Aussie secret got out: word crept out into the broader conference about the quality of the coffee.The choice was simple: you could stand in a queue elsewhere at COP for 20 minutes and buy a crap coffee for almost $5, or you could queue for five minutes and get an Australian-quality one for free.The queue was suddenly full of student representatives, Pacific Island negotiators, and random passers-by. It got longer and longer - and made Australia's pavilion one of the busiest on site.As they waited, the freebie-seekers' eyes might have fallen on promotional displays not just from Santos and Fortescue, but others such as Sun Cable and CO2-into-bricks start-up Mineral Carbonation International.""Good coffee, good company. But most important, this is Aussie companies doing amazing things. That's what I liked most of all,"" Taylor tells AFR Weekend.He's sold on the concept. ""When we left Madrid [the 2019 COP], I said, \' Next time, this is what we're doing'.

"COP26","Australia","COP26_Australia233","PUTIN, XI PROFIT FROM MEDIA'S CLIMATE MYOPIA","March 21, 2022 Monday","The Australian","As fracking looks set to make a comeback in Britain in the wake of sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, it's worth reflecting on the role of Russian disinformation in the global environmental campaign against the hydraulic fracturing of underground gas-bearing shale and coal deposits.Several British newspapers have reported Prime Minister Boris Johnson is open to ending the ban on fracking, which was imposed in 2019. The London Daily Telegraph reported on March 10 that Foreign Secretary Liz Truss was pushing for the lifting of the ban and quoted a spokesman for Johnson saying ""all options would be considered"". Johnson had personally intervened ""to stop the concreting in of England's only two viable shale gas wells"", the newspaper said.And Russian disinformation? Matt Ridley reported in The Sun on March 15 that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian gas monopoly Gazprom, the world's largest publicly listed gas company, had criticised fracking for years to protect the price of Russian gas being exported to Europe. The success of the fracking revolution in the US had put downward pressure on global gas prices.Lest anyone think Ridley was just doing the bidding of the Murdoch media, there is plenty of evidence from the US congress and from left-wing news sources that Russian trolls had been pumping out false information about fracking for years.The Guardian reported Russia was behind attempts to discredit fracking on June 20, 2014. It quoted former NATO secretary-general Anders Fogh Rasmussen saying ""as part of their sophisticated information and disinformation operations"", Russia engaged with environmental organisations working ""against shale gas to maintain European dependence on Russian gas"".The Chicago Tribune went further, reporting on March 1, 2018, that Russian troll factories had used Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to inflame US political debate over climate change. It quoted a report from the House science, space and technology committee providing evidence Russia used social media to inflame concern about fracking.US political website The Hill noted on March 1 this year the Guardian's Rasmussen report, and said the US media and Democrats had ignored evidence of Russian disinformation attempting to distort the US energy market. The Hill reveals a 2017 letter by Texas Republicans Lamar Smith and Randy Weber to then Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin quoting former secretary of state Hillary Clinton telling a private gathering in 2016: ""We were even up against phony environmental groups, and I'm a big environmentalist, but these were being funded by the Russians."" Much of the Western world's media is so tied up in environmental campaigning it can't even see the trap many democracies are sleepwalking towards. Here there has been little media mention of renewed interest in preserving old coal-fired power stations in Germany and Britain, or a wider push by the EU to open the way for new oil and gas drilling in the North Sea.The London Telegraph reported on March 16 that the British government was looking at watering down ""net zero"" rules on North Sea exploration so the UK could wean itself off Russian gas. The gas shock comes after months of high energy prices over winter when renewables generation faltered across Britain and much of the EU.Reuters quoted German Finance Minister Christian Lindner on March 13 saying Germany should rethink its ban on new North Sea oil and gas drilling. ""Against the changed geopolitical background, I think it is advisable to examine the entire energy strategy of our country without any prohibitions on thinking,"" Lindner said. Germany is Russia's biggest gas customer.The EURACTIV EU news website quoted several German politicians and energy specialists on March 10 confirming Germany would now need to keep some coal power stations - that were scheduled for closure - open and in reserve, as the nation started to wean itself off Russian gas. Germany has effectively bankrolled Putin's military with its gas purchases.It's no wonder neither Putin nor China's leader-for-life Xi Jinping attended the Glasgow COP26 climate conference last year. China and Russia, the biggest and fourth-biggest CO2 emitters respectively, will not be meeting net zero emissions targets by 2050. But they most certainly will be attempting to profit economically and politically from the decisions of other nations to do so.The Carnegie Foundation's Moscow Centre news site sets up Putin's view, in a piece published last September. ""Worryingly, while Russia acknowledges the dangers of a rapidly warming world, it does not appear to be preparing for a transition. Putin has even hinted at a potential brighter future for Russia thanks to climate change: one in which it is an agricultural powerhouse in a famine-stricken world; and where the Arctic makes Russia's strategic position in trade routes indisputable."" China was praised at COP26 for promising in September to stop building coal-fired power stations outside China as part of its Belt and Road Initiative. Media dupes accepted this as a face-value sign of Xi Jinping's commitment to net zero by 2060. Yet China signalled early this month a massive increase in its domestic coal production.Bloomberg reported on March 13 that China wants domestic coal production increased by 300 million tonnes a year. Total Australian annual thermal coal production is 550 million tonnes, so China's domestic increase is about 60 per cent of our total annual output, most of it exported. China depends on coal for about 60 per cent of its electricity.Meanwhile, our media continues with fraudulent reporting suggesting both China and India (the world's third-biggest emitter) are phasing out coal. Environment writers here applaud the early closure of coal-fired power plants as part of an energy transition that promises to produce far more challenges than most journalists understand. This column made those technical challenges clear in an interview with former Energy Security Board chief Kerry Schott, published on February 28.And the prissy ABC Media Watch program continues to police journalists straying from a strict climate change agenda as the national broadcaster, Guardian Australia and the Nine newspapers remain silent on the most important energy story out of Europe in our lifetimes. Energy will prove an enduring story from the invasion of Ukraine, and the bedrock upon which February's pact between Putin and Xi was built. The West has allowed its own industries and jobs to be exported to countries with rising CO2 emissions so it can reduce emissions in Europe and North America for no net benefit to the planet. US President Joe Biden is refusing to expand domestic oil and gas production to keep faith with the left of his Democratic Party on emissions, while reaching out to Russian client oil states Iran and Venezuela in the hope of winning a price reprieve for American motorists.

"COP26","Australia","COP26_Australia234","Country's goal not enough","November 20, 2021 Saturday","Western Advocate","The Queen recently sent a pointed message to the heads of government meeting at the latest United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow.She said, in all her years, she has met two types of leaders: those who play politics for short-term gain, and statesmen - those who see change coming and prepare their nations well for it.COP26 is all about setting realistic 2030 targets for a planet that will succumb to 1.5 per cent global warming by 2030 if we do not act decisively now.However, all the talk from the federal government before Scott Morrison left for Glasgow was about 2050.There is no time like the present.The federal government's stated goal of emissions at 26-28 per cent below 2005 levels is just not good enough. A bare minimum, like NSW's 2030 target of 50 per cent is required.More being done now means less to be done after 2030. However, doing more now does not seem politically or financially viable for the Liberals and the Nationals; nor does it seem for the Labor Party.Being a statesman is about risking losing elections while doing what is right for voters, regardless of what swinging voters might want.The last prime minister I saw being in any way statesman-like was John Howard as he stood in front of gun owners while wearing a bullet-proof vest after the Port Arthur massacre.I hope it's not too insensitive to say that COP26 was Scott Morrison's Port Arthur moment. Real leadership in times of crisis involves a willingness to sacrifice career and position in the cause of what is right. Did Scott Morrison do this?Reports speak of the Glasgow Exhibition Centre at COP26 being a place overflowing with possibility and hope about what is being done, and what can be done, for humankind and the environment in the next handful of years.Maybe I'm wrong, but it feels like Australia is missing out.The next 10 years will show us just how much possibility Australia missed out on.As it stands now, our federal seat of Calare will miss out on $15 billion worth of green investment.In recent years he has contributed to analysis of 100 per cent renewable energy futures, including a global search for pumped hydro energy storage sites.For more information about this, check out their website at HYPERLINK http://re100.eng.anu.edu.auhttp://re100.eng.anu.edu.auAndrew McAlister is a member of Bathurst Community Climate Action Network\l"
"COP26","Australia","COP26_Australia235","China wants world to pay for net zero target","November 2, 2021 Tuesday 10:55 AM AEDT","The Australian Online","India and China have called on advanced economies to provide up to $US1 trillion ($1.33 trillion) now for developing countries to reduce emissions, rejected 2050 net-zero targets and offered no firm commitments to phase out coal-fired power at the Glasgow climate summit. The divide between developed and developing nations is again looming as the major obstacle to greater progress at , with Scott Morrison warning that getting the climate shift wrong would impact ""those who can afford it least"" as he promoted his ""technology, not taxes"" approach to reducing emissions. Mr Morrison, who was due to hold talks with Prince Charles ahead of a Commonwealth leaders' reception on Tuesday, told world leaders successful action on climate change must occur not only ""in the developed economies of the North Atlantic but in the developing economies of the Indo-Pacific as well"". Delivering Australia's national statement at COP26 in Glasgow, the Prime Minister said global momentum to tackle climate change was building and driving down emissions could be achieved without imposing economy wrecking policies. Speaking to a high-level group of Australian business leaders, Mr Morrison said he was ""far more optimistic"" about the future of global warming than the ""depressing tone"" at COP26. ""It is not all doom,"" Mr Morrison said after scores of global leaders including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that the world was at ""one minute to midnight"" if it wanted to ""save the planet"". Mr Johnson, Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron had hoped to use the UN conference as a launching pad for a new era of ambitious global co-operation on climate change, but failed to win the support of the world's biggest emitters including India, China, Brazil and Russia. In his keynote speech, Mr Johnson told more than 120 leaders and representatives of 191 countries that humanity had ""long since run down the clock"" on climate change. ""It's one minute to midnight on that doomsday clock and we need to act now,"" the British Prime Minister said.The host, who likened world leaders to James Bond grappling with a ""doomsday device"", said he wanted clear COP26 outcomes around the ending of deforestation, the phasing out of coal, increasing electric vehicle take-up and strengthening the financial market's climate change focus. After the US President criticised China and Russia for snubbing the G20 and COP26 summits, Chinese President Xi Jinping was allowed to provide a written statement outlining Beijing's climate change agenda. In a message without any new commitments, Mr Xi told world leaders to ""govern by reality"" and boost support for developing nations, referencing an $US100bn-a-year pledge made by advanced economies in 2009 to support the global net-zero transition. Mr Xi, who submitted a video message to the conference, acknowledged the adverse effects of climate change were increasingly apparent. But he did not provide any detail on how the world's biggest polluter and coal-fired power consumer would meet its 2060 net-zero target and reduce its peak emissions, which make up more than a quarter of the globe's total carbon output, by 2030. He said countries should take a pragmatic approach ""in accordance with national conditions"", adding that ""developed countries must not only do more themselves, but also provide support for developing countries to do better''. Mr Xi, who claimed China ""resolutely curbs blindly high-energy-consuming and high-emission projects"", said Beijing would pursue a green and low-carbon economic system that could ""vigorously develop"" renewable energy. Despite his government resisting a net-zero target, Mr Modi shocked COP26 delegates by declaring India would aim to reach the goal by 2070. The 50-year target, which most believe would be difficult for India to achieve unless low-emissions technologies were scalable, would be supported by an accelerated shift to ""non-fossil energy"" from 2030. After attending Mr Johnson's COP26 world leaders' dinner reception on Monday night, Mr Morrison hosted a breakfast roundtable on his final day in Glasgow with Australian business chiefs including Macquarie Group chief executive Shemara Wikramanayake, Fortescue's Andrew Forrest, Rio Tinto chair Simon Thompson, Santos chief executive Kevin Gallagher and Sun Cable boss David Griffin. He said Australia had a ""tremendous opportunity."" ""What works has to work in the North Atlantic and it has to work in the Indo-Pacific, the developed countries in the North Atlantic and developing countries in the Indo-Pacific and whether its speaking to Indonesia, Vietnam or particularly India, they understand the challenge and they are looking for the answer to their economies. The world is looking for solutions. I am far more optimistic when I come to these things and sometimes they can have a bit of a depressing tone about doom, about gloom. That's not my view. It's not our government view. ""Eighteen months ago we were facing the abyss of a pandemic with no vaccine, and here we are, a vaccine has now been administered to billions around the world."" Mr Morrison was expected to meet heads of the International Energy Agency and International Atomic Energy Agency overnight.In his COP26""Technology will have the answers to a decarbonised economy, particularly over time - and achieve it in a way that does not deny our citizens, especially in developing economies, their livelihoods or the opportunity for a better quality of life,"" Mr Morrison said. Spruiking the government's target for net-zero emissions by 2050, Mr Morrison said Australia's success in slashing emissions by more than 20 per cent since 2005 - driven by world-leading take-up of rooftop solar and accelerated deployment of renewables - had not come at an economic cost. ""Over the same time, our economy has grown by 45 per cent, proving that economic growth is not at odds with emissions reduction,"" he said. ""And by 2030 our nationally determined contribution here at COP26 notes that our emissions will fall by 35 per cent by 2030, far exceeding our Paris commitment. Australia meets and beats our commitments. And we are doubling our initial climate finance commitment for our Pacific family and Southeast Asian partners to $2bn."" \l"

Unable to find the right buyer, he decided to double down, adding shares instead of paring them.The bet paid off: PT Bayan Resources' stock has more than doubled since, making Low one of the wealthiest people in the industry, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His stake, now at 61 per cent, is worth $US6.1 billion ($8 billion).""It's very simple: If I can't sell part of my shares, I better buy more,"" Low said in a rare interview from Jakarta in March, the month he added another 199 million shares.Coal producers have been on a tear recently, an unexpected development for the industry most responsible for carbon emissions. At last year's COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, more than 40 countries pledged to shift away from the fuel. Indonesia, its largest exporter, has boosted regulation to safeguard natural resources.Yet burning coal is still common, generating about 35 per cent of the world's electricity and twice as much in Indonesia. Post-pandemic economic activity has increased demand, as has the war in Ukraine. Nations including Japan have banned Russian fuel imports, further tightening supply and pushing prices even higher.For Bayan Resources, where Low serves as president, it's been a boon. Shares are trading near a record high. Revenue more than doubled to $US2.9 billion last year, and the company repaid all of its debt. Now the miner is building new infrastructure to boost its production capacity to as much as 60 million tonnes by 2026 from 37.6 million tonnes in 2021, according to chief financial officer Alastair McLeod.""There's still a very balanced, if not undersupplied market,"" McLeod said in the March interview. ""Obviously we will still face a variety of challenges. But from the market price perspective, there's a demand for coal. We would anticipate healthy margins in 2022.""Shares of coal miners have surged across the board, boosting the fortunes of other Indonesian tycoons. PT Adaro Minerals Indonesia, controlled by billionaire Garibaldi Thohir's PT Adaro Energy Indonesia, has shot up almost 2,800 per cent since its public debut in January. The 175 per cent jump in PT Harum Energy over the past year has sent the value of its founder's stake to $US2 billion.Environmental concerns have yet to tamp the world's demand for coal, said Shirley Zhang, principal analyst for Asia-Pacific coal market at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Even if the Russian-Ukraine conflict subsides, she said, ""coal will still be needed by most of the Asian countries by 2050, and lack of financing at coal mines will provide price support"".Bayan Resources has installed solar panels and solar-powered lighting at its projects, and its Tabang mine, which contributes to more than 80 per cent of its production, generates lower levels of sulphur, nitrogen and ash when it burns coal, according to a company presentation. But the limitations are obvious, McLeod said: ""Inherently there's only a certain amount we can do if we still sell coal.""Low moved to Indonesia more than five decades ago, ready to tap opportunities in south-East Asia's biggest economy. Initially, the Singapore native went into construction - his first project was to build a facility to store ice cream. But the sector was a constant hustle.""You still had to look for another project for our people to work on,"" he said.Mining looked more stable, and in the late 1980s and '90s, the construction company built its coal business. Bayan Resources was created in 2004, and Low also became the controlling shareholder of Singaporean coal shipper Manhattan Resources Ltd.Low says he's an animal lover, and he spends his free time strolling in the zoo and fruit plantations he established on the island of Borneo, near the site of his Tabang mine.

There are HYPERLINK https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-environ-102017-025739two forms this response can take - reacting to environmental disasters by providing financial and technical assistance to affected areas, or adapting to the effects of global heating by preparing for future disasters.

This was a HYPERLINK key focus of the UK's HYPERLINK COP26 presidency goals at the UN climate summit, which highlighted closing the ""adaptation gap"" and building resilience to climate change globally.Despite this, there are more political rewards for devoting attention and resources to disaster relief, rather than disaster preparedness.

Research finds that the public is HYPERLINK https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055409990104more supportive of policies that react to adverse climate events, rather than those that proactively minimise the potential for damage (like flood defences).

And inefficient subsidies make no fiscal sense in an environment of seriously constrained public budgets, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.""The exact level of direct taxpayer support for fossil fuel companies in Australia is unclear but estimates range from the low billions to about $11 billion each year. Globally, government support across major economies totalled $US500 billion ($676 billion) a year before the pandemic hit.As finance minister under Tony Abbott, Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison, Cormann had direct influence over the level of support given to Australia's fossil fuel producers.Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, who is in Scotland for the climate talks, said Cormann's comments had ""pulled the rug out from Prime Minister Scott Morrison's whole pitch here at Glasgow"".""Mr Cormann is right - fossil fuel subsidies are environmentally harmful, costly and distortive,"" she said. ""You can't be taken serious on climate if you keep subsidising coal and gas.""Cormann reminded the Glasgow summit that G20 countries, of which Australia is a member, had pledged in 2009 to phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies ""over the medium term"" but noted direct support for fossil fuel production actually rose by 5 per cent in 2020 as the world emerged from the pandemic.""If this support continues beyond COVID-related emergency funding, it will compromise the commitment to phase out inefficient fossil fuel support and create market distortions that will work against our efforts to achieve global net zero,"" he said.Cormann also called for inefficient support for industry, agriculture and fishing to be eliminated.

The physical risks associated with climate change will increase and certain physical impacts are already locked in. Even with the deep reductions in CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions we should expect the effects of climate change to become increasingly disruptive for at least the next 20 years.The coming decades will see significant shifts in economic activities as a result of the build-up of physical and transition risks (policy, legal, market and technology changes) to meet increasing commitments and ambition.Activists have never been better organised and are increasingly holding boards and directors to account.For these reasons, among others, there has been a dramatic rise in climate change litigation in recent years, such that it is now an increasingly prominent feature of the international disputes landscape. In a growing number of markets, cases have been brought seeking to compel governments and businesses to act on climate change. Our Business Guide to Climate Disputes confirmed that, by the end of 2020, well over 1,700 climate-related court cases had been decided worldwide. The United States led the field on climate disputes (1,213), followed by Australia (98), United Kingdom (62), Canada (22), New Zealand (18), Spain (13), and France (11).Climate change risk is a real and pressing challenge for Australian companies and their boards, with the impacts of climate change on business extending beyond carbon-intensive industries and into industries such as financial services and technology.Monitoring and accountability of corporate and government efforts to address climate change continue to drive an exponential increase in climate disputes. Australian financial institutions and other corporates have faced action for failure to disclose climate risks in accordance with company law, in annual reports and public statements. Growing scrutiny of climate-related matters calls for meaningful and credible engagement with climate risk and opportunity and clear, careful and consistent communication with the market and other stakeholders. Businesses wanting to retain market share, and remain competitive and relevant must now develop credible near- and mid-term climate action plans or review and revise them if already prepared; implement plans with urgency and conviction; and create transparency and accountability frameworks to track progress and results.DLA Piper supports climate action through our pro-bono work and as a founding member of the Net Zero Lawyers Alliance.

"COP26","Australia","COP26_Australia242","The other half of the climate change debate - adaptation","April 5, 2022 Tuesday","Canberra Times (Australia)","The scale of the tragedy that is the ongoing flooding in NSW and Queensland is hard to comprehend. Although the ever-increasing insurance claim figures sit at well over $2 billion, this is the tip of the iceberg.The loss of lives, the damage to infrastructure, the loss of productivity and the physical and mental health toll taken on the nearly 10 million Australian's makes the true cost of the event devastatingly higher.This will involve a creative re-examination of Australia's climate change policy. With largely bi-partisan support for a net zero target by 2050, and after the noise of COP26, one could be forgiven for thinking that the climate change debate is settled.However, the reality is that even limiting global temperature rises to around 1.5 degrees by 2050 will not stop Australians being hit by increasingly frequent catastrophic weather. Although the mitigation of our share of greenhouse gasses is crucial, we must also incorporate resilience into our climate change policy.Proactive action by industry, businesses, and governments to pursue climate resilience could deliver a $380 billion dividend over the next 30 years, according to our recent analysis with the Minderoo Foundation. This means of the estimated $1 trillion in economic costs from climate change over the next 30 years, more than one-third is avoidable through action that can be taken today.This won't be easy - the need for adaption is far reaching. It ranges from thinking about how to protect workers exposed to hotter conditions, to assessments we make on climate impacts when building new infrastructure, to reinforcing levees along our rivers and managing living in coastal regions, and to better asset management and investment decisions by business.Adaptation might mean different work hours and different schooling hours in some regions and could even impact when and where we play sport outside. Just as transforming to a net zero economy means widescale change, so too does becoming resilient.On a public policy level, this will involve drastically flipping the idea of natural disaster funding on its head. According to the Productivity Commission, just 3 per cent of the money committed to disaster recovery is used for preparation before an event occurs, while 97 per cent is committed to response and recovery after the event. This is not good enough: preparation must be a priority.On a private sector level, we need businesses in all sectors of the economy to treat adaptation as necessary insurance and build it into their business strategies and operations.Our modelling shows that adaptation strategies alone can add $120 billion in benefits to the Australian economy by 2050, and these strategies benefit the economy from the time of investment.Conversely, the cost of inaction will grow every year and by 2050 could cost Australia 3.6 per cent of its GDP and 137,000 jobs, according to our worst-case scenario.The climate change debate has, to date, been dominated by the important agenda of mitigation. The politics and urgency of the debate has been polarising and, perhaps, lent itself to partial analysis and partial solutions.Australia will not be physically or economically resilient to a changing climate unless adaptation is considered at the same time.Claire Ibrahim is a partner at Deloitte Access Economics and Dr Pradeep Philip is head of Deloitte Access Economics.\l"

"COP26","Australia","COP26_Australia250","Project Arise: Innovator's secret plan to take over AGL; Inside Story","February 22, 2022 Tuesday","The Age (Melbourne, Australia)","Late last year, as world leaders entered the final stages of negotiations for emissions targets they would make at climate summit in Glasgow, a small team had formed in Australia plotting what could turn out to be one of the single largest decarbonisation projects the world had yet seen.The team called itself Project Arise - a partnership between the Australian software billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes and his wife Annie's private investment vehicle Grok Ventures and Canadian asset manager Brookfield, a corporate behemoth with a track record of energy and infrastructure investing.Project Arise was secretly assessing making an offer to buy AGL, the largest Australian power company. Part of its proposal would be to fast-track the company's plans to close its coal-fired power stations and invest $10 billion to $20 billion in projects to replace them, including with wind farms and big batteries.For years, Cannon-Brookes, the co-founder of Atlassian and Australia's third-richest person, had made his frustration at Australia's lumbering climate politics and lack of meaningful action clear. ""We face the greatest human challenge for generations and we're not improving our targets? We are using trickery & misleading about our national emissions,"" he wrote in 2019. ""In the past, I believe Australia has always stepped up when asked. We've never dodged our global responsibilities, until now.""Cannon-Brookes has become a prominent investor in renewable energy, including plans to develop the world's largest solar farm in the Northern Territory and link it via a cable to Singapore. In 2021, he started thinking about what more his money could do for the planet.On the last day of June, AGL had unveiled a proposal to split itself into two: the first, AGL Australia, would own the group's power, gas and telecommunications retailing arm along with some cleaner generation assets. The other, Accel, would be created to hold AGL's fleet of giant coal and gas-fired power stations, which account for about 8 per cent of Australia's overall emissions.""There is no doubt the winds of change in the electricity market have been substantially faster than many people have anticipated,"" AGL chairman Peter Botten told investors. ""We are very committed to turning this ship around.""The influx of wind and solar into the electricity market has been gutting profits of the coal-fired generators that supply the bulk of Australia's power. In the six months to December 31, AGL had sunk to a $2.3 billion loss. But the proposed corporate split did little to address the company's carbon footprint or ensure a smooth transition from coal-fired power.Before long though, it caught the attention of Cannon-Brookes. ""[It] didn't make any sense,"" he thought. It was ""going in the opposite direction of what we expected"".He assembled a team to consider a takeover bid. One of those advisers caught wind Brookfield was assessing a similar move on AGL. By October, Grok and Brookfield started talking. ""Grok was always going to need a financial partner,"" said one source familiar with the two companies. ""It made sense for them to come together.""At first blush, Brookfield might seem a strange partner for Cannon-Brookes. The Toronto-listed company has extensive holdings in fossil fuel infrastructure, including in Australia's Dalrymple Bay coal terminal. What it also has, though, is deep expertise in the energy sector and four decades' experience investing in renewable energy.And, importantly it had recently raised a multibillion-dollar carbon fund for the kind of opportunities decarbonising AGL presented. The head of its transition fund is Mark Carney, who has served as governor of the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada, and has helped reshape the global financial sector's views on climate. At the COP26 talks in Glasgow, Carney chaired a coalition of banks, investors and insurers that collectively control $130 trillion in assets that it said would be committed to reaching net zero emissions across its portfolio by 2050.Cannon-Brookes became convinced the partnership with Brookfield made sense. ""It made very logical sense to combine strengths and together we have built a far superior offer than had individually,"" he recalls.\l"

Climate change, driven by man-made greenhouse gas emissions, is making extreme weather events more frequent and intense. In the long-term, unchecked climate change will fundamentally alter life on Earth. Why is it an issue? Experts say we must limit global warming to within 1.5 degrees to avoid devastating, irreversible consequences. Pursuing greener energy sources is a key way to cut the use of fossil fuels. Green energy sources are also rapidly decreasing in price, presenting new opportunities for small businesses. The impacts of climate change can be felt today. The costs of insurance and disaster resilience are rising, as businesses in storm-prone regions can attest. Beyond that, mounting cleanup bills are leading insurers to seek higher premiums; some businesses are simply going without coverage, risking both physical and financial ruin in case of disaster.

The climate pledge commits the companies to work towards producing 100 percent zero emission vehicles by 2035.Combine environmental issues, with the squeeze that we're all feeling from the rising cost of living, and it begs the question, is it time to switch to an electric vehicle?Financial benefits With fuel prices at an all time high and cost of living pressures rising while wages remain stagnant, Australians are feeling the pinch.March saw record high dollars charged at the bowser and consumers started to wonder how they would continue to run their cars at such an expense.Electric vehicles could be the answer. According to Driva, the average electric vehicle costs $15 to fully charge and can drive approximately 450km on one full battery. They also cost much less to service and maintain, omitting the need for fuel filters, spark plugs and oil changes among other factors.Government incentives create even more opportunity for savings, with each state government introducing their own.Tasmania for example, announced a two year waiver on stamp duty for new and used EV purchases and a two year exemption on registration for rental car companies when they purchase EVs.Electric vehicles are more accessible than ever, with most reputable car companies offering models priced in the mid-range.Even lenders are incentivising car shoppers to consider an electric vehicle, with lower interest rates. Driva, an innovative car financing platform, is offering a 0.7% interest rate discount on electric car loans with select lenders.General Motors intends to add great affordability to the market with their electrified Equinox SUV, set to launch in 2023 at the reasonable price of $41,500. But for those in the market now, MG provides their ZS EV at $44,990 drive away.The environmental benefits Assessing emissions from EVs and comparing them against internal combustion engine vehicles is not straightforward. While EVs don't release tailpipe emissions, charging them via the electricity grid does generate carbon dioxide.Even with Australia's current grid being powered predominantly by coal and fossil fuels, the CO2 emissions from charging EVs are still substantially less than those generated by ICE vehicles.And as movement is made towards renewable energy, potential is high for even smaller emissions from EVs.An article published by Forbes pitted the Volkswagen Golf 1.0 TSI against its BEV (battery electric vehicle) counterpart, the Volkswagen ID.3 Pro Performance.After calculating the vehicle's own CO2 emissions and the emissions generated by fuel or electricity production, the BEV still came out on top, emitting 36.2% less CO2, even after using Australia's notoriously polluting grid as an example.Performance and convenience The greatest pushback preventing widespread acceptance of EVs is the misconception that they aren't as efficient in their performance and convenience as petrol fueled cars.When in fact, they can actually accelerate faster than ICE vehicles due to the reduction in moving parts and the uncomplicated engine.There is however the lack of charging stations nationwide to consider, with only 3000 public charging stations dotting mostly the perimeter of Australia.That's predicted to be a fleeting problem though, with the first round of the government's Future Fuels Fund funnelling $24.5million into fast charging stations in 2021, creating 403 EV fast charging stations across the country.The initiative includes three rounds of funding and $500million to build infrastructure in a bid to overcome barriers that prevent Australians purchasing EVs.With the driving range of EVs constantly improving, the charge in a full battery is often enough to last city drivers an entire week, and home charging stations are predominantly used unless drivers are travelling.Electric vehicle sales are rapidly increasing, with sales doubling within the months of January, February and March this year, in comparison to the same period last year. So with increased demand, Australia will surely follow suit of other countries more advanced in the EV market.This is branded content for Driva.\l"

But it's almost certain to include a strengthening of the language of the Paris Agreement, hopefully with a formal commitment that warming will be held to 1.5?. Reason for hopeAs with previous conferences, policy commitments at Glasgow will be insufficient to reach the 1.5? target. Most notably, the commitment to reduce methane emissions is, at this stage, merely an aspiration with no concrete policies attached. And as HYPERLINK https://climateactiontracker.org/publications/glasgows-2030-credibility-gap-net-zeros-lip-service-to-climate-action/analysis released on Tuesday found, real-world action is falling far short despite all the net-zero promises.

And they can be implemented without condemning developing countries to poverty or requiring a reduction in living standards for wealthier countries. The fact we have these options reflects both remarkable technological progress and the success of policies around the world, including emissions trading schemes and renewable energy mandates. Thanks largely to government support, advances in solar and wind technology kicked off in the early 2000s. This ultimately pushed the cost of carbon-free electricity HYPERLINK https://www.carbonbrief.org/solar-is-now-cheapest-electricity-in-history-confirms-ieabelow that of new coal-fired and gas-fired plants. The biggest impact was felt in the European Union, where carbon prices and emissions trading drove a rapid transition. The EU has a HYPERLINK clear path to the goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. The most important requirement is to accelerate the transition to carbon-free electricity. This involves rapidly expanding solar and wind energy and replacing petrol- and diesel-powered vehicles with electric alternatives. These changes would incur a one-off cost in scrapping existing power plants and vehicles before the end of their operational life, but would reduce energy and transport costs in the HYPERLINK https://thedriven.io/2020/07/23/lifetime-cost-of-electric-cars-already-lower-than-comparable-ice-vehicles/long run.Other important steps are already beginning.

"COP26","Australia","COP26_Australia257","What have China, Russia and India committed to at COP26?","November 4, 2021 Thursday","7.30 Report","ANDY PARK, REPORTER: China is the elephant not in the room at . So what good are Glasgow agreements anyway if the leader whose country is responsible for around 28 per cent of the world's carbon emissions isn't even there, and what of the fossil fuel reliance and climate goals of China, India and Russia, who combined make up two-fifths of the world's emissions?TIM BUCKLEY, INSTITUTE FOR ENERGY ECONMICS: China is very coal dependent. China imports a lot of oil, they import even more gas, fossil gas.JOE BIDEN, US PRESIDENT: I indicated that China and Russia not showing up in Saudi Arabia is a problem. I think it's been a big mistake, quite frankly, for China, with respect to China, not showing up.ANDY PARK: Despite an absence from Glasgow, President Xi Jinping submitted China's new 2030 targets to the UN last week.XI JINPING, CHINESE PRESIDENT (translated): In the past 15 years, the cut of China's carbon emissions intensities has greatly exceeded the climate action goals of 2020.TIM BUCKLEY: President Xi has already committed to peak emissions before 2030. He has already committed to net zero before 2060 and so the fact he's absent from the actual in person COP discussions to me is largely immaterial. China has set the stage with enormous global ambition.ANDY PARK: Not only will China's carbon emissions peak before 2030, they intend to reduce something called carbon intensity, a measure of emissions per unit of gross domestic product, a key indicator for the world's economic powerhouse, by 65 per cent by 2030. Crucially, for a country in which coal accounts for around 60 per cent of energy supply, they plan on cutting all fossil fuels in energy to 75 per cent by 2030. A sign that China intends to continue its dominance in zero carbon emissions technologies.TIM BUCKLEY: China in my view is already the world's largest developer of zero emissions industries of the future. They're the largest investor and China is talking about building 1200 gigawatts of wind and solar and just to put that in an Australian context, that is 20 times the entire electricity generating capacity of Australia.ANDY PARK: Unlike all other participants at Glasgow, who have signed up to net zero by 2050, Russia only plans to reduce emissions by 80 per cent in that year. President Putin, absent from Glasgow, instead sent a pre-recorded message, affirming that Russia will strive for carbon neutrality by 2060.VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (translated): We don't just want to reach carbon neutrality, but make it so that in the nearest three decades, the accumulated volume of greenhouse gas emissions in Russia is less than even for our neighbours in the European Union.JOE BIDEN: His tundra is burning, literally the tundra is burning. He has serious, serious climate problems.ANDY PARK: Russia intends to use its vast forests as a carbon sink and did sign up to Glasgow's agreement to end and reverse deforestation by 2030. But as a major gas supplier to Europe, Russia refused to join with more than 100 countries pledging methane cuts, as did Australia and India. NARENDRA MODI, INDIAN PRIME MINISTER (translated): India is the only big economy in the world that has delivered both in letter and spirit on its Paris commitments. ANDY PARK: India's announcement at Glasgow of a net zero target two decades after the US and 10 years later than China has been widely received as a strategic move.TIM BUCKLEY: So India's committed to net zero emissions by 2070, a very conservative target. They have also committed within that to a 45 per cent emissions intensity of economic growth, a 45 per cent reduction by 2030. That is really important to get on the path to decarbonisation. They committed to 500 gigawatts of renewables by 2030.ANDY PARK: The developing country, vulnerable to climate change with an emerging middle class, is seeking $1 trillion in climate finance, mainly from developed countries further down the decarbonisation pathway.ANDY PARK: Unlike China, which is relying on transition fuels, India could leapfrog to zero emissions industries.TIM BUCKLEY: We're seeing India building out its solar manufacturing capacity, talking about a green hydrogen strategy and electric vehicles, lithium ion batteries.ANDY PARK: With Glasgow coming to a pointy end of negotiations, the promises and actions of the world's developing nations and big polluters so far has been mixed - hedging their bets, not wanting or needing to lead in conquering emissions challenges, while the first world still grapples with theirs.\l"

It also supported a push for the COP26 communique to urge for coal to be ""phased down"" rather than ""phased out"".Labor leader Anthony Albanese said his party's long-awaited climate plan was the ""most comprehensive modelling ever done by any opposition in Australia's history since Federation"" and that it was the ""right plan for Australia"". ""Our plan will create 604,000 extra jobs by 2030. Five out of every six (jobs) will be in regional Australia,"" he said. ""Our plan will create jobs, cut power bills, boost renewables and reduce emissions, which is the right plan for Australians.""The Opposition Leader defended having a less ambitious 2030 target than the 46-to-50 per cent cut previously called for by the Business Council of Australia. ""It is a modest policy. We do not pretend that it is a radical policy. It is a consistent policy with our approach,"" he said.""Business wants certainty. Major businesses and peak organisations all call for net zero by 2050 - well before this Government did.""Shadow climate change and energy minister Chris Bowen slammed the Morrison Government's climate modelling, calling it a ""fortune cookie"". ""This Government keeps missing opportunities ... our emissions are (not) coming down fast enough to protect our planet,"" Mr Bowen said. ""The modelling shows that Labor's policy will reduce emissions by 43 per cent by 2030. ""Australia's electricity market will be 82 per cent renewable under the policies of an Albanese Labor government (and) 43 per cent will be Australia's new target medicated by the Albanese Labor government.""Labor also wants to bid for Australia to host a future COP climate summit in an effort to rehabilitate the country's global environment reputation.The Opposition pledged to remove taxes on electric vehicles to make them between $2000 and $12,000 cheaper.

"COP26","Australia","COP26_Australia262","Why we need to invest in our environment's natural capital","November 11, 2021 Thursday","Australian Financial Review","Emissions reduction Measuring the true value of investing in the oldest greenhouse gas reduction technology means farmers can reap the financial benefits of their land management.If there is one message from COP26 to date, it is that reducing the world's emissions is more necessary than ever, and that the geopolitical climate for achieving this is more complex than many like to suggest.COP26 in Glasgow has been about emissions targets, the technology needed to achieve them and their importance in protecting the environment.Less in focus has been the heavy lifting we will need from our environment to achieve those targets, and that is opening an international asset class that could attract trillions of dollars globally.It is why Australia's participation in the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) announced during is so important.In simple terms, the world needs to better understand and measure the value of our natural capital - to help unlock investment in the world's oldest greenhouse gas reduction technology. Nobody gets to net zero without the environment, without what it can achieve in emissions reduction.Understanding the true value of our natural capital - our soils, water, oceans, biodiversity and spectacular landscapes - presents an enormous economic opportunity and a critical pathway for investment.Formally launched in June 2021, the TNFD is a global collaboration between the public and private sectors to develop a framework to support financial flows towards nature-positive outcomes.There is a TNFD forum of institutions and governments including Australia, the UK, France, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Peru, as well as a taskforce of 33 senior executives from financial institutions, corporates and market service providers, including three Australian members: Macquarie's Liz O'Leary, Scott Mesley from KPMG Australia, and Guy Williams from Deloitte Australia.While residential real estate accounts for our property boom, the growing realisation of what lies ahead in climate finance and Australia's unique wealth of natural capital assets could well emerge as a serious challenger.The natural capital metrics program announced in the 2021-22 budget will facilitate the development of approaches and tools that enable the measurement, integration and accounting of natural capital in financial decision-making, products and solutions.At COP26The better we can identify and measure the true value of investing in the environment, the more we can encourage private sector funding that can generate environmental and economic returns, and the more environmental philanthropists can confidently contribute.This is not about locking up the farm and selling it to foreign investors to offset emissions - it is about identifying the economic benefits of modern agriculture and even urban design, and it is about identifying the wider economic contribution of our landscapes and oceans.It is about providing farmers and other landholders with the tools they need to attract investment by showcasing the true value of their environmental management.Only last month, The Australian Financial Review reported on Kilter Rural winning a $US50 million ($67 million) mandate from a US institutional investor for an Australian Farmlands Fund. The fund is repurposing underutilised farming properties with quality infrastructure to produce higher-value crops, while reforesting 30 per cent of the landscape. It was reported as targeting 12 per cent growth through organic and conventional crops, while providing carbon sequestration through soils.Growing our understanding of the environmental and economic benefits of these investments is the key, and that is work that Australia is already leading on.The government's commitment to blue carbon - the subject of another key COP26 announcement - is a prime area for the valuation of natural capital. Blue carbon includes the restoration of coastal and marine ecosystems such as mangroves, salt marshes and seagrasses that absorb carbon and support marine species.As part of our $100 million Oceans Leadership commitment, we are investing $30 million in a Blue Carbon Conservation, Restoration and Accounting Program. At COP26, Australia also launched the Blue Carbon Accelerator Fund that will focus on restoration and conservation projects.Whether it is governments, commercial investment or companies looking to extend their social licence through environmental philanthropy, the importance of grasping the economic value of assets remains.Again, natural capital is not a term for locking up or selling off the environment, nor for crippling one industry sector at the expense of another. It is an important tool in ensuring the environment is valued along with any other asset, and that the private sector can credibly invest in outcomes that can help us all.It is, in short, about creating opportunities to invest in our future.Sussan Ley is the Environment Minister.\l"

"COP26","Australia","COP26_Australia264","'The Australian way' appears to be creating a facade of action then doing nothing","November 5, 2021 Friday","Canberra Times (Australia)","Mr Morrison's legacy at COP26 will not be one of effective diplomacy, nor of progressive climate ideas. Instead, it will be one of sloganeering. His recurrent use of ""the Australian way"" is embedding itself into common language - to denote a facade of supposed action, when in fact there isn't any. ""The Australian way"" is becoming a ""drover's dog"" saying for the English-speaking world.If COP26In the past few days, the government has published its National Climate Resilience and Adaptation Strategy 2021-2025, so as to be available for COP26. This document appears to follow the ""Australian way"" of reacting to an urgent, complex issue by producing a colourful, well-constructed document with little substance. Cynically, it has been delivered by a minister who recently approved three new coal mines, and by a government refusing to sign the methane 30 per cent reduction pledge - an action which will compromise our resilience.Will this strategy document do anything to address the fact that Australia does not have policies and plans for adaptation, when at least 106 other countries do?The strategy has no defined policy on a range of issues, no legislative safeguards or targets, no comprehensive delivery of essentials such as health policy, and no clear funding. Prior to COP26, US President Joe Biden announced $US105 billion for environmental resilience to address the impacts of extreme weather events. On a per capita basis, Australia would need to announce about $A10.9 billion to match this.To properly plan for effective resilience, every government department must commit to a co-ordinated approach. One of many areas requiring urgent attention is the wide range of health impacts brought on by climate change, recently detailed by Doctors for the Environment Australia.The past decade was the hottest on record for Australia, with the temperature almost 1 degree above average. Life becomes increasingly unliveable when temperatures soar above 40 degrees, and indeed infants and the elderly become physically stressed and in danger of collapse. Our heat-related mortality rate is about 2 per cent, causing more deaths than bushfires or any other environmental event.Already some locations in Australia regularly reach 40 degrees or more, and many regions will become progressively unliveable.Countless towns in regional and rural Australia will need heat shelters, just one of a host of health needs yet to have national help or policy. The Royal Commission into National Natural Disaster Arrangements detailed the urgent need for bushfire shelters, but these need to be multipurpose, for more long-term use by young and old in severe heat waves.This illustrates the need for national co-ordination and expertise on just one of countless resilience issues. Are local communities, councils and authorities expected to develop their shelter plan with local expertise on structural, heat-resistant architecture, or will there be a national blueprint they can vary for their own needs? The plan must include fire and heat-proof building regulations, secure energy with storage from a localised grid, first-aid facilities, secure communications, water security and capacity for local population requirements.READ MORE:Global carbon emissions will surge to pre-pandemic levels, but COP26 pledges bring hope COP26 pledges to cut methane emissions, halt and reverse deforestation Australia snubs global pact to end coal production Such co-ordination and delivery are interdepartmental necessities which appear to be beyond the federal government's capacity, as evidenced by national issues such as COVID vaccine delivery, renewable energy development, Murray River security and biodiversity protection. The government is hindered by the smoldering climate denial in the National Party.What we need is an independent body of expertise, a Sustainability Commission or an Independent Climate Change Commission as detailed in Zali Steggall's climate change bills. This would encompass all existing resilience measures, including the National Recovery and Resilience Agency. It is inconceivable that a federal government can deliver this co-ordination from the proposed National Adaptation Policy Office.My pointing out these national inadequacies should not be taken as downplaying the efforts and plans of states, territories, local authorities and the input from many groups, including the Emergency Leaders for Climate Action.Many will feel shamed by Australia's fellow-travelling with Russia and China in the coal and methane mining camp. Our government's choice amounts to a denial that global warming may become irreversible this decade, and may condemn millions to a terrible future. Unfortunately, the position of a Labor government may not be appreciably different.The confronting message from COP26 is for our nation to urgently build our resilience to coming disasters - and to avoid doing it ""the Australian way"".Dr David Shearman, AM PhD FRACP, is emeritus professor of medicine at the University of Adelaide and co-founder of Doctors for the Environment Australia.\l"

Overseen by former Bank of England supremo Mark Carney, the banks and other financial institutions signing up to HYPERLINK https://www.gfanzero.com/Gfanz (the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero) are pledging to report annually on the carbon emissions linked to the projects they lend to. They are also aiming to provide trillions of dollars in green finance, while committing to net zero emissions across the board by 2050. HYPERLINK Major signatories to the initiative, which was originally unveiled HYPERLINK https://racetozero.unfccc.int/net-zero-financial-alliance-launches/in April, include Citi, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America. While it's very encouraging to see many of the world's leading banks committing to sustainable lending, it's hard not to feel apprehensive. It certainly isn't the first opportunity that they have had to decarbonise their loan books, and so far the results have not been impressive. In 2019, the UN General Assembly exuberantly launched its HYPERLINK https://www.unepfi.org/banking/bankingprinciples/principles of responsible banking (PRBs) with similar goals in mind. The banks that signed up agreed, among other things, to ""work with their clients to encourage sustainable practices"" and to ""align their business strategy"" to the HYPERLINK https://sdgs.un.org/goalsUN sustainable development goals HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreementParis climate agreement HYPERLINK https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-78873-5So far, many of the biggest banks in the world have not signed the PRBs, even though the principles have been the gold standard until now for committing to decarbonising lending. Leading signatories are also a long way from satisfying their requirements - not to mention those of Gfanz. Greening financeBanks can contribute to solving the climate crisis from two angles: their lending and their investments. On the investment side, we saw a tipping point in 2020 when BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, HYPERLINK https://ukinvestormagazine.co.uk/blackrock-to-focus-on-esg-and-climate-change-in-2020/announced that it would concentrate its investments on securities that were focused on sustainability. Lending is still in the nascent stages of its green transition, however. And since it is well accepted that it makes up the majority of corporate finance, this area is make or break for decarbonising the industry. HYPERLINK https://www.unepfi.org/banking/bankingprinciples/prbsignatories/Well over 200 international banks have signed the principles of responsible banking in the past two years, but, many of the biggest banks are not among them. Of the HYPERLINK https://www.advratings.com/banking/worlds-top-banks-by-market-captop ten banks (by market capitalisation), only Citi, Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China are signatories. A further six - JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, China Construction Bank, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and China Merchants Bank - are not on the list. I should stress that being a signatory to the PRBs is a limited commitment. Signatories have four years to comply with the principles. Even then, everything is voluntary and non-binding, so signatories are not penalised or even named and shamed for failing to live up to the principles. To get a sense of the status quo, HYPERLINK https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-78873-5I looked at the lending practices of three major signatory banks - Citi, ICBC and Japan's MUFG - for the years 2016-19. This covers the period directly after the Paris Agreement to the year the PRBs were signed. You might have expected banks that were serious about their commitments to have been cutting back on carbon-heavy lending in this period. I focused on banks' lending to fossil fuels extraction, because data is readily available and because this is very much the top of the pyramid when it comes to carbon emissions. I also compared three other major banks who are not signatories to the PRBs: Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and HSBC. I found that Wells Fargo and JP Morgan were the world's largest financiers of such companies during that period (though Wells Fargo dropped to third HYPERLINK in 2020). Neither signed the PRBs, though both are now members of Gfanz. Both state in their annual reports that they are committed to the Paris climate agreement. Both did reduce their total fossil fuels lending each year from 2018 to 2020, by 57% and 23% respectively. Citi, meanwhile, was the third-biggest fossil fuel lender in 2016-19 despite being a signatory to the PRBs (and Gfanz), and reached second place in 2020. And MUFG and ICBC, who are also signatories to the PRBs, both grew their fossil-fuel lending over the period. MUFG is also a Gfanz member, though neither ICBC nor any of the other Chinese banks are part of the new initiative. Also note that HSBC was not a major lender to fossil fuel projects despite not being a signatory to the PRBs (though it too has signed up to Gfanz). Six banks and fossil-fuel finance 2016-19From this, I see no discernible sign that the PRBs have so far made any difference to lending in this area. Despite the roar at the UN General Assembly, my worry is that this tiger is proving toothless - and there is reason to fear that Gfanz will go the same way. The way forwardWhen signatories to the PRBs are lending money, they are supposed to carry out environmental-impact assessments and to measure the greenhouse gas emissions of projects. This is not a minor issue considering that such work is beyond the traditional competences of banks and will significantly affect their operational costs.Signatories are also supposed to ensure that loans go to projects that are carbon neutral. This means that borrowers have to commit to mitigation actions that last for the whole life-cycle of the project. It is part of each signatory's obligation to ensure that such mitigation actions are carried out, by monitoring the project throughout its duration. Yet the suspicion is that very little of this is happening on the ground at present. To change this, we would probably need to move to a scheme by which the PRBs are compulsory and binding. Unfortunately, Gfanz does not look like that scheme. Though the annual reporting requirements on carbon emissions are a step forward, nothing in the initiative is mandatory either. It was HYPERLINK https://www.ft.com/content/9105cc47-58fb-47dc-8233-6b622fb56ae2also criticised in the weeks leading up to COP26 because the members refused to agree to end lending to fossil fuel projects this year. Instead they aim to halve their carbon emissions in a decade. My own view is that it wouldn't make sense to abruptly forbid lending to non-green projects now, since we need to avoid hitting hardest the banks that are traditionally most involved in carbon-heavy sectors. Instead, loan books need to be treated as a portfolio of projects in different tones of green, with a defined trajectory towards greener - but it needs to be mandatory for signatories. It's a pity that Mark Carney and other banking leaders did not work towards strengthening the PRBs rather than come up with yet another initiative. I also worry that Gfanz muddies the waters by combining investing and lending rather than focusing purely on lending. We don't need more roaring; we need a tiger that actually has some teeth.

The first is that climate change, with other factors, is already putting lives and livelihoods around the world on the brink. Much focus has been on how small the window of opportunity is for global action - as if the world still had a couple more years before things really get bad. In Zimbabwe, for some of the poorest farmers, growing a potentially lucrative cash crop like tobacco has already become unviable. For many, the crisis is now. Second, heavily commercialised agriculture, especially livestock production, is HYPERLINK https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/handle/20.500.12413/13715amongst the biggest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. It's a bitter irony that it therefore contributes to the precarity of farmers, like those in Zimbabwe, who bear little or no responsibility for climate change. And yet agriculture has not historically been a high priority on COP agendas.The researchThese lessons are drawn from our HYPERLINK https://www.future-agricultures.org/publications/apra-working-paper-64-commercial-tobacco-production-and-climate-change-adaptation-in-mazowe-zimbabwe/research in Zimbabwe, conducted as part of of the HYPERLINK https://www.future-agricultures.org/apra/#introFuture Agricultures ConsortiumDue to high mortality rates of smoking, tobacco isn't everyone's choice of cash crop to promote. But it's seen by some as HYPERLINK a route out of poverty HYPERLINK https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264837719303291""success story"" for the HYPERLINK https://www.centreforpublicimpact.org/case-study/fast-track-land-reform-zimbabwefast-track land reform programmeIn the 1920s, 96% of the precolonial population were dispossessed of their land. Roughly 50% of the land, including all the best agricultural land, was given over to the 4% of the white settler population. Communal lands were the agriculturally marginal areas into which the black population was resettled. The fast-track land reform programme established land leases for two types of plots. The first were plots of between 5 and 10 hectares intended for small scale black farmers aiming to start or increase commercial production. The second were plots of between 50 and 200 hectares for farmers who already had established commercial credentials. Many of these recipients have taken up tobacco, such that production levels have almost recovered to above the pre-land reform levels, in particular owing to its HYPERLINK take-up by small-and medium-scale farmers. But climate impacts threaten the viability of tobacco production. Our key finding was that when rain-fed rather than irrigated, tobacco is one of the riskiest crops, even on land well-suited to growing it. This is both from a climate and a commercial perspective.Predictably, the higher the level of access to irrigation and other resources, the better able farmers are to weather the impacts and reduce climate-related production risks. And beneficiaries of land reform in Mazowe do seem, to varying degrees, better able to adapt to the new climate realities. Access to better land seems to have been crucial to building an asset base, itself an important component of adaptive capacity. Yet the risks are greatest among farmers predominantly in communal land, for whom the crop is already a marginal and precarious undertaking. These farmers are often amongst those most in need of the cash, assets and stability that tobacco can provide. The majority of communal land farmers in the area we worked in were, at the time, on food aid, experiencing the opposite of poverty reduction via income from tobacco.Climate change and social injusticeIncreasingly, farmers who don't have access to irrigation and inputs are HYPERLINK abandoning the cropAs we found through our research, these difficulties aren't solely caused by climate change. Its effects coexist with an ongoing array of processes, including: chronic economic instability and recurring bouts of inflation over four decades,the sharp reduction in agricultural extension provision in recent decades,  the linking of the provision of input subsidies to political support,the low placing of Zimbabwean farmers in international tobacco value chains.At the same time, the inputs provided for tobacco produced under contract farming no longer include fuel, such as gum trees and coal, for curing tobacco. This displacement of a production cost onto the farmer has led to tree cutting, and is implicated in larger patterns of HYPERLINK https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/handle/20.500.12413/16428deforestation. It's no coincidence that tobacco, as with much agricultural production, HYPERLINK https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319143816_A_History_of_the_World_in_Seven_Cheap_Thingspromotes unsustainable modes of commodification and consumption of nature. Markets continue to function as if the real costs of environmental change did not need to be priced in to agricultural produce, and the deeply inequitable distribution of revenues from global agricultural produce did not matter. Implications for the negotiatorsAgainst this background, the https://www.ciwf.org.uk/news/2020/11/food-and-farming-reform-key-to-tackling-climate-changerelatively low profile of agriculture at the global climate talks is hard to understand. But the implications from Zimbabwe for the climate change negotiators are clear. First, if we are to see meaningful change, these underlying dynamics need to be a focus for the negotiations. Yet, in the run-up to COP26 it doesn't appear that they are. Second, if things don't change, the people least responsible for climate change, in Zimbabwe and far beyond, will continue to be amongst those most exposed to and suffering from its accelerating intense impacts.Andrew Newsham, an academic at SOAS, University of London, is Climate Change Theme Co-Leader for the Agricultural Policy Research Africa (Apra).

"COP26","Australia","COP26_Australia271","Don't ignore the fine print","December 19, 2021 Sunday 1:00 PM AEDT","The Australian Online","From an early age, most of us are encouraged to read the fine print in any contract or agreement. With this maxim in mind, it is interesting to consider the numerous pledges and proclamations made at the recent climate change Conference of Parties (COP26) in Glasgow and question their validity. Because as official observers to COP26, the World Coal Association is wondering what was really achieved.Take for example, the non-binding pledge to ""phase out"" coal by 2030 championed so pugnaciously by COP26 president Alok Sharma, and agreed to by an eclectic coalition of countries. According to Sharma, and a coterie of other leaders, the Glasgow summit was going to be the ""COP to end Coal"". UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Glasgow would ""consign coal to history."" Jotters and magic markers in hand, most attendees generally agreed: coal would be ""phased out"". Fourteen days later, in Saturday overtime, as the wording of the final consensus document was being hotly debated, it was left to India's Climate Minister Bhupender Yadav to argue (rightly) that developing countries could not phase out coal and other fossil fuels when they still have serious economic agendas to pursue and poverty to eradicate. Thanks to that intervention - with support from China's delegation head, Vice Minister Zhao Yingmin, who said it was time for developed countries to honour their commitments and enhance support for developing countries, instead of merely urging other parties to raise their ambitions - it was agreed that unabated coal (as specifically referenced in the fine print of the Paris Agreement) could be phased down - but not out. So, what really happened? Climate leaders, especially those from the noble Global North - the UK, US, EU - have conveniently ignored the fine print in the Paris Agreement - particularly Article 10.2, which calls for all fuels and all technologies to be deployed in mitigating emissions. Similarly, countries have failed to undertake the ""cooperative action"" which the Paris Agreement specifically demanded. It is no wonder that countries across the coal-relevant Global South (including China, India, South Africa, Indonesia), are reluctant to make pledges because they simply have no basis in the fine print of the Paris Agreement. These nations and other supporting coal-producing nations, including Russia and Australia, understand that energy security is fundamental to economic, social and environmental survival - the needs of billions of people. In a time of clean technological choice, it would simply be irresponsible for a nation to put all their eggs in one (energy) basket. Nor should they. And why would they? The failure of $US100bn ($140bn) pledged at COP22 in Milan in 2020 to help developing countries decarbonise was the subject of much heated debate. A subsequent pledge was made to increase the amount. The details are nebulous and non-binding. It is no wonder that countries with a significant coal footprint are dubious about the commitments they are being asked or forced to make. They are naturally sceptical given the failure of leaders to adhere to the minutiae of the Paris mandate.If the world is really serious about the Paris Agreement, it should agree to ""phase in"" all clean technologies, including clean coal technologies such as High Efficiency Low Emissions (HELE), Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and Coal-to-Hydrogen - technologies which are already recognised by climate science as essential to reaching a net zero emissions future. The fine print is about abatement and diversity - the capacity for coal and other fossil fuels to be included in the different energy pathways individual countries choose. It is their sovereign right to make their own decisions, and each has a different footprint. If global climate change soirees are the way forward, the debate is lost in semantics.It has still not been recognised that coal remains essential to electricity supply in 80 countries, and it will still represent almost 40 per cent of Asia's electricity supply by 2040 (according to the International Energy Association). It remains crucial to Australia's economy as our second-largest export, worth about $50bn, and employing more than 350,000 Australians (direct and indirect). Throughout the world, coal will remain the backbone and building block of economic progress, responsible for the supply of 90 per cent of the world's cement, and 70 per cent of world steel (and the 170 tonnes of coking coal which goes into every wind turbine). So, what happened at COP26?Today's bizarre geopolitical climate has driven a wedge between reality and dogma. Until the Global North appreciates the differentiated responsibilities and decarbonisation pathways of the Global South, and appreciates the Paris fine print, we should not expect too much from roving conventions.

Biden's entourage will feature 13 cabinet members and other senior officials including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. The show of force is intended to send a message to the world that his administration regards HYPERLINK https://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/biden-and-the-eu-can-forge-a-new-path-on-global-warming-20210107-p56scp.htmltackling climate change as a top priority.Adding to the star power, former President Barack Obama is travelling to COP26 as well.What is far less assured is whether Biden will be bringing a realistic plan to turn his bold climate promises into reality. HYPERLINK deliver on the pledgeIf the US President shows up to Glasgow empty-handed, as climate activists increasingly fear he will, it will dramatically weaken his credibility and undermine his efforts to convince other world leaders to raise their climate ambitions.Just as Scott Morrison has to placate Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce to adopt a 2050 net zero target before Glasgow, Biden has his own complex party conflicts to reconcile before landing in Scotland.Biden's hopes of signing significant climate legislation into law rest on a single member of the US Senate: Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat from West Virginia. Manchin represents one of the country's top coal-producing regions and his state overwhelmingly supported Donald Trump at the last election.Like in north Queensland or the Hunter Valley, the prospect of a rapid shift towards renewable energy is a frightening one for many West Virginians. Manchin, who positions himself as a champion of the coal industry, is also a significant investor in fossil fuel companies.That's a massive problem for Biden given he needs the support of all 50 Democratic senators - including Manchin - to pass any legislation through Congress.A sweeping US$3.5 trillion bill currently before Congress contains an array of climate measures that would go a long way towards meeting Biden's 2030 emissions reduction target.But Manchin has reportedly said he will block the climate centrepiece of the bill: the US$150 billion Clean Electricity Performance Program, a mechanism that would reward electricity generators that transition to renewable energy and penalise those which don't.Manchin's stance, first reported in The New York Times, has infuriated environmentalists, who regard the clean electricity program as a highly effective way to drive down greenhouse gas pollution. Michael Mann, one of America's most prominent climatologists, said on Twitter that Manchin had ""just launched a hand grenade at Glasgow"".Mann said that without the clean electricity program, the Biden administration cannot meet its 2030 carbon reduction target. ""And international climate negotiations begin to collapse,"" he wrote.

Like many others, we kept our fingers crossed for any realistic progress on emission targets.

Our home nation, Bangladesh, is one of those most vulnerable countries. Two-thirds of it is HYPERLINK https://www.worldbank.org/en/results/2016/10/07/bangladesh-building-resilience-to-climate-changeless than five metres above sea level.

Based on these conversations and our own expertise, we reveal what matters most for super vulnerable countries like Bangladesh - and how these issues were sidetracked in the negotiation process.Bangladesh's position was that major greenhouse gas emitters, mostly developed nations, should commit to financial support for those countries which are at most risk yet will have a much smaller role in the reduction of CO? emissions globally.Much of this money will be required simply to adapt to climate changes that are already locked in. Bangladesh, for instance, needs to fortify its river banks against floods; it needs to conserve soil that is being washed away; it needs high-yield water sensitive crops, and it needs more HYPERLINK https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200910-the-remarkable-floating-gardens-of-bangladeshfloating gardens in flooded areas.

One of the delegates told us that Bangladesh wanted a 50:50 mix of support for adaptation and mitigation.Bangladesh, like other climate-vulnerable nations, also wanted more grants, rather than loans, which leave them indebted.

The revised expectation for financial year 2022 also includes around $510 million for perils for the remainder of the financial year.This climate cost will ultimately flow back to consumers in higher premiums and to shareholder returns.IAG's downgrade and BHP's impending asset sale both reinforce the Prime Minister's assertion that market forces will continue to do the heavy lifting on Australia's decarbonising push. But a lot of that is down to the policy vacuum created by the federal governmentNo clearer example of the business-led climate charge is there than billionaire Andrew Forrest, the iron ore baron-turned climate evangelist, who will be fighting for his share of the microphone in Glasgow.But timing, as they say, is everything in business.BHP's thermal coal exit is a deal that has been pregnant for a while, with the market anticipating a near-term delivery. The company's chief executive Mike Henry declared the miner's position last year - that its suite of assets would move to a lower-carbon future footing with no space for thermal coal on the portfolio.The first leg of this coal divestment happened in June when BHP offloaded its stake in a Colombian project, Cerrej\'f3n, for $387 million. The second leg will be the soon-to-be transacted sale of Mt Arthur in NSW. Neither sale moves the dial on BHP's earnings but send a meaningful messageThe Mt Arthur asset was written down in BHP's books twice this year and thanks to the costs of rehabilitation, it is accounted for as a liability on the balance sheet.In recent months valuations have been complicated by a surge in the price of thermal coal which is used to generate electricity. This has been on the back of a post-COVID surge in the international economy and the resultant shortages of supply.The price spurt has given voice to views that Australia is moving too quickly on the transition to renewable energy.However, it's unlikely to deter BHP from getting a thermal coal deal across the l"

"COP26","Australia","COP26_Australia282","Private credit: catalysts for climate impact","January 6, 2022 Thursday","Australian Financial Review","""The window is still open, scientifically, to act,"" according to Professor Johan Rockstr&#xF6;m, architect of the nine planetary boundaries - environmental thresholds for humanity recently popularised by the Netflix documentary, Breaking Boundaries.During the Zero-Hour Sessions, an event convened by Lombard Odier during the COP26 climate summit, Rockstr&#xF6;m stressed that our planet - ""a complex, adaptive, self-regulating biophysical system"" - has tipping points which, if triggered, cause ""self-enforced drift in the wrong direction"".While the stability of our planet, and the economic activity it supports, depends on humanity keeping within these science-based thresholds and avoiding the ""no-go zones"" beyond them, we have already broken through four limits: toxic waste, air pollution, freshwater overuse and agrochemical pollution - and are on course for transgressing a critical fifth boundary: keeping global warming within 1.5 &#xB0;C above pre-industrial levels.According to the IEA, COP26 commitments reduced the forecast global temperature rise from 2.7 &#xB0;C to 1.8 &#xB0;C. While further policy impetus is essential in directing real decarbonisation throughout the economy, private sector resources must be marshalled to realise the required emissions reductions. The financing gap to put the world on a path to net zero is estimated to be $US32 trillion ($44 trillion) in the next decade.As illustrated below, economy-wide decarbonisation presents new variables to consider in evaluating risk-adjusted returns as transitional, physical and liability risks increasingly factor into corporate profitability and valuations:- Transitional risk includes shifts in demand among climate-aware consumers, companies' ability to reduce emissions and the impact of higher carbon costs and regulation.- Physical risk includes the damage caused by more frequent extreme weather events and the associated degradation of agricultural yields and less-productive labour forces.- Liability risk includes historical responsibility for climate change among companies and sovereigns, as well as mitigation and adaptation costs.Forward-looking investors may identify public and private businesses that are mitigating climate risk and acting on the opportunities generated by the transition. Lombard Odier believes there are significant opportunities available to advance the transition to net zero (""NZ"") through not just traditional public equity and debt markets, but also through private markets. While private equity capital has been well-deployed towards sustainable finance, we believe the broad versatility of solutions-oriented private credit is positioned to play an important role in accelerating the transition into a low-carbon carbon-resilient economy.The broader consensus move to NZ creates investment opportunities in select sectors targeted as priorities by large asset owners and corporations. While many large companies are creating meaningful in-house contributions to the climate transition, some of the most impactful solutions are coming from entrepreneurs within fragmented, under-financed markets working directly with corporate partners. Such corporate consumers of sustainable goods and services often find it more accretive to purchase and scale an externally sourced product or service than to allocate such development to balance sheet.While equity is a necessary component of business development, particularly in funding earlier stage technological and business development activities, properly structured private credit capital can help catalyse growth. Drawing on structured, specialty and infrastructure finance methodologies, private lenders can provide well-covenanted tailored liquidity to borrowers not typically available in public markets. As enterprises seek to scale disruptive climate solutions, access to low-cost capital will remain a key driver of a virtuous cycle of asset creation.Sustainable private asset managers have an obligation to be more than simply capital providers to their partners; they can help create mutual value through influencing corporate behaviours and actions.Managers can provide guidance and technical support to growing enterprises seeking to overcome various challenges, including United Nations sustainable development goals (SDG) alignment; regulatory frameworks compliance; key performance indicator (KPI) transparency and environmental, social and governance (ESG) risk management.Lombard Odier today sees increasingly active conversations around the issues of stewardship and engagement among its investee and investor partners, and we expect that collaboration to grow in 2022 and beyond.COP26 provided further evidence of policy and social tipping points for recommitting to the Paris Agreement's 1.5 &#xB0;C threshold.The private sector is delivering novel solutions today to profitably adapt and reduce carbon emissions, while improving resilience. Frameworks such as Rockstr&#xF6;m's planetary boundaries provide a guide for investors who seek businesses that are adapting their business models to be profitable in a sustainable future.""There is no question about the direction of travel anymore,"" Rockstr&#xF6;m said. ""The question is: can we act fast enough in order to land in a safe operating space for humanity? ""Much of the answer lies in action within the real economy, where private credit is essential to catalysing and scaling additional impact.Adriana Becera Cid is a sustainability analyst in Lombard Odier's Sustainability Investment Research, Strategy and Stewardship (SIRSS) team, and a member of Lombard Odier Investment Management's Sustainable Private Credit Investment team.\l"

If you get very high temperatures and humidity, you either have to pull back on your exercise or you overheat.""If you're still wanting to be active, you actually have to find some way of having active cooling in that environment.""So we reach a limit to where our adaptive capacity can go.""He added Australian workdays might also need a rethink - with options including a nap during the day to avoid the hottest temperatures.The IPCC reports, which are published roughly every six to seven years, are considered an authoritative study of climate science, guided and agreed to by scientists and governments across the globe.The report also warned that changes in temperature, rainfall and extreme weather were having a major impact on the spread of disease in wildlife, agriculture and people.Its release comes just months after world leaders were unable to reach agreement on strengthening their climate commitments at the COP26 summit in Glasgow.At the summit, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged countries to keep the goal of global warming increases to just 1.5C, speed up the decarbonisation of the global economy and phase out coal.But asked if commitments made at the summit would slow climate change, lead author Dr Johanna Nalau's response was sobering.""A lot of talk, a lot of commitments, but I think the overall sense is that we are just not on track,"" she said.Professor Howden said a major concern was how emissions would track as the world bounced back from Covid.But he said that while the government knew what it needed to do, it was a matter of political will.""Climate change is here. In Australia it's mostly negative, and it really matters to pretty much everything we value here in Australia,"" Professor Howden said.""Listen to the people ... 90 per cent of Australians want more action on climate change.""If there was any other issue that had 90 per cent of people wanting more action on it, you'd have the politicians running for the policy development process immediately.""Yet we don't see that ... climate change should not be a political issue.""Among the report's key messages was the intertwined fates of human and natural systems.

With summer still months away, an unusually intense heatwave is threatening millions of people there. Temperatures are expected to exceed 48\'b0C on the border between Pakistan and India this week. A month ago, the heat broke a 122-year-old record. What can people do to weather the worst and prepare for a future of extreme heat?Don't have time to read about climate change as much as you'd like?Get a weekly roundup in your inbox instead. Every Wednesday, The Conversation's environment editor writes Imagine, a short email that goes a little deeper into just one climate issue. Join the 10,000+ readers who've subscribed so far.For many Indians and Pakistanis, particularly in rural areas, the intolerable heat will slash the valuable hours available to work outdoors. According to research published by the Lancet, more than 150 billion work hours were lost in 2018 due to extreme temperature and humidity. This trend will have global consequences.""Half of the world's food is produced by smallholder farms with most of the energy input from physical labour carried out by the farmers,"" says Mark Maslin, professor of Earth system science at UCL. ""As the world warms, there will be more and more days when it will be HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/will-three-billion-people-really-live-in-temperatures-as-hot-as-the-sahara-by-2070-137776physically impossible to work outside, reducing productivity and food security.""In cities, where an increasing share of the global population lives, there are opportunities to make streets more comfortable during bouts of extreme heat. One of the most popular, with wider potential benefits for wildlife seeking habitat, is urban greening - or making more space for trees and other vegetation amid the concrete sprawl.But a study led by Cardiff University's Mark O. Cuthbert, published in February, found that carpeting roofs and walls with greenery and weaving green corridors between expanded parkland can either HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/why-urban-greening-isnt-a-panacea-for-extreme-weather-under-climate-change-176556subdue floods or mitigate heatAccording to Cuthbert and his co-authors, Denis O'Carroll of UNSW Sydney in Australia and Gabriel C Rau of Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany, the reason cities tend to overheat in hot weather and flood during heavy rainfall is the same. The abundance of concrete and steel absorb and retain heat, while those same sealed surfaces ""can't act like a sponge to soak up and store rain, unlike the soil they've replaced"".The researchers argue that greener cities in areas of high rainfall - such as around the northern Europe and around the equator - are likely to offset stronger heatwaves because plants release water vapour during photosynthesis, which has a cooling effect.The research team expects the benefits of urban greening to be less pronounced in drier areas where there's plenty of energy from sunshine, but rainfall is more limited, like cities in India and Pakistan. But expanding green spaces in these places is still worthwhile, as this is where there is the greatest potential for water retention by soils, which can help to prevent floods.A report published during COP26, the most recent UN climate change summit in November 2021, suggested that Africa is HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/extreme-heat-hurts-human-health-its-effects-must-be-mitigated-urgently-171327heating faster than other regionsMohiddin says the continent needs immediate financial and technological assistance to adapt to the warming environment, as well as research funding to assess who and where is most vulnerable.In these regions and others, designs and building techniques sourced from traditional architecture can offer some of the cheapest and most sustainable forms of relief. Amin Al-Habaibeh, a professor of intelligent engineering systems at Nottingham Trent University, studies the ways builders have HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/could-traditional-architecture-offer-relief-from-soaring-temperatures-in-the-gulf-49760helped keep people cool for centuries in the Persian Gulf (another hotspot for intensifying heatwaves).Here, homes built with limestone and other natural materials absorb moisture when it's humid and release it through evaporation on hot and sunny days. This provides a slight cooling effect, Al-Habaibeh says. The sandy texture and colour of the buildings also reflects a lot of solar radiation.Narrow roads and alleys maximise shadows, while glass is scarce and windows small to maintain air flow but keep out the Sun's heat. Internal courtyards funnel hot air upwards at midday (when the sun is at its peak) and replace it with cooler air from the surroundings rooms, he says. While ingenuity and solidarity can help communities adapt to increasingly brutal heatwaves, there is a limit, say Tom Matthews and Colin Raymond, climate scientists at King's College London and California Institute of Technology, respectively.""The range of weather humans can encounter on Earth - the 'climate envelope' - is shifting as the planet warms,"" they warn. "" HYPERLINK Conditions entirely new to civilisation could emerge in the coming decades."" That means heat extremes that exceed what humans can survive.A 2021 study reported that HYPERLINK one in three deaths caused by extreme heat since 1991 can be linked to climate change. If you find yourself in a heat wave, Chloe Brimicombe, a PhD candidate studying climate change and its consequences for human health at the University of Reading, has some advice for staying safe: ""Keep cool. If indoors, trying bathing your feet in cold water or have a shower ... Close the curtains and open windows on the side not facing the sun,"" she says. Other measures that keep air flowing throughout the building include opening doors and turning on fans.Brimicombe stresses that it's very important to stay hydrated, as you lose a lot of water through sweat during heatwaves. ""Drink more often than you usually would, even when you don't feel thirsty,"" she says. And don't forget to check on people who may need extra help.""Look out for over 65s, pregnant women, children under five and those with medical conditions. These groups are all more vulnerable to heat. You should also avoid being in direct sunlight between 12pm and 3pm when the Sun is at its strongest.""\l"

That was UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson before he took a private jet home, and after he and Prince Charles each took a separate private jet from Rome, effectively forcing the British taxpayers to fund two separate private jets, and the climate to take twice the emissions, to go to the very same conference.And despite Malcolm Turnbull's protests that he is just a mere ordinary citizen - when a flat-bed business class seat on Qantas QF1 wasn't available because they weren't flying he just hitched a ride on Andrew Forrest's private jet.You'd think after his hydrogen hype, the iron-ore magnate might opt to fly in using the same planet-saving technology that powered the Hindenberg.The Antoinette class spruiked slashing emissions while creating a bigger carbon footprint than the entire neighbourhood suburbs they entered with motorcades taking VIPs to events in chauffeured cars, which waited in side streets with engines idling, rubbish overflowed from Glasgow's street bins, and all the while they were mounting the stage to lecture the masses to stop eating meat, drinking milk, or burning wood.But the lowest point of COP26 wasn't the grotesque display of public resources used on private aircraft or even the overflowing rubbish.In the glare of saving the world, they forgot to include the most basic of human needs that even bush post offices feature. Wheelchair access.A minister with muscular dystrophy, Israel's energy minister Karine Elharrar, was left to wait for two hours outside , and then offered a shuttle without wheelchair access, and then forced to return to her hotel. That in itself paints a bleak picture of what climate activists really care about - and it's not people.The left-wing European news source, Euronews, which recommends buying second-hand sex toys, using a reusable washcloth instead of toilet paper and claims pollution is causing penises to shrink, took aim at countries that refused to bow down to pledges which would destroy their development, such as Indonesia refusing to commit to zero deforestation by 2030.The single benefit to Australia being at COP26 was intimate access to 130 world leaders, where Prime Minister Scott Morrison was smashed with back-to-back meetings on trade, the global economy, the economic rebuild and vaccinating the world. Australia helped calm the hyperventilation spurned by fear-mongering carpet baggers indulging in greenwash to drive the reality that socialism and giving trillions of dollars of taxes to China is not the answer.Australia led a solid bloc of countries, with Japan, Korea, India, Brazil, China and Indonesia to delete extreme pledges from the final communique, including a timel"

But this year, the government turned to another great Aussie export to win hearts and minds: the flat white.For the first time, Australia hosted a ""pavilion"", becoming one of about 40 countries, organisations and campaigns to set up a showcase and meeting space in the venue's vast exhibition hall.The Australian pavilion was set up as a mini-cafe, with promotional videos dominating one wall, a few companies touting their wares around the edges, and - most importantly - a coffee machine and barista in one corner.It instantly became a magnet for the Aussie crowd. On a given morning, you might see OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann having a quiet coffee with Rio Tinto chief executive Jakob Stausholm, or globetrotting businessman Andrew Liveris bumping into Santos CEO Kevin Gallagher.When he wasn't meeting Joe Biden or Al Gore, Andrew Forrest and his Fortescue Future Industries team were a near-permanent fixture at one end of the pavilion, next to a Tardis-like installation they had produced to help promote Twiggy's green hydrogen campaign.Australia's band of COP-attending environmentalists, including Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, also dropped in, though some raised an eyebrow at Santos' carbon capture and storage exhibit.High Commissioner to the UK George Brandis kept a stately eye on proceedings, while Energy Minister Angus Taylor held meetings or gave presentations in the private room upstairs.Gradually, though, the Aussie secret got out: word crept out into the broader conference about the quality of the coffee.The choice was simple: you could stand in a queue elsewhere at COP for 20 minutes and buy a crap coffee for almost $5, or you could queue for five minutes and get an Australian-quality one for free.The queue was suddenly full of student representatives, Pacific Island negotiators, and random passers-by.It got longer and longer - and made Australia's pavilion one of the busiest on site. ""Good coffee, good company. But most important, this is Aussie companies doing amazing things. That's what I liked most of all,"" Taylor tells AFR Weekend.He's sold on the concept. ""When we left Madrid [the 2019 COP], I said, 'Next time, this is what we're doing'. We have worked very closely to get this outcome, and I want to ramp it up in the future.""In fact, he says he wants to ""double down"". What could this mean? Smashed avocado on sourdough toast?

Too much carbon in the atmosphere may create serious problems in the decades ahead.MCCORMACK: It depends on how he wants to frame his priorities and whether the government's reading of the room warrants it. Is action on climate change an urgent matter? Absolutely. Is his presence at a climate summit in Glasgow the most important thing? It's certainly not as important as concrete policy implementation and a legitimate roadmap on how we're going to fix the issue. His attendance in Glasgow will matter to the voters in seats like Warringah, or Brisbane. For people in Townsville or Gladstone, hearing from him directly, in person, on how the government plans to transition them away from fossil fuel industries will matter more.JOHNSON: A Prime Minister has a minister responsible for emissions he could send in his place, but the politics made a ScoMo no-show almost impossible.

"COP26","Australia","COP26_Australia303","Forrest adds Germany to tally of green deals; Exclusive","January 17, 2022 Monday","Australian Financial Review","London | Billionaire miner Andrew Forrest has added another green hydrogen deal to his sheaf, promising to supply up to 100,000 tonnes a year to a German chemicals giant as soon as 2024.The deal with Leverkusen-based Covestro, which Mr Forrest will announce today, is one of several supply commitments that his green energy unit Fortescue Future Industries has signed in Europe, even though FFI's capability is largely still on the drawing board.The two companies' memorandum of understanding is a precursor to a formal deal, but envisages FFI shipping 100,000 tonnes a year of green hydrogen and derivatives such as ammonia to Covestro plants in Asia, North America and Europe.""This collaboration reinforces that green hydrogen is a practical, implementable solution for a range of difficult-to-decarbonise industries,"" said FFI chief executive Julie Shuttleworth.FFI, the green energy arm of Mr Forrest's iron ore giant Fortescue Metals Group, will spend up to $US600 million ($820 million) this financial year on building an end-to-end supply chain for hydrogen and ammonia produced using only renewable energy.In recent months Mr Forrest has been on a relentless campaign to promote this form of hydrogen over the ""grey"" and ""blue"" alternatives, which rely on fossil fuels, with carbon sequestration for the latter.During a visit to Britain for the COP26 climate conference, he signed an MoU with British construction-equipment giant JCB for 10 per cent of FFI's output, which he has estimated will reach 15 million tonnes a year by 2030.He also signed MoUs with Jordan and Papua New Guinea to build renewable energy projects that could power green hydrogen production.After COP26 he went to Berlin and led a roundtable with senior bureaucrats and corporate executives at the German government's ministry for economic affairs and energy. The companies involved in the roundtable reportedly included chemicals companies Covestro and BASF, energy giant RWE, engineer and steelmaker Thyssenkrupp and Deutsche Bank.Dr Forrest's move into Germany adds a new private-sector strut to the hydrogen partnership deal signed by the Australian and German governments in June last year.That initiative has produced a joint report on the hydrogen supply chain, and will this year launch a hydrogen innovation and technology incubator, with $50 million in funding from Canberra and (EURO)50 million ($78.5 million) from Berlin. Assistant energy minister Tim Wilson recently said collaborating with countries such as Germany would help ""achieve the technological breakthroughs required to lower the price of hydrogen and drive its widespread adoption"".By 2030, German hydrogen demand could be eight times higher than the green supply, making Europe's largest economy one of several hydrogen-hungry countries that are looking to Australia as a potential supplier.FFI said it was also participating in some of Germany's government-funded hydrogen projects, including the H2Giga project that is looking at how to manufacture electrolysers at scale, and the TransHyDE initiative that is piloting hydrogen transport projects.FFI's putative customer Covestro, a manufacturer of polymer materials, says it could cut its carbon dioxide emissions by 900,000 tonnes a year through switching from grey hydrogen to green.""Green hydrogen and its derivatives play a key role for the chemical industry, both as an alternative feedstock and a source of clean energy,"" said Covestro CEO Markus Steilemann.\l"

Yet cities can also do a lot to mitigate climate change and help people adapt to its impacts. Cities can use renewable energy sources, promote greener transport, and get industries to cut pollution and adopt cleaner production techniques. Also, they can form or use existing networks and partnerships to strengthen these efforts.Almost HYPERLINK https://data.unicef.org/resources/childrens-climate-risk-index-report/1 billion children - nearly half of the world's children - live in countries that are at extremely high risk of climate change impacts. Climate change has direct and indirect impacts on children's rights to health, life, dignity and education. Also, climate change increases the risk of exposure to violence against children. Climate-induced disasters displaces people, and limits access to schools, adequate water and nutrition. UNICEF has drawn attention to the fact that "" HYPERLINK https://www.unicef.org/reports/climate-crisis-child-rights-crisisthe climate crisis is a child rights crisis"".Recently children have taken the lead in global campaigns like School Strike for Climate and HYPERLINK Fridays for Future in over 7,500 cities. Children are calling on political leaders to see the crisis from their perspective and take action.Central governments are often criticised as too distant and detached from everyday realities. Whereas, city governments are closer to, and in a better position to deal with local challenges, needs and priorities. Cities are empowered by national and local laws to govern on issues concerning children and in climate-related areas. Thus, they can plan and deliver what's needed to address local climate challenges.In a recent HYPERLINK https://brill.com/view/journals/chil/29/4/article-p872_872.xmlstudy, I explored how city-level climate law and policy protects children in the context of climate change. The study used Kenya and South Africa as key examples. In many countries, and in these two countries specifically, I observed that city governments have the constitutional and legislative autonomy and obligations in climate-related functional areas such as water and sanitation. These laws and policies don't always specifically mention children, which means the concerns of children could escape attention. I argue that cities can do more to protect children from the impacts of climate change.Are children at the centre of climate action?The Climate Change HYPERLINK Act (2016) of Kenya is very clear on the obligations of institutions at the city level in relation to climate governance. It empowers county governments to enact laws and policies that promote city-level climate governance and to take robust climate action. Also, it obligates cities to make climate change responses an important part of their plans. The South African Climate Change HYPERLINK https://www.parliament.gov.za/storage/app/media/Bills/2022/B9_2022_Climate_Change_Bill/B9_2022_Climate_Change_Bill.pdfBill empowers municipalities to adopt climate change response plans at the local level. In particular, municipalities must coordinate climate action within their jurisdiction, including mainstream climate change responses in their development plans. The constitutions of Kenya and South Africa have explicit provisions dedicated to children's rights. Although these constitutional children's rights do not speak to climate change directly, the spectrum of rights guarantees children protection from the impacts of the climate crisis. Despite these obligations of city authorities over climate action on one hand, and children on the other hand, in reality the challenges of children do not always get attention in plans, budgets and interventions at the city level. This is a reality in many other cities in Africa, apart from the cities in Kenya and South Africa. The gains of child-led climate actionIn 2019, for the first time, children filed a HYPERLINK legal complaint to a UN human rights treaty body - the HYPERLINK https://www.ohchr.org/en/treaty-bodies/crcCommittee on the Rights of the Child - about the failure of their governments to take firm climate action. The children pointed out that they lived in cities such as Cape Town (South Africa), Lagos (Nigeria) and Tabarka (Tunisia) where the impacts of climate change are on the rise.The communication was considered HYPERLINK https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2021/10/un-child-rights-committee-rules-countries-bear-cross-border-responsibilityinadmissible, meaning it could not be heard on the merits. Yet it was ground-breaking in making it clear that children are key actors in climate change action, deserving a seat at the table of decision-making. The acceptance of children as key co-decision makers in climate governance is evident in their participation in global forums such as the 2021 climate conference - HYPERLINK COP26. This is commendable. But, without robust action and engagement of children at the local sphere of government, the commitments become empty noise. Considering the trends in urbanisation, child urban population, and the climate crisis, I would urge cities to:  Expressly provide for the rights of children in climate action, particularly in law, policy and strategies. This acts as a strong legal tool to ensure the protection and participation of children in cities.Open or expand institutional spaces for children to participate and contribute to climate action at the city level. This could include sporting and fun activities, forums and other opportunities for children to be engaged on the climate discourse at community level.Invest technical and financial resources to ensure that children have access to updated climate change educational material in child-friendly versions, and in languages that they understand.Support child-led initiatives and campaigns. This could include capacity building, resource mobilisation, and guidance for children to contribute to climate action.Up-scale leadership and coordination of action and responses in a child-responsive and child-sensitive approach, including in climate-induced disasters. The best interests of children should be the guiding principle.Rongedzayi Fambasayi is an independent External Expert in the Working Group on Children's Rights and Climate Change of the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child.

What are export credit agencies and why do they matter?The Kexim loan was intended to go to the Korean energy group SK E&S, which had HYPERLINK planned to export gas from the project to Asia. Without funding, there may be no project. That's why Kexim's move is so important. While export credit agencies are not the only funders of oil, gas and coal infrastructure, and not the largest either, they have been instrumental in developing many of the world's most carbon intensive sectors.Read more: Green lending: world's biggest banks' latest initiative at COP26 is a step backwardsHow? By locking in fossil fuel energy systems, leveraging private finance by reducing risk premiums, and shaping international standards which influence private bank policies. In short, they have played a key role in enabling fossil fuel expansion. For decades, these state supported agencies have gone under the radar. No longer. Scrutiny is increasing of their work borrowing from national treasuries or public capital markets to finance export-oriented fossil fuel projects. That's not to criticise all the work these agencies do. They've proven invaluable for nations like South Korea as they industrialised. By providing direct loans, insurance and guarantees to foreign buyers, they have helped improve the competitiveness of their exports.Ending lending: why export credit agencies must fund clean alternativesIf the world is to achieve the rapid energy transition necessary to avoid the worst effects of climate change, we will need a revolution in global finance. We have to drain funding from fossil fuels and pump it into clean energy.Until recently, efforts to cut international public funding for fossil fuel projects have focused on multilateral development banks like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. In response, both have slowly started to HYPERLINK shift their financingWhile that's a positive step, bilateral funding bodies like export credit agencies are still stuck at square one. Research estimates these public banks are now financing fossil fuel projects more than the multilateral development banks. Between 2013 and 2015, for instance, these agencies HYPERLINK https://1bps6437gg8c169i0y1drtgz-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2017.10.16_FinancingClimateDisaster_final.pdffinanced oil and gasAustralia's equivalent - Export Finance Australia - is hardly blameless. Between 2009 and 2020, our HYPERLINK https://www.jubileeaustralia.org/resources/publications/hot-money-2021agency loaned an estimated A$1.5 billion to new coal, oil and gas projects, dwarfing the funding it gave to renewable projects. The pressure is mountingAs governments belatedly swing into action, it is likely we will see an end to the historical support given by these banks to highly polluting sectors. In turn, this will hinder corporate efforts to mobilise public and private finance alike.That's not to say there won't be holdouts. At the Glasgow UN climate conference in late 2021, developed countries including the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom HYPERLINK committed to ending public funding for ""unabated fossil fuel energy"". Australia, Japan and South Korea were not among the signatories.Read more: Why banning financing for fossil fuel projects in Africa isn't a climate solutionThe Glasgow announcement came only a month after the OECD HYPERLINK https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/agreement-reached-at-oecd-to-end-export-credit-support-for-unabated-coal-fired-power-plants.htmannounced it would end export credit support for coal-fired power plants built without the ability to capture and store carbon dioxide. While important, these steps are nowhere near enough. To date, only the Canadian export credit agency has committed to aligning funding with the goal of net zero by 2050. That means the lending policies of almost all of these agencies remain glaringly inconsistent with Paris Agreement goals and renewed warnings from climate scientists.In a year when unprecedented floodwaters have taken lives and livelihoods up and down Australia's east coast, it is time for governments to revise the mandates of their export credit agencies. They can be a force for good by helping to leverage billions of dollars into clean energy projects, rather than fossil fuel ones.Without government action, it will be left to local communities like the traditional owners in the Northern Territory and environmental organisations to fight uphill battles against these taxpayer funded banks.\l"

Holding the most decarbonisation potential of any renewable energy source, wind power is an indispensable part of the solution to climate change while generating significant socioeconomic benefits.\~\~ But the world is not installing wind power at the pace needed to achieve net zero, and much more needs to be done to unleash its potential. According to recently released roadmap reports on reaching Net Zero by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the world needs to be installing wind power at around 3-4 times the level of 2020, which saw a record 93 GW installed.\~\~ The wind industry's new campaign for COP26 asks governments, companies, and people across the world one critical question: Wind. Are You In?\~\~ ""We need to move from talking to action, and work together to massively scale up wind power around the world if we want to get to net zero by 2050. We need to be installing wind energy three to four times the current pace, which means we need governments to urgently raise their ambition, simplify red tape, invest in grid and revamp energy markets,"" said Ben Backwell, CEO at GWEC.\~\~ ""The wind industry has the technology, and there is huge appetite from investors and companies to switch to clean energy, but we need governments to stop holding us back and be all in for wind"", he added.\~\~ The record-breaking deployment of global wind energy has been driven by a virtuous cycle of innovation, cost reduction, and increased scale. The result of this immense growth is that wind energy is now a mainstream energy source and has proven to be reliable and affordable while being a sustainable engine for economic growth.\~\~ ""Investing in wind power is a win-win for countries to create new local jobs and investment today to power a green recovery, while building more resilient infrastructure and economies for tomorrow. Governments are missing their golden opportunity to achieve their parallel goals of climate action and boosting economies after the COVID-19 crisis if they don't take urgent action to drive wind power growth. We need them to get serious about wind"", commented Rebecca Williams, Director of COP26 at GWEC.COP26, and governments need to use this critical moment to put the world on the right track to achieve net zero. We don't have time left to go on 'business-as-usual' - the climate emergency is already here. Luckily, we already have the solution that can significantly reduce the world's carbon emissions, but we need governments to join us now or risk getting left behind"", she added.\~\~ The Global Wind Energy Coalition for COP26 is an initiative led by the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC), and is a multi-stakeholder group of leading wind power companies and associations from across the globe committed to ramping up wind power capacity to limit the dangerous impacts of climate change.

But federal Assistant Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Tim Wilson said the report showed the world should follow Australia's approach.""What we actually need is other countries to follow our lead. While we've committed to net zero by 2050, we've got the UK now asking for wriggle room and backsliding on their commitment. China hasn't even committed to net zero by 2050,"" Mr Wilson told ABC Radio National yesterday.Other countries should adopt Australia's approach to ""technological innovation and deployment"", Mr Wilson said.The federal government is committed to its Paris Agreement target to reduce emissions by at least 26 per cent by 2030, based on 2005 levels of greenhouse pollution, and hit net zero by 2050. It has pledged billions in financial support to expand fossil fuel production under a ""gas-fired recovery"" to the COVID economic downturn.According to the report's 65-page summary for world governments, its models show that if the world was to hold warming to 1.5 degrees, we would need to have greenhouse gas emissions peak by 2025 and have ""rapid and deep [greenhouse gas] emissions reductions follow throughout 2030, 2040 and 2050"".It says that ""without a strengthening of policies beyond those that are implemented by the end of 2020, [greenhouse gas emissions] are projected to rise beyond 2025, leading to a median global warming of 3.2 degrees"". The report shows that if used on current trends the world's existing fossil fuel infrastructure alone would release enough greenhouse gas emissions to drive us past 1.5 degrees.One of the report's lead authors, Professor Frank Jotzo, director of the Centre for Climate Economics and Policy at Australian National University, said that he believed it was no longer ""plausible"" that the world could take the actions needed to hold warming to 1.5 degrees without overshoot. But he said it was positive news that the report showed the pathways to 2 degrees of warming were open, achievable and readily affordable. This would mean having emissions peak in 2025 and reduce by a quarter by 2030.He said the impacts of 2 degrees were far worse than 1.5 degrees, but that until recent changes in policy around the world and reductions in the cost of renewables, that target appeared out of reach too. ""The reference point here is what is realistically achievable,"" he said.The report showed that policies already adopted were having a significant impact on emissions, but also in protecting ecosystems while helping create new jobs. ""[The report] shows that a one-quarter reduction in global emissions would be possible and costs below $US20 dollars ($A27) per tonne. So now we're talking costs that are far below for example, the current European Union emissions trading price,"" he said.Limiting warming to about 1.5 degrees required global greenhouse gas emissions to peak before 2025 at the latest, and be reduced by 43 per cent by 2030; at the same time, methane would also need to be reduced by about a third, the IPCC said in a statement. ""Even if we do this, it is almost inevitable that we will temporarily exceed this temperature threshold but could return to below it by the end of the century.""""It's now or never, if we want to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees,"" said Jim Skea, co-chair of the IPCC working group that wrote the report. ""Without immediate and deep emissions reductions across all sectors, it will be impossible.

Business wants to make it happen,"" Mr Israel said in an interview with The Australian Financial Review.""The momentum is huge for investors and now for the market, particularly after COP26, these things have become very important for new investors.""For us, we've been on a journey to create pathways for each of our portfolio companies. This commitment furthers our objective to proactively prepare for the escalating risks of climate change and to capture the emerging opportunities from decarbonisation.""Its new commitments for its Global Infrastructure Fund and Infrastructure Portfolio - worth more than $5 billion - include at least a 50 per cent reduction in scope one and scope two carbon emissions by 2030.There is also a commitment to reach net zero in scope three emissions, which include those by end users.Across the two QIC funds that are tackling the net zero commitments, there are 17 assets across six countries.The assets include Port of Melbourne, Brussels airport, Hobart Airport as well as some renewable assets such as Tilt Renewables in Australia and CenTrio in the United States.Mr Israel said there would be a ""longer tail"" trying to decarbonise some of the asset classes such as shipping and aviation.CEFC chief executive Ian Learmonth said it was important to take action in difficult-to-abate infrastructure, including ""bolt-on"" emission reduction opportunities for existing assets as well the acquisition of new assets, including those that have a focus on reducing carbon emissions.Some 70 per cent of Australia's emissions are associated with infrastructure projects.""With assets spanning energy, transport and social infrastructure, the QGIF portfolio provides an exciting opportunity to deliver meaningful action on climate change,"" he said.""These assets are critical to our economic growth and QGIF is demonstrating how they can play a leading role in our transition to a low-emissions economy.""The Ashurst survey found the top three strategies for reaching net zero were to reduce the company's own emissions (57 per cent), acquire carbon offsets (48 per cent) or directly invest in development projects (48 per cent).A total of 72 respondents to the survey said their strategies for the energy transition had changed in the past year.Some 63 per cent of organisations believed their shift in investing in traditional energy sources, such as coal, gas and oil, to renewable technologies would accelerate in the next 12 months.While hydrogen was the buzz word at the COP26 summit in Glasgow, the survey found company investors interest in hydrogen had slowed in the past year as it was seen in the early stages of development.""Respondents' sentiment that the technology will take longer to mature reflects the current cost estimates for hydrogen which are not yet economically competitive,"" the Ashurst report found.""There is also lack of clarity about how quickly domestic and international demand for hydrogen - whether as ammonia or liquified - will emerge.""Ashurst said it had seen some private groups beginning to invest larger amounts in hydrogen-related businesses which is expected to increase as government regulation and support becomes clearer.\l"

These commitments were well below those of other developed nations.The text also calls on countries to accelerate the phase out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels. Australia will fight to keep the current vague wording, which doesn't set time frames or specific targets.Energy Minister Angus Taylor said Australia should be judged on action and outcomes. He stressed that Australia was projected to reduce emissions by a greater amount than the target: 35 per cent by 2030 on 2005 levels.Between 2005 and 2021, Australia's emissions fell by 20.8 per cent, and he pointed out that this outpaced the reductions of the United States, Canada and New Zealand, and every other major commodity exporting nation.COP26 which highlighted our strong record of achievement,"" Mr Taylor said.""While ambition is important, action and outcomes are what matters.""

Scientists say even with all of the commitments made this year, including a flurry in the past fortnight, that global warming will be 2.4C higher by the end of the century and urged even more urgent action to cut fossil fuels.The text recognises that limiting global warming to 1.5C by 2100 requires rapid, deep and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, including reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 relative to the 2010 level and to net zero around mid-century.Countries that haven't submitted new or updated nationally -determined contributions for 2030 must do so by November 22 next year. It is proposed that world leaders meet next November and then every year to finetune their pre-2030 ambitions.Money for developing countries to try to mitigate climate change is to go beyond the current target of $US100bn a year and there is scope for much larger support from 2025.India had asked that there be $US1 trillion a year support for -developing countries.

This does not mean the idea of acting solely in the interest of shareholders is dead. But we are in a very different context now.

And it is damning.This report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a litany of broken climate promises.It is a file of shame, cataloguing the empty pledges that put us firmly on track towards an unlivable world.We are on a fast track to climate disaster: Major cities underwater. Unprecedented heatwaves.Terrifying storms. Widespread water shortages. The extinction of a million species of plants and animals. This is not fiction or exaggeration.It is what science tells us will result from our current energy policies.We are on a pathway to global warming of more than double the 1.5-degree limit agreed in Paris.Some government and business leaders are saying one thing - but doing another. Simply put, they are lying.And the results will be catastrophic. This is a climate emergency. Climate scientists warn that we are already perilously close to tipping points that could lead to cascading and irreversible climate impacts.They are choking our planet, based on their vested interests and historic investments in fossil fuels, when cheaper, renewable solutions provide green jobs, energy security, and greater price stability.We left COP26 in Glasgow with a na\'efve optimism, based on new promises and commitments.But the main problem - the enormous, growing emissions gap - was all but ignored.The science is clear. To keep the 1.5-degree limit agreed in Paris within reach, we need to cut global emissions by 45 per cent this decade.But current climate pledges would mean a 14 per cent increase in emissions. And most major emitters are not taking the steps needed to fulfil even these inadequate promises.Climate activists are sometimes depicted as dangerous radicals. But the truly dangerous radicals are the countries that are increasing the production of fossil fuels.Investing in new fossil fuels infrastructure is moral and economic madness. Such investments will soon be stranded assets - a blot on the landscape, and a blight on investment portfolios.But it doesn't have to be this way. Today's report is focused on mitigation - cutting emissions.It sets out viable, financially sound options in every sector that can keep the possibility of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees alive.First and foremost, we must triple the speed of the shift to renewable energy. That means moving investments and subsidies from fossil fuels to renewables - now.In most cases, renewables are already far cheaper. It means governments ending the funding of coal, not just abroad, but at home.It means climate coalitions, made up of developed countries, multilateral development banks, private financial institutions, and corporations, supporting major emerging economies in making this shift.It means protecting forests and ecosystems as powerful climate solutions. It means rapid progress in reducing methane emissions.And it means implementing the pledges made in Paris and Glasgow. Leaders must lead.But all of us can do our part.We owe a debt to young people, civil society and indigenous communities for sounding the alarm and holding leaders accountable.We need to build on their work to create a grassroots movement that cannot be ignored. If you live in a big city, a rural area, or a small island state; if you invest in the stock market; if you care about justice, and our children's future; I am appealing directly to you: demand that renewable energy is introduced now - at speed and at scale.Demand an end to coal-fired power. Demand an end to all fossil-fuel subsidies. Today's report comes at a time of global turbulence.Inequalities are at unprecedented levels. The recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is scandalously uneven.Inflation is rising, and the war in Ukraine is causing food and energy prices to skyrocket.But increasing fossil fuel production will only make matters worse. Choices made by countries now will make or break the commitment to 1.5 degrees.A shift to renewables will mend our broken global energy mix and offer hope to millions of people suffering climate impacts today.Climate promises and plans must be turned into reality and action - now.It is time to stop burning our planet, and start investing in the abundant renewable energy all around us.UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres delivered this speech after the release of the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.A guide to the environment, what's happening to it, what's being done about it and what it means for the future.

In the first draft, the seven-page document urges parties to ""revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their nationally-determined contributions, as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022"".The request for new targets are aimed at countries like Australia, China, India, Brazil and Saudi Arabia to have fresh short term plans on the table by the end of next year, which for Australia, falls after the general election.The text also calls on countries to accelerate the phase out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels. Australia will fiercely try and keep the current vague wording, which doesn't set any time frames or specific targets on this point. Australia, like the United States, has refused to sign up to a pledge to phase out coal mining. Australia's position is to continue to export coal and that the wind down of coal-fired power generation will develop over time.Federal politicians have reassured Australians that the lights won't go out.Australia also bypassed another big push at COP26, the pledge to cut methane gases.Mr Johnson returned to Glasgow by train on Wednesday to build momentum for the consensus cover document and said: ""Here in Glasgow the world is closer than it has ever been to signalling the beginning of the end of anthropogenic climate change, and it's the greatest gift we can possibly bestow on our children and our grandchildren and generations unborn''.He added: ""We just need to reach out together and grasp it. And so my question to my fellow world leaders this afternoon as we enter the last hours of COP is - will you help us do that, will you help us graph that opportunity, or will you stand in the way?""Mr Johnson said the world knows what a mess our planet is in and people will ""find it absolutely incomprehensible if we fail to deliver"".He warned the the backlash from people ""will be immense and it will be long-lasting'', adding, ""frankly we will deserve their criticism and their opprobrium.

The UN wants to keep countries on track to try and prevent global temperature rises going above 1.5C this century. Scientists say even with all of the commitments made this year, including a flurry in the past fortnight, that global warming will be 2.4 degrees higher by the end of the century and urged even more urgent action to cut fossil fuels.The text recognises that limiting global warming to 1.5C by 2100 requires rapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions, including reducing global carbon dioxide emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 relative to the 2010 level and to net zero around mid-century.Countries that haven't submitted new or updated nationally determined contributions for 2030 must do so by November 22 next year. It is proposed that world leaders meet next November and then every year to fine tune their pre-2030 ambitions.Money for developing countries to try and mitigate climate change and make them more resilient is to go beyond the current target of $100bn a year and there is scope for much larger support from 2025. India had asked that there be $1 trillion a year support for developing countries.The draft says that developed countries are to at least double their collective provision of climate finance for adaptation to developing countries.\l"

That's always very, very concerning no matter where you are in the world.""When the Herald described Australia's refusal to count Scope 3 emissions from its coal burned overseas as ""the drug dealer's defence of I didn't use the drugs, I simply sold them"", Mr Joyce said the argument did not apply because drugs killed people and ruined families, while coal generated power that kept people warm and had helped pull countless people out of dire poverty.It was ""a moral good"".He said he still supported new coal-fired power stations if needed.During his tour through the electorate of Lyne, Mr Joyce was taken to see four federally funded projects: Figtrees on the Manning, the Taree Universities Campus, Forster Main Beach foreshore and the Forster civic precinct.Dr Gillespie said the Figtrees on the Manning development was almost half finished and would encourage hundreds of millions of dollars worth of residential and commercial real estate development and a pedestrian and cycle corridor connecting Taree CBD with the city's regional sports facilities.Dr Gillespie said Mr Joyce was also shown around Taree Universities Campus, which was looking at the former council office building as a potential long-term home.He said the Forster civic precinct project was under way and Forster Surf Club was being redeveloped with the federal government having contributed $3.59 million towards a $6.3 million project.Our journalists work hard to provide local, up-to-date news to the community.

Leading into the Glasgow summit the IEA had calculated that the temperature increase would be as much as 2.7 degrees Celsius.Mr Birol added a caveat, noting ""there is a big if, here"" that the pledges will all have to be carried out to see the slowing of the warming rate, and some of the pledged measures were dependent on funding from richer countries. Selwin Hart, UN Special Adviser and Assistant Secretary-General for climate change, challenged the IEA numbers and said the battle to reduce global heating was ""far from over"".""Fatih, I heard your numbers, but based on the Nationally Determined Contributions that have been submitted, the world is on a 2.7 degree pathway, a catastrophic pathway, and therefore we are a long way away from keeping the 1.3 degree goal of the Paris Agreement alive,"" he said.Mr Birol told the Australian government that he agreed with Canberra's position that blue hydrogen, made using gas and having the carbon emissions captured and stored underground, was worth pursuing. He added: ""There is a huge discussion about what is low carbon hydrogen. In our view, natural gas and CCS can be a very good source of hydrogen if it is abated in the right ways. Of course the green hydrogen (using renewables) is the quality ... we also don't care about the colours if they are clean, if they are cost effective and if they are helping us to reach our energy level cost.""Mr Fatih said the key to hydrogen success would be to give demand a boost to reduce production costs.Meanwhile, Australia has agreed to double the energy efficiency of four key products - industrial motor systems, air conditioners, refrigerators and lighting - in a COP26 Product Efficiency Call to Action led by the British government and the IEA.\l"
"COP26","Australia","COP26_Australia335","We need to stop kidding ourselves on climate; Opinion","April 26, 2022 Tuesday","Australian Financial Review","The election campaign is being conducted as if Australia has no fundamental problems, and can afford to squabble over personality and trivia.The contest has headed in the wrong direction, with endless commitments to debt-funded increases in public expenditure and subsidisation of unsustainable emissions-intensive industry.It is good that we are starting to face up to the failure of development knowledge and support, and of diplomacy that has led to China filling the vacuum of influence in Solomon Islands.But we have hardly noticed the more consequential failure of influence in the much larger country closer to home.Why did it take a Papua New Guinea royal commission to show that Australian authorities were asleep at the wheel as some Australian professional and corporate interests undermined fragile democratic governance in PNG?Climate change connects these and other crucial Australian interests. We are the developed country that has most to lose from climate disruption. Failure of the global effort would impose greater cost on Australia than any other developed economy.Failure would damage profoundly our geostrategic interests, including from the displacement of hundreds of thousands of residents of the Western and Gulf provinces just across the water from Far North Queensland and in the populous Sepik provinces of Papua New Guinea.Despite our large economic interests in coal and LNG exports, Australia - more than any other country - would receive large net economic benefits from an early and complete global transition to zero net emissions.In the high-carbon economy, Australian coal is available to industries in Shanghai, Kobe and Pusan as cheaply as it is in Australian cities. Development of the LNG export industry in Gladstone lifted the cost of Australian gas in our eastern industrial cities to that in north-east Asia. Thus, despite being a net energy exporter, Australian energy-intensive manufacturing receives no competitive advantage.By contrast, Australia's potential to generate and firm renewable energy more cheaply than other countries confers large and sustainable advantages on domestic industry in the new low-carbon world. Yes, Andrew Forrest and Mike Cannon-Brookes will sell large quantities of solar energy to South-East Asia, transported by submarine cable.Many producers using renewable electricity will export zero-emissions hydrogen and its carriers to Asian and European markets.But unlike coal and gas, Australian renewable electricity and hydrogen will be more than twice as expensive in Singapore, Pusan, Kobe, Shanghai and Hamburg as they are at home.Submarine cables and preparation for export and transport of hydrogen and its chemical carriers cost more than the renewable products themselves. It will not be economically sensible to process Australian materials in other countries using Australian zero-emissions energy. Australia will be the economically rational location for at least the early stages of processing.Using Australian renewable hydrogen at home to process the Australian iron ore that currently goes overseas would reduce global emissions by more than twice as much as Australia reducing its own domestic emissions to zero.Unlike the old industry, the zero-emissions economic opportunities of the future are overwhelmingly concentrated in rural and provincial Australia.And yet at the COP26 meeting of the UN in Glasgow last year, we joined Russia, China, Brazil and Saudi Arabia in opposition to the US, Britain, the European Union and other developed democracies on 2030 emissions reduction targets, reduction of methane emissions, and early phasing out of coal in power generation.We were noticed. A senior American official close to US President Joe Biden told veteran Sydney Morning Herald journalist Peter Hartcher: ""We were looking to a close ally for support at Glasgow on a key policy and Morrison gave us just f---ing bullshit.""As I wrote in five articles in The Australian Financial Review late last year, our government was kidding itself on climate policy at Glasgow. We were relying on a ""road map"" that had a different destination from other developed countries, no engine to drive us across the landscape, and no steering mechanism.The kidding has shifted to more emphatic denial as we have doubled down on a ""gas-led recovery"", expanding coal and gas capacity as prices rose at first with restrictions on investment for climate reasons in other countries, and temporarily more with the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Uniquely in the developed democratic world, we avoided significant support for the energy and climate transition in a spending spree that will leave us with a trillion dollars of Commonwealth debt. The kidding has taken new shapes during the election campaign. The Commonwealth government has told coal and gas exporters who are benefiting from historically high prices and profits that they have no responsibility to remove or offset fugitive emissions.This promise jeopardises the current government's woefully inadequate emissions reduction commitments. With the OECD's Australia secretary-general, Mathias Cormann, leading efforts to introduce a carbon price throughout the developed world, our government has promised during this election campaign to never ever join this global effort.The COP27 meeting in Egypt late this year gives Australia a second chance. Prime Minister Scott Morrison at the 2019 election rejected the opposition's commitment to net zero emissions by 2050. He cared enough for the national interest to break that promise.If he is still prime minister at the time of COP27 and still cares for the national interest, he needs to desist from holding out against the heads of government of the US, Britain and other developed democracies, and take Australia's 2030 commitment into the range of developed countries. That means beating South Korea's minus 42 per cent.If whoever is prime minister cares for the national interest, he needs to add a commitment to reduce emissions by three quarters by 2035, accept Biden's leadership by joining the global pledge to reduce methane emissions by 30 per cent by 2030, and join the US president and other leaders of the developed democratic world in committing to phase out coal in power generation by 2035.Australians face interrelated policy challenges of historic dimension.Fail to deal with them well, and we irretrievably disrupt climate and environmental conditions that underpin Australian lives, lose the chance to regain effective influence in our neighbourhood, continue the last decade's stagnation and decl"

But it went no further than Mr Xi's pledge last December to reach net-zero emissions by 2060, and barely advanced the country's previous NDC in 2016.Mr Johnson's team will be hoping the Chinese leader pulls a rabbit from the hat during his on-screen address in Glasgow, such as bringing forward the ""peak"" of China's greenhouse gas emissions from 2030 to 2026.COP26 and taking concrete action to cut emissions and expedite the transition to renewable energy, including phasing out coal"".French President Emmanuel Macron has also been on the phone to Mr Xi, telling him to lift his game.""There is still a lot Beijing could do outside of its targets in the next two weeks, at the G20 summit in Rome and COP26 in Glasgow,"" said Byford Tsang, a senior policy advisor at climate think tank E3G.This could include ""supporting a political commitment to keep 1.5 Celsius within reach, and putting an expiry date on coal in its coal power system, and showing the world that it's serious about being a global leader on climate"".But any change announced at Glasgow would represent a substantial handbrake turn from Mr Xi.Although the country is ramping up its renewables base, Global Energy Monitor reported that last year China commissioned 38 gigawatts of new coal-fired power, triple the rest of the world combined, and initiated another 73.5 GW of new proposals.Indian intransigenceIndia's Mr Modi, meanwhile, has been resisting Johnson's efforts to lock him into tougher net-zero targets.His ministers have said India's focus will be on ""climate justice"": getting rich countries to transfer green technology to the developing world and unlocking more money from the West.The Indian press has been quoting government sources as saying that net-zero targets serve to push the burden onto emerging economies - which will particularly hit coal-dependent India, the world's third largest emitter of greenhouse gases after China and the US.Mr Modi has not yet made any new pledges for COP26. According to the Climate Action Tracker website, his government subsidises coal at a higher rate than renewables, and has opened the sector to private investors.India's coal capacity is thus expected to climb from 200 GW now to almost 266 GW by 2030.

David Mills reportsIt's been hyped as 2021's hot ticket, and Prince Charles dubbed it the ""last chance saloon"" for the environment. But in the weeks leading up to Sunday's COP26 conference in Glasgow, could momentum on climate action be slipping away? In April, the UK, US, Japan and Canada updated their emissions targets in one whirlwind week, offering tantalising hope some progress might finally be made on climate change.But in the past week, that ebullience has faded. Russia and Saudi Arabia committed to net zero, but pegged it on the never-never date of 2060. Australia opted for 2050 but announced it would not update its interim target for 2030.The two-week COP26COP26 will fail. Further blows came when the Queen and the Pope had to withdraw because of health issues.Could COP26Climate Council CEO Amanda McKenzie doesn't think so.""The Saudis, the Russians and the Australians have all been considered laggards in this regard, so it's not surprising those three countries have advanced a longer term target,"" she said. ""I think it's actually a really good sign that even the laggards are coming to the table."" Momentum shouldn't just be measured by the actions of countries, Ms McKenzie said, predicting Glasgow would feature a plethora of announcements from businesses, as well as state, provincial and local governments.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor arrive in Glasgow with a policy to reach net zero by 2050, but no increase on the existing goal of cutting emissions by 26-28 per cent by 2030. They will, however, produce projections showing Australia will likely reduce its greenhouse gases by 30-35 per cent by then anyway.The Morrison government's position has divided opinions.Boris Johnson heralded the 2050 goal as ""heroic"". CNN said the lack of an updated 2030 goal made Australia ""the rich world's weakest link"". John Connor, CEO of the Carbon Market Institute, said the lack of a stronger 2030 target would expose Australia to ""potential carbon tariffs and higher capital costs"".The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) Emissions Gap report, released on Wednesday, argued the Paris Agreement signatory countries would need to cut emissions by 55 per cent by 2030 to limit global warming to 1.5C.Alok Sharma, the incoming COP26 President, said there had been ""progress, but not enough"" on cutting emissions.""We especially need the biggest emitters, the G20 nations, to come forward with stronger commitments to 2030 if we are to keep 1.5C in reach over this critical decade,"" Mr Sharma said.The UNEP report stated current climate promises for 2030 put the world on track for 2.7C of warming by the end of the 21st century - a catastrophic rise that one recent Australian report claimed would almost certainly wipe out Australia's Great Barrier Reef.Mr Morrison appears unlikely to be moved by international pressure over 2030 targets.""We won't be lectured by others who do not understand Australia,"" he said while launching the government's net zero plan on Tuesday.""The Australian Way is all about how you do it, and not if you do it.

The same poll showed 55% of Australians say the government's energy policy should prioritise ""reducing carbon emissions"" - up eight points since 2019. We can expect the climate vote to be driven by several factors. They include: personal experience of disaster and recovery, Prime Minister Scott Morrison's leadership on the issue, the government's performance in reducing emissions, power prices and energy security, and competing parties' credibility and promises on climate action.There is mixed evidence on how extreme weather affects voting intentions. For example, while HYPERLINK https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358447878_Climate_change_experiences_raise_environmental_concerns_and_promote_Green_votingsome studies say it benefits parties with greener policies, HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/research-shows-voters-favour-financial-relief-after-disasters-but-we-need-climate-action-too-179028others indicate voters prioritise economic security after a disaster.But the Morrison government has also been accused of HYPERLINK https://www.smh.com.au/national/i-accept-the-criticism-scott-morrison-apologises-for-family-holiday-20191222-p53m6o.htmlweak leadership during recent disasters and being HYPERLINK https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/history-repeating-morrison-too-slow-on-a-natural-disaster-20220309-p5a37f.htmltoo slow to deliver assistance afterwards. Such perceptions, particularly in disaster-hit areas, are likely to weigh heavily against the government.The election, of course, will not be decided on the overall swing, but what happens in marginal seats and those where credible independent candidates - many of them with climate action high on their agendas - pose a real threat to incumbents. Some 25 electorates are likely to determine the next government. The 2019 election was only narrowly won by the Coalition and it HYPERLINK currently holds nine seats on a margin of less than 4%. Labor holds 14 marginal seats and independents hold two. Seven of these seats were hard hit by the Black Summer fires and this year's floods.

It has taken a long time to reach this point and many fraught negotiations. But if ever there was a prime minister suited to understanding the significance of presenting at COP26, it is the man who is disparaged as ""Scotty from Marketing"".He is now winging his way to the Glasgow meeting. He has a plan, which has been denigrated as merely a pamphlet. Even a planphlet by the wits and the wordsmiths. Despite their cynicism, it is the right document for the meeting he is about to attend.The UN Conference of Parties has never managed to fulfil the original vision of a serious forum in which countries negotiate and commit to achievable emissions-reduction targets to which they are able to hold one another accountable. For many years, renewable technology wasn't capable of powering a developed economy. It still isn't and countries remain unwilling to take an economic hit by relying too heavily on it.As a result, developed countries routinely fall short of their targets. The UN's 2021 Emissions Gap Report notes, for instance, that ""Canada and the United States of America have submitted strengthened NDC [Nationally Determined Contribution] targets, while independent studies suggest that they are not on track to meet their previous NDC targets with currently implemented policies"". Consequently, they will be subjected to the sternest peer pressure. The UN gave up any pretence that there would be HYPERLINK https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/sanctions-and-punishment-barred-from-cop21-vocabulary/sanctions or punishmentInstead, the COP has become an enormous annual collaborative marketing campaign at which concerned parties advertise the climate crisis and their heartfelt desire to mitigate climate change by hosting a kind of international reality game show. Governments strive to agree to goals that may or may not be possible, depending on the technology they're willing to deploy.""Ambition"" - the yearning rather than the completion - is highly prized. There is theoretically a pot of money to help poorer countries also sign up to ambitions, but most of it has yet to materialise. Part of the game is sledging each other for not being ambitious enough - that's the peer pressure part. When this is done well, it distracts from the fact that the most ambitious of the ambitions remain unfulfilled.Morrison and his Energy Minister, Angus Taylor, have understood there are no significant barriers or downsides to joining the game. Anybody can have ambition. They have also grasped that the gathering that accompanies the colossal marketing campaign has morphed into a technology trade expo. This makes it very worthwhile attending for a country with the ambition to secure technology investment.As such, Taylor will attend to ""promote Australia as a safe and reliable destination to invest in gas, hydrogen and new energy technologies"" and ""advance Australia's low emissions partnerships"". Some might call this a cynical use of the Conference of Parties. They would be right. It may also be the most realistic way to extract an outcome from COP26 and subsequent meetings - courting investment to develop technology that could help countries realise their climate ambitions is at least a tangible step towards transforming ambition into action.Australia committed to successful COP26 Summit in Glasgow @AngusTaylorMP\~#auspol\~pic.twitter.com/4FWteJDyEh Political Alert (@political_alert) October 28, 2021For Australian taxpayers, international investment would represent a welcome reduction to the bill for realising our own ambitions. We are currently on the hook for the new projects that form part of the ""technology road map"". Mining magnate Andrew ""Twiggy"" Forrest is currently shopping for government co-investment in his plan to create green hydrogen. This should serve as a reminder that, despite the government's slogan ""technology not taxes"", the replacement for the politically toxic carbon tax will be a big wodge of money out of the pooled taxes contributed by Australians, allocated by governments ""picking winners"".It would be nice to have this investment validated by an overseas vote of confidence that our money is going into a technology that others believe will one day pay a return. The large-scale Sun Cable project backed by Mike Cannon-Brookes and Forrest recently received this kind of recognition from the Indonesian government. COP26 will be an opportunity to present to other potential investors.Perhaps you now see where I'm going with this. The Nationally Determined Contribution documents that countries take to are hardly worth the hemp they're printed on as commitments to reducing emissions. But Australia's is a canny prospectus for wooing investors into taxpayer-supported projects. Scotty from Marketing's pamphlet full of ""technologies which don't yet exist"", as detractors have derided them, may fudge its way ignobly to 2050, but its value lies in the message it sends to investors that there's a government willing to contribute significant funds to new technology. And there's nothing investors like better than state-sponsorship to turbo-charge the value of their shares.Our national head of marketing will be presenting his prospectus at the biggest green expo in the world. The opportunities created by the sense of urgency that the summit creates around climate are there to be seized and monetised.You might admire the PM for his savvy or savage him for his lack of climatory zeal, but the fact remains that Scott Morrison and COP are a perfect match for each other.Get daily updates on the climate summit that will shape our future.

The United Nations has called for developed countries to remove coal from their power networks by 2030 in order to avert catastrophic levels of climate change.Under AGL's new closure dates, its Bayswater coal plant in NSW, which had been scheduled to retire in 2036, would now shut in 2033. Its newest coal generator, the Loy Yang A generator in Victoria's Latrobe Valley, would have its closure brought forward from 2048 to 2045.AGL said the earlier closures would cut its emissions by between 18-27 per cent a year from 2025-34, and by 55-60 per cent a year from 2025-30.""The readiness of the entire energy system to operate without our critical baseload generation will determine whether the earlier, more ambitious targets in the range can be achieved,"" the company said.The viability of AGL's coal operations have increasingly been in doubt as the rapid rise of cheaper-to-run renewable energy across the country drives daytime wholesale power prices to levels where fossil fuels struggle to compete. Volatile prices across the east-coast energy grid helped push AGL to a $2 billion net loss in the 12 months to June 30.On Thursday, AGL posted a 41 per cent drop in underlying profit to $194 million for the six months to December 31.

The CAT report criticised Australia on a number of fronts, including that it refused to cut out coal-fired power by 2030 and that it subsidised gas production.The report was compiled ahead of the Australian government's pre-COP26 pledge for net zero by 2050. But Canberra was chastised for ramping up a ""gas-fired recovery"" over a green economic recovery and its refusal to increase a 2030 domestic emissions target. The CAT's new overall rating for Australia is ""highly insufficient"".Global temperature rises above 2\'b0C are predicted to create a maelstrom of deadly environmental impacts from record heatwaves, rises in sea levels, destruction of ice sheets and ocean devastation, including of coral reefs.""Under current policies (rather than the pledges), we estimate end-of-century warming to be 2.7\'b0C,"" the report says. If all 2030 pledges are factored in, the rise is still estimated at 2.4\'b0C. ""While this temperature estimate has fallen since our September 2020 assessment, major new policy developments are not the driving factor.

Australian Renewable Energy Agency chief executive Darren Miller, who is overseeing the grants program, said ""assisting fleet users to move to zero-emission vehicles means getting more zero-emission cars and trucks on the road sooner and driving the road transport sector towards a net zero future"".""By getting these vehicles on the road as soon as possible we'll reduce emissions in the short term and help to create a market for second-hand vehicles, giving more consumers the option of switching to a ZEV with their next vehicle purchase,"" Mr Miller said.""We're confident the future fuels program will continue that great work and drive down Australia's transport emissions."" Mr Taylor, who will launch the $128m funding boost for low-emission fleets at SEA Electric Australia, said the government was backing businesses that want to switch to future fuel technologies ""where it makes sense for their fleets"".""We will not force Australians out of the vehicle they want to drive or put the costs up for those who can afford it the least,"" he said.The Future Fuels strategy, released following the Glasgow summit last year, is a central pillar of the government's $2.1bn investment in low- and zero-emission technologies.

He's instead raised a new date.""COP27 [in 2022] will move to targets for 2035 and that will become the medium-term target that nations will be asked to look at and that obviously creates scope for countries like Australia to look at their projections,"" he told the ABC.Mr Falinski did not put a specific target on the 2035 date but said it should be ""as high as possible in a manner and form that protects both our environment and the economic opportunities that Australia"".""As a matter of democratic faith, any update to our 2035 target needs to be taken to the people at an election so they can compare and contrast,"" Mr Falinski said.Several other Liberal MPs are agitating for the same outcome.

The improved scenario was largely attributable to China's recently reaffirmed target to get to net zero by 2060, and India's announcement it would get there by 2070, researchers said.The two nations are the first and third biggest emitters, collectively responsible for more than a third of total greenhouse gases pumped into the atmosphere.Dr Simon Bradshaw from the Climate Council said the analysis was ""highly credible"", but it ""hinges on the assumption that pledges will be backed by the necessary policies and actions across energy and land use, and that funding is adequate to ensure their implementation"".""While real progress, it is still a long way from what is necessary to 'keep 1.5C alive'. That will require countries coming back with new and stronger commitments for this decade,"" Dr Bradshaw said.The analysis comes after US Climate Envoy John Kerry cited other experts who said the world still had a 60 per cent chance of limiting global warming at 1.5C.The most recent IPCC report showed the world had already warmed close to 1.1C above pre-industrial levels.Professor Will Steffen said a 1.9C warmer world would certainly be better than one that was 2.5C or 3C hotter, but we shouldn't ""underestimate how much more difficult a 1.9 degree warmer world is going to be to live in"".""First of all with a huge degree of probability, the Great Barrier Reef would be gone,"" he said.

Deputy Prime Minister and Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce said a 30 per cent cut in emissions would have a disastrous impact on the beef, feedlot, dairy and coal mining sectors.Methane makes up about 20 per cent of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions - with the livestock industry responsible for roughly half of that.Mr Strong said the sector was already a world leader when it came to reducing emissions.""When you think about the contribution of livestock, so often the poor old cow gets maligned in this whole discussion,"" Mr Strong said.""(The livestock industry accounts for) half of the methane emissions but the addition to that is that it's only 10 per cent (of total emissions). And ... it's actually been halved since 2005.""So we have all this discussion around livestock, largely from the people who are responsible for the other 90 per cent. We've all got our part to play and livestock, particularly cattle, have already done a massive amount of the heavy lifting.""Mr Strong said breakthroughs on genetics, enabling farmers to turn off livestock at a younger age and a heavier weight, and progress with technology, in particular methane-reducing feedstuffs, meant the red-meat industry was more than halfway to meeting its goal of being carbon neutral by 2030.He said the industry recorded ""some quick wins upfront when we didn't know much about where the specific areas of progress were going to come from first"" and expects the remaining percentage to be somewhat more challenging.""Maybe it was the easy half but we've still got the best part of nine years to go (to reach the target) so it is OK ... it's definitely achievable and something which the sector remains committed to.""Mr Strong said expected ""bonuses along the way"" to carbon neutrality by 2030 included climate neutrality ""where we no longer contribute to warming"".""This is what so much of the conversation is about,"" he said.

So it ticks the box for sustainability.ETFs also tick the box for value. The Vanguard fund for instance has an annual fund fee of just 0.16 per cent.The 2021 Responsible Investment Benchmark Report from the Responsible Investment Association of Australia (RIAA) shows that investing sustainably doesn't have to mean sacrificing strong returns.The RIAA found responsible Australian share funds notched up gains averaging 7.4 per cent and 8.1 per cent annually over the past five and 10 years respectively.International funds with a sustainable focus performed even better with five- and 10-year returns of 11.4 per cent and 10.1 per cent respectively.Of course, past returns are no guide for the future.But as the RIAA notes, money is jumping ship to ethical investments.In Australia, the responsible investment market has soared in popularity to be worth $1.2 trillion in 2020.Ethical investing could be the way for you to help the planet while also helping to grow your wealth.Paul Clitheroe is Chairman of InvestSMART, Chair of the Ecstra Foundation and chief commentator for Money Magazine.\l"

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh1","A Bangladeshi youth at COP 21","January 6, 2016 Wednesday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Jan. 6 -- The global temperatures will rise by 3.5 to 7.4 degrees celsius in less than one hundred years, with even greater increase over land and the poles. These apparent minor shifts in temperature could trigger widespread disasters in the form of rising sea levels, violent and volatile weather patterns, desertification, famine, water shortage and other secondary effects including conflict. For this the 2015 United Nations , COP 21 or CMP 11 was held in Paris, France, from 30 November to 12 December 2015. About 196 countries were present in the conference, it attracted close to 50,000 participants including 25,000 official delegates from government, intergovernmental organisations, UN agencies, NGOs and civil societies and also a team of 11 young reporters known as the Climate Tracker Adopt a Negotiator Fellows.Among them was Sohara Mehroze Shachi, one of the key young Bangladeshi voices on climate change. Shachi completed her masters in development studies from BRAC University. She did her bachelors from Yale University, USA. She is currently working in the development sector. Shachi was selected as the only Bangladeshi from over 2,000 international applicants to participate as a youth fellow. During the conference she focused on climate finance -- funding for mitigation and adaptation. She expressed, ""Bangladesh emits very little carbon by global standards, but it is still bearing the brunt of climate change in the form of increased frequency and intensity of natural disasters like flood, hurricanes and drought. Bangladesh government is making significant investments for adapting to climate change.""In developing countries, the increasing number of population, raise of income levels and excessive use of energy are leading to rapid increase of greenhouse gas emission. These emissions are expected to surpass those of developed countries. The magnitude of future growth of emissions, however, is by no means certain.Sohara said that mitigation measures are already underway that are tempering the growth of developing country emissions, the forces that drive these measures, and the opportunities that may exist for furthering them. In order to achieve the long-term temperature goal set out of keeping temperature rise below 2degC, developing countries aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, and to undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance with best available science to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century.COP 21 was able to achieve a historic agreement. As per this Paris deal, countries must aim to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, reduce the risks and impacts of climate change to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2degC above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5degC above pre-industrial levels. Countries must also make finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.As a youth fellow from Bangladesh at COP 21, Sohara was humbled by the response she received, including being interviewed by different television channels, Vogue magazine and a leading German publication Taz. ""In COP 21, as a citizen of one of the most climate change affected countries, I was considered to be the voice of millions of vulnerable people,"" says Sohara, ""and that is a huge responsibility."" She also interviewed many eminent leaders including members of the Bangladesh government delegation, and wrote articles for numerous national and international publications including Deutsche Welle, Huffington Post, Open Democracy and IPS.According to Sohara Mehroze Shachi, Bangladesh's response to climate change has been remarkable. The country has a good strategic framework for combating climate change, having developed a Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP), a National Action Plan on Adaptation (NAPA) as well as setting up a Bangladesh Change Trust Fund (BCCTF). Bangladesh is not waiting to get International funds, but is rather investing its own resources to undertake adaptation interventions. Climate Change Cell was also established in the Department of Environment (DoE).However, there is still a long way to go for Bangladesh.""It is an uphill struggle to ensure direct access to climate finance for developing countries like Bangladesh,"" Sohara says., ""We need to develop our institutional capacity to overcome barriers of direct access, such as lack of transparency and accountability in climate finance expenditure.""The writer is a second year BBA student at Bangladesh University of Professional(BUP), HYPERLINK mailto:arabid418@gmail.comarabid418@gmail.comPublished by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh2","COP 21- is the glass half empty or half full?","January 5, 2016 Tuesday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Jan. 5 -- The 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP 21 or CMP 11 that was held in Paris, France, from November 30 to December 12, 2015 has left some wondering whether it was as successful as claimed by certain leaders. This was the 21st yearly session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the 11th session of the Meeting of the Parties to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.A number of meetings had already taken place in preparation for COP21, including the Bonn Climate Change Conference, October 19- 23, 2015, which produced a draft agreement. The Organising Committee had earlier stated that the objective of the 2015 Conference was to achieve, for the first time in over 20 years of UN negotiations, a binding and universal agreement on climate, from all the nations of the world.The Conference took place two weeks after a series of terrorist attacks had shattered the peace of central Paris. Security was tightened ahead of the event with 30,000 police officers and 285 security checkpoints deployed across the country until the conclusion of the Conference. The European Union and 195 nations, including Bangladesh, were the participating parties.The overarching goal of the Convention was to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to limit the increase of global temperature. Since COP 17 this increase had been set at 2degree C (3.6degree F) above pre-industrial levels. Christiana Figueres, a leading figure associated with COP-21, had however acknowledged in the closing briefing at the 2012 Doha Conference that ""the current pledges under the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol are clearly not enough to guarantee that the temperature will stay below 2degree C and there is an ever-increasing gap between the action of countries and what the science tells us.""During previous climate negotiations, countries agreed to outl"

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh4","COP 21: Murky waters of climate finance","December 7, 2015 Monday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Dec. 7 -- One may think that organising funds to fight climate change would be a simple issue: there are countries that are suffering the impacts and they need finance to adapt; the problem was created by big industrial emitters, so they should pay for it.In spite of this intuitive rationale, while millions of climate change victims around the world are hoping the biggest global climate conference COP21 will deliver a substantive outcome with regards to funding, the details of climate finance as of yet remain mind-bogglingly murky.Firstly, the nature of the money is not clear. When the Green Climate Fund (GCF) -- the newest source of climate finance -- was first set up, climate vulnerable nations expected ""no-strings-attached"" grants from the developed nations for mitigation and adaptation projects in developing nations. To the outrage of affected nations, government co-financing (i.e. requiring developing nations to bear a part of the total costs of the adaptation interventions), soft loans and other non-grant financial instruments are now becoming part and parcel of green climate fund lingo.The GCF aims to raise $100 billion a year by 2020, but disputes remain about whether the funding target will be based solely on public sources of funding, or will incorporate private finance as well. And only a small proportion of this total amount has been pledged so far.There is also lack of clarity about what percentage of the funds is going to be good money i.e. plain and simple grant, and what percentage is less direct - repayable grants, loans etc. GCF's panoply of financial instruments is making it increasingly unclear what affected countries can actually expect to receive.Moreover, GCF funding was meant to be ""new and additional"" to Overseas Development Assistance (ODA). It was meant to supplement the existing flows of development aid going to vulnerable countries, not replace or overlap with them. But that too is no longer a certainty.""There are talks now of replacing some of the existing sources of funding,"" said Q.K Ahmed, one of the lead negotiators of the Bangladesh delegation to the Paris Climate Summit. ""But that must not happen,"" he adds, ""those are vital dedicated sources of funding, GCF isn't"".Furthermore, the Green Climate Fund's mantra is that it ""will aim for a floor of 50 per cent of the adaptation allocation for particularly vulnerable countries, including Least Developed Countries, Small Island Developing States and African States."" But in actual terms adaptation funding lags far behind mitigation funding, and is a major issue for climate vulnerable developing countries that need billions of dollars to adapt.Bangladesh, which is one of the most climate-vulnerable nations, currently finances over 72 per cent of its adaptation projects with domestic funding. This resource-constrained country, like many others, is in dire need of international assistance to help many millions of people adapt to increasing threats of climate change.In this context, it is crucial that during this climate conference the murky rhetoric around climate finance is replaced with a clear outl"

According to a recent paper, that is responsible for about 11 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.Forests are something of a ""Cinderella"" subject at climate conferences, our correspondent says.They are essential for the climate - but forest solutions are typically complex and local, and they do not lend themselves easily to sweeping global agreements.'NEW STARTING POINT'On Monday, US President Barack Obama said the UN conference, known as , could be a ""turning point"" in global efforts to limit future temperature rises.He urged negotiators to deliver a meaningful deal, because the ""next generation is watching"".Russian President Vladimir Putin also addressed the conference.During negotiations for the preceding Kyoto Protocol, Russia was the last industrialised nation to ratify the global agreement, allowing the landmark deal to come into force in 2001.Putin said: ""We have demonstrated we can ensure economic development and take care of our environment at the same time.""In a diplomatic play on semantics, probably to highlight the differing points of view between industrialised and emerging economies, Chinese President Xi Jinping told the conference he did not see the Paris talks as a turning point nor a ""finish l"

Dhaka Courier's AKM Moinuddin sat down with Zeller, during a cimate workshop at French Ambassador Sophie Aubert's residence. With a desire to delve deeper into the issues, they were forced to continue over email, long after the event was over. Excerpts:Dhaka Courier (DC): Even though we can expect some form of institutional oversight to remain from the UN, surely the longer the COP process goes on, it means the lack of an agreement. And so can we hope for Paris COP 21 to be one of the last COPs?COP21 must not be the end of a process, but the very beginning of a new one, starting from the agreement we all want to see, on behalf of the next generations. This new process, whatever it is, will have to involve all the governments and even beyond them, as the transition to a low carbon economy demands a large commitment of all the actors: of course the governments, but also the private sector, the civil society and the citizens. Changing the world we are living in will not be possible without the participation of all of us.DC: Bangladesh as you know is a major stakeholder in the entire COP process, and really any concern over climate change in the world today, due to our forefront position. We have been looking to the COP since Copenhagen in 2009 for a binding, and fair treaty acceptable to all. Will Paris this year be able to deliver what Copenhagen, Cancun, Lima, etc, have failed to deliver?PZ: This is what we are all working for! The French government, the French decentralized administration, cities, departments and regions, the civil society and the private sector in France are all mobilized for the success of .The French Foreign Ministry has a dedicated team of 80 people working for more than a year with all our partners in order to pave the way to a legally binding agreement, which will make COP21 a success. This agreement is the first pillar of COP21. It is fundamental in order to ensure that we have a consensus on the fact that we must maintain the global increase of the temperature below 2degC or even less, 1.5degC, by the end of the century, compared to the pre-industrial era.The National contributions, the so-called INDC, are also a very important pillar of the next COP: it will enable us to assess our effort in favour of the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and it will help us to assess the effort to be done for the future, in order to create a new sustainable word for our children. The entire country understands that the challenge is enormous, all the more as there is no choice: we are at a turning point for humanity.We are also confident that COP21 will help to achieve a global understanding of the absolute necessity to redirect our private and public funds all over the world in order to build a new carbon economy. Creating a new model means first of all working within a new framework. This new framework means mobilizing both our existing and new resources through redirecting them in favour of the creation of this new model. We can't create a new model using the old traditional channels of action. This is the third pillar of COP21.COP21COP21 in France symbolizes the global effort of the entire nation, and we are confident that the world doesn't want to miss the opportunity to change itself for the better.DC: Do you think at the moment enough consideration is being given to the concerns of small, developing, isolated or at least individual states on the forefront of climate change, such as Bangladesh? Some endangered states have been able to form groups and press for their demands, like the small-island states. But Bangladesh's position is quite unique.PZ: Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable continental countries to climate change, if not the most vulnerable one. In France we know about it and that's why I have come to Bangladesh: to express our support to Bangladesh, to explain what we were intending to do for COP21, and to get the position, analysis and expectations of the country. That's why this mission was so important and that's why I have appreciated so much the large exchanges of views and ideas I have had with the government of course, but also with the experts, the civil society and the people I met during my mission in Dhaka. Bangladesh is a very important actor of the climate negotiations and Bangladesh has been working for decades in the COP framework. Its position is known and has always been taken into consideration: Bangladesh is a bridge between the developing and developed countries.DC: Even though carbon emissions and pollution are part of a developing country's progress like ours, is there any recognition of some of the commendable policies implemented by Bangladesh in terms of moving towards more 'green' sources of energy, despite challenges?PZ: We are very much conscious of the fact that developing countries do need to develop power resources in order to pursue their development. This is a big challenge and Bangladesh is making a tremendous effort in order to achieve its goal to become a higher mid-income country in 2021. We highly recognize how efficient Bangladesh is, in terms of domestic solar solutions for example. Green energies are the key for the future. But you must also know that technologies have improved so much that some very highly efficient and in the same time relatively clean power solutions are now available in order to conciliate the demand to be on the one hand climate-friendly, and on the second hand mostly efficient in terms of power production. Our French private sector is very much in advance on these issues.DC: How important is it to avoid a North v South, or developed v developing, or rich v poor country fracture in the talks, caused by some of the issues of 'historic responsibility' that some of the industrialised nations face? Is a credible binding agreement possible in that case?PZ: Our world is a world in movement and fortunately, countries before classified as developing countries have now entered the club of the developed ones. The situation of the 1980's is not the situation of our decade. In our view, considering our global world, all the countries have to consider that they have a responsibility to protect the future. The issue to address is not an issue of fractures; it is a matter of global effort, of solidarity and of responsibility. It is true that the industrialized world has a responsibility in the increase of global temperature. But who would not be part of the industrialized world, as the entire world is running in order to be industrialized?We are living a very specific moment and we have the opportunity to impulse a wonderful effort in order to be collectively intelligent enough to make choices involving all the countries in order to create a new sustainable world. The benefit will be for everybody as soon as we have understood that a new model needed to be invented. We have all the tools. What will the next generations think about us, if they learn within a few decades that their grandparents decided to sacrifice their future on behalf of historic fractures?DC: This is the first time we have seen non-state actors, particularly referring to the large religious institutions, that have come out in support of success at the climate talks, Both the pope, and Islamic leaders also have thrown in their weight. How important do you think that is?PZ: The involvement of the religious and moral authorities of the world is a very important event. In France, in June, these religious and moral authorities have gathered in order to send a message to the world. This event was called (in French) ""le Sommet des Consciences"": the summit of the consciences. This shows that there is a deep worldwide awareness. As said before, our humanity is at a turning point and we mustn't ignore what our consciences are telling us.DC: You have read a lot about Bangladesh before coming here. Would you share some experiences based on your interactions with stakeholders in Bangladesh?PZ: I was deeply impressed by all the people I met here in Dhaka, in such a short time. Bangladesh is a place where you can meet with worldwide known experts on climate issues, I was extremely lucky to have the opportunity to exchange ideas with them and I've learnt a lot from them. Moreover, I have seen so many young people following the model of their peers. I had the opportunity to discuss with some people I would call the pillars and the conscience of the country. I met with extraordinary dynamic people, completely involved in the big task of, I would say, ""building the country"", with the idea that Bangladeshi people are the future of their country, no matter how rich or poor they are. It was a very rich experience for me.DC: You know women are the most vulnerable people due to climate change and disruptions. What steps should be taken for them?PZ: Women are very strong all over the world, but in many places of the world they are mistreated, or they are not given the place they should have. Men have to understand that women are the foundations of our societies. Girls must have a right to go to school equally to men. Women must have the choice to marry or not to marry. Violence against women is too frequently considered as a non-issue, and it is a shame for humanity. Being a poor woman facing climate change and disruptions is a very big challenge because these women are the most fragile ones. I know that along with other organizations, like UN Women, the European Delegation in Bangladesh focuses and will keep focusing on the issue of women and education in its next five-year cooperation plan. We highly appreciate this effort in France.

Strong action on carbon emissions is essential for multiple reasons, said Vidal, who hosted last year's UN climate conference in Lima.Vidal said a deal would show the world that countries can work together to fight global warming as well as terrorism.Christiana Figueres, the head of the UN's climate change negotiations, addressed delegates at the start of the summit.""Never before has a responsibility so great been in the hands of so few,"" she said.""The world is looking to you. The world is counting on you.""And the incoming president of the meeting, French foreign secretary Laurent Fabius, said one of his guiding principles over the next 11 days was transparency.UN climate conference 30 Nov - 11 Dec 2015COP 21 - the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties - will see more than 190 nations gather in Paris to discuss a possible new global agreement on climate change, aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions to avoid the threat of dangerous warming due to human activities.The talks are taking place amid tight security, two weeks after attacks in Paris claimed by the so-called Islamic State (IS) group.Negotiators from 195 countries will try to reach a deal at the meeting, known as COP21.Some 150 heads of state, including US President Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, have arrived at the summit.The last major meeting in Copenhagen in 2009 ended in failure.Key issuesMost of the discussions will revolve around a new deal that would limit global warming to 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial levels.Assessments of the more than 180 national plans that have been submitted by countries suggest that if they were implemented the world would see a rise of nearer to 3C.Major points of contention include:Limits: The UN has endorsed a goal of limiting global warming to no more than 2C over pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. But more than 100 poorer countries and low-lying, small-island states are calling for a tougher goal of 1.5C.Fairness: Developing nations say industrialised countries should do more to cut emissions, having polluted for much longer. But rich countries insist that the burden must be shared to reach the 2C target.Money: One of the few firm decisions from the 2009 UN climate conference in Copenhagen was a pledge from rich economies to provide $100 billion (93 billion euros) a year in financial support for poor countries from 2020 to develop technology and build infrastructure to cut emissions. Where that money will come from and how it will be distributed has yet to be agreed.'Hideous problem'Among those attending the talks is the broadcaster and naturalist Sir David Attenborough. He said he was not confident that the Paris talks would produce a deal to tackle the ""hideous problem"" of climate change.""Increasing temperature of the oceans will cause havoc amongst the fish stocks and similarly increasing the temperature of the Earth is causing the spread of deserts.""The problems of a rise in temperatures are huge; it has to be avoided at all costs.""The Prince of Wales said that humanity faces no greater threat than climate change, as he issued a call for immediate action to tackle rising temperatures.Charles told the summit: ""Rarely in human history have so many people around the world placed their trust in so few.""Your deliberations over the next two weeks will decide the fate not only of those alive today, but also of generations yet unborn.""Published by HT Syndication with permission from Bangladesh Business News.

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh14","Sustainable innovation agenda at COP21","November 27, 2015 Friday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Industry, Nov. 27 -- Industry, innovation and infrastructure constitute one of 17 SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) that form the framework of the 2030 UN mission for sustainable development. There is no doubt that sustained investment in innovation is a key driver of economic growth and development, especially for developing countries. In Bangladesh, the need for innovation is felt on account of poor infrastructure and weak governance in almost every development sector. That means a solution will be needed for balanced development among social, economic and environmental wellbeing of the country. In this regard, initiating ways for promoting innovation may provide a significant boost to facilitate sustainable development which could also be linked to the reduction of global temperature -- a key agenda of the forthcoming UN COP21 (Climate Change Conference) to be held in Paris.In order to limiting the global temperature rise to a maximum of 2 C, many initiatives have been taken by different countries under the sequential agreement of UN conferences held across different countries over the period. Among all of these, the process of sustainable innovation is gathering pace, leading to rethinking on changing the path of industrialisation for the future. The hot topic of 'sustainable innovation' will be discussed at the Sustainable Innovation Forum (SIF15) at the largest business-oriented discussion at COP21 in Paris. In a close discussion forum SIF15, many Bangladeshi representatives including ministers, industrialists and climate activists are going to attend the COP21 in order to firm up common interest on policy making aimed at achieving the sustainable innovation goal.So, what can Bangladesh's agenda for sustainable innovation at COP15 be and how Bangladesh stands strategically at the discussion forum for achieving benefits in the industrial arena? The agenda of innovation gap between high and low income countries can surely be one. Creating a platform might be a concern between developed and developing countries. Bangladesh may raise the related significant issues in the forum since the efforts for emerging as a green economy have already been initiated across different sectors of the country.Innovation is perceived as a business agenda within the context of sustainable innovation at the COP21However, for achieving SDGs, a country initially needs a performance-based sustainability policy in managing product innovation. It is true that different monitoring strategies are adopted in different countries that make an illusion between sustainability and the concept of innovation. Keeping this in mind, the COP15 sustainability forum may focus on sustainability polices and its practices in product innovation. Theoretically, the policy for sustainability management is universal and transnational, but the practices vary significantly from country to country; even sustainability management is seen differently in respect of the same product in two countries.As a result, the countries of low income background may fall back from the competitive advantages of sustainability management achieved in high income countries. Therefore, an integrated sustainability policy is required across organisations by bridging the common vision for product development between high and low income countries. Bangladesh should negotiate with the developed countries for the opportunities in the following interrelated themes: developing and transforming the related strategies for green business; global justice in case of emission versus product innovation; degradation by physical means like land, water, biodiversity etc; fundamental human needs and multi-level capacity increasing; and framing or tool development for monitoring sustainable product innovation.The writer is with the BRAC Research and Evaluation Division.

Both host France and the UN agency in charge of organizing the event, the largest such conference since the meeting in Copenhagen in 2009, are hoping to make the summit successful where 50,000 government officials, diplomats, representatives of non-governmental organizations, environment activists are expected to attend. Even before the attacks the French government had planned to deploy 30,000 security forces to mount a full-proof security. Organizers now say that the security will be further tightened in the wake of the attacks. It seems that the French government, mauled by the attacks reportedly by Islamic State terrorist group and now under a state of emergency, has redoubled its resolve to hold the summit.The COP21COP21, where the delegates are to hammer out how much the affluent nations are going to pay to the developing nations to compensate them in their climate change adaptation efforts. The decision to go ahead with the summit in spite of the attacks has been a right move on several counts.At a time when terrorists have declared a war against humanity, it is important for the world to stand united and steel its resolve to fight the evil forces with greater determination. The world just can't surrender its values and principles to a bunch of terrorists who are bent on destroying whatever the civilization has brought for mankind and the values on which the world of the good moves on. A postponement of the summit would have encouraged the terrorists who aim to spread fear through their attacks as heinous as the ones that occurred in Paris. The second important issue here is that the world is in a real hurry to reach a meaningful agreement on the climate change issues. What the wealthy nations are going to do to do in keeping the global warming under control and how are they going to help the developing nations in coping with the climate change impact.Background of The Climate TalksIt was at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 the international community launched the move to deal with the climate change impacts. The 'Rio Convention' included the adoption of the UNwork for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to avoid ""dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system."" The UNFCCC which entered into force on 21 March 1994, now has a near-universal membership of 195 parties. The main objective of the annual Conference of Parties (COP) is to review the Convention's implementation. The first COP took place in Berlin in 1995 and significant meetings since then have included COP3 where the Kyoto Protocol was adopted, COP11 where the Montreal Action Plan was produced, COP15 in Copenhagen where an agreement to success Kyoto Protocol was unfortunately not realized and COP17 in Durban where the Green Climate Fund was created.In 2015 COP21COP21 will be one of the largest international conferences ever held in the country. The conference is expected to attract close to 50,000 participants including 25,000 official delegates from government, intergovernmental organizations, UN agencies, NGOs and civil society.\l"

The analyst adds that Paris Agreement signatories have mentioned in varying detail how they intend to achieve their proposed contributions, and countries will need to take a variety of approaches to fulfill their pledges.\l"

China earlier said rich developed countries needed to offer more financial support to developing countries.Giza Gaspar Martins, the chairman of the group representing some of the world's poorest countries, said: ""It is the best outcome we could have hoped for, not just for the Least Developed Countries, but for all citizens of the world,"" he said.But Nick Dearden, director of campaign group Global Justice Now, said: ""It's outrageous that the deal that's on the table is being spun as a success when it undermines the rights of the world's most vulnerable communities and has almost nothing binding to ensure a safe and liveable climate for future generations.""Some aspects of the agreement will be legally binding, such as submitting an emissions reduction target and the regular review of that goal.However, the targets set by nations will not be binding under the deal struck in Paris.Key pointsThe measures in the agreement included: To peak greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible and achieve a balance between sources and sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century To review progress every five years $100bn a year in climate finance for developing countries by 2020, with a commitment to further finance in the future.Observers say the attempt to impose emissions targets on countries was one of the main reasons why the Copenhagen talks in 2009 failed.At the time, nations including China, India and South Africa were unwilling to sign up to a condition that they felt could hamper economic growth and development.The latest negotiations managed to avoid such an impasse by developing a system of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs).In these, which form the basis of the Paris agreement goal of keeping global temperature rise ""well below"" 2C above pre-industrial levels, nations outl"

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh22","COP21 is about the money, not the environment","October 16, 2015 Friday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Oct. 16 -- When it was revealed that Volkswagen had been duping diesel-emissions tests on some of its high-end environmentally friendly cars, people were outraged. The CEO resigned.About the same time, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley told the Alberta Chambers of Commerce that her province had better get its environmental house in order or it would have measures imposed upon it. She also said that Alberta has ""bad air.""Really? I challenge that statement. In 2011, Canada's air was judged to be the third highest quality in the world. In 2006, Environment Canada reported that Red Deer was an unusual hot spot for poor air quality related to fine particulate matter, but this was said to be due to the transportation corridor emissions, nothing else. Nav Canada's handbook on weather conditions for flying around Alberta confirms that weather and terrain play a big role in air quality.Likewise, transportation emissions, stagnant air and humidity are factors in making Paris - the site of the upcoming UN climate change talks - one of the dirtiest cities in Europe in terms of air quality.Episodes of stagnant, damp air led to Paris air-quality pollution levels as high as 180 micrograms of particulate matter 10 microns or smaller per cubic metre - more than double the safe limit of 80. This spring, during such an episode, the French government forced people not to drive. (Albertans only experience levels like that during wildfire smoke or weather inversions.)But what is the real reason for this terrible pollution? Faulty climate policy, of course. As Bloomberg View explains in Climate politics and the Volkswagen scandal on Sept. 23, Europe made a push for diesel on the claim that it uses less fuel overall, but diesel emits more smog-inducing soot and more nitrogen oxides. Preferential tax rates led to Europe now having more than half its cars on diesel, and in France, now more than 80 per cent, thus creating a much larger public health risk and not saving the planet.Does it not strike you as hypocritical that 50,000 people, intent on saving the planet, will be flying, driving, taking a fossil-fuelled boat, train or car to COP21 in December to reduce emissions?Shall Canada impose solutions upon them? Economist Ross McKitrick pointed out to me that Canada never gets credit for the advances we have made in addressing real pollution.From 1985 to 2011, our industrial carbon-monoxide emissions are down 26 per cent; industrial carbon particulate emissions are down 44 per cent; and industrial sulphur dioxide emissions are down 69 per cent. Total economic output: up by 89 per cent.When we go to Paris for the Climate Change Summit (COP21), we should demand that every other nation meets these standards and, until they do, they should have nothing to say to Canada on emissions.The UN is based on the principle of equal sovereignty. This is probably why Saudi Arabia can be elected to be head of the UN Human Rights Commission even though it has reportedly beheaded more people this year than ISIS. Point that out, if someone tries to impose environmental standards on us.As Google engineers recently revealed, renewable is not doable, so let's stop promoting it. Global warming has stagnated for over 18 years and eight months, with temperature rise being at values ""very close to zero,"" to quote German climate scientist Hans von Storch.The real push behind COP21 is related to carbon trading - not climate change, not air quality, not saving the planet, but rather saving the financial backside of those who made rush-to-renewables investments and, like Volkswagen, have been caught out. They're hoping to impose a global carbon-trading system on us. Their bad investment decisions should not require us to pay their piper.There's lots of foggy, smoggy hot air emitted by the whole climate change circus.Let's clear the air in Paris.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Many island nations want the text to reflect the fact that if the world warms more than 1.5C, their homes may be lost to rising seas. Other countries favour a two-degree goal.Another key issue is the question of differentiation. When the UN climate convention was signed back in 1992, the world was divided into developed and developing countries. The richer countries now want the new Paris deal to reflect how the world has changed.""Developed countries and now many developing countries acknowledge that the world has changed,"" said Michael Jacobs, a climate adviser to British Prime Minister at the time of the Copenhagen talks in 2009, Gordon Brown.But the idea of a change does not sit well with many of the leading developing nations. China criticised any attempts to change this division in the talks about the final deal.""We cannot accept starvation as a price for the success of this agreement,"" said Gurdial Singh Nijar of Malaysia, who was speaking for the Like Minded Group of countries in these talks that includes China, India and Saudi Arabia.""The world has changed? Yes, the world has changed but not in the way that you intend to use it perhaps as a subterfuge to undermine the basic precepts of the convention.""We cannot accept that because to accept that is to destroy our societies,"" he said to applause.There are concerns over finance as well, as the richer countries want to expand the base of donor countries if there is to be an increase in the promised $100bn from 2020 to help the poorer countries cope with climate change and ease their transition to low-carbon electricity.There are also significant divisions over how the promises made to cut carbon in this agreement will be reviewed, how often and in what format.Despite these many differences, there is a widespread feeling that compromises will be found.One of the biggest challenges may well be fatigue, especially for the poorer countries who have small teams of negotiators trying to cover many meetings.""Our negotiators must contribute to hours of talks, representing the poorest nations, as other countries tap in and out around them, as well as fitting in all the other meetings at the start and end of the day,"" said a source close to the group.""They are averaging around three hours' sleep a night and the pressure will only grow.""UN climate conference 30 Nov - 11 Dec 2015COP 21 - the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties - will see more than 190 nations gather in Paris to discuss a possible new global agreement on climate change, aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions to avoid the threat of dangerous warming due to human activities.Published by HT Syndication with permission from Bangladesh Business News.

The reality is that on energy policy the chancellor is effectively prime minister already.""Extra costsThere has also been criticism in Paris over the UK's contribution to climate finance for developing countries.Britain was praised by the UN for doubling its funding to help poor nations get clean technology and to adapt to climate change.But now the UK is under fire for diverting that climate cash from the regular aid budget.A spokesman for the Least Developed Countries in Paris told BBC News: ""The Copenhagen climate meeting made it clear - climate finance should be new and additional funds, which means it should not come from foreign aid - which is meant for development.""Think of it like building a road. You use the aid money for the road, but if temperatures rise due to climate change, you will have to thicken the tarmac, which is an extra cost.""If you build a road which is liable to flood due to rising sea levels, you will need to build in flood protection, which is again additional to development. It's that simple.""Domestic prioritiesA spokesman for the energy and climate department, DECC, replied that the UK's climate finance would help poor communities become resilient to climate change and to get clean energy.She said: ""We are committed to getting a global deal in Paris that will help prevent the worst impacts of climate change and grow the low-carbon economy.""The spokesman defended changes to policy priorities in the UK: ""Amber Rudd stated the priority is to keep the lights on and bills as low as possible; as well as to reduce the carbon emissions by 80% by 2050.""But is DECC really running energy and climate policy? Sources in the department have told journalists informally that decisions are being driven by the chancellor.BBC News has contacted the Treasury three times to ask about the chancellor's policies on carbon emissions.We have so far received no reply from Treasury, except for to say that the department does not comment on the chancellor's personal views.This time we asked for these questions to be addressed:Does Osborne accept that tackling climate change is urgent?Does he accept that his recent policy changes will mostly increase emissions?Why did Osborne scrap carbon capture and storage funding - a main pillar of UK climate policy?Does the chancellor accept that changing 'Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) is likely to increase emissions as people buy bigger cars?The questions appear to have been referred to DECC, who said of the scrapping of CCS funding: ""Government has not taken this decision lightly.Government was clear that this capital was subject to affordability.This was a tight financial settlement and difficult decisions have had to be made.""CCS has a potential role in the long-term de-carbonisation of the UK and the government will engage closely with bidders on the implication of this decision for them.""On the question of the change in VED rules leading to increased CO2 emissions, the DECC spokesman re-iterated the Chancellor's statement that VED tax breaks needed to change to ensure cash to fund new roads.UN climate conference 30 Nov - 11 Dec 2015COP 21 - the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties - will see more than 190 nations gather in Paris to discuss a possible new global agreement on climate change, aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions to avoid the threat of dangerous warming due to human activities.Published by HT Syndication with permission from Bangladesh Business News.

It is being held at Le Bourget, a conference and airportcomplex about 10 kilometres north-east of the centre of Paris, according to Climate News Networkmessage received here on Wednesday.Heads of state, presidents, prime ministers, and royalty,delegations from at least 190 countries, an estimated 3,000 journalists, dozensof NGOs and assorted lobby groups all are all due to converge on the beleagueredcity of Paris in less than two weeks' time.The French government and UNFCCC have said the conferencewill go ahead, albeit amid what is described as ""enhanced security"".Le Bourget is less than a 10-minute taxi ride from Stade deFrance, the sports stadium and site of one of the major explosions last Fridayevening.With the whole of France currently in a state ofemergency, security at the climate talks will be very tight. Any demonstrationsby protesters against the causes of climate are likely to be closelycontrolled.For journalists covering events particularly those whowant to follow proceedings both within and outside the conference hall lifewill be difficult.Journalists from developing world countries are already at adisadvantage compared with their western counterparts. Though many are keen tobe in Paris andto report on events, their media organisations often lack the funds to sendstaff to the French capital.Journalists from many developing countries also have to gothrough considerable visa formalities, and this can act as a furtherdisincentive to covering the talks.Yet these journalists often come from countries alreadyfeeling the effects of climate change, and where reporting on it is mostneeded.

However, Bonn climate change negotiation meeting has just ended with a negotiating text that has more than 1500 pairs of brackets. This indicates how the Parties are having their difference of opinion while developing a text for climate change deal. This text will be again discussed, negotiated and agreed in Paris in order to removal of all brackets or to find out alternative options to finalize the text. It will not be an easy task for the negotiators to minimize the gap and reach consensus to deliver an acceptable text to political leaders for their endorsement. The following issues need to be address carefully to have an agreement in the text.1. How historical responsibility of climate change will be defined and articulated in the text to ensure higher emission cut by the developed countries. Emission cut was not as promising as it should be under the Kyoto Protocol. Most of the cases Kyoto Protocol were neglected by the developed countries. New agreement, therefore, wants to ensure CBDR goal in the text for proper characterization of responsibilities. It has also bearing on implementation of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) that will be part of the legally binding agreement.2. Developed countries must have very clear declaration of resource mobilization of $ 100 billion per year by 2020. Developing countries want to see resource mobilization must be started before 2020 that means developed countries should provide resources to Green Climate Fund without any delay to build trust in climate finance negotiation. Only pledges of resource mobilization could not satisfy developing countries to agree on climate change deal in Paris.3. Climate vulnerable countries particularly Least Developed Countries, Small Island States and African countries must have preferential treatment to address climate change impacts under legally binding agreement. It is not a new idea to provide preferential treatment to climate vulnerable countries which is already embodied in the Convention.4. Political buy-in of legally binding agreement would be major challenge in Paris COP. The World leaders should be engaged in this process well ahead of time to take decisions at crucial juncture of negotiation in Paris. Without their direct involvement in negotiating the legally binding agreement it would be impossible for technical negotiators to overcome present stalemate situation to make Paris COP a successful one.The World is looking ahead to see success in Paris COP to address climate change for greater interests of human well-being and save mother earth. Let's hope for the best and join the Paris COP with full spirit and devotion to make it successful one.\l"

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh43","Five unanswered questions at COP21","December 10, 2015 Thursday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Dec. 10 -- The latest draft version of a potential world changing agreement represents a substantial improvement on previous versions. It's much shorter, with the key text of the actual agreement running to just 14 pages - the number of square brackets, indicating areas of disagreement, has reduced significantly to around 300 from more than 900.But the deal is far from done. Here's my guide to the five key questions that still need to be answered if the Paris deal is to live up to the hype. What's it all about? You would think that this late in the game, people would have a clear idea about the purpose of the agreement. Alas not quite. There is still a significant question over whether the deal will look to limit warming to 1.5 degrees or 2 degrees C. It mightn't seem like much of a difference but it's hugely important for island states and very vulnerable countries. For several years the idea of having 1.5 in the text was seen as just a platitude to these nations. But when the national plans for climate action, submitted by more than 180 countries were submitted, they added up to warming of around 2.7 degrees. How do we get there? Whether the target is 1.5 or 2 degrees, the world's use of fossil fuels will need to be reduced. In the text right now, the undecided question is how much of a reduction and by what date. One option asks for specific amounts of carbon cuts (70-95% of 2010 levels by 2050) or alternatively, a ""long term global low. The square brackets mean the words are not agreed. Where's my money? COP President Laurent Fabius highlighted the lack of progress on finance - and everyone knows that this is one of the most intractable issues. In the current text it takes up more than one page of the 14-page agreement. While rich nations have promised $100bn a year from 2020 and are on course to meet that target, the issue is actually much broader. Can I trust you? If money is a key, then what's termed transparency in these talks is one of the locks. Transparency means a method of measuring, reporting and verifying that countries are doing what they commit to do. Right now there are quite a few options and the text almost runs to two pages. Can I go home now? It may seem trite but this is one of the most crucial questions. Many of the 40,000 plus people involved here have been following the process for decades. After so many false dawns and the desperate disappointment of Copenhagen in 2009, there is tremendous war weariness and an almost pathological desire to get to the finish l"

The report has suggested investments for technology transfer, four regional climate technology transfer and finance centres, and mobilisation for public-private partnership for climate technology transfer. The global Environment Facility (GEF) is to work as catalyst in the technology transfer mechanism of climate change.Meanwhile, on October 08, 2015, finance ministers of the ""Vulnerable Twenty"" (Afghanistan, Barbados, Bhutan, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Kiribati, Madagascar, Maldives, Philippines, Nepal, Rwanda, Saint Lucia, Tanzania, Timor-Leste, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Vietnam) met in Lima, Peru during the 2015 Annual Meetings of the WB group and the IMF. It issued a communique calling for action to address the climate change phenomenon. The communique emphasised ""dedicated cooperative efforts"" of vulnerable countries and announced a series of actions to strengthen climate resilience and low emission development domestically and globally. It also emphasised innovative revenue-generating fiscal and financial measures and ""improved access to international climate finance from all sources."" Creation of a sovereign, trans-regional public-private ""V20 Climate change Pooling Mechanism"" was also agreed upon.Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world. It is working with several groups (DCs, group of 77 & V-20). The country is on several committees and boards that deal with climate change phenomenon. It has its own climate change strategy plan and has adopted many projects with its own resources and donors funds. It has successfully phased out ozone-depleting substances. It has an important role to play at the ensuing COP-21 in Paris.The commitment of Bangladesh to reduce green house (GHG) emissions in the power, transport and industry sectors as mentioned in its INDC may call for a debate. The coal-fired Rampal power plant in Khulna may trigger a controversy as environmental activists not only of Bangladesh but also of other south Asian countries have already voiced concerns about it. Not only emission but also the danger of colossal damage to the Sunderbans, the largest mangrove forest in the world, have been apprehended by the experts.Finally, the success of the 21st session of the Conference of Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC will depend on how efficiently the deliberations and negotiations take place in determining strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and creating the already pledged climate change fund with a mechanism for easy access of vulnerable countries to it.The writer is an economist and former environment secretary.Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Tens of thousands of people from across the world are rubbing shoulders in rallies in Paris where heads of state and government from 147 countries are attending the UN Conference on Climate Change. Similar rallies are being held simultaneously in several capitals and cities all around the world, from Indonesia to Chile, showcasing the desperation all around to find some assuring signals for sustainability of the planet and the people.The conference in Paris merits importance, much beyond its ceremonial attributes. The summit of the world leaders and the discourses by scientists, experts and researchers are aimed at deducing the much desired direction to control carbon emission blamed for increasing global warming and other climate change impacts. Indeed, the French government needs to be praised for hosting the massive event though the country is still reeling from shock and despair of the terror attacks. The commitment to go ahead with the COP21 clearly attests the fact that climate change or global warming is no less a threat to mankind than terrorism.Talks or negotiations to strike a universal deal to tackle global warming or climate change impacts have been going on for decades. However, it has never been possible to draw up an acceptable formula due to the differences in opinion, lack of commitment and dearth of understanding of the significance of the problem by different countries. As a result and as scientifically proven, emission of greenhouse gases kept on increasing adding to the rise in earth's land and oceanic temperature. It seemed none, whether the developed or developing countries, wanted to compromise with their economic progress wish-list.Climate change impacts or global weather warming scenarios are not any fiction but a stark reality.

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh52","The early success of COP21","January 1, 2016 Friday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Jan. 1 -- A core task of the UN process has been to globalise the effort on climate change. The past six months have witnessed a remarkable surge of 'Intended Nationally Determined Contributions' - over 180 countries have now set out their broad proposed goals, covering almost all global emissions. Together, if delivered, those goals would already be a big step to curtail projected climate change.Those plans did not come out of thin air. All the major emerging economies now accept that whilst they have not caused the problem, they inextricably have to be part of the solution. They are seeing more opportunities for, and potential benefits from, doing so. There is moreover clear international recognition of the need for regular review and strengthening of what is now on the table.A global agreement covering national emission goals is, however, only part of what is needed. At the heart of the challenge for most of the major economies is the transformation of their energy systems. That requires specific actions in at least two broad areas, and the opening day of the Paris conference presented major initiatives on both of these.One need is to accelerate the full chain of low carbon innovation, from R&D through to international dissemination. Twenty of the world's biggest economies committed to double clean energy R&D expenditure, within five years, from $10 billion to $20 billion a year, under the Mission: Innovation programme. They linked this directly with the private sector Breakthrough Energy Coalition. 28 of the world's richest investors, from Bill Gates to Mark Zuckerberg, and Richard Branson to Jack Ma, committed to forming ""a different kind of private investor with a long term commitment to new technologies, willing to put truly patient flexible risk capital to work. Motivated partly by the possibility of making big returns over the long-term, but also by the criticality of an energy transition.""In parallel, Indian Prime Minister Modi led an international solar energy alliance spanning 120 countries, to ""reduce the cost of finance and cost of technology for immediate deployment of competitive solar generation assets in all our countries and to pave the way for future solar generation, storage and good technologies adapted to our countries' individual needs"". Technology is half the answer; the other is to establish markets that work to support the growth and diffusion of such technologies by reflecting the full cost of climate risks. Thus - in addition to the widely-covered statement on reforming fossil fuel subsidies - the grand launch day in Paris also gave birth to the Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition.World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim and the IMF's Christine Lagarde had in October set up a high-level panel, spanning from Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande to President Enrique Nieto of Mexico and Governor Jerry Brown of California. All committed to ""carbon pricing policies to redirect investment commensurate with the scale of the climate challenge.""History teaches us that technology and proper pricing must go hand in hand. The Kyoto Protocol struggled to establish credible cap-and-trade carbon pricing. The US Bush administration spearheaded the Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Technology as an alternative, which delivered little and was ignominiously closed in 2011.We must not repeat the same dichotomy. Big technology needs stable funding; carbon pricing offers an obvious source. The UK Chancellor's shock cancellation of a $1 billion investment in carbon capture and storage shows the fragility of public technology programmes depending solely on tax revenues; more stable linked sources are needed. In the UK, carbon pricing already brings in twice that amount every year. Clean energy technologies must traverse the historical 'valley of death' from public R&D to fully private funding. This requires credible and strategically growing markets. Technology policy without proper pricing risks leaves clean technologies chasing the tail of innovation in high carbon technologies, which have demonstrated their own capacity for cost reduction when under pressure. The missing link is to entwine the forces of innovation and markets with proper pricing, to ensure that the cost of fossil carbon will rise.The UK was instrumental in fostering the Mission:Innovation coalition, but so far has been notable by its absence from the carbon pricing coalition. The UK government has continually stressed its commitment to markets-based solutions as a central tenet of Conservative philosophy. Within just the last month the Foreign Secretary pressed the case in Washington, and Energy and Climate Secretary Amber Rudd made cooperation to strengthen carbon pricing the central intellectual pillar of her famous 'Reset' speech.In a striking symbol of the new world that emerged in Paris, on Saturday (12 December) the governor of Quebec, which has established a cap-and-trade system along with California and successfully auctioned emission allowances, announced that it would contribute to international climate funds. Fortunately for the planet, it seems that the coalitions already launched at this conference are getting on with the job, with or without the UK, and whatever happens in the minutiae of the UN negotiations.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh55","BD drafts country paper to get share of $100b Green Fund","August 14, 2015 Friday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Aug. 14 -- Bangladesh has drafted a country position paper for its submission to the United Nations Framework on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to have its legitimate share of the proposed US$100 billion Green Climate Fund (GCF) to ensure its adaptation against global warming, said officials.The Department of Environment (DoE) under the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF) prepared the draft spelling out the country's vulnerability to climate change and necessary action for mitigating its loss and damage, a senior DoE official told the FE.""We, being a least developed country (LDC), want that at least 50 per cent of the GCF should be allocated for climate adaptation,"" said DoE director Mirza Shawkat Ali.The 21st session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 21) and the 11th session of the Conference of the Parties, serving as the meeting of the parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP), will take place in Paris from November 30 to December 11, 2015.Global negotiators on climate change expect that in 2015, COP21, a legally-binding universal agreement on climate aiming to keep global warming below 2degC would be inked, said Mr Ali of Bangladesh's Climate Change Cell.During the 2009 UN climate change conference, also known as Copenhagen Summit, the 195 member- countries had pledged to establish the GCF to release $100 billion every year from 2020 for climate change adaptation and mitigation.The member-countries are now preparing separate 'intended nationally determined contribution' (INDC) chalking out their plans for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), said Mr Ali.""We are expecting to finalise our position paper by next month to submit it to the UNFCC by October 1,"" he said.Officials said Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world due to climate change. Geneva-based Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) revealed last year that being a LDC, Bangladesh is at risk of facing food insecurity, severe illness, increased mortality and morbidity, loss of rural livelihood and marine and coastal ecosystem due to climate change.Bangladesh is also set to face scarcity of fresh water, rise in temperature, severe winter, rise in sea level and rapid increase of urban population, it stated.It might face extreme weather as the consequences of climate change, which might lead to breakdown of infrastructure networks and critical services like electricity, water supply and emergency services.The IPCC forecast that a breakdown of food systems might occur due to warming, draught, flooding and reduced agricultural productivity as the consequences of climate change.Due to sea level rise, coastal systems and low-lying areas will increasingly experience adverse impacts such as inundation, coastal flooding and erosion, the IPCC stated.Marine species, redistribution and marine biodiversity reduction will challenge the sustained provision of fisheries productivity and other ecosystem services.Different rights groups have long been demanding that the government should be more active in the forthcoming COP21 to ensure the country's fund from the proposed GCF.Coordinator of Network on Climate Change Bangladesh Trust (NCCB) Mizanur Rahman Bijoy demanded that the government should ensure a significant amount of money from the GCF as grant, not as loan. He also sought a significant allocation from the GCF for climate refugees and climate migrants from Bangladesh.Officials said the international political response to climate change began at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, where the 'Rio Convention' included adoption of the UNFCCC.This convention set out a framework for action aimed at stabilising atmospheric concentrations of GHGs to avoid ""dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.""The UNFCCC, which entered into force on March 21 1994, now has a near-universal membership of 195 parties.The first COP took place in Berlin in 1995 and significant meetings since then have included COP3 where the Kyoto Protocol was adopted and COP11 where the Montreal Action Plan was produced.

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh56","COP21 Agreement Unlikely to be Good for Vulnerable Countries","November 30, 2015 Monday","Energy & Power","It seems to me that we will have a Paris Agreement. We have a text for the agreement and it still has to be negotiated. It is 34 pages text. There is a huge political momentum. The president of France is putting in place a long political negotiation to getting an agreement. He met the Chinese president and is meeting with the world leaders everywhere. All the world leaders are waiting to have an agreement. I have no doubt there would be an agreement. The question is how good the agreement would be and good from whose point of view.Eminent climate change expert Dr Saleemul Huq, Director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development and Senior Fellow at the International Institute of Environment and Development, made the observation about the prospects of crucial negotiation at the Climate Change conference (COP21) in Paris to take place from November 30, 2015.The following are the excerpts from an exclusive interview with Energy and Power Editor Mollah Amzad Hossain in Dhaka.EP: How do you see the Bangladesh case in the perspective of the possible agreementSH: We have a particular point of view as a vulnerable country. Bangladesh belongs to the group of vulnerable countries, least developed countries. Our point of view is that if it's not sufficient enough to tackle the problem, then we can't say it's a good agreement. It may be okay agreement, but not a good agreement. So we are fighting to get a good agreement. And, the definition for a good agreement for us is one that first of all set a long term goal (LTG) which is commensurate with the problem. We believe that the LTG should be to limit temperature rise by 1.5 degrees Celsius. At the moment, the global agreed goal is 2 degrees. But we have not agreed to it. We are still fighting for the 1.5 degrees. In fact, it is a group of leaders, including Bangladesh, who formed the Climate Vulnerable Forum highlighting concerns, issues and challenges faced by vulnerable countries. They have issued a strong statement, pushing for the 1.5 degrees. So that is the big push from vulnerable countries.The other aspect whether it is a good agreement or not is how we are able to bring down temperatures. One good thing is that all countries are putting their plans forward to reduce emission, carry out mitigation activities. More than 150 countries submitted Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) - their plan for tackling climate change. If we add them all up, we still are far from 2 degrees. We are just below 3 degrees (2.7 degrees), which is not good enough.We know that we would not be able to reach at 2 degrees in Paris. So the next argument becomes - well keep it at 2 degrees. But how do we move in the right direction Paris must not be an end, Paris must be the beginning of moving in the right direction. So how frequently do we need to review progress and change direction if we need it. Some countries are arguing for 10 years and we are saying it is too long. It should be reviewed after five years - one review after 2020. If the progress is not good enough, progress can be enhanced. Because, one of the things from the INDCs of the developing countries is that they give two plans - one is that how much we can do ourselves. Bangladesh can reduce five percent itself and then how much we can do if we get finance and technology. We can do more if we get finance and technology. We said 15%. Let's go for higher ambition with money and technology.And let us review every five years to see how we were able to do, how much money and technology was given and how much the countries were able to do. And set higher ambition after five years, increase our ambition. Now it is 2.7 degrees and after five years we can say that we can actually do more. We hope Paris will build a virtual cycle where in mitigation, they will find theycan do more and they will do more. Countries will go on a potentially carbon free future, which is where we have to go in the long run.EP: How do you see the INDC submitted by BangladeshThe good thing is the beginning that we have started a debate about the future trajectory of Bangladesh's industrialization and other development.There is no doubt China is the big polluter and they recognize it. They are now thinking about the energy alternatives. In the post-fossil fuel era, China would be the leader.India is also polluter, but their per capita pollution is very low. India also debating on the energy - they are working on energy efficiency, and renewable energy. What they are saying is that they need development, so they want to go slow as far as carbon emission is concerned.EP: What should be the energy pathway of BangladeshEP: How do you see Bangladesh's preparation about the crucial negotiation in ParisSH: Bangladesh is well prepared as the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, Finance Minister, Environment Minister and senior officials concerned are well briefed this time. The world now wants to hear Bangladesh as a vulnerable country. So, we do not have the scope to sit idle. We have worked a lot as we have already adopted projects worth US$500 million from own resources. It should be kept in mind that climate change is now a diplomatic issue. Bangladesh has to prepare its diplomats. We will have to work in Paris in coordination with government and non-government organizations as well as media professionals. At the same time, we will have to coordinate with the different groups like Least Developed Countries, Climate Vulnerable Forum and others.EP: What do you say about the debate over the conditions of climate change fundSH: We don't want loans, we want grants. We will have to make it clear that whatever we are doing at the home front is with our own resources. Whatever we have achieved so far, will three times more if resources are available.The developed countries had pledged for providing LDCs with 0.7% of their GNI, but they are not following it and they are doing only at their will. There is no obligation for them to meet their commitment. But the climate change funding will be under an international treaty, with the countries having legal binding to finance climate change projects.As of now, the developed countries have promised to provide financing of US$100 billion annually until the year 2020 to be mobilized both from public and private sectors. The countries are now saying that, of the fund, only 16% would go for adaptation projects and the rest 84% for mitigation projects. However, a recent GCF board viewed that this should be equally distributed to adaptation and mitigation measures. The board also viewed that the entire adaptation fund should come from the public sector.EP: What indications are there in the draft adopted in Bonn conferenceSH: The 34-page draft text was adopted on broad consensus. Each of the issues, except Loss and Damage, has two options - one for developed countries and another for the developing countries.The two main issues having broader differences are the LandD and displacement of vulnerable people. There is a positive indication in the draft that the agreement would come into reality.There is also an indication to make permanent the Warsaw International Mechanism which currently has a two-year tenure. The WIM has 9-point work program, including LandD, displacement and migration. In Paris, we will demand for financing for LandD stepping aside from earlier stance of ""polluters to pay"". We will also want separate committees to look after the issues of LandD and migration.EP: How do you see the strategy of France in their efforts to make the conference successfulSH: France has taken a different strategy this year - along with some other partners, the country has decided to invite the heads of states to take part in the high level segment before the real negotiation starts. It is expected that they will give directions to the negotiators in the segment. It is because the leaders often cannot reach final decision as evident in the past negotiations. The initiative seemed to help make this event successful.As part of the groundwork, the host country also invited ministers at a preCOP meeting to give them heads up so they can prepare for playing critical role in the negotiation segment of ""political horse-trading"" in the second week.The United States had raised an issue in Lima that a legally binding agreement would not be possible as the Congress is unlikely to ratify it. But legal experts found that the ratification needs when a treaty is signed. We're expecting here a legally binding agreement, which would not require ratification by the Congress.EP: How the civil society organizations want to see the outcomeSH: So far the target is to reduce the rise of temperature by 2 degrees within the year 2100, but it is too high as far as the vulnerable countries are concerned. We would demand for setting the target to 1.5 degrees. The target would be reviewed in every 10 years as of the present text, but we want it to be reviewed every five years.EP: How do you see Bangladesh's negotiation preparation for the conferenceSH: Bangladesh delegation and experts have long been working on this issue and they are now very skilled in negotiation. They do not only depend on their own inputs, but exchanges views with other group members as well as the civil society organizations. They share thoughts during the negotiations to get feedback. Bangladesh's negotiation is also being recognized by other member states in the LDCs and G77 as reflected in the previous occasions when other countries supported Bangladesh's points put forward during the negotiations.EP: Will Bangladesh's plan to develop coal-based power plant weaken the country's position in the negotiationSH: There is no relation between coalbased power plant and the negotiation. Bangladesh as a LDC can do it for the sake of its development. Bangladesh can move ahead with its development paradigm. But it is the high time for the country to think about alternatives for the sake of its own interest.EP: Bangladesh has taken a number of energy efficiency, conservation and alternative energy development programs at its own initiative. How the country could take the advantage of the initiatives from the negotiationEP: What Bangladesh should do to make its initiative a case for getting grants from the climate fundsSH: First, we will have to design appropriate projects. The ERD, which is the National Designated Authority for the Green Climate Fund (GCF) will first have to ensure that national institutions are able to access the GCF directly and mobilize the funds within the country.Meanwhile, there are allegations that the project implementation works are not going through a transparent manner for projects funded from the government's own resources. We will have to make sure that the implementation is taking place in a transparent manner, making it clear why a project is being undertaken, how the project would benefit us and how much would be the cost. Answers to the questions should be made public through media so the people understand and can monitor the projects.Even then, there might have some lapses in the implementation process - these should be recognized instead of hiding.\l"

From then on, the issue has dominated the public domain, from conventional news media to social media, to international conferences and summits. Now that the protest and processions are banned during the United Nations (UNCCC) at Paris due to fear of further attacks, it seems the spirit of the Conference may be lost from its core aim - ""climate change"".Paris attackOn November 13, in the midst of a friendly football match between French and Germany, sudden explosions outside the stadium created panic among the ones, including the French President Francois Hollande, who were present there, only to learn that further shootings are taking place outside the stadium. More than 100 people were already dead and many more were already injured before the police took down most of the shooters. Political leaders from across the globe did not waste much time to come up with statements condemning the attack. Hollande vowed strong military response against ISIS, which claimed the responsibility for the attacks, and French air strikes in Syria have been intensified accordingly.The suspected leader of the shooters, along with other suspects, except one, was killed during a raid in Paris suburb aftermath of the attack. The armed forces, who carried out the raid, confirmed that they were equipped enough with arms and ammunition to carry out more attacks in France and other parts of Western Europe. ISIS has sworn for more assault on Western soil.Ban of protests and marches during Climate conference amid fear of fresh attacksProtests, marches and other outdoor activities take place during every international conferences and summits to express both the supporting and the opposing views regarding various concerned issues related to the events. However, the protests, marches and other outdoor activities during the Paris climate conference, which will be held from November 30 to December 11, have been banned due to security reasons. The government claims that intelligence sources warned them of threats of attacks during the conference, and therefore, through such ban, the government intend to prevent attacks in the guise of protests or marches.Paris attack dominated all subsequent Summits and ConferencesThe G20 Summit, the ASEAN Summit and the East Asian Summit took place this month subsequent to the Paris attacks. Although the G20 is an economic platform, this year's Summit in Turkey was mostly dominated by the Paris attack issue. The same issue also filled a sizable space in the ASEAN and East Asian Summit, both of which are primarily meant to address issues like regional economic integration, regional disputes and regional stability.ObservationsBahauddin Foizee, lecturer at DCLE (centre of University of London) and legal associate in a law firm.Published by HT Syndication with permission from Dhaka Courier.

""We are pleased to host such an important dialogue on carbon pricing in Zurich. In our view, putting a price on greenhouse gases is a prereq uisite for reducing emissions in the most cost-efficient and effective way.

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh59","The Paris Alliance for Climate","August 20, 2015 Thursday","Dhaka Courier","Dhaka, Aug. 20 -- The Conference of Parties, the COP, is the United Nations framework for Climate negotiations. In December 2015, Paris will host the next COP: COP21. COP21 is not ""one more COP,"" because humanity is at a turning point regarding climate risk. In Paris, France wants to create a Paris Alliance for Climate, lying on four main pillars:The first one is the universal and legally binding agreement. This agreement will have to consider equally mitigation and adaptation, which is a priority for Bangladesh and all the countries already facing the impacts of a changing climate. This agreement will symbolise the willingness of our global worldwide society to commit itself to building a new global economic model in order to maintain greenhouse gas emissions below 2DegreeC, and even below 1.5DegreeC compared to the pre-industrial era, if we want to preserve a sustainable world for future generations. This means a global and worldwide transition towards low-carbon economies. The agreement will open the door to a long-term process of cooperation. COP21 must not be the end of a process; it must be the beginning for a new world and a new worldwide consciousness.The second pillar is the National Contributions, the so-called INDC. INDC have to be published before Paris Conference, to be integrated there. INDC present the national commitments on mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and they can include adaptation plans. INDC are the way to assess our global effort in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Forty-four countries have already published their INDC and we are confident that Bangladesh will comply with its commitment to publish them by October.The third pillar is financing. The international community has committed itself to mobilising $100bn per year, by 2020 to address climate issues. Through the Green Climate fund and many other channels, this effort is necessary, in order to redirect public and private flows towards low-carbon economies. Creating a new model means first of all working within a new framework. This new framework means mobilising both our existing and new resources through redirecting them in favour of the creation of this new model. The fact is that we can't create a new model using the old traditional channels of action. Private sector commitment is fundamental, because the private sector is the main actor for the production of value and new technologies.The last pillar is the Lima-Paris agenda, also called the agenda of solutions. The goal is to involve all the actors and to create a collective effort in order to change our global society. In Paris, NGO's, the private sector and other actors will be able to showcase their positive solutions to address climate change.The whole of France is working to make COP21 a success. 50,000 participants are expected in France for COP21. This is our challenge and we are ready to take it up, with the help of all of you, and on behalf of future generations.Published by HT Syndication with permission from Dhaka Courier.

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh60","France Wants Review of INDCs Every Five Years","November 30, 2015 Monday","Energy & Power","The French government has made a choice that the heads of state will open the COP21 to give the last political impulsion before the final climate change negotiations in Paris. One of the challenges of this COP would be to increasing fund mobilization and all the countries will have to increase their ambitions. The French government would suggest, among other proposals, a review of the national contributions every five years.French Ambassador to Bangladesh Sophie Aubert spoke of her government's stance to be taken at the COP21EP: As you are well aware that your country is hosting the COP21, to what extent you are hopeful about success of the conferenceSA: I hope that the right decisions will be adopted at COP21 because it would be a shame for our political leaders and heads of state if they refused to find out a global agreement in order to protect our children from the biggest disasters our humanity has ever faced. As the entire global society is conscious on this risk for peace and development, there will be no option but to get a global consensus.EP: Unlike previous events of COP, this time the heads of states will take part in the first segment of the conference. Why Will a political package come out of itSA: COP21 will be opened by the heads of state, 30st of November. This choice was made by the French government, with the aim to give the last political impulsion before the final negotiations.EP: Will the climate finance concerns be resolved in Paris successfullySA: French and Peruvian Finance ministers hold a ministerial meeting to address the climate finance issue at the latest IMF and WB assemblies, which took place in Lima last October. At this occasion, several reports were presented regarding green funds mobilization. According to the OECD report, US$62 billion were mobilized in 2014 in favour of climate finance from North to South. If we consider the commitments of the development banks for the future, so far, it appears that we are on the right trajectory to achieve the target of US$100 billion by 2020.EP: What are the possibilities for a road map of post-2020 finance in the context of the larger pictureSA: One of the challenges of this COP will be the increase of finance mobilization to address climate change before 2020 but also after 2020. This means that all the countries will have to increase their ambitions. This is also why my government will suggest, among other proposals, a review of the national contributions every five years. In my view, we must understand that we will have to create a new global energetic model. The main idea is not only to have new funding to face climate change but also to redirect our global finance towards new technologies and projects in order to improve our capacities of adaptation, but also to mitigate the impact of climate change. This means that not only public funds, but also private funds will have to be mobilized with the aim to create a new society.EP: There are terms about a Long Term Goal under the Paris agreement such as de-carbonization and climate resilience being used. Where does France stand on thisSA: Last August 17, 2015, France adopted a new law dedicated to energetic transition. This law doesn't oppose one source of energy against the other one, but it organizes complementarity among all the sources of energy, in order to develop a new energetic model. The principle is to pave the way to a green growth model, to promote innovation and new technologies and therefore to contribute to maintain the increase of global temperature below 2C and even more, by the end of the century. For example we now know how to build infrastructures producing more energy than the level they need to absorb in order to function. New technologies can shape a new world and this law will accelerate the transition of my country towards a new model of society.EP: Is there anything surprising Paris would offer the delegatesSA: Paris will host people from all over the world and Paris will offer to the world the best of itself. COP21 will be the biggest event we have ever welcomed and it will symbolize the victory of our humanity over those who want to destroy our way of life, our values and our civilizations fond of mutual respect, progress, development and peace.\l"

The goal of the summit is to produce an agreement that will last for a decade beyond that, hopefully longer.Previous climate summits have failed, for a variety of reasons.Though it may seem fruitless to hope to affect the outcome of a global summit from thousands of miles away, at least one person disagrees.A climate-change advocate who has attended every international summit since 2012 visited Arizona State University on Thursday morning to talk about what interested observers can do to contribute. Natalie Lucas is executive director of Care About Climate, an organization that works on climate education, mitigation and adaptation projects around the world. She will be attending the negotiations in Paris from Nov. 30 through Dec. 11.The Paris talks are expected to end in a universal and legally binding agreement - not a treaty - for all major countries that produce the most greenhouse gases.Lucas discussed nine things you can do to influence the summit.1) Get your city, campus, business or community to commit support, whether in the form of a statement or by acting in some of the ways described below. Convincing your mayor to send a letter to the State Department can be a coup.2) Talk about it. Be vocal on social media, talk about it with friends and family, let people know this is an important issue. ""Write to your local newspaper,"" Lucas said.

Skipping classes or work isn't always a great idea; Lucas said spending an afternoon volunteering for a local group like the Citizens' Climate Lobby might be a more viable option.7) March again. A second global march is slated for the day after the summit.8) Vote in next year's presidential election. ""Put someone in the White House who cares about these things,"" Lucas said.9) Join groups such as the Sierra Club or the Citizens' Climate Lobby.

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh64","Paris climate deal 2015-a cushion for developing nations","December 14, 2015 Monday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Dec. 14 -- After difficult two week-long COP21 negotiations, representatives of 195 countries of the world reached a unanimous landmark climate change accord in Paris. The historical climate deal for the first time made all the nations of the world to commit to cut greenhouse gas emissions to help reduce disastrous global warming effects. The deal is partly legally binding (like submitting a carbon emission reduction target and the regular review of the goal) and partly voluntary (such as the targets for reducing emission targets set by nations will not be binding under the Paris 2015 agreed accord) and it will come into being in 2020.The Paris 2015 deal attempts to limit global atmospheric temperature to less than 2 degrees Celsius and the measures adopted in the agreement included provisions for reviewing progress every five years, and for $100 billion dollars a year in climate finance for developing countries. As per the agreement, countries will now be legally required to reconvene every five years with updated plans to tighten their emission cuts starting from 2020.The Paris 2015 agreement will require developed countries to raise finance worth $100 billion per year from 2020 to help developing nations in both mitigation and adaptation activities for building a low emission future, while other countries to provide funding for the cause voluntarily.The international scientific advisory body on climate, the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) had been clearly pushing for the COP21 accord to limit global atmospheric temperatures below 2 degrees Celsius not only for saving the environment but also to protect sustainable development. The success of COP21 has created an opportunity to develop a framework for accelerated technological innovations and their deployment.There were three major challenges to finalise the Paris Climate deal 2015: reaching an agreement on emission reductions; adaptation to the impacts of climate change (present and future) and financing for the actions required for emission reductions. The final deal reached in COP21 has not made everybody happy but the commitment of nations to transform the global economy to a new low-carbon future will receive a boost from the outcome of COP21. Businesses have a vital role to play in the fight against climate change. Many companies and businesses are affected by climate change and are compelled to take adaptation actions. Businesses will also provide much of the financing to enable adoption of new technologies as well as innovation to develop new products for improving present and future production processes towards reducing energy consumption and improving efficiency.US President Barack Obama, who presented himself in the COP21 summit in Paris few days back as the representative of the biggest economy and the second largest polluting country of the world, expressed his satisfaction after the Paris Climate agreement saying, 'the agreement sends a powerful signal that the world is fully committed to a low-carbon future' and 'we have shown that the world has both the will and the ability to take the challenge.' Five years back, such a deal was politically impossible and the Copenhagen climate summit failed as the participating countries could not unite around the deal.China, the largest polluter and the second largest economy of the world, hailed the Paris climate deal. Chinese climate change negotiator Xie Zhenhua said that the agreement is not perfect, £nd there are some areas in need of improvement, but this does not prevent us from marching forward with the historic step'. He called the deal 'fair, just, comprehensive and balanced, highly ambitious, enduring and effective'.Giza Gaspar Martins, chairman of the group representing some of the world's poorest countries, said 'it is the best outcome we could have hoped for, not just for the Least Developed Countries, but for all citizens of the world'.India, one of the major polluters as well as an emerging economy of the world, is also happy as its concerns have been taken care of in the climate deal. Indian Environment Minister Prakash Javedkar thinks that the deal is a balanced one to take forward the world.To achieve the targets for reducing carbon emission to limit global warming within 2 degrees Celsius and to endeavour to keep it within 1.5 degrees, the world needs a huge cut on fossil fuel use. And to reduce carbon emissions, nations will be required to rely more on renewable energy and enhance energy efficiency significantly. Developing nations need both financial and technological assistance from rich countries to switch over to low-carbon development. Developing countries want more funding supports and they want it in the form of grants rather than loans. The rich nations have a key question related to transparency, i.e. the method of measuring, reporting and verifying that countries are doing what they are committed to do. Also, questions should be answered how low-emission technology processes should be disseminated to aid emission reductions, and how this should be financed. While the question of financing and technology is asked for developing greener and sustainable world, the issue of institution building and capacity development for developing nations is also to be addressed.The writer is a mining engineer and writes on energy and environment issues.

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh67","Global action needed to combat global warming","December 27, 2015 Sunday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Dec. 27 -- Contemporary global warning stemming from global warming and rising seas is a veritable reflection of experts' concerns calling attention of the policy level political and official high-ups. Fast changing rainfall pattern showing decreasing trend in monsoon and increasing trend during post monsoon period is a danger sign. Unexpected heavy rainfall as a mark of capricious play of nature threatens to lead to increasing runoffs causing devastation of flood.There has been increasing debate over global warming. Poor regions, particularly Asia and Africa, are vulnerable to 'the projected effects of global warming despite the fact that their emissions have been small compared to the developed world. The exemption of developing countries from Kyoto Protocol restrictions has been used to justify non-ratification by the US and a previous Australian Government. Australia has since ratified the Kyoto protocol. Another point of contention is the degree to which emerging countries such as India and China should be expected to constrain their emission.' According to 2007-2008 Gallup Polls survey 'over a third of the world's population was unaware of global warming, developing countries less aware than developed and Africa the least aware. Awareness does not equate to belief that global warming is a result of human activities.' Organized environmental group and policy communities stressed the need for changes in the current climate and with calculated risks. At times they advocated 'promoting adaptation to changes in infrastructural needs and emissions reductions.' Some fossil fuel companies have scaled back their efforts in recent years, or called for policies to reduce global warming. A host of global warming skeptics in the political community debated £ll or some of the global warming scientific consensus, questioning whether global warming is actually occurring, whether human activity has contributed significantly to the warming, and on the magnitude of the threat posed by global warming.According to the latest UN Global Warming report underlining facts and predictions 'the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change delivered a huge blow to global warming skeptics. Leading climate scientists are now 90 percent sure that human activity is heating up the planet. They present various scenarios that show where global warming could take us by the end of the century. The choice is ours'.The concerns of the government of the small island states deserve mention. Maldives, for illustration, is a small island state vulnerable to changes in sea level. Due to climate change there are possibilities of being badly damaged by cyclone, floods, tidal surge, and tsunami. The Maldives and Bangladesh are among the SAARC countries with clean air having much less incidence of emission of greenhouse gas. Despite this reality these two countries are going to be the worst victims of global warming and 'consequential sea-level rise'. Scientists apprehended Maldives would go under sea water and one third of Bangladesh would go under sea water. The global environment is changing due largely to 'the rapid sea-level rise occurring in all climate models whether they depict low, medium or high rates of greenhouse-gas emissions. In a medium greenhouse-gas emission scenario, the coastal areas would see an additional rise of about 8.3 inches above the mean sea level rise that is expected around the globe because of human-induced climate change' 'Thermal expansion and the melting of land ice, such as the Greenland ice sheet, are expected to cause the global sea-level rise. The scientists projected the global sea-level rise of 10.2 inches based on thermal expansion alone'The scientists express grave concern over coastal belts. This is because of the fact that £bout half of the world population live in coastal belts. Of course there is a large variation among countries. Changes in climate will affect coastal systems through sea level rise and increase in storm-surge hazards and possible changes in the frequency of extreme antecedents. The people in developing countries are four times more likely to die in natural disasters than people in developed countries. An increase in the global temperature is likely to potentially result in a sea level rise as much as one meter that may cause inundation of costal areas and high frequency of submersion of vast area under water. The consequences are being faced by the people in different parts of the world regarding health hazards, natural calamities, draught, acid rain, desertification, sea level rise and so many greenhouse effectsCop 21 was held in Paris, most beautiful and green friendly city of Europe . It continued from 30 November to 12 December 2015. ""The conference negotiated Paris agreement, a sort of climate chorus with concerted views and promise of united action . A number of meetings took place in preparation for COP21, including the Bonn Climate Change Conference, 19 to 23 October 2015, that ' produced a draft agreement'Paris conference is also termed global agreement on the reduction of the danger of global warming. The text of the global agreement. Paris concert in other others represented a consensus of the representatives of the 196 parties attending it. The agreement was supposed to become 'legally binding if joined by at least 55 countries which together represent at least 55 percent of global greenhouse emissions. Such parties will need to sign the agreement in New York between 22 April 2016 and 21 April 2017, and also adopt it within their own legal systems (through ratification acceptance, approval, or accession).'Think tanks such as the World Pensions Council(WPC) expressed the view that the keys to success lie in convincing U.S. and Chinese policy makers: ""as long as policy makers in Washington and Beijing didn't put all their political capital behind the adoption of ambitious carbon-emission capping targets, the laudable efforts of other G20 governments often remained in the realm of pious wishes. According to reports on the Paris confertence:According to the organizing committee at the outset of the talks, the expected key result was an agreement to set a goal of limiting global warming to less than 2 degrees celsias(degC) compared to pre-industrial levels. The agreement calls for zero net anthropogenic green house emissions to be reached during the second half of the 21st century. In the adopted version of the Paris Agreement, the parties will also ""pursue efforts to"" limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degC. The 1.5 degC goal will require zero emissions sometime between 2030 and 2050, according to some scientists.'The agreement establishes a ""global stocktake"" which revisits the national goals to ""update and enhance"" them every 5 years beginning 2023.

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh68","Renewable energy revolution next!","November 7, 2015 Saturday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 7 -- The fossil fuel industry has taken a very cavalier bet that China, India and the developing world will continue to block any serious effort to curb greenhouse emissions, and that there is, in any case, no viable alternative to oil, gas or coal for decades to come.Both assumptions were still credible six years ago when the Copenhagen climate summit ended in acrimony, poisoned by a North-South split over CO2 legacy guilt and the allegedly prohibitive costs of green virtue.At that point the International Energy Agency (IEA) was still predicting that solar power would struggle to reach 20 gigawatts by now. Few could have foretold that it would in fact explode to 180 gigawatts - over three times Britain's total power output - as costs plummeted, and that almost half of all new electricity installed in the US in 2013 and 2014 would come from solar.Any suggestion that a quantum leap in the technology of energy storage might soon conquer the curse of wind and solar intermittency was dismissed as wishful thinking, if not fantasy.Six years later there can be no such excuses. As The Telegraph reported, 155 countries have submitted plans so far for the COP21 climate summit to be held by the United Nations in Paris this December. These already cover 88pc of global CO2 emissions and include the submissions of China and India.Taken together, they commit the world to a reduction in fossil fuel demand by 30pc to 40pc over the next 20 years, and this is just the start of a revolutionary shift to net zero emissions by 2080 or thereabouts. ""It is unstoppable. No amount of lobbying at this point is going to change the direction,"" said Christiana Figueres, the UN's top climate official.Yet the energy industry is still banking on ever-rising demand for its products as if nothing has changed. BP is projecting a 43pc increase in fossil fuel use by 2035, Exxon expects 35pc by 2040, Shell 43pc and Opec is clinging valiantly to 55pc. These are pure fiction. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) may or may not be correct in arguing that we cannot safely burn more than 800bn tonnes of carbon (two-thirds has been used already) if we are to stop global temperatures rising two degrees above pre-industrial levels by 2100. I take no view on the science.But this is the goal accepted by world leaders. It is solemnly enshrined in international accords, and while it might once have been possible for energy companies to dismiss these utterings as empty pieties, to persist now is to trifle with fate.""This is a world apart from where we were going into Copenhagen. The centre of gravity has fundamentally and irreversibly shifted,"" said Mark Kenber, head of the Climate Group.China switched sides several years ago, not least because it faces a middle class insurrection that has shaken the Communist Party to its core. An estimated 100m people viewed the anti-pollution video ""Under the Dome"" in just 24 hours before it was shut down by horrified officials in February.The IEA says China invested $80bn in renewable energy last year, as much as the US and the EU combined. It is blanketing chunks of the Gobi Desert with solar panels, necessary to absorb the massive surplus production of its own solar companies. The party's Energy Research Institute has floated the idea of raising the renewable share of electricity to 86pc by 2050.It is patently obvious that China is not about to sabotage a climate deal. Its submission to the COP21 summit aims for peak greenhouse emissions by 2030, if not before. It plans 200 gigawatts (GW) of wind and 100GW of solar by then, and a reduction in coal use from 2020 onwards. There will be a carbon emissions trading scheme as soon as 2017.The panels have led to big electricity savings for the 1.4 million householders who have installed them,155 countries have submitted plans so far for the COP21 climate summit to be held by the United Nations in Paris this December Photo: AlamyThe text makes it very clear that China considers itself ""among those countries that are most severely affected by the adverse impacts of climate change"" and is pushing for a far-reaching COP21 deal in its own defence. Going green with a vengeance is one way that China wishes to reposition itself as a global ""soft power"" force, as will become clear during its presidency of the G20 next year.The last hold-outs are increasingly lonely as China, the US, Europe, Japan and Mexico all flaunt their good intentions. India has shifted safely into the middle ground, dashing the last hopes of those who thought COP21 would wither on the vine.India invoked ""our planet Mother Earth"", Mahatma Gandhi, and the ancient practices of yoga in its poetic submission, pledging to raise renewables to 40pc of power output by 2030 (mostly solar) and to soak up three billion turns of carbon dioxide in new forests. It plans to cut the energy intensity of GDP by a third from 2005 levels, no easy task for an economy on the cusp of an industrial surge. India's green think-tank TERI called it an ""unprecedented"" shift.There is still a North-South haggle over money - erupting in terse words last week in Bonn - but this dispute has become ritualistic, increasingly hollow in a world where China is now a creditor. It revolves around $100bn of annual funds pledged by the rich countries long ago. ""It's peanuts,"" said Mrs Figueres.The sums are trivial set against the $90 trillion of new energy investment that the IEA deems necessary by 2030 just to keep the global juggernaut on the road.The IEA says the COP21 pledges imply will require $13.5 trillion of energy-saving and low carbon investments alone over the next fifteen years. New emissions will ""slow to a crawl"" by 2030.Global energy intensity will rise three times faster than hitherto, and 70pc of all new power added will come from low-carbon sources. Markets will do the job under the right terms and they are already making the switch as they discover a potentially lucrative new home for the world's glut of excess savings and capital.A Carbon Tracker forum in the City this week was packed with bankers and fund managers itching to find a way into the biggest investment boom of all time, which is what the Paris accord promises to ignite.The COP21 emission targets imply an assault on multiple fronts at once. Fossil subsidies worth $600bn a year - or $5.3 trillion under the International Monetary Fund's elastic definition - are already sliding fast. They will inevitably fade away.There will have to be a carbon price, whether a tax or a trading scheme, and it will have to rise over time as the ""year zero"" of negative CO2 emissions comes closer.Carbon capture and storage can perhaps save large parts of the fossil industry if it moves in time, which is why the World Coal Association has belatedly become a cheerleader for what was once an outlandish idea of the greens.Shell says a carbon price of $40 would bring CCS into play under current technology - some say $80 - but that in itself would shift the balance of advantage further in favour of renewables just as the cross-over point arrives. In large parts of Africa it already has: it is cheaper and quicker to install micro-grids based on solar power than to bother with power stations.The old energy order is living on borrowed time. You can, in a sense, compare what is happening to the decl"
"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh69","Middle Income Country: Fuel Challenges and Facts","April 15, 2016 Friday","Energy & Power","Since its inception, Bangladesh was worldwide known as a low-income country. In 2014, World Bank recognized Bangladesh as a lower middle-income country considering its per capita income, electricity consumption, literacy rate, unemployment rate, poverty rate, healthcare indicators, and the like. The basic indicators for the recognition as a lower middle-income country were US$ 1,300 per capita income, 348 kW-hour per capita electricity consumption, 70% literacy rate, 24% poverty reducing rate, low infant mortality rate, low maternal mortality rate, low mal nutrition rate, women empowerment, etc. During the 50th anniversary of the liberation in 2021, Bangladesh wants to get worldwide recognition as a middle income country. The government has a strong-will to do what needs to be done for realizing the dream.To be recognized as a middle-income country within the next five years, the most important indicators such as the per capita income and per capita electricity consumption should be at least US$ 4,645 and 1,000 kW-hours; and the poverty rate should be below 14%. Since per capita income and per capita electricity consumption are the most influential parameters to be a middle-income or high-income country, these parameters need to be discussed elaborately. Ensuring door to door electricity, healthcare, and digital technology are the firm commitments of the present govern ment. Let's discuss about ensuring electricity for all as electricity has a deep relationship with the income and living standards of the people. The Awami League alliance government has achieved significant success in generations and distributions of electricity in the last seven years since they came to power in 2009. Still, 25% of inhabitants do not have access to electricity. More a country uses electricity, the more developed it is.How is it possible to become a middle-income country with per capita income of US$ 4,645 and electricity consumption of 1,000 kW-hours? In order to continuing the GDP growth rate at least 8% or more, the government has already set a power demand of 24,000 MW by 2021. For this, in the Power System Master Plan (PSMP) 2010, a balanced fuel-mix diversification policy has been taken into consideration to meet this demand. The policy is taken to lessen indigenous gas dependency from 62% to 42%. In order to keep operating the 42% gas based power plants, uninterrupted and sustainable gas supply will be met by importing LNG. It is under way to build a floating terminal in Maheshkhali for LNG import. According to the PSMP for LNG import initiatives either pipel"

The report, based on investigation in six countries, is the first to calculate the actual amount that rich countries should give based on estimates for future global adaptation needs and to compare this to their adaptation finance contributions so far.""The impacts of climate change on vulnerable communities in Bangladesh and other developing countries are already massive,"" ActionAid Bangladesh country director Farah Kabir said.""Approaching COP21 in Paris we need to see a roadmap that shows the scaling-up of public finance to at least $50 billion per year by 2020, and at least $150 billion per year by 2025, so that developing countries like Bangladesh can start implementing the adaptation work that is so urgently required,"" she added.She said adequate grant-based, not loan based climate finance, will be a key barometer of success for the world's leader at the climate summit in Paris next month. Rich countries must deliver their fair shares of adaptation finance in the new global deal.The calculations show that rich countries are falling well short of providing adequate money to help people in poor countries already suffering the harsh impacts of climate change.The USA needs to increase its contributions by more than 154 times, from the US$0.44 billion it gave in 2013 to a fair share of US$67.5 billion in 2025.France, which is hosting the next month's landmark climate conference COP21, needs to increase its contribution by more than 75 times to meet its fair share, from the US$0.07 billion it gave in 2013 to US$5.5 billion in 2025.European Union members collectively need to increase contributions by more than 11 times to meet their fair share, from US$3.2bn in 2013 to US$36.9bn in 2025.Australia needs to increase its contributions by 20 times to meet its fair share, from US$0.22 billion in 2013 to US$4.4 billion in 2025.The rich and emerging economies contribute to almost 80 per cent of the global emission, where Bangladesh contributes only about 0.16 per cent (0.4 tonnes per capita)- this is almost negligible considering any calculation, especially population and development needs.According to the report, rich developed countries, which have produced the majority of greenhouse gas emissions in the earth's atmosphere and have the most historical responsibility for climate change, must acknowledge their obligation to support developing countries to adapt to climate change impacts.""This must be done through providing means of implementation such as climate finance, technology transfer and capacity building,"" the report says.The report says developing countries are particularly vulnerable to climate change. Adaptation in these countries will be challenging, costly, and must take place in addition to ongoing development efforts.There is still a great deal of assessment, trial and learning to be done with regard to adaptation.Investment in technology, communications, infrastructures, institutions, training, outreach and many other approaches will all be required, according to the report.

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh72","Climate Pledges Would Slow Energy Sector Emissions","November 30, 2015 Monday","Energy & Power","World will come together in Paris at end November 2015 to agree or disagree on emission reduction for limiting global warming below 2 degree Celsius (2DS) threshold. Various regions of the world over that last few years have witnessed regular visits of major natural disasters from adverse climate change from global warming triggered by emissions. Summers have become warmer, winter became cooler. Tsunamis, cyclones, tidal bores, bushfires, earthquakes, cold waves, snow storms have devastated many countries. Continued melting of glaciers in arctic is causing sea level rise. Many low-lying countries are in real threat of getting swamped unless the global warming is not urgently restricted. Most of the emissions come from developed countries sand most of countries vulnerable to climatic disaster are relatively poor and hence unable to take required protective and preventive measures.Polluting developed nations are not only required agreeing to emissions cut but also commit generous contribution to climate fund. These are the major objectives of COP21. Nations of the world are looking forward with great hopes that for the greater interest of mankind and for a livable future world COP21 would achieve its desired objectives. The 21st Conference of Parties (COP) in Paris is going to be a milestone in efforts for combating climate change. More than 150 countries have already submitted pledges accounts for around 90% of global economic activity and almost 90% of global energy related GHG emissions. These countries include all countries in North America, almost all in Europe, 90% of Africa, about two thirds of developing Asia, 60% of those in Latin America and on third in the Middle East. These countries together account about 90% of global fossil fuel demand and produce about 80% of global fossil fuel.Energy production and use account for around two thirds of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. If the climate pledges lead to a binding agreement this would definitely slow down energy sector emissions. International Energy Agency (IEA) in its special briefing for COP21 has released a summary assessment of the energy sector impacts of national climate pledges (Intended Nationally Determined Contributions [INDCs]). Countries like Bangladesh which however are blessed with infinite reserve of primary fuel resources and have limited access to modern emission restricting power generation technology may be required to reassess their energy generation options. Environment friendly green energy may be preferred. Developed nations may require to transfer technology and train professionals of climate vulnerable countries for creating critical mass of competent professionals. Intensive attention will require to be diverted for energy efficiency and conservation.We are aware that IEA as an autonomous agency is mandated to promote energy security amongst its member countries through collective response to physical disruptions in oil supply. It provides authoritative research and analysis on ways to ensure reliable, affordable and clean energy for its 29 member countries and beyond. IEA goals and objectives are very much consistent with the pledges and commitments of COP. The special briefing of IEA would greatly assist the participants of COP21 in Paris in sensing the directions of ensuing Paris meet. IEA assessment apprehended that actions in the energy sector can make or break efforts to achieve the worlds agreed climate. It considered the coverage of pledges as unprecedented and impressive. But IEA considered the energy sector focus as uneven. The content of climate pledges varies in many respects, making their interpretation and evaluation challenging.The pledges that countries has submitted include among others GHG emission targets, emissions intensity targets (GHG emissions per unit of economic output), deviations from ""business as usual"" emissions trajectories, reductions or limitations in per capita emissions, or statements regarding policies and measures to be implemented. Some pledges are conditional depending on external financial supports or other factors. All INDC submissions include energy sector emissions; most of them have targets and pledges of actions for achieving those. About 50% include explicit energy focused targets either inclusive of GHG target or standalone goal. 40% of the submissions stated about expanding renewable energy use and one third stated about introducing improved efficiency in energy use. Some submissions about short term actions stated about reducing use of inefficient coal fired power use, lowering methane emissions from oil and gas production.Some submission pledged fossil fuel subsidy reform or carbon pricing. A small section of submission discussed about technology and policy options that are required for nuclear power generation, carbon capture and storage and alternative vehicle fuel (advanced bio fuels electric vehicles). Some pledges in INDC have GHG targets without making clear the expected contribution of the energy sector and non-energy sector sources of these emissions.Renewable Sources for Power Generation Would Become Preferred OptionThe IEA special briefing assessed that global CO 2 emissions from power generation remain broadly flat through to 2030. The power sector is the largest source of energy related CO 2 emissions. Worldwide attention is directed towards de-carbonize energy sector. The global power sector emissions would stay broadly flat though electricity demand would increase by more than 40% to 2030. It is a positive development that at the global level, the link between rising electricity demand and rising related CO 2 emissions is broken. This is an important step towards further decarburization. IEA also stated that seven out of every ten units of additional electricity generation through to 2030 is projected to be low-carbon, bringing the share of total electricity generation from low-carbon sources from one-third today to nearly 45% in 2030. The above evidence that fossil fuel based power generation will gradually be reduced and would be replaced with increased use of non-fossil renewable energy.Investment RequiredThe full implementation of climate pledges will require the energy sector to invest US$13.5 trillion in energy efficiency and low-carbon technologies from 2015 to 2030, representing almost 40% of total energy sector investment. Around $8.3 trillion is needed to improve energy efficiency in the transport, buildings and industry sectors, while much of the remaining investment is to de-carbonize the power sector. More than 60% of total investment in power generation capacity is projected to be for renewable capacity, at $4.0 trillion, with one-third of this being for wind power, almost 30% for solar power (mainly solar photovoltaics) and around one-quarter for hydropower. While OECD countries absorb 60% of energy efficiency investment ($5 trillion), nonOECD countries absorb a greater share of the investment in low-carbon technologies ($2.7 trillion).Impacts of Pledges for COP21 on Future energy Sector TrendsEven if the pledges made through INDC leads to binding agreement and implemented the consequent global temperature increase may be limited to 2.7 degrees Celsius (C) by 2100, falling short of limiting the increase to no more than 2 C. Hence it becomes imperative that the INDCs be viewed as an important base upon which to build ambition.Bridge Strategy for Energy SectorThe energy sector can do more to restrain and reduce its GHG emissions; for all countries, there are many ways in which energy sector actions require to be accelerated. The EIA's Energy and Climate Change Special Report highlighted five energy sector measures (relying only on proven technologies and policies) which may help achieve an early peak in total energy-related GHG emissions, at no net economic cost.The five measures are:- Improving energy efficiency in the industry, buildings and transport sectors;- Phasing out the use of the least-efficient coal-fired power plants;- Further boosting investment in renewables-based power generation technologies (to $400 billion in 2030);- Gradually phasing out fossil fuel subsidies;- Reducing methane emissions from oil and gas production.Many of these measures are included within some of the submitted INDCs, but there is scope for their adoption to be broadened and their level of ambition to be raised. An additional $3 trillion (around 20%) of cumulative investment in energy efficiency and low-carbon technologies would be required through to 2030 in order to bring the level of ambition reflected in the INDCs up to that of the IEA's Bridge Strategy. Around 70% of the additional investments need to go towards improving energy efficiency and almost 30% towards support.IEA suggested for efforts to improve the clarity and consistency of climate pledges, as well as to identify ways to enhance their ambition, would bring major benefits. It also suggested that the advances in reducing energy-related GHG emissions must, ultimately, be permanent rather than temporary.Energy sector is the major emitter. Hence the gradual reduction of fossil fuel use, adoption of advanced less emitting technology, expansion of use of renewable energy, increasing energy efficiency, generous contribution by major emitter developed countries to climate fund, technology transfer and assistance to climate vulnerable countries must be the goal for COP21.\l"

It was jointly organised by Bangladesh Unnayan Parishad (BUP) and the Global Call to Action against Poverty (GCAP).The roundtable was called on the eve of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)'s annual Conference of the Parties (COP 21) scheduled to start on November 30 in Paris.In the roundtable, the climate change experts also stressed the need for focusing on technology transfer to the climate-vulnerable countries like Bangladesh at the Paris climate summit.Coordinator of Bangladesh Climate Change Negotiation Team at the COP 21 Dr Qazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmad said the team would not support any proposal on loan for the climate change adaptation or mitigation purpose.He said the developed countries are responsible for the climate disasters and ""we are the worst victims of the climate change.""Increase in temperature, which is causing climate change, is a result of uncontrolled carbon emission by the developed countries.Climate vulnerable countries will raise voice for their compensation as grant and the Bangladeshi negotiation team will remain vocal at the COP 21 against any soft loan from the green climate fund, he said.Dr Ahmad also said as Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, she needs more fund as well as technology to adapt to the changing climate.Climate change expert Dr Rezaul Karim presented a paper at the roundtable.

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh74","Conference of Parties on Climate negotiations: Paris Alliance for Climate","July 14, 2015 Tuesday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, July 14 -- We are half way through a year, 2015, during which the focus is on development and climate. These battles can be won only if we fight together: to tackle poverty and enable development, we must win the battle against climate change.To do so, we need to build together an agreement in Paris that enables us to limit the rise of the average temperature of the planet less than 2oC, or 1.5oC above pre-industrial levels, and adapt our societies to deal with the existing climate disruption.It should set us on the path of a low-carbon transition which will allow everyone to benefit from sustainable development. This transition will - above all - be an opportunity to improve energy security, bring down the deficit, reduce poverty, and improve public health...In our capacity as future presidency for COP21, the international framework for climate negotiations, we are working with all countries, transparently, to support the negotiating process towards an agreement everyone will be able to own. The many discussions we are having confirm that all countries want to achieve a universal agreement on the climate in December 2015.As incoming presidency of the COP21, we are not supporting one specific solution, neither French nor European one. We are listening equally to all parties, in order to understand the concerns, the national situations and the expectations for each and every one of them, particularly the most vulnerable.We envision that we should achieve, in December, a Paris Alliance for Climate, which should rely on four components:n The first, and most important one, is a universal and legally binding agreement. This agreement will have to deal equally with mitigation and adaptation, a priority for all countries which are already feeling the impact of climate disruption, sometimes in a tragic way. The agreement will also have to take into account everyone's responsibilities and capabilities. It will have to be on a long-term and establish a process of cooperation between us, so that we can reinforce our collective effort and progressively achieve a shared long-term goal.n National contributions (INDCs) that each country must publish before the Paris Conference. These contributions must present commitments on mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, and for those willing to do so, include adaptation plans. Nearly 40 countries have already presented them. The European Union is playing its part. We have - together with Germany, the United Kingdom, and many others - supported last year the adoption of ambitious European climate and energy objectives for 2030, among which the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% compared to 1990. This constitutes the European 'INDC' to the Paris Agreement.n To enable a global transition, we must also address financing. We must create confidence that the commitment made in Copenhagen in 2009 to mobilize $100 billion a year by 2020 for developing countries (some of which will go through the Green Climate Fund) will indeed be honoured. More broadly, we must establish the rules and incentives to enable a profound redirection of public and private capital flows towards the low-carbon economy.n Finally, the fourth aspect of the Paris Alliance is the Lima-Paris Action Agenda, which aims to involve civil society and non-governmental actors (local authorities, businesses and voluntary organizations)to commit and strengthen the engagement of States, so as to reinforce our collective effort, particularly before 2020. Today is an opportunity to showcase many concrete actions and illustrate the cooperation between Governments and non-governmental actors. It shall also convey the message, right through to the Paris Conference, that the climate challenge represents economic and social opportunities, and that all civil society actors should get on board.In all these areas, progress is being made: contributions are being published, financial actors are getting increasingly active, and each day we get closer to the agreement that we need in Paris. As such, the session of intermediate negotiations that just took place in Bonn reinforced the trust of parties in the process and gave a mandate to the two co-chairs of the working group to restructure the current project and present a more concise and clearer text, which will then be negotiated in the next two intermediate negotiation sessions (August and October), so that in Paris, an agreement could be reached.We are entering a period where we need to do everything possible to identify and consolidate the areas of convergence on the key political questions. To help finding these compromises, we will support the process of formal negotiation by organising over the coming months (September and October) several informal discussions, on both negotiator and ministerial level. These meetings will gather countries which are representative of the negotiation groups, but will always be open to everyone who wants to participate, and the results will then be reported back to the ADP working group.We also envisage consulting heads of States and Governments, so that they can give a clear political direction. With this in mind, we are considering a meeting, led by the French President and the United Nations Secretary-General in New York, during the upcoming United Nations General Assembly, in September. Furthermore, we are also considering that heads of States and Governments, who wish to attend the opening of COP21, may do so.As reminded by President Hollande at the G7 summit in June- where developed countries adopted an ambitious position in view of -, France is facing up to the responsibility of its future presidency with a determination to succeed and a commitment at the State's highest level.With just four months to go until the Conference, we believe that we are on the right track, but time is short and the pace of the negotiations must be stepped up. Every meeting must represent a step forward, and everyone must agree to make the necessary choices in a spirit of mutual trust, so that in October all the issues will already have been discussed and solutions can be proposed. The Paris agreement must be built before the Paris summit.Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh76","Keeping the climate-finance promise","November 15, 2015 Sunday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Nov. 15 -- In 2009, the world's rich countries pledged to mobilize $100 billion a year by 2020 to help poor countries tackle climate change. Since then, that promise has come to be regarded as a key test of the developed world's resolve to do its part in the fight against global warming.Reaching the $100 billion target is important. Poor countries must believe that rich countries will honour their pledges. Otherwise, the prospects for an effective international agreement at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in November and December could be at risk. Fortunately, there are encouraging signs that the commitment will be honoured. But larger financial flows are needed, particularly from the private sector. According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the Climate Policy Initiative, developed countries collectively mobilized $52.2 billion in 2013 and $61.8 billion in 2014 to help poor countries reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and build resilience against the effects of climate change that can no longer be avoided.While it is important to note that this figure is only an estimate, it represents a preliminary but credible indicator of climate finance, based on information provided by developed countries. If one assumes greater leverage for private-sector investment, the number would be higher. Similarly, conservative assumptions about how much ""genuinely extra"" money is being spent to fight climate change through overseas aid and the multilateral development banks might have produced a lower figure.In reaching their estimate, the researchers took into account major investments by both the public and private sectors in a wide range of projects. Examples include the funding of small-scale renewable energy projects in Uganda by the United Kingdom (UK), Germany, Norway, and the European Union (EU), as well as the African Risk Capacity - supported by the UK and Germany - which offers insurance to governments against drought and other natural disasters.What the report reveals is the relatively low level of investment by the private sector in projects that will increase poor countries' resilience (though the authors acknowledge that limited information might mean that the true amount is higher). This is both a challenge and an opportunity; with the right incentives, a sharp rise in private investment that enhances resilience could go a long way toward meeting the $100 billion target.Reaching that goal will require increased confidence in the policies and institutions of the countries in which the money is to be spent. New processes for sharing and reducing risk will be necessary. In this effort, development banks and bilateral aid institutions have much to offer.It is crucial that this new climate finance be used to complement the even-larger investments in sustainable development that will be necessary over the next few decades. A central aim for climate financing should be to establish and implement the policies, regulations, and frameworks that will create the appropriate incentives for investors. This could provide very large ""multipliers.""According to the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, some $90 trillion will need to be spent on infrastructure over the next 15 years, mostly in developing and emerging economies that are experiencing rapid growth and urbanization. If that infrastructure locks in dependence on fossil fuels, it will be very difficult to reduce global emissions of greenhouse gases.However, if countries invest wisely in the transition to a low-carbon economy, they will stimulate innovation and generate decades of sustainable growth. Thus, it is important that climate finance be used to foster public and private investment in low-carbon infrastructure and technologies, particularly to lower the cost of capital, which is crucial to scale up projects and encourage renewable-energy adoption.Furthermore, climate funding provided by rich countries should help improve resilience to climate change in the most vulnerable countries. It should also be used to avoid deforestation and to protect fragile resources, including oceans and biodiversity. And it should boost innovation and break new ground for climate action, including novel ways for the public and private sectors to work together, such as projects on carbon capture and storage.Some of the $100 billion will be channelled through the newly created Green Climate Fund; but the existing multilateral development banks should also play a central role, along with national aid agencies and departments. Money spent on sustainable development and climate action should be mutually reinforcing. And finance ministries in developing countries should reaffirm that, in addition to fostering growth and poverty reduction, wise action to mitigate climate change can lower levels of air pollution and raise energy efficiency.Success will ultimately depend on rich countries' willingness to live up to their promises. Their leaders must recognize that financial support for action against climate change in developing countries is not only morally right; it is also in the interest of their constituencies and, indeed, the world community.(The writer is Chairman of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science and President of the British Academy.

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh83","The ambitions and flaws of the Paris Agreement","December 17, 2015 Thursday","Dhaka Courier","Dhaka, Dec. 17 -- The conclusion of COP21 did give us an environmental agreement, the first to impose various binding and voluntary measures within its remit that will first permit a peak of greenhouse gases globally before rapidly reducing.[1] It will attempt to limit the rise in global temperatures ""well below"" 2degC above pre-industrial levels, with the background target being 1.5degC (Art. 2.1(a)). A climate finance fund of $100 billion per annum for developing countries by 2020, with further future finance, is to come from the pockets of developing states.Delegates emphasised the historical sense of the occasion. A persistent theme to come through was that of ""balance"". In the Agreement, it was recognised that ""global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions"" would vary for developing country parties. Once reached, rapid reductions would take place forthwith ""so as to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century, on the basis of equity, and in the context of sustainability development and efforts to eradicate poverty"" (Art. 4.1).Various environmental groups were certainly not convinced by the paperwork. The agreement, according to Friends of the Earth International, was a ""sham,"" the outcome of deception and bullying. The developed countries, in short, had gotten away with the meanest of undertakings.[2] The problems of differentiation, to take one example of this purported sham, have been combated with a severely contorting bit of legalese termed Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities, In the Light of Different National Circumstances (Art 2(2)).Other stinging criticisms were also mounted. Compensation mechanisms for irreparable damage have not been factored in; adequate finance will not be made available; and the proposed program will exceed the proposed temperature limit. The point was largely compounded by the memories of Copenhagen 2009, when the insistence on binding emission targets led to any prospective being scuppered.The result, then, has been a new creature in the form of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), many of which were submitted in advance of the meeting, and will be a cornerstone of the agreement. When these are factored in, a target closer to three degrees is considered the more accurate outcome of the commitments. Data from Climate Analytics, ECOFYS, the New Climate Institute and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, suggests that the generated figure, based on the Paris undertakings, will come at 2.7degC by 2100.Nick Deardon, director of the Global Justice Now group, took issue with the persisting disparity between developed and developing states on the subject. As for what was actually binding in the agreement, one could count only on some bare bones procedures: the submission of an emissions reduction target, for instance, and the regular review mechanism on reaching that goal. (The first review will take place in 2019, with a more thorough ""global stocktake"" (Art. 14) in 2023 followed by cuts to carbon emissions two years later.)What otherwise stands out is Article 6(1), a wordy provision that puts the boot into binding obligations while giving a free hand to states, suggesting that flexibility is better than not. ""Parties recognize that some Parties choose to pursue voluntary cooperation in the implementation of their nationally determined contributions to allow for higher ambition in their mitigation and adaptation actions and to promote sustainable development and environmental integrity.""Is such a regime a genuine compromise on shouldering adequate and proportionate burdens? Not so, according to Deardon. ""It's outrageous that the deal that's on the table is being spun as a success when it undermines the rights of the world's most vulnerable communities and had almost nothing binding to ensure a safe and liveable climate for future generations.""[3]Any arrangement worth its salt was going to have to go into the drawers of history to consider past wrongs, a sort of divvying up of resources that would require a dramatic shifting of wealth. That is simply not going to happen. The fund for $100 billion, which is in turn hundreds of billions short, is small fare for what has taken place, and what is to come.The interaction between humankind's engagement with the environment has already produced a range of dystopian foretastes. Even climate change sceptics would find it hard to deny Beijing's ""red alert"" for smog, declared on Monday by authorities in an effort to keep people in from the lethal air.[4] They would find it impossible to deny the increasing deaths from those living in cities which are becoming uninhabitable, or movement from areas which are vanishing. These are simply some features of the environmental devastation that require addressing.COP21 seeks the vision of the de-carbonized globe; but it is highly questionable whether it will have the legs, and the lengths, to fulfil it. Kumi Naidoo of Greenpeace claims that, even if the wheel of climate action turned slowly, it had at least turned at Paris. ""There's much in this deal that frustrates and disappoints me, but it still puts the fossil fuel industry squarely on the wrong side of history.""[5] But after the chatter has been concluded in Paris, the implementation on home fronts will have to take place. Fossil fuel lobbies will continue their dirty work. (They are glaring absentees in the final text.) A hostile US Congress, rent with climate change sceptics, is already promising to make life for the administration interesting.In any case, such measures are meaningless without a united front of seemingly disparate interests, be they anti-austerity groupings on the one hand, or climate change activists on the other.[6] Environment, economy and politics are vast but related peas in a complex pod. In the aftermath of Paris, it is clear that COP21 was far from what Angelica Navarro, Bolivian trade and climate negotiator, would have wished for: the equivalent of a Marshall plan for planet earth.Dr. Binoy Kampmark was a Commonwealth Scholar at Selwyn College, Cambridge.

The G-20, whose members account for about 85 per cent of the world economy, has an important responsibility to respond to challenges that affect the lives and prosperity of millions of people around the world. It cannot risk falling into complacency and inaction.Since Turkey assumed the presidency of the G-20 in December 2014, our approach toward ensuring inclusive and robust growth through collective action has enjoyed the support of the organisation's members. This effort has been built on three pillars: decisive implementation of past commitments, boosting investments as a powerful driver of the global economy, and promotion of inclusiveness so that the benefits of growth are shared by all.When it comes to implementation, great strides have been made. By promoting sound macroeconomic and fiscal policies and implementing solid, structural reforms, we have made significant progress toward our objective of expanding the G-20's collective gross domestic product (GDP) by 2.1 per cent by 2018. The global financial system is now more resilient than it has ever been. Financial capacities are being rebuilt, and new growth targets are being met.But there remains much more to be done. G-20 members should expedite efforts to deliver on their commitments to boost productivity and eliminate structural bottlenecks to investment, competition, trade, and jobs. We must also cement the fundamental reforms to the global financial system that the G-20 has delivered over the past seven years.Our focus on investment - a key driver of growth, jobs, and development - is also beginning to pay off. There is a huge investment gap in the global economy, both in advanced and developing countries. That is why we need developed-country strategies that bring together concrete policy actions and commitments to improve the investment ecosystem, support small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), and promote the construction of efficient, high-quality infrastructure. If the G-20 members fully implement their commitments under these strategies, their collective GDP is expected to increase by another 1.0 per cent.Economic growth must be strong and sustainable; but, above all, it must be inclusive. Inequality is rising in many G-20 countries; in some cases, it has reached historic highs. This is a dangerous development, one that can retard growth, threaten the cohesion of societies, and jeopardise people's well-being. It is imperative that the G-20 tackle inequality head on and demonstrate its determination to ensure that all of its member countries' citizens enjoy the fruits of economic growth.Reducing unemployment is central to the fight against inequality. There are about 100 million jobless people in the G-20, and another 200 million young people who are neither working nor studying. Significantly reducing youth unemployment is one of the G-20's most important commitments.Inclusiveness cannot stop at the borders of the G-20. We must work to ensure that the benefits of growth and prosperity are shared by people all over the world. In Antalya, we will discuss how we can align our efforts with the new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and increase our engagement with low-income, developing countries.As politics and economics are increasingly intertwined, the G-20 must also work together to confront our era's geopolitical challenges. This year is an important one in the fight against climate change. We must send a strong political message from Antalya in support of a successful outcome at the United Nations that takes place in Paris from November 30 to December 11.Meanwhile, we cannot afford to forget that global challenges - such as the war in Syria, terrorism, and the refugee crisis - require global responses. The G-20 is an ideal forum in which to address them.The Syrian civil war - now well into its fourth year - must be brought to an end, and a fair and sustainable political transition must be ensured. The conflict and the brutal state terrorism of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime is not only the cause of terrible suffering in Syria and the death of more than 360,000 people; it is also the root of the refugee crisis and the emergence of Daesh (the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant or ISIL) - a threat to all countries. Turkey is a member of the coalition against Daesh, and we are seeking to degrade and destroy this terrorist menace in our country and beyond our borders.Meanwhile, we must not allow ourselves to forget the plight of those fleeing the brutality of the Assad regime and Daesh. The international community that shuddered at the photograph of Alan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian toddler who was found dead on a Turkish beach, must be made to remember that many more like him are dying every day in the cold waters of the Mediterranean and the Aegean.Turkey is currently hosting some 2.2 million Syrian refugees, and we have spent more than $8.0 billion over the last three years caring for them. The international community must agree on a mechanism that ensures that the burden is fairly shared.Finally, it is important to note that Turkey continues to confront the threat of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), an organisation listed as a terrorist group by both the United States and the European Union (EU). Turkey has implemented a large number of reforms and made major investments to the benefit of our Kurdish citizens. And yet the PKK has refused to disarm, instead amassing weapons and attacking civilian and security targets across the country. As we continue to fight this terrorist organization, we call on all countries to reject terrorism in all of its forms.The G-20 Summit in Antalya will address these and other major issues confronting the world. Whether the subject is economics, finance, climate change, or politics, the guiding principle must be equality and justice for all.Recep Tayyip Erdogan is President of the Republic of Turkey.Project Syndicate, 2015.

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh91","No turning back in the global fight against climate change","April 26, 2016 Tuesday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, April 26 -- As people around the globe observe Earth Day today, world leaders are making history at the United Nations in New York. Over 100 countries will sign the Paris Agreement on climate change, representing their commitment to join it formally. This marks a turning point in the story of our planet and may set a record for the largest number of signers to an international agreement in a single day.Moreover, last month, President Obama announced with President Xi Jinping that our two countries will sign the Paris Agreement today and formally join this year.We are confident other countries will do so too, with the intention of bringing this historic and ambitious agreement into force as quickly as possible.A greener future is already in sight. Leaders of countries and cities are adapting and innovating away from fossil fuels and business owners are investing in a clean energy economy.The United States is moving forward in its commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions 26-28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025. We are doing this through the strongest fuel economy standards in our history, through our twenty-fold increase in solar generation since 2009, and through proposed rules on everything from energy conservation standards for appliances to reduction in emissions of methane-rich gas from municipal solid waste landfills.While we are taking significant climate action domestically, the United States is also focused on international cooperation to address this global challenge. Our $500 million contribution last month to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) - the first tranche of the $3 billion U.S. pledge to the GCF - will help developing countries reduce carbon emissions and prepare for climate impacts, while also advancing our commitment to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals - another major landmark agreement the world came together around last year.One of the most successful environmental agreements of all time is the Montreal Protocol, which is phasing out ozone depleting substances globally. It set the ozone layer on a path to recovery and prevented tens of millions of cases of skin cancer among other health, environmental, and economic benefits. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) - which replace many of the ozone-depleting substances - do not harm the ozone layer, but they are greenhouse gases that in some cases can be thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide.The United States is working with partners to adopt an HFC phase-down amendment to the Montreal Protocol this year that could avoid half a degree Celsius of warming by the end of the century.We also need international cooperation to change how we transport ourselves and goods. The aviation sector represents two percent of the world's total greenhouse gas emissions. The International Civil Aviation Organization is aiming to achieve carbon neutral growth for international aviation by 2020. The United States is committed to reaching an agreement on a global market-based measure that will help move the airl"
"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh92","Can the divestment movement tame climate change?","June 13, 2015 Saturday","Bangladesh Business News (BBN)","New York, June 13 -- An increasingly popular tool in the fight against climate change is emerging ""divestment"".The term refers to the shedding of stocks, bonds or other investments, in this case that are held in companies that produce or burn fossil fuels, reports BBC.As the world's leaders prepare for a make-or-break climate summit in November, will divestment change our relationship with fossil fuels and what might the dangers be, asks our social affairs reporter John McManus?It began with a campaign on US university campuses.Most scientists say that the burning of fuels like coal, gas and oil is the main driver of climate change, and that cutting back on them is inevitable.Yet the companies that locate and extract fossil fuels form part of a multi-billion dollar industry.The divestment strategy has two objectives.First, there's a financial imperative, where campaigners say withdrawing funds and support from energy companies makes it much harder for them to operate in the marketplace.Secondly, divestment can, to a certain extent, ""stigmatise"" certain industries, making them unpopular with wider society.The movement is growing.The latest institution to join is The Royal Australasian College of Physicians, which represents 21,000 medical practitioners. It's divesting about \£31.2m of fossil fuel interests from its \£345m endowment.A spokesperson said the college's reasoning was clear: ""Since the RACP is a health organisation with an objective of improving the health of our population, divestment is an important action that leads to reduced carbon outputs and achievement of our health objective - to ensure better health outcomes for our patients into the future.""Divestment is closely related to the concept of ""Carbon Risk"".Campaigners point out that fossil fuel reserves that haven't yet been extracted are thought to equal five times the amount of carbon that can be burnt if climate change is to be limited.BURN WHILE YOU CANYet oil, gas and coal producers are still factoring in the burning of those reserves when calculating their companies' financial worth.A recent report by Deutsche Bank pointed out that any deal on emissions at an upcoming November gathering of world leaders ""means accepting that the entirety of the world's known fossil fuel reserves cannot be extracted and burned"".The authors say that this means that oil producers will try to maximise the benefit from their product while they still can which is why the oil cartel Opec is refusing to cut production, even though prices remain low.Campaigners from that era credit divestment - and the effect it had on South Africa's economy - as one of the drivers that brought white politicians to the negotiating table, and resulted in the eventual collapse of the apartheid system.Even some of those who might be thought to be avid supporters of fossil fuel producers have come out in support of divestment.Sir Mark Moody Stuart, formerly of Shell and the mining company Anglo American, says it is ""rational"" because of the industry's lack of progress on climate change.GROWING DEMANDShell's current CEO, Ben van Beurden, has criticised divestment, though, most recently in February in a speech during International Petroleum Week, saying energy could make the difference between poverty and prosperity.They all have a right to energy, a right that should not be denied.""van Beurden also addressed concerns that some of Shell's untapped assets - unextracted oil, for example - would be rendered worthless, saying that future investments had already factored in the potential higher cost of carbon emissions.Other critics, such as John Gapper, a columnist for the Financial Times, have also pointed to flaws in the targeting of the divestment campaign.Why, he wrote, should energy producers like Exxon be vilified, while others such as Apple, which ""produces millions of electronic devices, escape?""Indeed, others have pointed out that campaigns against tobacco companies worked by persuading smokers to give up cigarettes - so shouldn't climate change groups work to make individuals give up or cut their personal energy consumption?There's also the fact that many people depend on fossil fuel companies for their livelihoods - whether as employees, or as the recipients of the pension funds invested in them.Some of those who've already divested from energy companies, or have promised to do so, include the $900bn sovereign wealth fund of Norway, which is selling shares in coal companies; the Church of England, which has also divested from coal and tar sands oil; and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, a charitable trust run by the heirs of John D Rockefeller, the famous oil baron.Smaller institutions are also involved, such as the London-based Frederick Mulder Foundation, which dispenses grants to combat poverty and climate change.The foundation's Eugenie Harvey says it has signed the ""Divest Pledge"", committing to using its funds to fight climate change. She denies, though, that campaigners want to immediately shut down oil or coal businesses.It doesn't mean those companies will go out of business. But it removes their social licence, in the same way South African businesses were boycotted during the apartheid era.It isolates, raises awareness, and condemns.""Not everyone agrees, however.Fiona Reynolds is managing director at Principles for Responsible Investment, an NGO founded by the former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan. It provides a platform for investors who want to integrate environmental and social concerns into their businesses.Reynolds says that despite the divestment campaign, the world will still be using fossil fuels for three or four decades while cleaner sources of energy come onl"
"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh93","The linkages between climate and conflict","December 2, 2015 Wednesday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Dec. 2 -- It is sheer coincidence that Paris was struck by terrorists on the eve of a key climate conference known as COP 21. To some, the attacks may appear like an unfortunate distraction in the face of efforts to meet a civilisational challenge like no other. Yet there are important cross-connections between security and climate concerns.Runaway climate change will impose growing stress on natural systems and human societies, and it could well usher in a whole new age of conflict. We live, after all, in a world marked by profound disparities in wealth, social and demographic pressures, unresolved grievances, and a seemingly endless supply of arms of all calibers. Far from being a separate concern, climate change is certain to intensify many existing challenges. More frequent and intense droughts, floods, and storms will likely play havoc with harvests and compromise food security. Extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and spreading disease vectors could undermine the economic viability and long-term habitability of some areas. The result could be escalating social discontent, mass displacement, and worse.In fact, such scenarios are no longer mere conjecture. Consider Syria. Several consecutive years of severe drought in the country's agricultural heartland had fateful consequences as underground water sources ran dry, livestock herds died, and farmland turned to desert. Close to three-quarters of farming households in Syria's northeast experienced total crop failure. Some 2-3 million people fell into extreme poverty. A number of factors are behind this calamity, including climate change, overexploitation of groundwater due to subsidies for water-thirsty crops like cotton and wheat, inefficient irrigation systems and overgrazing.The drought led to an exodus of perhaps as many as 1.5 million people from rural to urban areas. But Syria's cities were already under economic stress, in part because of the influx of refugees from neighbouring Iraq following the U.S. invasion of 2003. Growing numbers of destitute people found themselves in intense competition for scarce jobs and social services. Francesco Femia and Caitlin Werrell of the Center for Climate and Security point out that ""the role of disaffected rural communities in the Syrian opposition movement has been prominent compared to their equivalents in other 'Arab Spring' countries.""Of course, Syria's civil war is the product of several factors. Deep-seated popular discontent over decades of repressive rule, heightened by Assad's violent reaction to peaceful demonstrations, surely was a major driver. The rise of extremist groups financed and armed by the Gulf States was another. But this is the important point: the repercussions from environmental degradation do not occur in a void; they interact with a cauldron of societal pressures and unresolved political problems.Though the precise circumstances and dynamics will vary from place to place, Syria's experience illustrates the danger of major upheavals if environmental and resource pressures go unresolved. A recent scientific paper warns that due to climate change, some population centres in the Middle East ""are likely to experience temperature levels that are intolerable to humans"" by the end of this century. Elsewhere, melting glaciers, sea-level rise, highly variable rainfall, and parched farmland could have potentially dire consequences.Violence captures the headl"

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh98","Climate justice and the poor","March 13, 2016 Sunday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, March 13 -- Just two months ago, world leaders signed a historic climate agreement in Paris that raised hopes of a global shift away from fossil fuels and a future where vulnerable populations do not have to live in the shadow of environmental threats. For the first time in history, all countries agreed to play their part in keeping global temperature increases below 1.5degC, an essential step in protecting the livelihoods and the very existence of many populations living in areas highly vulnerable to climate change.But the lengthy and heated negotiations in Paris may turn out to have been the easy part. It is only when the spotlight turns away and leaders return home that we find out whether their commitments are real or merely a facade. Are politicians ready to confront vested interests and chart a new course of radical climate policies? Are we ready to move from talking about solidarity to acting in good faith with our fellow citizens, especially those facing the most immediate threats from climate change?Like those Britons who recently experienced severe flooding, Indians know the price of the world's failure to tackle climate change. Farming communities are increasingly vulnerable to heavy rainfall and floods that threaten to decimate their crops and their livelihoods. The risks loom large, threatening to unravel the slow but steady progress that countries like India are making in alleviating poverty and providing a dignified life for their citizens.Developing countries like India are well aware of their responsibilities to negotiate a cleaner path of growth and development. Indeed, the 'Paris effect' is already visible in many quarters, with China recently announcing a moratorium on new coal mine projects, and Vietnam also pledging a U-turn away from coal. But without serious commitments from other major emitters like the EU, these efforts will be in vain. The EU has a moral responsibility to show the same leadership in implementing the Paris agreement as it did in making the agreement possible. The climate crisis was not solved in Paris: the COP 21 was just one step in the right direction.Inspired by the Pope's courageous encyclical Laudato Si', faith leaders from around the world came together in advance of the COP 21 to call on world leaders to strike a truly transformational climate agreement putting the common good ahead of national interests and protecting the Earth - our common home - and all its inhabitants. Echoing Pope Francis' words, and supported by the Catholic networks CIDSE and Caritas Internationalis, we argued for a deal that limits global temperature increases to avoid catastrophic climatic impacts, especially on the most vulnerable communities. An agreement has now been signed, but faith leaders, civil society groups and many other proponents of climate action have no intention of turning our attention away.The EU faces the first real test of its resolve this Friday (4 March) as European environment ministers gather to discuss the implications of the COP 21 on the continent's policy decisions. Those ministers, and the heads of state present at the European Council summit two weeks later, can and must build on the momentum they helped create in Paris by recognising that a recalibration of the EU's climate goals is required in order to meet the commitment of keeping global temperature rises to 1.5degC. They must revisit the EU's climate and energy policies and commit to going beyond the 40% cuts in domestic greenhouse gas emissions to which they have previously agreed. Commissioner Canete's desire to raise the EU's energy efficiency target above 30% and his willingness to explore the possibilities of boosting the bloc's 2050 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target to 90-95% are to be welcomed, but must be committed to in no uncertain terms by heads of state themselves in March.Ambitious and fair financial and fiscal pathways are also key for the EU to go beyond its existing commitments and guarantee climate justice for developing countries. Raising additional international public climate finance for adaptation and renewable energy sources in countries like India and phasing out EU fossil fuel subsidies should be considered a priority. Remembering that it will have to present its progress on an international scale at the global stock-take foreseen for 2018 at the COP 21, the EU must ratify the Paris Agreement as soon as possible and show that the period leading up to 2020 is a live and urgent political window for action.I hope that the visionary words of Pope Francis in Laudato Si' continue to guide European climate policies, inspiring political action to protect the citizens of the world whose future is most threatened by climate change. Through its pledges in Paris, the EU has given the world's most vulnerable people hope; now, Europe must fulfill its moral responsibility and make the words of the Paris text meaningful.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh107","Who is afraid of climate change?","December 10, 2015 Thursday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Dec. 10 -- As European negotiators gather in Paris to attempt to hammer out a deal at the COP21 climate change summit, they have strong support (87 percent) from the European public to sign an accord that will limit national greenhouse gas emissions.This figure includes support from 91 percent of Spaniards, 89 percent of Italians and even 63 percent of Poles. By comparison, 83 percent of the Japanese, 71 percent of the Chinese and 69 percent of Americans back an accord at COP21.But Europeans do differ in their assessments of the severity of the issue and their level of concern for global climate change trails behind poorer nations'. On the politically charged issue of whether rich countries should do more to mitigate the effects of climate change than developing nations, Europeans show themselves far more willing than the Americans and the Japanese to place the burden on wealthy nations.According to a recent Pew Research Center survey that polled more than 45,000 people in 40 countries, a global median of 54 percent think climate change is a very serious problem. In Europe, an equal proportion agreed, although the British (41 percent) and the Poles (19 percent) are substantially less concerned. According to our research, Poles are among the least concerned about global warming.European concern about climate change is greater than in the U.S., where 45 percent see it as a very serious problem, and in China, where only 18 percent express a similar level of concern. But Europeans are far from the most worried around the world: 74 percent of Latin Americans and 61 percent of Africans polled expressed intense concern about global warming.Europeans' commitment to tackling global warming is also personal. Strong majorities across the EU countries surveyed said they would consider major changes in the way they live as a means of dealing with the effects of climate change. More than 83 percent in France, 77 percent in Spain, 75 percent in Germany, 70 percent in Italy, and 67 percent in the U.K. agree that they'll have to change their lifestyle. The Poles, at 49 percent, are less sure changes to lifestyle are key to combatting climate change. This compares with 66 percent of Americans, 58 percent of Chinese and 53 percent of Japanese who acknowledge that people will have to adapt.The question of who should ramp up their efforts to deal with global warming will likely prove as contentious an issue in Paris as it was at the 2009 U.N. Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen. ""We hope advanced nations will assume ambitious targets and pursue them as they have the most room for impact,"" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi told delegates in Paris.A median of 56 percent in Europe agree. They say rich countries - such as Japan, Germany and the U.S. - should shoulder more of the burden than developing nations because they are responsible for most of the CO2 currently in the atmosphere. Support for this view is strongest in Poland (61 percent), where many respondents were likely influenced by the fact that Poland is not a rich nation, while next-door neighbor Germany is. The lowest support is in the U.K., where only 49 percent agree that the rich should do more to fight climate change than developing nations.On this issue, Europeans differ with their Japanese and American counterparts, both of whom tilt toward saying they want developing nations to rise to the occasion as well. This could yet prove a problem in the negotiations.In a number of key countries involved in the Paris negotiations, the young are far more supportive of rich countries taking on a greater role in dealing with climate change. In the U.S., young Americans (51 percent) are far more likely to hold this position than older Americans (34 percent). A similar generation gap exists in Japan (45 percent to 31 percent) and in Australia (55 percent to 45 percent).In Germany and France, the trend is reversed. There, the older generation (65 percent in Germany, 60 percent in France) is much more likely to support the idea that rich nations should lead the fight against climate change than the younger generation (47 percent in Germany, and 44 percent in France). German and French officials believe this may reflect a particularly internationally minded consciousness common in the generation that grew up in the '60s and '70s, and not as prevalent in among younger countrymen.Whether the nations assembled in Paris will be able to reach an agreement on a climate change deal is not yet clear. But we do know that European negotiators have the public support to do so. Most European publics are willing to see rich nations do more than developing countries, which could ease agreement with nations from Africa, Asia and Latin America. Whether this will be sufficient to bridge differences between European and American and Japanese points of view remains to be seen.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh108","P-21 hullabaloo: Little commensurate action beckons","December 21, 2015 Monday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Dec. 21 -- COP-21, or the twenty-first Conference of Parties on Climate Change, in Paris, 2015, successfully brought 195 countries to sign a ""watershed"" agreement but concrete carbon-cutting commitments remain as evasive as ever. With 55 ratifications needed, which countries get there first, how much of the world's carbon emission they account for, and whether President Barack Obama's contention that the deal was ""the best chance we have to save the one planet we got,"" remain enigmatic.BBC New's Justin Rowlatt wryly described this agreement as ""an exercise in applied etymology."" Even with notable features, past performances may ultimately shed more light on future pathways of the Paris agreement than pledges and promises.Before examining that proposition, a word or two about the subject. Carbon stems from four greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and sulphur hexaflouride), hydrofluorcarbons (HFCs) and perfluorcarbons (PFCs). While chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were treated by the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, they haunt contemporary conferences. Emitted carbon typically stays in the atmosphere for about a century. They can be cleared by deforestation or new carbon-sucking technologies.Since the first U.N. climate change conference convened in 1995, the baton of the leading carbon-emitting country has passed from the United States to China. Both countries magnify the complications of environmental cleansing efforts: China echoes sentiments of many emerging countries (ECs) that environmental safeguards require rapid development, and the United States symbolises the approach of developed countries (DCs) that creating jobs and sustaining growth pave the way for environmental protection, increasingly so under competition.Buried in indifference has been the outcome of COP-3, the December 1997 Kyoto Protocol (positing that global warming is taking place, caused no less by human-triggered carbon emissions). Implemented from February 2005, of the 192 original high-contracting parties, only 37 undertook the ""second commitment"" in 2012 (the so-called Doha Amendment). Though that number increased to 55, ratification requires 144. Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Russia and the United States exemplify DC (Development Charges) exemptions, while Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine retain the option to withdraw. China, India and the United States simply opposed ratifying any carbon-reducing treaty.A broader history from the 1930s and 1940s confirms that carbon emission expanded at least five-fold, from about 7 gigatonnes to about 37 now. A far broader history shows how the 2 or 3 gigatonnes carbon emitted annually across the globe when the Industrial Revolution began in the 1770s/1780s have multiplied by 12-18 times. Other industrial ailments, like child and women labour, labour rights and principles, working conditions, monopolistic behaviour, and profiteering, show how effective controls evolve from protracted contestations, rather than wishes and provision-making, to become acceptable standards. Environmentalists must learn from that.True, the damage to Planet Earth by these other industrial ailments does not compare to carbon-emission, but industrialised countries paying US$ 100 billion annually to their less-well-off counterparts comes across as either a ""penalty"" imposed by less developed countries (LDCs) upon industrialised countries for carbonising the planet, or a ""bribe"" they make for LDC carbon-control collaboration.Regardless, a successful COP-21 agenda must cultivate a carbon-control mind-set to replace ""nationally determined contributions.""

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh116","Turning tables: Growing support against corporate capture of climate policy-making","June 14, 2015 Sunday","Weekly Blitz","Dhaka, June 14 -- In the final days of the Bonn Climate Change Conference of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Corporate Accountability International delivered a resounding call to the governments who have ratified the UNFCCC: protect the treaty and climate policymaking from the undue influence of the globe's biggest polluters. The call endorsed by over 224,000 sends a strong message to kick big polluters out of climate policy.The call comes as record droughts and rainfall as well as relentless heatwaves claim lives around the globe and some of the world's biggest polluters attempt to co-opt the treaty process and influence negotiating outcomes. The meeting in Bonn, concluding June 11, is one of the last formal meetings of the governments that have ratified the UNFCCC before their next full Conference in Paris (formally called Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC or COP-21) -largely regarded as a make-or-break moment for the agreement.""Why would you let the professional arsonist join the volunteer fire department?"" said Bill McKibben, author and co-founder of 350.org, ""These are the guys who want to keep the problem going, not solve it.""From aggressive lobbying of national governments to bankrolling of international meetings, the fossil fuel industry interferes at all levels. Industry co-optation of treaty meetings has been a growing problem and a primary obstacle to progress. At the 19th Conference of the Parties (COP) in Warsaw, corporations with a direct conflict of interest in the treaty's success not only sponsored the talks, they were given preferential access to delegates.In May, it was revealed that COP 21 in Paris may be yet another ""Corporate COP"" with the announcement of EDF and Suez Environnement as lead sponsors. Suez Environnement, infamous for its dealings in water privatization, is partially owned by ENGIE, formerly GDF Suez, which profits from fracking operations around the world, putting it at direct odds with the advancement of the treaty. ENGIE and EDF's coal operations contribute to nearly 50% of France's emissions.The cozy relationship between polluters and the UNFCCC has become increasingly institutionalized. The Lima-Paris Action Agenda (LPAA), a joint project of the incoming and outgoing COP presidents, the Office of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the UNFCCC Secretariat, encourages direct engagement with non-state actors-primarily identified as sub-national governments and corporations-as stakeholders in the policymaking process.""The fossil fuel industry is not a partner in the solution-it is the driver of the crisis. Giving big polluters a seat at the table glosses over the glaring conflict of interest fossil fuel corporations have in a real solution to climate change,"" said John Stewart, deputy campaign director at Corporate Accountability International. ""Inviting gas, oil and coal corporations to shape climate policy is akin to looking to Big Tobacco to shape public health policy.""""It's time for the politicians to listen to the people and not the polluters. The fossil fuel industry continues to be the main obstacle in addressing the climate crisis, whether by corrupting the political process or by attempting to derail the ongoing transformation away from fossil fuel dependence. The only place for them in the UN process is outside of it. These negotiations must put the needs of vulnerable people and the planet centre-stage, not the profits of dirty energy corporations"" said Jamie Henn, 350.org Strategy and Communications Director.It is important to note that as the climate policy-making processes move forward, there are other processes too moving ahead which may help address corporate capture of development justice agenda! For example, civil society consultations are being held globally to help shape a possible global binding treaty on business and human rights. Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development (APWLD) along with International Network for Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ESCR-Net) had organized the Asia Pacific consultation for such a global binding treaty in early May 2015, in which Citizen News Service (CNS) was represented. In June 2014, the UN Human Rights Council adopted a resolution to elaborate a binding instrument ""to regulate, in international human rights law, the activities of transnational corporations and other business enterprises"". This provides another critical opportunity to advance corporate accountability.All is not that dark! There is a legal precedent of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) where governments came together to kick Big Tobacco out of health policy-making! Ten years ago, Corporate Accountability International and its global network of civil society organizations secured a powerful international legal precedent when it led the charge to successfully kick the tobacco industry out of treaty talks at the World Health Organization negotiations of the FCTC. The success of the FCTC has enabled meaningful public health regulation that is unencumbered by industry profit motives and protects 90 percent of the world's population from one of the most deadly industries on the planet.Let us hope that Paris COP-21 meeting will also adapt measures to firewall climate policy-making from industry interference.Published by HT Syndication with permission from Weekly Blitz .

As ice in these regions melts, it affects the ocean height, temperature, and circulation - which, in turn, gradually changes earth's climate. Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world due to climate change. Besides its major problems of poverty and illiteracy, Bangladesh's vulnerability to climate change is very alarming. The overall economic development of the country has been troubled to a considerable extent by the adverse affects of climate change.Among the major impacts of the climate change - particularly of the global warming - the increasing rise in sea-levels every year has been the most alarming one so far, with the possibility of submerging 6-8 per cent of 'flood-prone' Bangladesh under water by 2030 (a prediction made by the UK Department for International Development in 2007). The major cause behind the rise in sea-level is the melting of ice of different regions, mostly of the south and north poles.GLOBAL WARMING: The global warming is one of the major incentives for climate change. It is a global phenomenon causing much damage to the resources of the globe, making life of the living beings, including human, miserable. Global warming has caused the weather of different regions to change drastically and disproportionately. Ice is melting rapidly in the ice-covered regions because of this global warming. Melting of ice, without any doubt, causes the sea-levels to rise. The effects of the continuation of the rise in sea-levels are deep. It would submerge many areas around the globe, especially the coastal ones; and perhaps it will not take decades for the coastl"

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh119","Economics of climate change","November 29, 2015 Sunday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Nov. 29 -- The twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) and the eleventh session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP) will take place from November 30 to December 11, 2015, in Paris, France. It is expected that countries will reach a global agreement on climate change in order to keep the global temperature below 2 C by the turn of the century in 2100. Will there be an agreement? - is still a million dollar question for us who are eagerly waiting to see a happy ending of this saga.Climate change has, by now, become a familiar household term among many people in Bangladesh as well as in many countries of the world. Changes in temperature in different seasons, as well as changes in rainfall during monsoon months are now synonymous with climate change for many people around the world. Ahead of the meeting, global media are producing reports on consequences of climate change. According to a CNN report more than 11,000 forest fires erupted in Brazilian Amazon this year due to draught, about 47 per cent rise from last year. The report claimed that these are linked to global warming. New York Times reported the same in October of this year.According to Christiana Figueres, Executive Secretary of UNFCCC, ""The Paris UN Climate Conference represents an historic opportunity to put the world on course to meet the climate change challenge. The world needs a new model of growth that is safe, durable and beneficial to all. COP21 seeks to deliver a clear pathway with short- and long-term milestones, and a system to help us measure and increase progress over time until we get the job done. The Paris Agreement is not only possible, it is necessary and urgent. We are counting on everyone's contribution"".In general, climate change phenomenon is linked to rising temperature of the earth's surface. This issue was first reported by scientists, mainly Physicists, in the 1980s. Since that time, many researchers developed climate models to understand the reasons behind it. By the end of the 80s, they identified a clear culprit. It was use of fossil fuel, which contributed to rise in the deposit of CO2 in the upper atmosphere causing a 'glass-like shell' around the earth. This acts as a shield and traps the radiated temperature from going out. Gradually it causes a rise in temperature. This result in changes in precipitation, melts the ices in the glaciers, and hence causes sea level rise, variation in global weather patterns and changes in the frequencies of extreme weather events. According to many scientists, it will cause flooding, prolonged inundation of flood plains, intrusion of sal"
"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh120","Biofuels must be part of the transport sector's decarbonisation plan","January 20, 2016 Wednesday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Jan. 20 -- After the dust of the in Paris has settled it now is time for action. The implementation of the European Union 2030 Climate and Energy Package will be a litmus test to see whether Paris really stands for a substantial change towards a low carbon EU policy. Until now, no binding contribution is foreseen for the traffic sector. Without appropriate EU regulation, the decarbonisation of the sector would stop after 2020 at worst. The Renewable Energy Directive (RED) and the Fuel Quality Directive (FQD) that set mandatory targets for 2020 will be revised in 2016 for the subsequent time. The urgency to set ambitious goals is obvious, as 30% of the energy demand and approximately 25% of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the EU come from aviation, shipping and road traffic. Although their contribution to replace fossil fuels is limited, biodiesel and bioethanol will have to play an important role in reducing GHG emissions in the short and medium term, and maybe beyond.Biodiesel and bioethanol reduce GHG emissions by more than 60% compared to fossil fuels today, depending on the feedstock and the production process. According to European legislation, biofuels must be produced in a sustainable way. This means that no rainforests can be destroyed in order to produce feedstock for biodiesel or bioethanol. Auditors are controlling farmers and biofuels producers worldwide to ensure that these laws are obeyed. Still there are strong reservations towards the use of biofuels. That is why many are hoping for e-mobility as an alternative. The COP21 in Paris saw some very promising initiatives for the transport sector such as the Paris Declaration on Electro-Mobility and Climate Change. While e-mobility will be an alternative for passenger cars and light duty vehicles in the future, it can clearly only reduce emissions if the power used comes from renewable sources. But as long as there are not enough charging facilities available, as long as batteries are still expensive and their charging speed is slow, e-mobility has a problem in consumer acceptance. The power stored in 1kg of battery is approximately 60 times lower than in 1kg of fuel. As a consequence e-mobility will not play a role in heavy duty transportation in the short and medium term. In that sense biofuels and e-mobility are natural partners: a perfect liaison for renewable energy and decarbonisation in road traffic with biofuels preferably used in range extenders and heavy duty vehicles for road transport.Critics say that the GHG balance of biofuels is not complete as it does not contain the emissions caused by indirect land use change (iLUC). According to the proponents of the iLUC-theory, the GHG balance of biofuels can even be negative if effects from the logging of rainforests are included into the calculation.But stopping the use of biofuels would not prevent the clearing of rainforests, while at the same time the only existing alternative to fossil fuels would be banned - a missed opportunity because of a dubious theory.Indirect effects on the use of land cannot be seen or measured, therefore they must be modelled. Depending on the model used, values for iLUC vary immensely according to the existing scientific literature. iLUC factors can be either some 200% below or some 1700% above the fossil fuels value. The uncertainty range for iLUC factors is even larger than the substantial differences between the data of all types of food from lentils via tomatoes, cheese and even chicken to beef and lamb. It is not only about the size of the numbers, it is even unclear whether the iLUC effect of certain biofuels is positive or negative.In order to tackle the problem of land use change two measures should be taken: the EU should prohibit the use of crops from areas were rainforest has been cut down - irrespective of the later use of the feedstock; and it should expand the application of sustainability criteria that are in place for biofuels to other users of agricultural commodities. That way the use of palm oil from land formerly covered with rainforest would not only be forbidden for producing biofuels but also for food and chemicals. Other opponents of the European biofuel policy claim that if agricultural commodities are used to produce fuel prices for food rise, causing hunger.The organisations arguing this way are the same that used to call for higher prices in the 1980s and 1990s, stating that low crop prices were destroying local markets and were hindering investment in the agricultural sectors of developing countries. There are many reasons for hunger in the world which existed long before biofuels became an issue.Wars and civil wars, poverty, corruption and extreme weather conditions are among them, but not biofuels. While biodiesel and bioethanol production could influence prices on global commodity markets, the price transmission into local markets in developing countries is very limited. So even if biofuels had the effect on global market prices that critics claim, this does not mean that their influence on prices at a local level is relevant. While the production of biodiesel and bioethanol has risen throughout the last years, the food price index calculated by the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) has decl"

The regular natural hazards that already batter the country - tropical cyclones, river erosion, flood, landslides and drought - are all set to intensify and the frequency may be increased as a result of climate change. Rising sea levels will inundate Bangladesh's coast, and dramatic coastal and river erosion will destroy land and homes.These alongwith other adverse effects of climate change will have deeper repercussions for the economy and development of the country. One of the most dramatic impacts will be the forced movement of people from one place to another throughout Bangladesh as a result of losing their homes, lands, property and livelihoods to the effects of climate change. While it is impossible to predict with accuracy how many people will be displaced by climate change, the best current estimates state that rising sea levels alone will displace 18 million Bangladeshis within the next 40 years.The vast majority of these people will be displaced domestically - not across international borders - presenting the government with enormous challenges, particularly when it comes to finding places to live in and work for those who have been displaced.World leaders will again gather in Paris on April 22 next to sign the historic climate agreement, which was adopted in Paris in last December at the summit level conference in Paris. The summit was attended by 196 parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change at COP21. The agreement is a legal and binding document and on the opening of the signing ceremony 130 countries including the world's two most powerful countries - China and the USA - would put their signature, the UN source said. Both China and the USA have been accused for high level carbon emission. They until December last did not agree to have a legally binding agreement to reduce the carbon emission. Both China and the USA have been the victim of natural disaster like cyclone-hurricane, earthquake, flood etc, which encouraged both the countries to change their tough stance against the legal and binding documents. China refused to sign the carbon reduction document on the plea that it will hit its development programme. On the other hand, the USA's plea was that the carbon reduction document would affect the comfort of its citizens. Both China and the USA are heavily dependent on the coal-fired electricity.UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon would host the signing ceremony and the UN source has indicated that over 60 heads of government will attend the ceremony.

Laying emphasis on financial assistance instead of receiving credit, they also urged that the delegates who would be attending the UN Climate Conference in Paris (COP21) in December to play an effective role to ensure the financial assistance [compensation] for the country.They made the above observations at a roundtable conference, organised by Network on Climate Change Bangladesh, held at the PKSF auditorium in the city chaired by NCCB Chairman Kazi Wahiduzzaman. Chairman of PKSF Dr Qazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmad attended the conference as the chief guest while the keynote paper was presented by NCCB coordinator Mizanur Rahman Bijoy.""Now some people are talking about getting credit for chasing climate change impact. But it is not acceptable to take loan for tackling adverse impact of climate change. Instead, we have to fight tough to get compensation as Bangladesh is one of the most climate affected countries around the world,"" said Dr Kholiquzzaman.He said, ""It is a long-standing process to recover compensation. So, we will have to continue talks apart from taking effective steps in this regard.""In the conference, the speakers also said that the 'developed nations' are solely responsible for the climate change. They have already admitted the responsibility. But they are playing dilly-dally role in playing compensations to the less developed countries.And so, the less developed countries must be united to compel them [developed nations] to sign an agreement in this regard. Once the agreement is signed, then it will be easy for us [less developed countries] to fight for compensation for climate impact in the future. In this circumstance, Bangladesh will have to play the role of a leader of the affected countries [in the climate change], the speakers said.Indications are clear that after more than 20 years of negotiations among more than 190 countries, the UN climate conference in Paris will be a turning point in the fight against climate change.

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh131","Global warming, actors and victims","December 5, 2015 Saturday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Dec. 5 -- The ocean covering more than two-thirds of our planet functions as a ""climate integrator"", moderating climate change in two ways. It absorbs most of the heat that accumulates in the atmosphere: it has absorbed 93% of the excess heat from the increased greenhouse effect (1), at the cost of rises in ocean temperature and sea level, largely due to thermal expansion and the melting of the Greenland ice cap. It also captures much of the carbon emissions generated by human activity (28% since 1750), at the cost of acidification (see graphic, page IV).This climate regulating function therefore comes at a cost, since the ocean deteriorates as it mitigates climate change. The changes in the ocean's fundamental physics and chemistry, though less spectacular than the rise in sea level, have a considerable impact on marine ecosystems, and consequently on humanity. Ocean warming and acidification impede the calcification process vital to some marine organisms (corals, shellfish); many coral reefs are being bleached by the destruction of their symbiosis with zooxanthellae (algae); phytoplankton is declining in warmer waters; the fish food chain is being disturbed; some species can migrate to cooler waters, but not all.Despite the ocean's critical role in providing food security for hundreds of millions of people around the world, international climate negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have given it minimal attention. To fill this gap, a number of researchers (2) taking part in the Oceans 2015 Initiative (3) decided to provide the negotiators at the Paris climate conference (COP 21) with a synthesis of past changes and changes projected to occur by the end of the century, and of the consequences for marine ecosystems and the services they provide. Two contrasting greenhouse gas emissions scenarios were considered: a continuation of the present rising trend (business-as-usual) and, more optimistically, a fall that would keep the global temperature increase to less than 2degC in the 21st century.Apart from strict limitation of carbon emissions, the international community needs to protect marine and coastal ecosystems, restore those that have already been damaged, and enable societies that depend on marine resources to adapt to change. A number of approaches are being tested at local level, but the further we move away from the 2degC target, and the warmer and more acidified the ocean becomes, the less room there is for manoeuvre. For example, the further coral reefs deteriorate, the more vulnerable they will become and the harder it will be to save them. Some approaches are antagonistic: solar radiation management aims to limit global warming by increasing the amount of heat reflected back into space. This could undermine efforts to reduce carbon emissions and would do nothing to remedy ocean acidification.Four key messages emerge from the Oceans 2015 Initiative's analysis. First, the ocean strongly influences the climate system and provides important services to humans. Second, the deterioration of marine and coastal ecosystems is already detectable and is certain to worsen, even under the optimistic scenario where global carbon emissions fall - especially as, no matter what happens, the damage to the ocean will occur across all latitudes, making this a global concern. Third, an immediate and substantial reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide (CO2), is vital to prevent irreversible impacts on ocean ecosystems; any treaty that did not make it possible to limit global warming to 2degC would have disastrous consequences. Finally, the higher atmospheric CO2 rises, the fewer the options for protecting the ocean and restoring its ecosystems.The Oceans 2015 Initiative, noting that the ocean has received minimal attention at previous climate conferences, pleads for a radical change of perspective: COP 21 must take the necessary action and propose a new, less destructive plan for civilisation. The future condition of the ocean depends on the amount of carbon emitted in the coming decades. The more stringent, optimistic scenario allows less than one-sixth of the emissions expected by the end of the 21st century under the pessimistic scenario, without regulation. In fact, carbon emissions will need to be even lower since the ocean's capacity to absorb will decl"

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh135","Why recycling must be on the agenda of COP22","April 14, 2016 Thursday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, April 14 -- As the dust settles and the euphoria fades, trumpeted international accords often tend to look flawed or inadequate. This should not be the case of the COP21 deal struck in Paris in mid-December, for all the inevitable critical post-mortems.That nearly 200 countries with diverse agendas concluded two decades of wrangling by signing a global agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions and avoid the most noxious effects of climate change is an extraordinary feat. In essence, this historic and ambitious deal struck by most of the world's nations signals the end of fossil fuels.As well as agreeing to try to curb global warming to below a better-than-expected 2C, countries committed to a new goal to reach net zero emissions between 2050 and 2100 and to a review period every five years. Significantly, rich nations pledged to raise $100bn (&#163;66bn) a year by 2020 to help poor countries transform their economies.Rather than focusing on the agreement's perceived shortcomings, we should therefore celebrate it for what it is: a massive step in the fight against climate change.That is not to say that we should stop there. Those serious about tackling climate change should also start recognising the huge untapped potential of recycling as a green partner. A low carbon industry, recycling is currently reducing greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 700 million tonnes per year (a BIR-conducted study actually confirms CO2 savings of 572 million tonnes for ferrous, copper, aluminium and paper alone). In concrete terms, this is more than the entire aviation industry generates in a year and would therefore offset the pollution of that sector.Some regions, particularly Europe, are taking the lead by setting ambitious recycling targets and putting the right framework in place to make recycling an indispensable part of our societies and economies. However, in other parts of the world, namely Africa and Asia, recycling is less entrenched in everyday life, and much work remains to be done, particularly in terms of education and boosting free and fair trade. Otherwise, the very real danger is that CO2 emissions will increase together with the population of these areas.This time bomb is bigger than one or two continents can defuse alone: a global approach required. The circular economy is a viable economic model, but should not be limited to Europe. If we are to see meaningful benefits for the environment, the circular economy needs to be adopted on a global scale.At the Bureau of International Recycling, we also strongly advocate strengthening the impact of the Paris deal by formulating binding rules that would oblige countries receiving aid to earmark a portion of that funding for recycling projects.Recycling is simply too vital a part of the war on climate change not to feature on the agenda of the next round of international talks - COP22 - open in Morocco in November 2016.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh138","Universal, legally binding climate deal","December 14, 2015 Monday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Dec. 14 -- At a time when people the world over kept their fingers crossed, the climate conference at Paris known as the COP21 (the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) broke the happy news. Sixteen hours after the scheduled closing, the intense negotiations have succeeded to strike a climate deal. Divergence of opinions at times gave the impression that the conference would conclude without reaching an acceptable agreement but all the nations (195 in total) have nodded in favour of the historic climate agreement. It is historic because none of the previous conferences including the Kyoto and Rio meets on climate ever could bring the nations closer to unanimously sign a deal on an issue considered most important for survival of human beings on the planet Earth.Against the rising global warming, the most contentious issue was to contain the temperature rise within 2 degree centigrade (2C) above the pre-industrial level. This demanded voluntary cut on carbon emissions. Since fossil fuels still prove convenient and even cheaper for generation of energy and power in order to run automobiles and industries, the challenge of shifting to other sources for the purpose is daunting. Both developed and developing nations have put forward their arguments in favour of fossil fuels. So far the green technologies are yet to be an adequate alternative to those. It is because of this the advanced countries with enormous consumption of power/energy have refused to let go the advantage. On the other hand, developing countries like China and India at a crucial stage of development have argued for enjoying the facility for some more years before they caught up with the leading industrial nations.No wonder, the United States of America, China and India are the top polluters of environment. But happily all three and Brazil, another high polluter, have endorsed the agreement. Credit certainly goes to French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius who patiently and adroitly led the arduous negotiations beyond the scheduled time. Thus the first universal legally binding climate deal comes into being. In previous negotiations the 2C rise above the pre-industrial global temperature proved unachievable. Now the benchmark for 1.5C is set for all to work towards achieving. This surely is a major achievement.How the world leaders propose to achieve the goal is very important. For a start, the agreement is categorical that $100 billion will be raised a year by 2020 in order to help the poor nations reshape their economies and accept a new goal of net zero emission by later this century. Measures will be directed towards an accelerated phase-out of fossil fuels and growth of renewable energy. These will further be complemented with effective and strong carbon market in order to enable countries to trade in emissions and protect forests. By the look of it the climate deal looks very ambitious and promising too. Much will depend on how the rich nations go by their promises. Earlier, their actions did not match with their promises. Now that the agreement is otherwise legally binding, things are likely to be different. Against the capricious behaviour of Nature in recent time, the deal may be an outcome of humbling lessons.Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Also, mitigating and adapting to a changing climate are key to most of the other goals including ending poverty, achieving food and water security, providing access to energy, and building sustainable cities.Later this year, at the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change () in Paris, the international community is expected to finalize a new global climate agreement and the way to finance it.For example, ADB will seek to mobilize concessional financing from the Green Climate Fund, which is becoming operational, for ADB's adaptation projects in poorer countries. ADB will tap institutional investment through private equity funds like the ADB-sponsored Asia Climate Partners. ADB will also issue more green bonds as an important source of funding for its climate operations.Mr. Nakao stressed the importance of technology in tackling climate change, and said that ADB will adjust its procurement systems in order to facilitate the integration of cleaner and more advanced technology into its projects. ADB will also strengthen partnerships with centers of excellence across the world to provide its member countries with cutting-edge knowledge and expertise on climate change.ADB, based in Manila, is dedicated to reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh144","Debate centering climate migration","March 31, 2016 Thursday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, March 31 -- Visceral, heart-rending images of war lend urgency to policy debates about whether and how to accommodate - or not - people driven from their homes, communities and countries. But more people are displaced by climate-related events than conflict, and international agreements have so far said little about the likely surge of people who will uproot themselves and their families as climate change impacts intensify.As global average temperatures creep higher, and as storms, droughts, floods, and heat waves grow more severe, the international community is poised to face a future characterized by even more climate-related migration.Some people will move in anticipation of climate change impacts; some will move in response to changes they have already experienced. If the status quo persists, many of these ""climate migrants"" will likely wonder why their rights are not better protected by international laws and norms. A number of efforts are currently underway to change that status quo.Since 2008, 22.5 million people have been forced from their homes due to floods and hurricanes, twice as many as the record 11 million displaced by conflict in 2014. That amounts to one person every second, according to Jan Egeland, director general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, who spoke at a briefing during the 21st Conference of Parties in Paris last year. Ninety percent of climate migrants move to or within developing countries, Egeland noted. And climate-related mobility is trending upwards. We are living in ""the era of forced displacement,"" Egeland said.Some of the drivers, such as drought and desertification, are ""creeping"" disasters, which can take years or decades to make a place unlivable. Faced with deteriorating landscapes, people seek better opportunities elsewhere, and many of these migrants go uncounted.""Many times I ask myself, how come everybody knows how bad Syria and all of these wars are for displacement, and few people understand twice as many are displaced by climate and weather,"" Egeland said in Paris.And yet while refugees fleeing conflict or persecution find legal protection in the 1951 United Nations convention that established their right to seek asylum, there is no international framework to protect the rights of people displaced by climate change-related weather events, or those who choose to migrate because climate change is staring at them in the face and promising a more difficult future.For those who think such a framework ought to exist, the Paris climate agreement forged at COP21 last year offers some reason for optimism. The agreement includes two references to human mobility. In its preamble the Paris agreement implores states to ""respect, promote and consider"" the rights of migrants, among other vulnerable groups, when taking action to address climate change.And the agreement calls for the Executive Committee of the Warsaw International Mechanism - a body created in 2013 to address ""loss and damage"" caused by climate change impacts - to establish a new task force ""to develop recommendations for integrated approaches to avert, minimize and address displacement related to the adverse impacts of climate change.""The Paris agreement is not the first United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change document to discuss the link between climate change and displacement, but it is the first agreement with so much international buy-in to do so, said Mariam Traore Chazalnoel, an environmental migration expert with the International Organization for Migration.In February the Warsaw International Mechanism Executive Committee - or ExComm - met and worked over four days to create the displacement task force and advance discussions on human mobility and climate change, as directed by the Paris agreement.The takeaway from Paris and from this most recent ExComm meeting, Chazalnoel said, is that ""this is a very bureaucratic process."" But, she added, ""the issue is firmly on their radar. They will work on it over the next few years, and this is a big difference from what happened a few years ago where we had to fight to bring the question of climate displaced persons to the negotiations.""Parties to the COP21 treaty understand that they must do something to prepare for and address climate-displacement, ""but what that something is, is not exactly clear,"" Chazalnoel said. The legal protection gap is not unique to climate migrants. Migrants, in general, lack an integrated convention or internationally negotiated document that spells out their rights. Instead, these rights appear in ""a disparate system of different norms,"" some of them established by labor bodies, others by human rights groups, according to Laura Thompson, the IOM's deputy director general.Devex speaks with Ambassador Laura Thompson, deputy director general of the International Organization for Migration, about efforts underway to integrate a ""disparate"" assortment of migrants' rights protections.But climate-related migration and displacement, which will almost surely accelerate, presents a particular international policy challenge, because the people who relocate because of climate change impacts are usually not the same people whose activities contribute to those impacts. There are sticky issues of liability and compensation at play in these discussions, which the Paris agreement largely avoided in order to stay alive.The Syrian refugee crisis has revealed the political sensitivity and difficulty of building consensus around coordinated migration policy. But that does not mean national governments and international bodies are without options to improve current policy and implementation, the IOM experts pointed out.Legal frameworks already on the books - the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, for example - could be invoked more purposefully as a basel"

Since then, Bangladesh and Japan have been enjoying very cordial relations. Both countries have also developed bonds of mutual understanding and friendship.Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina visited Japan on May 25-28, 2014 while Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Dhaka on September 6-7, the same year that apparently took the relations between the two countries to new heights.By the time Dhaka Courier will hit the stands on Friday, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will remain busy in Japan in further strengthening her government's ties with old friend Japan and others in the G7, or Group of 7, a club of rich countries consisting of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, currently chair of the G7, formally invited his Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina on April 8 to attend the outreach meeting of G7.Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina left here on Thursday morning for Nagoya, Japan on a four-day official visit to attend the G7 Outreach programme where she will take leadership role in four basic subjects. The four areas are related to health, women empowerment, sustainable development goals and cooperation for advanced infrastructure building.The prime minister has been requested to play leadership role in these four basic subjects at the G7 Outreach programme to be held in Ise Shima. Bangladesh Foreign Minister AH Mahmood Ali described the prime minister's participation in the G7 Outreach Programme as a reflection of world leaders' confidence in her leadership.He hoped that the relations between Bangladesh and Japan will get fresh boost through cooperation in infrastructure development, trade and investment and technological cooperation between the two countries through the visit.Sheikh Hasina was scheduled to deliver her speech at the G7 Outreach Program at Shima Kanko Hotel on Friday. She will deliver another speech at a working lunch with the G7 outreach leaders. The prime minister will have a meeting with her British counterpart David Cameron on the same day. On Saturday, she will hold meetings with Sri Lankan President Mirthipala Srisena and Japanese counterpart Shinjo Abe.The main topics on the agenda, as set out by this year's Japan presidency for the G7 Summit, are the global economy, investment, trade, the refugee crisis, climate change and energy, the fight against terrorism, foreign policy and development. Leaders will also discuss several global health policy issues, gender equality and women's rights. G7 leaders will address the global demand-supply gap in investment and will help promote infrastructure investments.At the summit, the G7 members are likely to send a strong message in support of free trade as a tool to promote jobs and higher living standards, including calling for strengthening the rules-based multilateral trading system and the functions of the WTO, according to documents received here ahead of the Summit.The G7 will discuss how to lead the efforts of the international community, building on the outcome of the climate change Conference of the Parties (COP21) in Paris, in December last year.

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh147","The EU's ineffective climate diplomacy","March 1, 2016 Tuesday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, March 1 -- At a meeting last week, the Council adopted conclusions on ""European climate diplomacy after COP21."" This self-congratulatory document celebrates the EU's diplomatic success in Paris and suggests that more of the same will move the climate agenda forward. According to the Council, the EU-led ""High Ambition Coalition"" could secure ""timely signature, swift ratification, and full implementation by all parties of the Paris Agreement.""There is nothing in the conclusions, however, that could help to resolve the collective action problem that resulted in the Paris Agreement's huge disparity between collective ambition and individual obligation.While the agreement's objectives are clearly ambitious, very little in the agreement is ""legally binding."" At the US government's insistence, the Paris agreement was rather conceived as a set of generic political commitments. So it is hard to see in what sense the mere repetition of prior commitments, dressed up with an even more ambitious and more unattainable objective, marks a ""decisive turning point towards comprehensive and collective global action,"" as the Council suggests.With respect to the EU's climate diplomacy action in 2016, the Council approves the development of an action plan focused around three main strands:Maintaining climate change advocacy as a strategic priority in diplomatic dialogues, public diplomacy and external policy instruments;Supporting implementation of the Paris Agreement and the intended nationally determined contributions (INDC), in the context of low-emission and climate-resilient development;Increasing efforts to address the nexus of climate change, natural resources, including water, prosperity, stability and migration. While the first two strands are unsurprising and bland, the third one raises the spectre of climate change being drawn into broader social programs. Indeed, according to the Council, ""the EU and member states' development cooperation with third countries should fully take into account the existing synergies between climate objectives and the sustainable development goals as adopted by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.""The United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which reads like a high school 'social justice' project, sets out 27 goals, of which the fight against climate change is one, listed in 13th place among such other goals as fighting poverty and reducing inequality. This approach will backfire in at least two ways.The EU would do better to focus its efforts solely on combatting climate change; immigration policy, for instance, is a politically charged and divisive subject that should not be blended with climate policy.In short, the Council's conclusions are a missed opportunity to remedy some of the weaknesses of the Paris agreement. Apparently, the Council believes, against all odds, that more of the same is required in the fight against all evil and against all odds. If the EU pursues this policy, it will likely adversely affect its credibility and the public's confidence in EU policies, while increasing the influence of activist groups to the detriment of other constituencies, thus aggravating the democratic deficit.National parliaments should firmly reject this approach. Instead, they should insist on a plan that addresses the Paris agreement's inherent weakness, i.e. its lack of obligations binding on individual countries, and a plan that will result in equivalent, although not necessarily equal, efforts by non-EU countries.If no such plan is feasible, there is a serious question as to whether the Paris agreement has a future. The EU should therefore aim for more than vague climate diplomacy. It should establish a process aimed at creating a level playing field. Any such process needs to be sufficiently modest and pragmatic to garner political support, and sufficiently flexible so that new knowledge can be reflected.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh152","A Happy Climate Deal In Paris","December 31, 2015 Thursday","Energy & Power","Last week the world leaders justifiably hailed the agreement struck in Paris as historic. The agreement came from 195 countries of the world.The objectives of the Paris climate summit were to cut down the carbon emission to below 2 C by 2100, make it binding on the nations and raising a fund to boost adaptation efforts.Nations, including Bangladesh, are rejoicing at the success in delivering a deal in Paris. Congratulatory message are pouring from the world's capitals.Let's see what the world leaders have said about the deal. US President Barack Obama said in a televised speech that the deal offered the ""best chance we have to save the one planet we have"". He took the opportunity of praising his country's ""leadership"" in clinching the deal.UK Prime Minister David Cameron said the deal represented ""a huge step forward in securing the future of the planet"".The reaction from world leaders echoed the feelings of other countries. This has been a deal where all the nations played a role and made a contribution. The deal would not have been possible if only one nation would disagree. Bangladesh, one of the most vulnerable nations to climate change impact, played an influential role in making the deal happen. When French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, who was also the president of the conference, used his high negotiation skills to bring about the deal there were cheers all around. As he put the gravel on the table signaling the signing of the deal the conference delegates burst into cheers, claps and some even cried in joy.Fabius proved himself the star of the negotiations. Many attributed the success of one of the most difficult negotiations of the present day world to his political and diplomatic experience.Questions, however, remain about how legally binding is the provisions of the deal. Here is a checklist: Review and submission of emission reduction targets will be binding.For the developed nations it will be binding to form the $100bn fund to help emerging and developing nations decarbonizes their energy mix. This will mean moving away from burning fossil fuels to clean energy sources, such as renewables and nuclear. What won't be legally binding will be the emission targets.These will be determined by nations themselves. Within the agreement the targets are known as Intended National Determined Contributions (INDCs). To date, 187 countries have submitted their INDCs. Observers have calculated that all of the targets, if delivered, will only curb warming by 2.7 C. This is well above, not well below, the 2 C goal of the Paris Agreement.This begs the question why the targets themselves are not legally binding under international law. In Paris, a number of big emitting emerging economies - including China, India and South Africa were unwilling to sign up to a condition that they felt could hamper their economic growth and development.Even the most supportive observers accept that it is going to be a very tall order for the world to deliver a package of measures that will result in limiting global temperature rise to ""well below"" 2 C (3.6 o F), let alone 1.5 C, above preindustrial levels. Critics are not as happy as the world leaders.The Chief of Friends of the Earth, was cautious. In hailing the ""the spirit of Paris"" as positive he, however, said the conference failed in addressing the key issues. Not enough was achieved, he observed.""We have got to understand the limits of Paris,"" he said. ""It is certainly not sufficient [as an agreement]. If you judge it by the science, it's clearly not strong enough. It's also clearly not strong enough for poor countries."" In spite of such criticisms, it is important that the delegates of COP21 were not empty-handed as they returned home. It's important to build on the positive outcome of the conference for saving the Mother Earth.\l"

And at the same time, the countries will try to control the temperature by 1.5 degrees Celsius.The Paris Agreement requested the UN Secretary General to be the Depositary of the Agreement and open it for signature in New York from 22 April 2016 to 21 April 2017.

Officials say the submissions, in their current form, won't keep global temperatures from rising by more than the 2C danger threshold. The global total of carbon emissions will continue to grow, although more slowly than over the past two decades. However the UN report says the plans are a major step forward and the 2C goal is still ""within reach"". The UN believes that these national climate plans, called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) will form the cornerstone of a binding, global treaty on climate change that will be agreed at a conference in French capital Paris in December.Even much smaller countries like Ethiopia, Bhutan and Costa Rica are identifying absolute limits on the quantity of emissions. I think that signals a real evolutionTaryn Fransen, World Resources Institute. According to the UN, the submissions now cover around 86 per cent of global emissions: about four times the amount covered by the Kyoto Protocol, the world's first carbon cutting treaty.Their assessment is decidedly upbeat about the plans, despite acknowledging that taken together they point to rises in global temperatures of 2.7C above the pre-industrial level.Scientists have determined that if temperature rises exceed 2C, this will lead to significant and dangerous climate impacts, which will especially hit the world's poor. UN climate chief, Christiana Figueres, said the plans were an excellent first step: ""The INDCs have the capability of limiting the forecast temperature rise to around 2.7C by 2100, by no means enough but a lot lower than the estimated four, five, or more degrees of warming projected by many prior to the INDCs.""Observers say the 2.7C figure is a substantial improvement on 3.1C, which was the estimate when the plans were assessed last December.UN climate conference 30 Nov - 11 Dec 2015 - the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties - will see more than 190 nations gather in French capital Paris to discuss a possible new global agreement on climate change, aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions to avoid the threat of dangerous warming due to human activities, according to a news agency.Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Although our carbon footprint contribution is almost zero. But we are working for restricting future warming below 2 degrees Celsius. Despite getting pledged assistance from major emitter developed nations we are working with our own resources. Especially our power supply model Solar Home Systems (SHS) to off grid community has been acclaimed as a lesson to the world.Prime Minister's Energy Advisor Tawfiq E Elahi Chowdhury BB said this while talking to Energy and Power Editor Mollah Amzad Hossain on the occasion COP21 scheduled to start in Paris soon.""The philosophy of our visionary Prime Minister for guiding the future generation to a habitable world is our inspiration. We are working relentlessly from our firm conviction of making the world free from global warming,"" Chowdhury said.Replying to a question, he said eliminating wastage of resources is the top priority. ""For this we have taken initiatives and implementing actions for ensuring efficiency across all segments of power value chain from generation through transmission to power supply to end users. As the launching step we have distributed 13 million CFL valves free for reducing lighting load. We are endeavoring for converting lighting load to LED now. Work is also advancing for standardizing all electricity consuming appliances. In phases efficient energy use will be ensured through leveling all appliances. Simultaneously Sustainable Renewable Energy Development Authority (SREDA) is working for encouraging efficient use of energy and opting for using alternate environment friendly energy.""Chowdhury also said the average efficiency of Bangladesh's power generation plants is about 32%. ""Using our own fund we are replacing old generators using outdated technologies with modern fuel-efficient combined cycle plants. In 5 years our generation efficiency would become 50%. On the other hand, a pilot project has been taken for recovering waste heat and using it in industry. We have about 2000 MW gas based captive power generation. Initiative has been taken to convert all these to cogeneration and tri generation. It will make a significant contribution to reducing the use of fossil fuel in the country. We are also working for introducing smart grid in phases.""Tawfiq E Elahi mentioned that SHS as an ideal commercial model for replicating in the rest of the world for off grid power supply. About 3.5 million users have already come under the scheme. By 2018 it will expand to 6 million. Grid connected mosques, schools and public places are coming under solar power through food for work program. Work is also advancing for grid connective solar power supply.""We have already signed an agreement with SunEdison for a 200 MW solar power plant. Work is also proceeding on mini and micro grids...It must be known to all that we have taken some innovative initiatives for solar power generation as we can affect our limited agricultural lands. Such plants will be set on the banks of rivers and canals. We have also taken major initiative for replacing all diesel using irrigation pumps to solar pumps. From these power will be supplied for irrigation for 3 months and there will be provision for supplying power to grid for the remaining 9 months,"" he added.Replying to another question, Chowdhury said taking advantage of technology works has also started for wind power generation. Agreement has been signed with two foreign companies for setting up wind farms in the coastal areas. The project of wind mapping is almost complete. The government is expecting major achievement in wind power soon.He said Bangladesh is working actively for environment friendly power generation.Asked why at the same time several coalfired power projects are being implemented, Chowdhury said ""We have to keep our wheels of development rolling side by side to environment protection for achieving our national vision of becoming mid income country. There is no option but to achieve sustainable power and energy security. We must bear in mind that our per capita annual emission level is on .3 tonne while that of developed nation is 20 tonnes. Still then we are adopted advanced environment friendly modern technology for coal fired power generation.""He added: ""We are implementing most of the above with our own money. Donors have not given any assistance for alternate energy resource though they expressed intention for it. We are not keeping our fingers crossed. We have taken initiative for educating our school students for energy conservation and energy efficiency.

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh162","EU needs to rethink of foreign aid","February 5, 2016 Friday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Feb. 5 -- In 2016, the European Union will need a radical rethink of its foreign and development policies. The temptation may be to look for immediate solutions - but there are no quick or easy answers. We need to look at the root causes of these crises, and collective action is required at the global level.Four major conferences in 2015 set out a package of global agreements on trade (#WTOMC10 in Nairobi), development finance (#FFD3 in Addis Ababa), climate change (#COP21 in Paris) and the universal Sustainable Development Goals (the #GlobalGoals in New York). These offer the opportunity to adapt international cooperation to the realities of the 21st Century.At these events, the international community came to a consensus on some tough issues. So what is needed in 2016 is strong political backing to start fully exploiting the potential of these four global agreements for the long and difficult road ahead.One of the principal features of the UN's ambitious Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) for 2030 is their 'universal' nature - they need to be implemented around the world even in developed countries. This presents the EU and its member states with a double challenge. How can you realign existing policies and practices around aid, while weaving the targets of the UN goals and principles of shared responsibilities into internal EU policies?For the EU and its member states, there needs to be full ownership of the Sustainable Development Goals throughout all ministries and sectors, beyond just those dealing with foreign affairs and development.It is now widely recognised that aid is not the only solution for development, but it can play a vital role. Europe needs to redefine the role of aid in an era of austerity. Aid can be used more effectively if it is focused strategically in the world's least developed countries and used as a catalyst to mobilise other resources like domestic taxation and private sector investment. This was the consensus that emerged in Addis Ababa at the UN's Third International Conference on Financing for Development last July. But it's not just about aid. What is essential for realising the integrated ambition of the Sustainable Development Goals is the notion of policy coherence for sustainable development recognised as one target of SDG17 in the UN agreement.One danger may be that different players will continue to concentrate on the goals they see as most relevant to them and not work in a more integrated fashion that takes all the goals into account. But policy coherence inevitably involves looking across the board, making political choices and creating viable and accountable ways to measure the effects of each policy on each other - including trade, financial, agricultural and climate related policies to name but a few. Europe's neighbourhood faces increased instability in Syria, Iraq, the Sahel, Central Africa and the Horn of Africa. Federica Mogherini, as the High Representative of the European Union, has favoured a new comprehensive 'global' strategy that extends beyond the traditional security domain to cover all aspects of EU external policy.If Europe is to respect the legacy of 2015, and as this new strategy will shape EU foreign policy for the best part of the next decade, formulating it cannot be done in isolation from the new Sustainable Development Goals, the new EU's new trade policy, Trade for All, and the 2016 review of the European Neighbourhood Policy. The global strategy should define a truly integrated approach where external and internal policies are harmonised.Dealing with migration is not just about border controls - it is also about addressing the root causes of why millions are displaced and managing the global flows of migrating people in a way that supports sustainable development everywhere. The EU's new Africa Trust Fund shows Europe reaching out to African countries to establish better cooperation on the migration crisis, but it must also involve a long-term commitment to development, and a diplomatic response for unstable regions. A crisis mood appears to have settled in as the new status quo for Europe and many parts of the world. Yet the year behind us was also a year of major global agreements, which constitute impressive steps forward in dealing with global challenges. In 2016, we need to build on this and Europe, and the rest of the world will need political vision, imagination and a genuine sprit of cooperation to collectively deal with the shared challenges.(James Mackie is Senior Adviser for the European Centre for Development Policy Management (ECDPM), and Rhys Williams is Communications Officer).Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh164","Chasing The Main Culprit","November 30, 2015 Monday","Energy & Power","An international publication on wind power says ""our civilization is built on a hydrocarbon platform"". The civilization has gradually become rich through industrialization, in fact, since the innovation of steam engine which run on fossil fuel. Scientists consider the fossil fuel has caused two-thirds of the pollution for global warming which now reaches to 6 degree Celsius scenario (6DS). The world has long been making efforts to limit the global temperature rise to 2 degree Celsius scenario (2DS) by this century so the earth remains livable for the human being. Some even want to limit it to 1.5 degree Celsius scenario. So far, the strategy is to control GHG emission due to the fossil fuel while facing the impact of already changed climate through adaptation measures. As part of the latest efforts, the world is moving towards a crucial climate meeting (COP21) in Paris staring on the last day of this month.As the largest source of greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions, the energy sector will be at the heart of global action to tackle climate change. Ahead of the meeting, over 150 countries - representing 90% of global economic activity and nearly 90% of energy-related GHG emissions - have submitted pledges to reduce emissions. Around half of these submissions include explicit energy-focused targets, either alongside a GHG emissions target or as a stand-alone goal. The most common energy-related measures are those that target increased renewables deployment (40% of submissions) or improved energy efficiency (one-third of submissions). John MacNaughton, Executive Chair of World Energy Trilima says the world will have to invest US$48-53 trillion in energy infrastructure to achieve the 2DS target. The global energy demand is now increasing by 3 percent per annum - the developed countries of OECD group would share 1.5% of the global demand rise.According to a report on ""Nuclear Energy: Combating Climate Change"", the global temperature would increase by 6DS in 2100 at the present rate of GHG emission, which should be reduced by half if the world has to achieve the 2DS target. On the other hand, the temperature rise could not be brought to 2DS even if the countries completely implement their respective targets stated in the INDCs (Intended Nationally Determined Contributions). This implies that the developed countries will have to reduce emission at a much faster rate than what they have intended to.Global Energy and Process Related Greenhouse Gas Emissions in the INDC Scenario (Gt CO2 -eq) 2014 2020 2025 2030Energy-related GHG emissions 35.5 36.9 37.5 38.4Chandra Bhoshan, deputy director of Centre for Science and Environment (India), says that the INDCs are 25% away from what is necessary to achieve the 2DS target. Civil society organization Climate Justice estimated the gap at 12 gigatonnes. Environment experts Dr Saleemul Huq, however, thought that the target of temperature rise should be limited to 1.5DS.To do that, the developed countries will have to accelerate reducing the emission while increasing contribution to the Green Climate Fund to facilitate developing countries for reducing the rate of emission. A publication titled World Wind Energy 2050 says that the global power consumption could be reduced to 40,000 Twh by the year 2050 if the INDCs are implemented properly, but at the present rate the consumption would increase to 74,000 Twh. A publication of International Energy Association (IEA) says the contribution of renewable energy would be 22-32% of the total power consumption level of 40,000-42,000 Twh by 2050 subject to achievement of the emission reduction targets. International Renewable Energy Association, however, estimated that the global power demand would stand at around 37,000 Twh by the year 2030 with 43% coming from renewable energy if the countries can implement the renewable energy roadmaps.At present, 41.1% of the global power generation comes from coal, followed by natural gas 21.9%, 15.6% hydro, 11.7% nuclear, 3.9% oil and 2% wind. In this perspective, coal shares only 2% of Bangladesh's power generation of 11,800 MW as of 2015 while 2% comes from hydro, 28% from fuel oil and the rest comes from natural gas. Like other countries, 68-70% of Bangladesh's total GHG emission (only 0.3 tonne as compared to 20 tonnes by developed countries) comes from fossil fuel. Yet, Bangladesh is pursuing a lowcarbon growth policy as the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is implementing development projects giving highest priority to protect the environment. At present, 70% of Bangladesh's total commercial energy comes from natural gas while power generation depends 67% on the gas, which is exhausting fast. As a result, the country is exploring alternative energy sources to continue with the development activities.In accordance with the Power Sector Master Plan, half of the 40,000MW of power to come from coal by 2030 while 25% to come from natural gas, 10% from oil and the rest from import, nuclear and non-carbonized sources of energy. ""We must follow the low-carbon growth policy, but not at the cost of our development,"" Prime Minister's Energy Adviser Dr Tawfiq-E-Elahi Chowdhury. ""We are choosing technology for the coal power plants giving highest priority to pollution control."" According to the latest world energy outlook by IEA, the carbon emission from the energy would increase by 16% during a period of 2013-40 as the energy demand would increase by 3%. ""The single largest energy demand growth story of recent decades is near its end; coal use in China reaches a plateau, close to today's levels, as the country's economy rebalances and industrial coal demand falls.The largest oil consumer - the United States - experiences one of the world's largest reductions in demand from 2013 to 2040 (along with the European Union), declining by around 4 million barrels per day (mb/d), and returning to levels last observed in the 1960s. Broad-based growth in global natural gas demand (up 47%) is led by China and the Middle East. By 2040, oil and coal collectively relinquish 9% of the global energy mix, with renewables growing by five percentage points and gas and nuclear each growing by two."" The world's appetite for electricity lifts demand by more than 70% by 2040, and there is a concerted effort to reduce the environmental consequences of power generation. Renewables overtake coal as the largest source of electricity by the early-2030s and account for more than half of all growth over the period to 2040. Renewables-based generation reaches 50% in the European Union by 2040, around 30% in China and Japan, and above 25% in the United States and India.Coal's share of total electricity generation drops to 30% in 2040, and the output from inefficient sub-critical plants decl"

It's a global problem and all countries should sit together to find a solution. If anyone tries to show red eyes, the negotiation will fail. The countries should not play the blame game and must also agree that it is a problem.Environment Minister Anwar Hossain Manju stressed on the collective efforts in fighting the consequences of the climate change ahead of the COP21, scheduled for November 30 to December 11 in Paris, in an exclusive interview with Energy and Power Editor Mollah Amzad Hossain in Dhaka recently. Following are the excerpts:EP: How do you see the prospect of the upcoming climate negotiation in ParisAH: The heads of states of many countries would not go to the conference while many developed countries would try not to give adequate money as required for mitigation and adaptation measures. Meanwhile the leftists would try to put the negotiation to fail. China, India and Brazil have expressed their intention to take mitigation measures but not at the cost of their development. The countries like ours would try to raise their vulnerabilities and seek money to intensify adaptation measures. The developed countries would try to make a point that if they have money, they will give us. On the other hand, we would be arguing that: ""If I pollute the environment, you will be affected."" The meeting of the heads of states with which the conference starts would yield hardly any outcome, but it will not fail either. The directions expected to emerge from the meeting would lead the negotiation in the second week towards a positive outcome.EP: Are you hopeful about a legally binding agreementAH: The issue of legally binding agreement emerged as the Kyoto Protocol failed to serve in reducing carbon emission for lack of ratification of the protocol by the developed countries like USA, Canada, Japan and some other countries. There are apprehensions that it would not be done, but I am hopeful about it as biggest polluter china has come forward while the European Union is providing full support in favor of the agreement. On the other hand, countries like USA, Canada and Japan also facing serious climate change consequences and facing pressure from within to go for solution of the problem.EP: What would be Bangladesh's strategy to bring out results from the crucial negotiation of the conferenceAH: Our main strategy would be to put our points on the table and tell everybody humbly, modestly and politely that see I am in distress. The target is to get money as much as possible. Our point will be that the environment polluted due to your industrialization, but we are the worst affected. We will not have the tactics to outsmart others. ""I want to make a human story of the reality."" So, the position is clear - give us money. Keep patience and see what we can bring - the issue is to get the result.We will press for legally binding agreement too.EP: Who are in the Bangladesh negotiation teamHowever, the representatives from civil society organizations, who have reputations in dealing with climate change negotiation, are not in the team this year. But they will cooperate with the negotiation team to provide information and necessary advice.EP: How Bangladesh would try to get the Green Climate FundAH: Our main concern will be to increase the contribution of the fund for the adaptation measures, as the major contributors to the fund now want to give only 16% for adaptation and 84% for mitigation. That means the mitigation fund would again go back to the developed countries. The vulnerable countries will then get hardly any benefit.We have the institutional capacity ready to get the fund while having the projects ready. What we now need is the fund. Yet, we will not approach like the activists, but will try to convince with our distressed condition.EP: What do you say about the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) target Bangladesh submitted to the UNFCCC along with other countriesAH: Our target is to reduce the GHG emission by 5% by the year 2030 and we would go further to reduce it 15% if we are provided with adequate money and appropriate technology. But one thing we made clear that it would not be at the cost of our development. The countries offered the INDCs only to show good intentions.EP: Do you think our plan of coal-based power generation would put us on back foot in the negotiationAH: Those who will criticize our plan are also using coal. We are much behind development. And we can not reduce coal use at the cost of our development. Yet, we are using high-tech coal power plant that would help keep carbon emission at the lowest level.\l"

What proved to be magic in Hong Kong was the agreement on a mandate to operationalise aid for trade. A WTO Task Force recommended using existing mechanisms for identifying and prioritising trade-related capacity constraints in developing countries around which donors should align their support.So 10 years on, did Aid for Trade deliver on its promise?The Initiative created strong partnerships between developed and developing countries, between the trade and development communities, between the traditional and non-traditional donors and between the public and the private sector. These partnerships are based on a common agenda with clear objectives and reciprocal commitments.Successive Global Reviews and Aid for Trade at a Glance reports have shown that the Initiative has raised awareness among developing countries and donors about the positive role that trade can play in promoting economic growth and development. Moreover, developing countries, notably the least developed, are getting better at articulating, mainstreaming and communicating their trade-related objectives and strategies.As a result, cumulative aid-for-trade disbursements reached USD 245 billion and an additional USD 190 billion in other official flows, since the Initiative started in 2006.

At the 19th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 19) in Warsaw, Poland, Parties agreed to initiate or intensify preparation of their intended nationally determined contributions"" to be submitted in advance of the COP 21 in Paris. These country commitments are known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs). Their form and rigor will largely determine whether the world achieves an ambitious 2015 agreement and is put on a path toward a low-carbon, climate-resilient future targeting 2 C goal of temperature increase by the end of 2100.Warsaw decision to prepare the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) by all Parties of the UNFCCC will form a key input to the negotiations leading towards the 2015 Paris climate agreement. So INDC become very critical element of UNFCCC negotiation. However it is important mentioned that the parties must follow the Article 2 of the Convention while preparing their INDC.Countries around the world are committed to creating this new international climate agreement by the conclusion of . This will determine whether the world can pave the path towards a low-carbon climate-resilient future. The process of determining INDCs will be through a bottom-up system in which countries put forward their contributions in the context of national priorities, circumstances and capabilities and a topdown system in which countries collectively aim to reduce emissions in order to meet the global aim. Under the INDCs each country will detail their proposed steps to reducing emissions, how they will adapt to climate change impacts and what support they may need from other countries.Lima COP 20 decided that all Parties to communicate their intended nationally determined contributions well in advance of the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties in a manner that facilitates the clarity, transparency and understanding of the intended nationally determined contributions.The COP 20 also decided that the information to be provided by Parties communicating their intended nationally determined contributions, in order to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding, may include, as appropriate, inter alia, quantifiable information on the reference point (including, as appropriate, a base year), time frames and/or periods for implementation, scope and coverage, planning processes, assumptions and methodological approaches including those for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and, as appropriate, removals, and how the Party considers that its intended nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious, in light of its national circumstances, and how it contributes towards achieving the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2.Lima COP also requested developed country Parties, the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism and any other organizations in a position to do so to provide support for the preparation and communication of the intended nationally determined contributions of Parties that may need such support.Though least developed countries (LDCs) are not the greatest contributors to climate change, they are still undertaking mitigation efforts at the national level. Developing INDCs under the UNFCCC is a process that will identify these efforts, and analyze where there is potential to increase ambition domestically so all countries can work collectively towards reducing emissions. While developing INDC developing countries must take into account their domestic circumstances and international processes for comprehensiveness, transparency and ambition as negotiated under the UNFCCC.Please note that INDC is an ex-ante process was formally adopted under the UNFCCC that created demand for clarify the concepts, revisit historical precedents and outl"
"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh170","Paris meet may deliver deal - Dhaka should seek compensation, resettling climate refugees","December 1, 2015 Tuesday","The News Today (Bangladesh.)","A firm belief has been in the buildup that there was life on other planets, too, but got extinct on many of them. The reason, primarily, is one: climate change. Such notion, increasingly founded on scientific researches and findings, has stoked up worry about the fate of our one because of the signs in the changing weather patterns.A repeat of escapism in Paris would only imperil all in the same boat on a journey with those making a hole into it. The concern erupts into a cry now --'Save Mother Earth--as the world converges once more, now in the French capital, to decide on a guarantee for survival of mankind from the elemental forces of nature.The main motto is single one, that is, a binding deal for all to go by--but hardly and harshly binding for a few, who are considered villains of the piece on the global theater. And the sticking point lies in the later part of the pact that involves the most powerful ones in this disparately developed human society. They are widely blamed by the greens for fouling the fair face of the Earth with toxic exhausts and then torpedoing a much-cherished climate deal on the past occasions of summit talks.In the event of the deal being finally sealed, what Bangladesh should gain from it is the moot question being discussed in Dhaka. Bangladesh is one of the countries that are worst affected by adversities of climate change under the impact of emission of greenhouse gases. Recurrent droughts, floods, desertification process, sea level rise, salinity incursion, arsenic contamination of groundwater, the pollution of sweet water, and spread of diseases are among the many forms of fallout. One very serious outcome of global climate change in Bangladesh is climate refugees.Pushed out of homes by cyclones and tidal surges and beggared by salinity intrusion into farmlands, many people of coastal areas are going on exodus bound for other safer rural areas, towns and cities. Rural-urban migration is creating crisis in the already cramped towns and cities of this Ganges delta of a limited landmass where some 160 million people huddle for a livelihood and accommodation.This crude reality makes it a major talking point for the Bangladesh delegation at the 21st Conference of the Parties () on November 30-December. Resettlement of the climate refugees in difficult in this land and so Dhaka should raise a demand for their rehabilitation from the land-scare to land-surplus parts of the world.The developed world had better take this matter into consideration in order to avoid repetition of the troubles triggered by recent migration crisis with hordes of displaced people invading Europe. Another moot point, as suggested by experts, is compensation for the losses being handed by climate change mainly attributed to mindless lust for riches and development in the hedonistic developed hemisphere of the planet. Here, the negotiators must not budge from the claim that the victims want grant assistance, not loan, from the $100 billion global climate fund under consideration.In the meantime, protests in the climate-victim countries worldwide are trying to press home these common points. The demos, essentially, are not against the climate summit against noncommittal posture of the big powers while they are meeting again by spending millions. The protest moves are meant to build up pressure so the main players could not get away again, like in Kyoto, Copenhagen, Doha and so. In Copenhagen, the Danish capital, in December 2009 high hopes for a legal pact to curb climate-harming greenhouse gases came crashing down as diplomacy foundered in extra time. Now, six years later, 195 nations will try again, this time in Paris.Much, however, has changed in the climate arena since 2009, and observers say there is reason to be hopeful that negotiators may finally seal some sort of deal. ""The world has learned some valuable lessons from the experience in Copenhagen,"" former US vice president-turned climate activist Al Gore was quoted as saying in a news report.A key difference is that heads of state and government, who swooped in at the end of the 2009 summit, have been invited to attend only the first day's meet in Paris. When leaders failed to reach consensus six years ago, a handful among them -- representing key players such as the United States, European Union, Japan, China, India and Brazil -- huddled together to thrash out a face-saving ""accord"". It is the 21st yearly session of the Conference of the Parties to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the 11th session of the Meeting of the Parties to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.The 2015 conference objective is to achieve a legally binding and universal agreement on climate, from all the nations of the world. Some observers say the level of mutual trust ahead of Paris summit is far, far better. Many say the jihadist attacks that killed 130 people in Paris little over two weeks before the summit may forge a common resolve among nations, many of whose leaders said they decided to come in fact to take a stand against violence.The overarching goal of the Convention is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to limit the global temperature increase to 2 \'c2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels. Green-planet campaigners and lobbies of change stand as sentinels against anymore setback. The International Trade Union Confederation has called for the goal to be ""zero-carbon, zero-poverty"" one. As such, analysts believe a binding deal is more likely than not, this time around. Tropical storms like typhoons, tsunamis, quakes for common destiny for the developed and the developing both.\l"

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh172","Paris deal critical for low-carbon economy","November 5, 2015 Thursday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 5 -- If successful, the 2015 Paris Climate Conference, also known as COP21, will result in a new, legally binding global agreement to combat climate change, charting a course toward a low-carbon, green economy powered by renewable energy.The government policymakers, diplomats and elected officials who will gather in Paris in December know the consequences of doing nothing will be dire, including more floods, intense heat waves, droughts, hurricanes and tornadoes. They know climate change does not respect borders. It affects every country.The goal is to limit global average warming to no more than a 2 C increase by the end of the century; the challenge is how to do that. Reaching a global, binding agreement will not be easy, but the business community recognizes the need for an orderly, predictable and planned transition.The country-by-country commitments that will comprise the Paris agreement, by themselves, will not be enough to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to a level that limits global warming. The support of the business community is essential.And let's be clear: The transition to a low-carbon economy will occur one way or another. It will either be an orderly transition over the next two to three decades, or a disorderly one, spurred by crises and human hardship.Further delay in taking global action will only ensure the latter.An orderly transition is one that occurs within the existing financial and economic system. It does not threaten or overwhelm the foundation of our market economy. It does not require aggressive government intervention and centralized demand and control.An orderly transition provides an opportunity to create many winners, because adaptive and innovative companies will flourish.If corporations, the markets and entrepreneurs have a clear signal that an orderly transition to a low-carbon, green economy is more certain, through an ambitious global climate agreement, the needed investments and innovations will occur.At the latest Group of Seven meeting in Bavaria, world leaders took a step toward setting this direction by pledging to phase out fossil fuel emissions by the end of this century. This also made it clear to corporations and the markets that low-carbon technologies hold the promise of being profitable long-term investments.Many business leaders have already recognized the commercial and economic benefits of taking action now on climate change. In the auto industry, for example, there has been considerable innovation and investment in zero-emission vehicles, though more is needed.Today there are about 800 million vehicles on the world's roads.By 2050, it's estimated there will be more than 2 billion. We cannot continue to rely only on fossil fuels to power those vehicles and supply the bulk of our energy if we are going to avoid the worst effects of climate change.The auto industry already has proven and affordable solutions to wean drivers off our addiction to fossil fuels. The most prominent, ready and affordable solution is the electric vehicle, the only zero-emissions vehicle that can be powered with purely renewable energy.The Renault-Nissan Alliance is the first automaker to offer a full range of electric vehicles. Recently, we sold our 250,000th EV, more than every other automaker combined. While I'm proud of our leadership, I know it's not nearly enough. Zero-emissions vehicles remain a tiny fraction of the overall vehicle market.Other automakers are now joining us with new EVs, plug-in hybrids and fuel-cell electric cars, which are helping to expand the market for zero- and low-emission vehicles. When there are more players there's more competition, and competition stimulates demand.Many governments around the world are helping stimulate demand for EVs with various incentives, from cash for trading in old, polluting cars, to free parking and EV access to bus and high-occupancy lanes. We are also working daily with governments and businesses to expand the charging infrastructure that's necessary if EVs are to go mainstream. In places where such investments have taken place, such as Norway and the U.S. city of Atlanta, customers have reacted positively and sales have grown rapidly.By investing in green innovation, companies can create value for their future while playing a major role in fighting the threat climate change poses. In fact, according to the latest New Climate Economy Report, produced by the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, the global market for low-carbon and environmental goods and services is worth more than $5.5 trillion.This kind of investment will continue to grow. It has already helped many businesses create competitive advantages, build stability, and better position themselves for future challenges.The U.N. secretary general recently said that we are the first generation to feel the effects of climate change and the last to be able to do anything to stop it. This is a call to action, and I urge the world's governments to meet that challenge this year.Many corporations already have taken action on climate change because we recognize the consequences of not doing so. But we also appreciate the economic benefits such investments generate, including new innovations and opportunities for growth.A global climate agreement, properly structured, could unleash growth and a major wave of innovation globally.The Paris Climate Conference can serve as a significant milestone on the road toward decarbonization, which will spur growth and jobs.We look forward to all the countries of the world making strong commitments to climate action in the months ahead.(Carlos Ghosn, 61, was born in Brazil and spent much of his childhood in Lebanon.

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh173","Framing a transparent, sustainable climate fiscal policy","December 30, 2015 Wednesday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Dec. 30 -- The Paris deal of climate change has already created considerable optimism across the world. It is mainly due to the three high notes of the deal, at least two of which are tangible in nature. First, all the parties will try to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emission no matter whether a country is a big emitter or not. Second, it endorsed a commitment for ""zero net"" GHG emissions in the second half of this century. Third, the parties will ""pursue efforts to"" limit the temperature to grow to 1.5degC.Realisation of the world leaders and vested corporate interest of the need for addressing climate change is perhaps the biggest achievement so far in the context of COP21. Nevertheless, the ongoing pace of climate change is unlikely to alter with these important three steps, and countries like Bangladesh would continue to remain greatly vulnerable to disasters and vagaries of nature in the coming decades.Indeed, Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP, 2009) recognises that the country ranks fifth among ten countries in the world which are most vulnerable to climate-induced disasters. To address climatic adversities, it also identifies the expenditure and revenue or finance sides of climate fiscal funds, and suggests developing a transparent and sustainable climate fiscal policy. The budgetary policy framework serves as a key element of the Climate Fiscal Framework (CFF) in developing favourable circumstances for climate fiscal policy without hampering the existing public financing mechanism. Thus, CFF is commensurate with the BCCSAP, which adopts an integrated approach to climate change, disaster risk reduction and social protection as these are intrinsically interwoven with covariate shocks. Social protection programmes are, therefore, imperative to have built-in mechanisms to factor in the adversities of climate change.Bangladesh Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR) prepared in 2012 and the CFF prepared in 2014 were taken into consideration when Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was recognised as one of the ""Champions of the Earth"". These documents worked out the expenditures on ""social protection"" directly related to climate change and ""livelihood"" programmes. Unfortunately, the documents do not systematically demonstrate which ""social protection"" and ""livelihood"" programmes were identified as ""climate change relevant"" at the national level although they ascertain and analyse, albeit scantily, the climate change-relevant expenditures at local levels. The major climate change-relevant programmes mentioned are Food for Work, Test Relief and Employment Generation Programme for the Ultra-Poor (formerly known as '100-day Employment Scheme'). Covariate shocks from climate-induced disasters have been implicitly embedded in the country's recently published National Social Security Strategy (NSSS). The NSSS also recognises the significance of reducing risks and vulnerabilities emanating from climate change and disasters. Thus, there is an implicit overlapping between climate change interventions along with related expenditures and the social protection programmes. Since all programmes mentioned in the NSSS are unlikely to address the adversities and reducing discomforts of climate change, there is a need for clearly spelt ""adaptive social protection"" for both CFF and NSSS. Surprisingly, the NSSS and CFF documents do not clearly define the Adaptive Social Protection for mobilising climate change financing.Therefore, a well-defined ""Adaptive Social Protection"" should be the main focus of allocating funds for social protection programmes. The CPEIR reveals that the definition of climate change expenditures usually excludes social security programmes that makes it difficult to work out the public expenditure for climate change in the context of social protection. Indeed, adaptive social protection is an integrated approach to encompass climate change, disaster risk reduction and social protection. However, neither the CFF nor the NSSS have come up with a selection of adaptive social protection programmes. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a robust and acceptable set of criteria to identify the programmes that can contribute to the development of resilience to the impacts of climate change. An appropriate definition of ""Adaptive Social Protection"" is important to fathom the actual climate change expenditure in Bangladesh.NSSS and CFF do not fully overlap in the government's current approach to classify social protection programmes. The term ""social protection"" is also debated in the literature, and perceptions do not completely match with the practices and policy documents. In Bangladesh, social safety net programmes (SSNPs) are divided into social protection and social empowerment programmes. In the budget of FY 2015-16, the total allocation for SSNPs is Tk 375.46 billion, in which the allocation for social protection is Tk. 269.58 billion (72 per cent of total SSNP budget). However, as high as 42 per cent of the total allocation for social protection is dedicated to ""Pension for Retired Government Employees and their Families"", although social protection programmes are perceived to be designed mainly to protect the poorest, marginalised and the most vulnerable groups including climate-vulnerable populations. It also reduces the scope of allocation for adaptive social protection as the majority of the programmes are already climate-blind.Some social empowerment and development programmes are employment generating which protect the livelihoods of the climate- and disaster-vulnerable populations, but they are excluded from the social protection programmes. The examples are ""Emergency Cyclone Recovery and Restoration"", ""Water Supply and Sanitation in Cyclone Prone Sidr-Affected Area"" and ""Coastal Climate Resilient Infrastructure Improvement project"". Therefore, a working definition of adaptive social protection is needed, which will evolve through wide-ranging debates and discussions among the policymakers, practitioners, civil society, academia and the media. It will thus be accepted by all the stakeholders and help segregate the programmes related to climate change, social protection and livelihood programmes.The Paris deal reminds all that the onus is on the countries themselves to reduce emissions and protect the millions of climate-vulnerable populations, many of whom depend on carbon sequestrating ecosystem services and ozone-depleting activities. We need to act accordingly.Dr Mahfuz Kabir is Senior Research Fellow at Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies (BIISS).

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh174","Transition to a Lower Carbon Future","March 15, 2016 Tuesday","Energy & Power","Despite current weakness in global energy markets and the slowdown in China's growth, demand for energy will continue to grow over the next 20 years and beyond as the world economy expands and more energy is required to power the higher level of activity. According to the 2016 edition of the BP Energy Outlook, published recently, global demand for energy is expected to increase by 34% between 2014 and 2035, or by an average of 1.4% per year. This growth in overall demand in cludes significant changes in the energy mix, with lower-carbon fuels growing faster than carbon-intense fuels as the world begins to transition to a lower carbon future. The Outlook looks at long-term energy trends and develops projections for world energy markets over the next two decades. The 2016 edition was launched today in London by Spencer Dale, BP's group chief economist, and Bob Dudley, group chief executive.""In the middle of a downturn in oil and gas prices, it is important not only to adapt to the current tough conditions, but also to prepare for the next set of challenges.

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh175","Debate over private sector finance for climate change","January 23, 2016 Saturday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Jan. 23 -- With the landmark Paris climate agreement now a month-old and the holiday cheer for its accomplishment a bit more subdued, an earnest debate is fully underway over how to live up to the promises of the accords.A central piece of the puzzle is the issue of funding. If 2015 and the buildup to COP21 were all about reaching an agreement, the mission of 2016 and its subsequent years is to come up with reliable sources of finance to put the plan into action.""The private sector"" is often the knee-jerk, panacea solution to the problem of insufficient public funds to keep global temperatures in check. But the question then becomes how to entice private capital to take up a large stake in climate finance. And how to ensure some certainty of return that is commensurate with boosting inclusive growth and sustainable development - core pillars of the 2030 Development Agenda that climate action forms a part of.It is indeed a complex equation that is complicated even more by having two sides of the climate change issue - mitigation and adaptation. Both are critical strategies for action on climate and fortunately, both present an array of options for dealing with the challenge.Thus far mitigation has overwhelmingly drawn the bulk of investment. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, mitigation - investments in renewable technologies, clean energy, carbon sequestration, and other strategies - has historically accounted for roughly 90 percent of private funds mobilized for climate action.The imbalance makes financial sense. Clean energy and other green assets are more likely to produce concrete returns than investments in climate adaptation and resilience. The mitigation camp itself further splinters into a debate on the best course of action to produce large scale change. Carbon pricing - though never directly mentioned in the final Paris agreement - has garnered strong support from businesses and governments as being a clear long-term signal for the private sector to invest emission-saving strategies.The term ""carbon pricing"" is often thrown around, but what does it mean? And why does it matter? In this video, Devex explains how it is being implemented and the business case behind the policy.Implementing a price on carbon takes many forms, with influential voices advocating for each of the main options. The International Monetary Fund, for example, endorses the strategy of a carbon tax.""It is the most natural way to price carbon,"" Vitor Gaspar, head of fiscal policy at the IMF, told a recent gathering in Washington, D.C. Road fuel excises and other across-the-board measures that price the consumption of carbon are straightforward and relatively easy to administer, he argued.The World Bank, meanwhile, generally tends to favor approaches that build carbon markets through tradable carbon offsets and credits. Individual governments, based on their unique circumstances, will determine whether the tax or the markets-based approach will be adopted. And both strategies will continue to be core components of the broader set of policies that fall under carbon pricing.However, new twists to conventional strategies will also need to be applied. For carbon taxing, that can mean governments phasing out subsidies that artificially suppress fossil fuel prices below their true market and social costs. Global energy subsidies, according to IMF calculations, totaled $5.3 trillion in 2015, or roughly 6.5 percent of global gross domestic product. Raising the price of those fuels will both drive down emissions from consumption and generate considerable revenues for governments to channel into other development-oriented strategies, according to the IMF.For emissions trading, the Paris agreement may well have laid the groundwork for innovative approaches to finance climate using a critical carbon asset - international forests. Halting deforestation and replenishing deforested lands alone can achieve up to 30 percent of the mitigation pledges put forward in Paris, according to the Center for Global Development, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank.The agreement itself endorses the principles of carbon trading - officially articulated in the agreement as ""internationally transferred mitigation outcomes."" And Article 5 of the agreement specifically encourages the conservation and enhancement of ""sinks and reservoirs"" of greenhouse gases.Combining the two, environmental experts say, can eventually lead to carbon trading mechanisms in which greenhouse gas emissions can be offset by the purchase of credits whose proceeds promote forest preservation.Such a scheme would have to overcome significant regulatory hurdles, namely the creation of an international - rather than domestic - market for carbon trading. But the groundwork exists in places such as California where a state-wide emissions trading scheme allows companies to buy emissions reductions from countries with tropical forests. The implementing rules, however, have not been finalized.The need to build up investments on the resilience front, meanwhile, are immediate and pressing when considering the lopsided effects that climate change has on the world's poor. The V20, a coalition of countries most vulnerable to the damaging effects of a warming planet, estimates that roughly half of its 700 million citizens live in extreme poverty. While current aid flows and active investments toward resilience are not as mature as they are for mitigation, financial organizations are building the necessary strategies to leverage large sums of private capital.Climate change finance will require innovative mechanisms and policies. Devex talks to a group of experts about what's needed to transform the status quo.For example, a key priority for the Global Environment Facility is to use the targets agreed in Paris to build multistakeholder partnerships around sustainable energy, land use and urban systems, said Naoko Ishii, the GEF's chief executive. Having provided funding to 46 countries to devise their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions toward the Paris agreement, the GEF will now gear grant and assistance money toward helping them implement those commitments.Meanwhile, the Green Climate Fund, the financing facility formed in 2009 where donors committed to contributing $100 billion in overall climate finance, operates on a 50-50 mandate to direct funds evenly between mitigation and adaptation. While the GCF has recently rolled out new innovations on the mitigation front such as green bonds or early venture capital for off-grid solar in Africa, it admits that planning for investment in resilience is a much tougher task.""Adaptation is very locally driven and trying to understand how to use the marginal adaptation dollar is a tough struggle,"" said Leonardo Martinez-Diaz, a U.S. board member to the GCF. Overcoming the hurdle of determining the proper intervention to build climate resistance, he said, requires building up greater inventories of data - of degraded lands or coastal forests, for example - and are tasks that some development organizations can be properly equipped to address.The Paris agreement has been described in many ways as the start of an ongoing process toward a more sustainable climate. How to finance those ambitions, on all fronts, will be a key debate going forward. Fortunately, the debate is largely dominated by questions of ""which"" and ""what"" financing options to choose from rather than a dilemma from a shortage of opportunities.(Naki is a reporter for Devex Impact based in Washington, D.C., where he covers the intersection of business and international development.

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh177","Coal Sector to COP: We are Part of the Solution","November 15, 2015 Sunday","Energy & Power","Just about two months before the COP21 climate summit in Paris, proponents of coal energy say they are fighting an uphill battle to get the world to recognize how coal-fuelled electricity plant modemisation and carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems can be a key component to a dramatic reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions.Increasing the efficiency of coal-fired plants to over 50 percent will be a crucial milestone in cutting global carbon dioxide emissions by 80 to 95 percent of 1990 levels, says Hans-Wilhelm Schiffer, the head of the World Energy Resources program at the World Energy Council, and consultant to the largest Garman coal-power producer RWE.However, the public perception of coal is so low, that it is hard to get governments to support even the most innovative technologies, says Schiffer, ""Coal is being portrayed as the bogey man, responsible for only negative environmental problems."" Schiffer is concerned that opponents ignore the benefits ""coal has in human development.""Economic CaseCartan Sumner, Vice President of Public Policy at Peabody Energy, the largest private-sector coal firm in the world, and Associate Member of the International Energy Agency (IEA) Coal Industry Advisory Board, shares Schiffer's concerns. He points out that over 40% of worldwide electricity is produced with coal and adds that ""coal is going to continue to be used at a dramatic rate"". He cites a projected tripling of coal use in the ASEAN region between 2011 and 2035.""Coal has been the world's fastest growing fuel, and as the IEA pointed out in its most recent World Energy Outlook, coal demand is approaching that of oil."" A recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in the US, supports these claims and states that ""we are witnessing a global renaissance of coal majorly driven by poor, fast-growing countries that increasingly rely on coal to satisfy their growing energy demand."" ( HYPERLINK http://bit.ly/1INHIQ7http://bit.ly/1INHIQ7Right now, they are primarily thinking in terms of punitive measures, such as raising carbon prices. However, says Schiffer, ""there will not be an economic case for CCS unless CO 2 allowance prices rise substantially-in the EU to more than 10 times today's prices. But this would cripple industry."" For this reason, Schaffer says CCS should be given policy parity with other low emission on energy technologies such as renewable in international climate mechanisms.Super CriticalBut is it possible for the coal power sector to contribute to reducing CO2 emissions Yes, say Schiffer and summer emphatically.The first step to global environmental improvements is upgrading coal-fuelled plants worldwide, Schiffer says. Citing a figure from the coal Industry advisory Board Submission to the IEA, he claims moving the current global average efficiency rate of coal-fired power plants from 33 to 40% by deploying more advanced technology could cut CO2 emissions every year by approximately 2 Gt, which is as much as the total annual emissions of India, the world third largest emitter, after China and the US.""If all the world's coal-fired power plants were brought up to the latest standards, the CO2 saved would be more than that saved under the Kyoto Protocol,"" Schiffer adds.As an example of upgrading, he mentions using waste heat for the fluidized-bed drying of lignite before combustion.RWE installed a prototype of this concept at its Niederaussem facility. It improves efficiency by as much as four to five percentage points, and can safely dry up to 80 tonnes of lignite per hour, says Schiffer. New capabilities to handle steam temperatures of 700oC at 350 bar have given coal operations another four percentage points gain in efficiency.Summer mentions the further development of High-Efficiency, Low-Emissions (HELE) plants that ""continue to push the envelope of technology in terms of efficiency."" To that end Peabody invests in advanced coal technology initiatives around the world, he notes, including China's GreenGen IGCC project in Tianjin, while funding academic research at the University of Wyoming and Washington University in St. Louis.""We want to see the best technology used,"" Summer says. ""It's critical to our future."" The hope is that the ventures will lead to more implementation of super critical coal power facilities, and a reduction in cost of CCS systems.New TechniquesIn the long term, CC(U)S is obviously going to be key to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Schiffer says that after having been upgraded, plants could be fitted with carbon capture facilities, and the CO 2 could be either used or stored.Schaffer and Sumner have high expectations of SaskPower's CCS project at Boundary Dam near Estevan, Saskatchewan in Canada. Sumner calls this project ""iconic to the coal argument."" Upgrading Boundary Dam Power cost 1.47 billion Canadian dollars (US$1.1 billion), according to stateowned SaskPower, with roughly CA$ 900 million going to the CCS system.Canada's national government contributed CA$ 240 million to help defray project costs at the 110 MW facility. Prior to the upgrade, the plant produced 139 megawatts and released 3,604 tonnes of CO 2 per day. Now it realeases 354 tonnes per day, effectively capturing about 90 percent of CO 2 emissions.SaskPower calculates their plant captures a million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. The company applied for a 15.5 percent rate increase from 2014 through 2016.The government approved a 10.5 percent hike through 2015 instead. But SaskPower believes the costs for using carbon capture in their next installation will drop by 20 to 30 percent as they have identified potential design improvements and gained experience in implementation.Sumner says this is ""absolutely"" possible, saying costs will drop significantly once the process is adopted in more parts of the world. Schiffer also notes that CCS as a process is improving, with new scrubbing techniques that can reduce CCS energy consumption by 20 percent while using less solvent.Dark AgesCCS projects such as Boundary Dam are criticized by advocates of renewable energy because they argue it makes more sense to invest in wind and solar energy instead. Schiffer is also in favor of an increased use of renewables, but says the only way to guarantee the availability of electricity during peak periods is having conventional power plants that are able to meet that demand when renewables do not provide enough. He looks to one point during 21 March 2013 when wind and solar were barely able to meet two percent of German energy demand.Three days later, the two power sources were able to provide 69 percent of the country's demand.He supports new boiler-turbine control systems that allow coal power plants to run at a partial-load level of under 20 percent. Modernized coal-fuelled power plants are capable of scaling between partial load level of under 20 percent.Modernized coal-fuelled power plants are capable of scaling between partial load at three percentage points per minute, Schiffer says, providing security to the energy supply even as the amount of installed renewable capacity continues to grow. ""Coal provides the same flexibility as gas in power generation.Thus coal is not in contrast with an increased use of renewable energies, but instead coal and renewables complement one another and are partners in meeting present and future energy needs."" Nevertheless clean coal will only have a future if policymakers recognize its benefits, say both Schiffer and Sumner.According to Schiffer it is vital that an accord formed at the Paris climate summit in December should provide incentives for the sector to deploy advanced coal-fueled technologies, including CC(U)S, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This would be less costly than relying solely on renewable energy.""Encouraging investment in the more efficient use of coal has to be part of the solution. Eliminating coal use would push many back into the Dark Ages.""\l"

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh179","Assessing co-benefits of climate change","February 3, 2016 Wednesday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Feb. 3 -- Many measures aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have other positive effects on other aspects of the economy. Some of these co-benefits can be directly translated into financial terms (e.g. savings from reduced fuel use) but others, like improved health or preserved biodiversity, need to be estimated. Better understanding and assessment of the co-benefits of climate change mitigation could thus greatly help countries around the world adopt bolder mitigation measures. Taking into account such co-benefits can radically change the picture and demonstrate that action can pay off not only in the long term but also in the short to medium term.The most obvious of these co-benefits will be on public health. Air pollution and climate change are different phenomena, but they are closely linked. The burning of fossil fuels is the major source of both air pollutants and greenhouse gases. Thus, many actions taken to reduce emissions from these sources will help improve air quality and address climate change at the same time. The WHO estimates the total number of premature deaths due to air pollution to be 7 million per year, with about 5.9 million in Asia. Estimates show that the reduction of GHG emissions by half by 2050 would reduce premature deaths due to air pollution by 20-40%, depending on the country. The mitigation of short-lived climate pollutants would have positive climate effects (such as significantly reducing the rate of sea-level rise by 2050) but would also avoid 2.4 million deaths per year caused by outdoor air pollution.The health impacts of air pollution were estimated to cost the equivalent of $1.6 trillion in 2010. In almost half of the countries in Europe and North America, air pollution costs represent more than 10% of GDP, several times the annual economic growth in most countries. Reducing air pollution would therefore release important funds. Some researchers state that the health benefit of pollution-reduction could reach $200 per tonne of CO2 reduced. In East Asia, the benefits are expected to be 10-70 times the marginal abatement cost in 2030.There are also many other co-benefits to reducing GHG emissions in different sectors, in particular energy, transport and agriculture: resource efficiency, economic security, sustainability of ecosystems and protection of biodiversity as well as economic dynamism. A reduced dependence on fossil fuels lessens the risks of disruption for importing countries and lowers the potential economic losses caused by price volatility, while actually saving money from the cutback in fuel use. Moreover, transitioning to a low carbon economy, with all the adaptation measures that it implies would also create new job opportunities and benefit the economy. Co-benefits can actually offset the costs of mitigation initiatives, especially for investments in renewable energy sources and energy efficiency. In some forest projects, for example, non-climate co-benefits represented 53-92% of total benefits.The co-benefits and the detrimental effects of mitigation strategies must always be identified, so as to take an integrated approach that fully considers all costs and benefits. For instance, some air pollution-reduction initiatives, such as the increased use of energy from commercial biomass, would effectively reduce GHG emissions but could have a negative impact on biodiversity. This shows the need for a coordination of initiatives that takes into account different interactions.Member states of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) have been working successfully to gradually reduce and prevent air pollution from the US reaching the EU and Russia, through the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution and its Gothenburg protocol, the first legally binding instrument to reduce short-lived climate pollutants. UNECE is also playing a key role in implementing stricter emissions and efficiency standards for all types of motor vehicles through the World Forum for Harmonisation of Vehicle Regulations. In addition, UNECE is working on developing best practices for methane management, on fostering cleaner energy production from wood and is a key player in the Transport, Health and Environment Pan-European Programme (THE PEP) alongside the WHO. All of these activities directly contribute to a better understanding and the optimisation of co-benefits of climate change mitigation.Taking into account co-benefits, it is estimated that up to 90% of the reductions in GHG emissions required to prevent temperatures rising above 2degC could be achieved through measures that are in the direct interest of the countries undertaking them. This creates stronger incentives to take action, at national and international levels.The European Union has been a key player in climate action since the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol. It has been constantly advocating for more ambitious mitigation measures and taking the lead in setting ambitious targets for emission reductions, even after the lack of international agreement in Copenhagen in 2009. Ahead of COP 21, it committed to reducing its emissions by at least 40% by 2030. Co-benefits could prove a useful argument in its dialogue with developed and developing countries in favour of decisive action to implement the Paris Agreement and in the foreseen revision of targets every five years.We should not underestimate the benefits. We should not forget the threats. We must act now.(Christian Friis Bach is Under Secretary-General of the United Nations, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE).

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh185","Dealing with the adaptation gap","December 3, 2015 Thursday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Dec. 3 -- Over the next few weeks, Duncan has agreed to run a series of posts by participants in the recent USAID-IDS workshop on adaptive management, to share their ideas, insights and suggestions. As co-designer and facilitator of the workshop, I wanted to kick-off with a summary of my opening remarks.Adaptive management is very different from traditional aid approaches. Andrew Natsios, former USAID administrator, famously described how the strategic and managerial agendas of development evolved over time in a landmark paper. In it he argues that the principles of scientific management, developed by Frederick Taylor and famously implemented by Henry Ford in the early 20th century, have come to exert a disproportionate influence on the aid enterprise. 'Fordism' is about standardization and control, change efforts that are driven top-down, and a reliance on management planning and execution of repeatable tasks.Adaptive management by contrast, (to the extent that it is clearly defined), is much more about interaction and change, and requires much more focus on emergence and context. Instead of planning and precision, adaptive management places greater emphasis on capacities and processes to generate productive novelty in day-to-day work.To put it another way, traditional management assumes we have the answers and puts in place an engine for delivering those answers in as replicable a fashion as possible. Adaptive management assumes we don't have the answers, and puts in place a network to generate those answers when and where they are needed.So why do we in development need adaptive management? Because development is best seen as a complex adaptive process that emerges from the interaction of a whole range of factors and actors. It is fundamentally shaped by diverse behaviours across dynamic networks. In such cases, traditional management doesn't work, because it is based on an ordered and predictable response: an answer delivery system built on the insight, innovation and leadership of people who work far from the problem.However, the evidence from many different sectors is that responding adequately to complexity requires an answer discovery approach: an adaptive response rather than an ordered one, which tries to trust and empower those closest to the problem.Ramalingam 1So how are we dealing with this? My concern is that the typical response of many development organisations has been to respond to complexity with directives and systems that seek to restore a sense of order and control. It's what I call doing the wrong thing righter.We work in systems where both the parts and the people are assumed to be replaceableDoing the above ad infinitum has led us to teeter on the edge of an £daptation gap', which might be defined as follows:""The gulf between the growing need for adaptive management and the level of capabilities, cash and commitment that we have in place to meet this need""So how do we address this gap? Well, I think it is increasingly evident that knowledge and learning is a core capability for adaptive management.In practical terms, that means individuals, groups, organisations and networks need to invest in enhanced capabilities to:-specify interventions that are relevant to context, drawing on insights of those in that context-implement interventions in ways that support the ongoing and real-time sensing of information, insights and ideas from the internal organisational system, from partners and peers, and most importantly from communities and others embedded in operational contexts;-make sense of this information, insights and ideas in ways that is relevant for the programme or policy, to support more appropriate, contextually relevant decision making-make appropriate changes and adjustments at a strategic and tactical level.-Do all of the above on an ongoing basis, in continuous cycles of 'learning by doing'.At a minimum, aid organisations that addressed the adaptation gap would,:-Operate from the ""end-user-back"", and not from the ""organisation-forward""-Develop knowledge, information and data capabilities and tools to anticipate and interpret problems, emerging needs, and to respond to uncertainty and change-Empower organisations and teams to make decentralized decisions based on a shared understanding of organizational purpose and values-Foster new kinds of networks and partnerships to achieve goals in a highly collaborative fashion-Develop and adapt business models as necessary to ensure relevance in a highly fluid and dynamic worldIn case you missed it, the great post here on adaptive management and Sasquatches two weeks back illustrates exactly this kind of working in practice. But as Lisa points out, such case studies are rarely spotted, and even more rarely documented. We need to get better at learning from positive deviants, who are able to apply adaptive approaches despite the considerable constraints they face. And we need to network them together, to bring about wholesale change in the way development works.The stakes couldn't be higher. During the End to End Review in DFID, which led to the development of the Smart Rules and a whole host of adaptive management-focused reforms, there was repeated reference to 'the battle for the soul of the organisation'. I think this applies more widely: the relevance and value of the aid system in the 21st century is fundamentally dependent on how well we manage to bring about more adaptive changes in how we work.That probably sounds a bit heavy, so let me give a last, lighter, word to Dilbert, who as ever, anticipates the trends in development jargon and spin by about a decade.(Ben Ramalingam, newly appointed leader of the Digital and Technology cluster at IDS, and author of Aid on the Ben_Ramalingam post beardEdge of Chaos, shares some thoughts on £daptive management').It isn't just citizens and NGOs that truly care about a responsible environmental policy. Entrepreneurs like me care too. In fact, industrial companies might even be particularly valuable in the fight against climate change.When 195 states meet for the Climate Change Conference in Paris from 30 November to 11 December, the German mechanical engineering industry hopes for a comprehensive and ambitious agreement. Not only because we have an obvious interest in a sustainable planet, but also because it will be good for businesses in Europe.Not too long ago, industry in Germany had to adapt to a historic decision with significant effects on the country's environmental policy. In 2011, following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, Berlin decided to close all German nuclear power plants by 2022.Not every entrepreneur was excited about having energy policy turned upside down within a few weeks. However, today the German mechanical engineering industry looks at the shift to a cleaner economy as an opportunity rather than a threat to business.As president of VDMA, I speak for 3,100 mainly small- and medium-sized companies that develop and produce machinery for manufacturers. So, when we talk about lower emissions and more efficiency in industry, mechanical engineering is at the very centre of the discussion, because in many cases our machines are the enablers for the change.My assessment is that an ambitious agreement in Paris is technologically feasible. In fact, European industry is famous for its innovative capacity. Our companies will have a competitive advantage when global demand for clean technologies rises.Let me give you one example. Each year, Germany brews about 100,000 hectolitres of beer. In this process, hot water of above 60 degrees Celsius is needed. This costs a lot of energy. With modern hot water pumping systems, it is possible to regulate supply streams more efficiently. In the end, brewers can save up to 47% of energy costs.There are thousands of similar cases in every sector of European industry.However, investments in green technologies are not simply triggered through tough environmental legislation. The framework must also take account of current and future business models and be realistic.Firstly, industry can adapt - but not every few years. What we need is a long-term and robust climate agreement in Paris that companies can rely on. Machines can easily cost several hundreds of thousands of euros and are built to work for decades. Entrepreneurs will only invest in green solutions when they get a return on investment.Secondly, you won't save emissions by relocating production. This is why we need a COP21 agreement that sets standards globally. Companies worldwide need roughly the same requirements to prevent a shift of production to places with laxer environmental laws.Under these conditions, I am confident that European industrial companies will be beneficial to the fight against climate change. Just a few months ago, we asked VDMA's members if they expected a cleaner approach to energy production to have positive or negative effects for their business: 62% of them consider it a future opportunity and 54% expect to enter new business segments.An ambitious agreement in Paris is not opposed to the interests of industry. This is why it makes sense to invite industry to the table when discussing environmental policy. We are, in fact, a part of the solution.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh190","That was the year it was: 2015 in review","January 11, 2016 Monday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Jan. 11 -- Crucial 2015 developments will undoubtedly impact the Bangladesh economy during 2016. These include: U.N. members had transited from the MDG (Millennium Development Goals) orbit into the SDG (Sustainable Development Goals) trajectory, about which much has been said in this newspaper; the TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) adoption potentially threatened our dominant RMG exports in the largest export market, the United States, with which GSP (Generalised System of Preferences) divergences and TICFA (Trade and Investment Cooperation Framework Agreement) negotiations remained stalemated; and, of course, our graduation from a low to a middle-income ranking.Yet, how economically sturdy our ship remains in an increasingly choppy sea will likely be most influenced by the ghost of the 2013-4 strikes/stoppages: foreign interest, with particular emphasis on investment, will arguably be the tipping point of our 2016 fate. With infrastructural development as a strategic goal, backed up by monumental projects, foreign investment certainly established itself as a need. Attracting foreign investment depends as much for its success on how good we look economically and to what extent have we crossed the political Rubicon. As such, the review moves from the most positive performances/indicators to the most negative, with the mixed bag in between. This is not a comprehensive survey, just an interpretive overview, highlighting a possible 2016 pathway.Among the economic fundamentals, growth and inflation rates shed useful light as to where we are this year. The Asian Development Bank, International Monetary Fund, and World Bank confirm our 2015 growth-rate to be in the 6.5 per cent area. The figure is consistent with our past trends; but when seen in relative global terms, our true accomplishments (whatever they may be) get a little more shine. The world as a whole managed a 2.8 per cent growth, sustaining the slow 2007-10 Great Recession recovery. Yet, behind that figure, advanced industrialised countries did less well than emerging countries, with Japan and the European Union registering even less than half the global average (1.1 per cent and 1.5 per cent respectively), while the United States fell slightly below (with 2.7 per cent). China and India did better than what we did, but how we utilised 2015 to parcel out some of our key infrastructural projects and special economic zones to both probably carried more future mileage than immediately apparent. Current predictions to register a similar growth-rate next year show a good start, but we need to perform better to move up the middle-income ranks.Our inflation rate carries mixed messages. It fell to 6.4 from 7.1 per cent last year, keeping the downward trend that began in 2011 when we actually notched a double-digit score (10.9 per cent). Yet, that also means investment was low-keyed, particularly foreign investment. Strikes/Stoppages constrained us in 2013-4, to be followed by the assassination of foreigners in October 2015. We began preparing in 2015 to expand state-driven infrastructural projects, or depend upon non-western investment sources, such as from China or Japan (since western investment involves increasingly tougher conditions, mostly in labour relations and factory working environment). We were also invited by the International Financial Corporation to float Taka bonds in the global market. With our dominant export markets in the west, 2015 implicitly pushed us to start accenting not only new trading partners, but also non-democratic ones (India and Japan being exceptions).More explicit was our decision, along with so many others, to join China's Asian Investment Infrastructure Bank (AIIB), while repairing relations with the World Bank following the 2013 Padma Bridge breakdown. It mirrors our efforts to expand neighbourly trade and investment relations. India got more heavily engaged this year, but our forays extend east too: to Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand specifically, while the Bangladesh-Bhutan-India-Nepal (BBIN) corridor was initiated against the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar (BCIM) counterpart (which is already making news through an annual Kolkata-Kunmin car rally, paving the way for trade volumes to flow). Singapore, South Korea, and Sri Lanka have all expressed interest in opening special export processing zones.As the above discussions hint, 2015 was a good year for Bangladesh's Asian profile, just as pressures and diminished export returns from the West climbed. The ghost of factory fires continue to haunt us in 2015, just as the U.S. GSP denial not only constrains our exports, but also with the TPP inclusion of Vietnam, our relative position worsened: Vietnam's RMG export growth-rate to the United States during 2015 was double ours, even before the TPP provisions kick in; our $5.6 billion share of the $42.6 billion U.S. market during 2015 might end up being the peak point unless quick remedies, like TPP membership, emerge quickly.Even the mixed environmental picture in 2015 could take a turn towards the worst: our prime minister won an environmental award, but our absence in Paris for COP-21 proved conspicuous, especially as the agreement emerging from that summit is expected to be less favourable for environmentally needy, less developed countries against the perils of climate change. We confirmed a strong partnership with The Netherlands on this front against sea-level threats, but we need much more. If other developed countries cannot step in to support our salvation, they key 2015 message may be to go to the private market, since our middle-income entrant also began closing aid gateways for us this year.This is where the greatest 2015 concern might lie: inviting foreign investors. We almost got the breakthrough until the October killings of foreigners revamped alerts the world over. Against all the promises outl"
"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh191","Climate change is real: Time to act decisively","December 5, 2015 Saturday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Dec. 5 -- About 200 countries are participating in the the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which began in Paris on November 30. The leaders included President Barack Obama of the United States, President Xi Jinping of China and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of india. All these three countries are major contributors to pollution of the globe.As a result of widespread degradation of environment in the form of trillions of tons of melting ice, a rise in the sea level by a couple of inches, droughts in many parts of the world, heat wave, monster storms, devastating floods, forest fires, and a series of tornadoes have endangered the planet. Over and above, overpopulation, desertification, deforestation and endangered species pose environment problem too.The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate change (UNFCCC) in Rio de Janeiro conference in June of 1992, also known as the Earth Summit, adopted a resolution to stabilise atmospheric concentration of Greenhouse gases at a level that would prevent dangerous interference with the climate. This was followed by another climate summit in Kyoto in Japan on December 11 of 1997. The Kyoto protocol planned to reduce Greenhouse gas emissions on a global scale. Industrialised countries were committed to stabilisation or reduction of 5 per cent in their emissions from 2008 to 2012.Biggest polluter, the United States, under the leadership of President George W. Bush, had walked out of the Kyoto protocol. Another international summit on climate change took place in Copenhagen in 2009. The Copenhagen accord agreed to stabilise Greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system while agreeing to reduce global emissions to hold the increase in global temperature below 2 degree Celsius.Despite the adoption of binding agreement in two significant international conferences, there has been no improvement of global climate. Extreme hot weather, burning of forests, melting of ice in the Arctic, flooding and less snowfalls are major indicators of global warming. According to a recent article published in Digests, global climate has been affected as a result of temperature in the Earth's surface which increased by 0.6 Celsius over the last two centuries. Most of the warming observed in the past 50 years is attributed to human activities, in particular to burning of fossil fuels. The current increase in global temperature goes beyond natural climate variability. Changes in the Arctic climate which has been recorded twice will also affect rest of the world. It may be noted that Digests is published under the Green Facts Scientific Board.Therefore, the claim by most lawmakers of the Republican Party that global climate change is a hoax is divorced from reality. A glaring example is the United States. Hurricane Sandy, worsened by sea level rise in New Jersey in 2012, had caused more than $ 67 billion in damage and claimed 159 lives, apart from losses in business worth $ 30 billion. A drought is still hurting people in California, apart from burning of forests, including Washington State.This writer organised a seminar on climate change at the BCS and Foreign Service Academy in 1993 for the benefit of newly recruited foreign service officers. Presided over by retired Foreign Secretary Nazrul Islam, the seminar was participated, among others, by Professor Kazi Zaker Hossain of the department of Zoology of Dhaka University, Professor Aminul Islam of the Geography department of Dhaka University, Dr Ainun Nishat of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Dr A Atiq Rahman, Director, Bangladesh Centre for Advanced studies, who was also a consultant for Centre of Research, Oxford University. They said that the problems of CO2 emissions and pollution are mainly the product of the industrialised world. They correctly feared that countries like China, India and Brazil would become big polluters.This writer also took part as a member of the Bangladesh delegation at the UN climate change conference in Bonn in June in 1998.The French summit meeting on climate change is facing problems from developing countries, led by India, to strike a binding deal. Being the world's third largest Greenhouse gas polluter, Indian Prime Minister Modi said, ""Climate change was not of our making and it is the result of global warming that came from the prosperity and progress of an industrial age powered by fossil fuel"". But the fact remains that one of India's largest and most productive coal fields at Jharia in northern part of India has been burning for many years. It has become one of the longest burning fires in the world. Modi instructed officials to put out the fires before joining the summit in France to attend COP 21. Jharia is one of thousands of coalfields on fire that are polluting the climate.For a welcome change in US attitude, President Obama is taking climate change very seriously. As the leader of the world's largest economy and the second largest emitter, he by took responsibility to do something about it. Similarly, Chinese President Xi Jinping took up climate change seriously. It is very important for China and the United States to be firmly committed to the right direction of building a new model of cooperation.Both the US and China agreed on November 11, 2014 to reduce greenhouse gas emission by 26 to 28 per cent by 2025 while China announced to peak CO2 emissions around 2030 and to increase non-fossil fuel share of all energies to around 20 per cent by 2030. Xi also announced during his state visit to the US in September this year that China would assist poor countries to improve climate change by offering $ 3.1 billion. The pledge by 19 countries, including the US, to double their investment by 2020 to $ 20 billion would help poor countries in making a transition to a new economic model that relies less on the use of carbon. Similarly, the US State Department pledged $ 248 million to help the world's least developed countries (LDCs) not to rely on use of carbon. Microsoft founder Bill Gates also pledged to invest in moving clean-energy technologies from laboratories to market places. The US also contributes $ 10 billion to the UN Green Climate Fund to help less developed countries towards transition to cleaner fuel and to pay for loss and damage.It is hoped that developing countries would follow the industrialised states in controlling pollution of climate because scientific research has revealed that the destructive effects of climate change have already begun to sweep the planet. The developing countries should join hands with industrially developed countries to find a binding agreement at the summit which will end on December 11.The writer is a retired diplomat.Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh195","Climate change will throw more people into poverty","November 16, 2015 Monday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Nov. 16 -- On November 08, 2015 the World Bank said that climate change could drive over 100 million people more into poverty by 2030 in absence of right policies to keep the poor safe from extreme weather and rising sea level. In a report the bank said, if global warming and its effects on the poor were not accounted for in development efforts to end poverty - one of 17 new UN goals adopted in September 2015 - would be impossible to achieve. It added that the aim of keeping the rise of global temperature within an internationally agreed limit of 2 degrees Celsius is not an ambitious plan. To reduce the effects of climate change, efforts must also cushion poor people from any negative repercussions.The World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim said in a statement that ""Climate change hits the poorest the hardest, and our challenge now is to protect tens of millions of people from falling into extreme poverty because of a changing climate"". If development progresses slowly the bank's estimated victim of another 100 million poor by 2030 is on top of 900 million expected to be living in extreme poverty. The World Bank senior director for climate change John Roome said that in 2015, the bank puts the number of poor at 702 million people. Climate change is already hurting them through decreased crop yields, floods washing away assets and livelihoods, and a bigger threat of diseases like malaria. He described ending poverty and tackling climate change as ""the defining issues of our generation"". He told, ""The best way forward is to tackle poverty alleviation and climate change in an integrated strategy"".Since the main assets of the poor people are often their makeshift homes and degrading land, and their losses are largely uninsured, the poor families are more vulnerable to climate stresses than the rich. Low-income households in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are particularly at serious risk of having their hard-won gains wiped out by climate-linked disasters, forcing them back into extreme poverty. The report warns that, climate policies can do little to alter the amount of global warming that will happen, between now and 2030, making it vital to invest more in adaptation measures and broader ways to make people more resilient. A payout from a regional catastrophe risk scheme helped speed the response when Cyclone Pam devastated Vanuatu this March 2015. A national programme providing cash and food in return for work on community projects was quickly expanded when drought in Ethiopia led to a hunger crisis in 2011.In the next 15 years, the report said that better health coverage and social safety nets for all, together with targeted improvements such as early warning systems and hardier crops, flood defences could prevent or offset most of the negative effects of climate change on poverty. Stephane Hallegatte, a senior World Bank economist who led the team that prepared the report said that ""We have a window of opportunity to achieve our poverty objectives in the face of climate change, provided we make wise policy choices now"". Roome highlighted the need to roll out good policies faster, and ensure development projects consider climate projections, so that new infrastructure is not damaged in the future. The report, released ahead of a UN climate summit from November 30, 2015 to December 11, 2015 where a new deal to curb global warming is due to be agreed, warned that adaptation limits beyond 2030, the world's ability to adapt to unabated climate change will be limited,The World Bank said that immediate policies are needed that will bring emissions to zero by the end of this twenty-first century to rein in the longer-term impacts on poverty. Some of those will have benefits for the poor, such as more energy efficiency, cleaner air and better public transport facilities. Others could increase energy and food prices, which represent a large share of poor people's expenditures. But, it added, policy shifts need not threaten short-term progress against poverty provided they are well-designed and international support is made available.The report also said that for example, savings from eliminating fossil fuel subsidies could be reinvested in assistance schemes to help poor families cope with higher fuel costs. Or governments could introduce carbon or energy taxes and recycle the revenues through a universal cash transfer that would benefit the poor. The international community can help by providing financial and technological support for things like crop research, public transport, insurance schemes, and weather forecasting systems.In the meanwhile ministers and negotiators from more than 75 nations have made headway in talks ahead of a crunch UN climate summit. But France's foreign minister Laurent Fabius said on November 10, 2015 that the ""the task ahead is considerable"". Laurent Fabius, who will preside over the conference in Paris to be held from November 30, 2015 to December 11, 2015, told after the three days of talks that ended on November 10, 2015 had been an important step and ""progress has been made on at least five points"". But he warned, ""the task ahead is considerable"".The UN climate chief Christiana Figueres added, ""It continues to be entirely possible to come to an agreement... despite all the challenges in front of us."" Fabius announced that 117 heads of state and government - including US President Barack Obama, China's Xi Jinping, Narendra Modi of India and Russia's Vladimir Putin - have confirmed they will attend the summit, tasked with inking a pact to stave off dangerous levels of global warming. A rough draft of that hoped-for agreement has been drawn up by rank-and-file diplomats. The ministers are set to sign the final deal at the end of the Conference of Parties (COP) in Paris. The deal will be underpinned by national pledges to curb greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels blamed for climate change. The ""pre-COP"" meeting sought to identify areas of potential compromise on issues still dividing global nations and thereby avoid a repeat of the 2009 Copenhagen summit which ended without a binding global pact.Laurent Fabius said that there was momentum towards ensuring that countries ratchet up their efforts to slash carbon pollution beyond pledges submitted ahead of the summit. He said that ""A review should take place every five years... to prepare an upward revision of national plans"". Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest crude oil exporter, filed its climate pledge on November 10, 2015, saying up to 130 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year would be ""avoided"" by 2030. ""'Matter of survival' - Current national plans would yield average global temperatures three degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times-far beyond the 2 degree Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) limit that scientists say is the threshold for dangerous warming. Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, Peru's environment minister, told that ""The COP21 will put in place the mechanism to close the gap. Getting to 2 degree Celsius depends on boosting our ambition"". Fabius said that enshrining the principle that nations would not be allowed to backtrack on their carbon-cutting promises is also gaining ground.Another make-or-break issue on the table in the three-day talks was money for developing nations to help them decarbonise their economies, and shore up defences against unavoidable climate impacts. Thoriq Ibrahim, Minister of the Environment and Energy for the Maldives, one of many small island states whose very existence is threatened by rising seas, told that ""Climate finance was very central"" to the discussions and ""Adaptation is a matter of survival for us. Nobody wants to leave the Maldives, we are there to stay"".African leaders said they were looking forward to the talks for solutions to electrify their continent, grow its economies and keep their young people from fleeing abroad. The 195-nation UN climate forum has officially adopted the goal of limiting global warming to 2 degree Celsius. But many vulnerable and poor nations are pushing for that threshold to be lowered to 1.5 degree Celsius. Recent scientific studies have shown that even if the 2 degree Celsius goal is attained, the impact could be devastating in many parts of the world. According to a study published by Climate Central, a US-based research group, a 2-degree Celsius rise would submerge land currently occupied by 280 million people, while an increase of 4 degree Celsius would cover areas home to 600 million. Bangladesh is also one of the highly climate change venerable countries in the world.But one thing is certain that monetary compensation to the affected poor countries by the rich countries is not the solution to the climate problem since the entire globe is in danger of climate warming since air pollution and climate warming know no boundary. For example, developed American and European countries are of late experiencing the bite of climate change. Climate change is a global problem and it has to be faced globally through globally avoiding green house gas emission to save global population from extinction.The writer is a retired professor of Economics, BCS General Education Cadre.Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh196","Bring on the SDGs","August 6, 2015 Thursday","Dhaka Courier","Dhaka, Aug. 6 -- The 193 member states of the UN have recently reached agreement on the draft outcome document that will constitute the new sustainable development agenda. It will be adopted this September by world leaders at the Sustainable Development Summit in New York, and be implemented over the next 15 years. The new goals would be effective from January 1, 2016.Concluding a negotiating process that has spanned more than two years and has featured unprecedented participation of civil society, countries agreed to an ambitious agenda that features 17 new sustainable development goals that aim to end poverty and promote prosperity and people's well-being while protecting the environment by 2030.More than 150 world leaders are expected to attend the Sustainable Development Summit at the UN headquarters in New York between 25-27 September to formally adopt the outcome document of the new sustainable agenda. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will attend the SDG Summit.The new sustainable development agenda builds on the success of the Millennium Development Goals, which helped more than 700 million people escape poverty. The eight Millennium Development Goals, adopted in 2000, aimed at an array of issues that included slashing poverty, hunger, disease, gender inequality, and access to water and sanitation by 2015. The new sustainable development goals, and the broader sustainability agenda, go much further, addressing the root causes of poverty and the universal need for development that works for all people.The preamble of the 29-page text, ""Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,"" states: ""We are resolved to free the human race within this generation from the tyranny of poverty and want and to heal and secure our planet for the present and for future generations. We are determined to take the bold and transformative steps which are urgently needed to shift the world onto a sustainable and resilient path. As we embark on this collective journey, we pledge that no one will be left behind.""On from RioAt the Rio+20 Conference of 2012, member states agreed to launch a process to develop a set of sustainable development goals, which will build upon the Millennium Development Goals. The Millennium Development Goals have proven that goal-setting can lift millions out of poverty, improve well-being and provide vast new opportunities for better lives. It was agreed that the new goals would be global in nature and universally applicable to all countries while taking into account different national realities, capacities and levels of development and respecting national policies and priorities.The negotiations were co-facilitated by the UN Permanent Representative of Ireland, Ambassador David Donohue, and the UN Permanent Representative of Kenya, Ambassador Macharia Kamau, over two years. The inclusive and transparent consultations by member states, with the strong engagement of civil society and other stakeholders, have served as a basis for the conclusion of the intergovernmental negotiations on the emerging universal and people-centred agenda.Core elementsThe outcome document highlights poverty eradication as the overarching goal of the new development agenda and has at its core the integration of the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. The emerging development agenda is unique in that it calls for action by all countries, poor, rich and middle-income. Member states pledge that as they embark on this collective journey, no one will be left behind. The 'five Ps'-people, planet, prosperity, peace, and partnership-capture the broad scope of the agenda.The 17 sustainable goals and 169 targets aim at tackling key systemic barriers to sustainable development such as inequality, unsustainable consumption and production patterns, inadequate infrastructure and lack of decent jobs. The environmental dimension of sustainable development is covered in the goals on oceans and marine resources and on ecosystems and biodiversity, bringing core issues into the goal and target framework.The means of implementation outl"

Because of its special geographical feature, Bangladesh is afflicted by a multitude of natural hazards including flood, tropical cyclones, tornadoes, tsunamis, drought, earthquakes, riverbank erosion, landslides, salinity intrusion and arsenic contamination. To make matters worse, experts say that in future, floods, cyclones and other weather-related hazards are likely to become more severe and frequent in Bangladesh due to the global warming.

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh198","Focusing on urban interests in SDGs","October 1, 2015 Thursday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Oct. 1 -- When member states come together to finalize the sustainable development goals later this week, they will not only be agreeing to such historic aims as ending poverty within 15 years. They will also be formalizing a whole new way of conceptualizing and strategizing around international development and sustainability. Of course, many of the SDGs are simple extensions of the Millennium Development Goals framework that has guided global development efforts over the past decade and a half. There is no doing away with, for instance, priorities on hunger, education and gender equality. Given that the MDGs made progress on these aims but did not finish the job, the SDGs will seek to pick up where efforts on the previous goals left off, with some tweaks.Yet the SDGs are not only far more expansive than the MDGs; they also address key issues that have risen to the top of the global agenda over the past 15 years. Taking ""urgent"" steps to combat climate change, for instance, now makes up a formal development goal - SDG 13.Likewise, urbanization is now being formally seen as a potent, and similarly urgent, component of both anti-poverty and sustainability efforts. As a result, cities and human settlements make up the sole focus of SDG 11, to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.Indeed, many argue that how the world deals with its cities in coming years will do much to define the overall success of the SDGs. As U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson said in June, ""Cities are where the battle for sustainable development will be won - or lost if we fail.""More than half of the world's population now live in urban areas, and that proportion is expected to rise to more than two-thirds just by the middle of this century. Further, while cities are the clear economic engines for nearly all countries, they also produce almost three-quarters of all greenhouse gases.Cities are an intrinsic component of nearly all traditional development aims, yet for a variety of reasons urban policy has rarely been seen as a tool in itself to either tackle the negatives of urban areas or leverage their positives. The MDGs, for instance, had only one urban-specific objective - to see a ""significant improvement"" in the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers. And that, too, was a target subsumed under the broader goal of environmental sustainability.For the first time, SDG 11 will now allow policymakers, planners, civil society and the development community to see cities themselves - physical spaces with a host of their own well-integrated systems - as a tool by which to achieve anti-poverty and sustainability aims. Importantly, the goal could also see a reappraisal of the key role played by mayors and other local officials in these critical national processes, too.Certainly the scope is already inherent to Goal 11 for a momentous shift in strategy, as well as a bolstering of opportunity. As with all of the SDGs, Goal 11 is made up of a broad aim girded by a series of more specific thematic targets, as well as indicator metrics on how to physically measure progress on those targets. Goal 11's targets cover the traditional concerns around housing, slums, transportation and more. Yet it also deals with a host of environmental and climate-related issues, including air quality, waste management, resilience, and preparedness around natural disasters. The goal even touches on innovative and unprecedented aims around cultural and natural heritage as well as green and public space.""A group of urban experts, including myself, had been working hard to get an urban goal included in the post-2015 SDGs, because many of these urban challenges would have been missed otherwise, such as affordable housing, sanitation and transport,"" said Peter Head, executive director of the Ecological Sequestration Trust, a think tank. ""2015 has been a good year for enabling cities to take a strong role in addressing global challenges . Now the big challenge of implementation begins.""Development implementers are already recognizing, and reacting to, the sea change brought about by Goal 11.""We see SDG 11 as very significant as it brings a renewed emphasis on urban issues and, for the first time, puts cities front and center on the international development agenda. This is definitely a shift in focus,"" said Sharon Van Pelt, democracy and governance practice director at Chemonics, a Washington-based international development company.""While local governance has been a part of development programs for many years, SDG 11 looks more holistically at the catalytic role of subnational governments . to encourage economic growth and job creation, and safe, open space,"" she continued. ""Thus, the urban SDG and its corresponding targets encourage the development and implementation of more integrated development strategies and solutions within cities, where the growing majority of the world's inhabitants live.""The push to include a ""stand-alone"" cities goal in the SDGs did receive pushback over the past two years, as it built up momentum. For years, after all, international efforts have focused primarily on rural areas as particularly in need of assistance and capacity building. Today, some remain concerned that a renewed focus on urban areas could divert focus from rural areas, though Goal 11 tries to view these as ends of a continuum rather than separate entities.""It is easy to slip into the 'urban versus rural' dichotomy, [but] it is not one versus the other. Indeed, such thinking contributed to a swing away from urban over the past decades in terms of development programming,"" Van Pelt said. ""It will be critical to set the discussion so as to design and implement programs that focus on developing inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable cities, and the positive effects this has on urban, peri-urban and rural areas."" For example, building better roads - thus facilitating both markets and value chains - can have equal impact on all types of areas and settlements, she noted.Either way, Chemonics is already starting to change its planning around both Goal 11 and the SDGs framework more generally. And across the sector, development experts are seeing the presence of Goal 11 as encouraging a more comprehensive approach to many development concerns.""SDG 11 will push the development community to design and implement projects that are not only more urban-focused,"" Van Pelt said, ""but that also require multisector, interdisciplinary strategies and approaches to help cities address the plethora of inter-related challenges they face.""In addition to the new Goal 11, most of the rest of the 16 SDGs have important urban components to them, from energy to infrastructure to governance and beyond. The presence of Goal 11, however, allows for these thematic focuses to be approached on a cross-sectoral basis.Beyond the SDGs: How to deliver water and sanitation to everyone, everywhereIt was no surprise that sanitation was among the most off-track of all the targets in the Millennium Development Goals, how do we change this in the new global goals? WaterAid's Margaret Batty shares in this guest commentary.The international organization WaterAid, for instance, focuses exclusively on issues related to water and sanitation - two concerns that are explicitly addressed in the SDGs, under Goal 6. Yet planners within the organization say the comprehensive urban focus of Goal 11 offers an important backstop to the sector-specific aims of Goal 6. Lisa Schechtman, WaterAid's policy and advocacy director, says this dual approach was the result of lessons learned under the MDGs.""Under the old MDG framework, these two issues were joined together under a single goal, which created a barrier to addressing either issue holistically, or to looking at true root causes of poverty,"" she said. ""Goal 11 will bolster WaterAid's long-time focus on addressing the water and sanitation crises in urban and peri-urban areas, as well as our partnerships with housing rights organizations . which view water and sanitation as core to quality housing and shelter.""The finalization of Goal 11 and the other SDGs will do much to reorient the development community to see the city as a potent tool in achieving development aims. But the summit at the end of this month will be only the beginning of this next chapter.Next up will be the continued debate around indicators for each of the goals - a process that will have significant influence over how exactly national government choose to implement the broad vision of the 17 goals.Already, substantive disagreements have broken out among stakeholders around how exactly governments should be required to analyze and report on progress they're making on the SDGs, for Goal 11 as for the rest of the new framework. Public input on this discussion is being sought in multiple phases over the coming months, and the debate will be concluded only in the spring, when the UN Statistical Commission meets to finalize the indicators.In terms of extending this new urban focus, however, all eyes will now be on the UN's Habitat III conference on cities, slated to take place in October 2016, in Quito, Ecuador. In a global debate that is just now picking up speed, the Habitat process will bring together the entire U.N. system and member states, along with civil society and other stakeholders to see through the urban discussion that has now been started through Goal 11. The eventual goal: an agreement on a 20-year global urbanization strategy called the New Urban Agenda.Coming in the aftermath of finalization of the post-2015 development agenda as well as the COP21 climate negotiations, Habitat III will be the first major opportunity for the international community to assess the accomplishments of 2015 and cement approaches to implementation. Cities, now recognized as a key part of this puzzle in their own right, are the natural place for that conversation to begin.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh199","Promoting 'go green' model of development","October 27, 2015 Tuesday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Oct. 27 -- Northeast Brazil boasts some of the world's most beautiful beaches, ribbons of white sand tracing a region known as ""a terra da felicidade"" - the land of happiness; but venture inland and a harsh, semi-arid landscape with some of the country's worst poverty emerges.Geographer Friedrich W. Freise, in a survey of the region, painted a bleak picture: ""The principle disintegrating agent is solar heat, which is operative many hours daily from a cloudless sky. The cracking and splintering effect . is great, and the surface is therefore widely strewn with sand and dust.""Freise made these observations in 1938 and he commented - rather hopelessly - on the prospects for reforestation to restore natural watersheds. ""There is strong evidence that man is utterly powerless here,"" he wrote.But today, ""green growth"" advocates are trying to prove Freise wrong, and they're relying in part on a tool he could not have referenced in 1938: microfinance.Microloans are a vital tool for farmers and rural entrepreneurs to upgrade their businesses or invest in the next growing season. But what happens to microfinance models when the next growing season never materializes? Or the one after that? Microfinance institutions can help answer those questions and can offer a key bridge to climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. And, according to some researchers, they better, if microlenders - and their clients - are going to weather the climate change era.Dry and getting drierDrought is no stranger to the northeast region of Brazil, where people have coped with and adapted to the stress of water scarcity for generations. But in recent years, drought-prone communities have seen a glimpse of what is projected to be a drier, hotter future.The region typically receives about 700 millimeters of rain per year. In 2014 it received 100 millimeters. The current drought is described as the worst in many decades, with roughly half a million households, at times, facing freshwater shortages. The last century was the hottest on record, and 96 million Brazilians were affected by climate-related disasters between 1991 and 2000. Those impacts were concentrated in the northeast. The country has long sought to find pathways for economic growth in the region, many of them involving large-scale infrastructure programs.The northeast region is served by Brazil's largest microfinance institution, Agroamigo, which reaches more than 800,000 clients. Microfinance institutions like Agroamigo offer lending tools that can help people unserved by traditional financial institutions access credit, start and sustain businesses, and make productivity-enhancing investments, like better seed varieties, or improved irrigation.In many cases, microfinance institutions are not yet accounting for the impacts of climate change, or providing financing products designed to address them. But as the effects of climate change become more apparent, they may hurt borrowers' ability to repay their loans, causing default rates to rise. The overall viability of some microfinance business models could be at risk.In many parts of Latin America, it's already starting to happen. Microfinance lenders describe a situation where climate stress is harming their lending portfolios. Arantza Loza, a consultant with the Inter-American Development Bank's Multilateral Investment Fund, spoke with lenders, who told her climate change is becoming a problem.The lenders told her, ""We see our clients losing crops. we see our clients affected by . high electricity prices. We see our clients affected by electricity breaks .That is not only affecting them, it's also affecting me and the quality of my portfolio,"" she said.Many farmers and ranchers in northeast Brazil operate on the threshold of profitability, and one bad year can sink a small business. The worst drought in half a century could be just the beginning. Surface air temperatures are expected to increase up to 4.5 degrees Celsius while rainfall could decrease by 50 percent by the end of this century, according to the Brazilian Panel on Climate Change. Northeast Brazil stands at a climate change ""front l"
"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh200","Energy Security Status in Bangladesh","December 31, 2015 Thursday","Energy & Power","The present government of grand alliance is approaching completion of second year of the consecutive five-year terms in state power. It inherited a crisis-prone energy and power sector when it was voted to power in December 2008. Huge deficit of power grid caused unbearable power load shedding, supply shortage of natural gas in gas grid almost stagnated industrial growth and development. Government had to adopt contingency planning and adopt short, medium and long term planning for both power and energy sector development. There were huge challenges ranging from securing investment, arranging sustainable supply of primary fuel, developing infrastructure, reducing system loss, improving efficiency, structuring appropriate pricing, developing competent manpower.In some areas government achieved commendable successes and some areas it could not. In 2010 Government adopted updated Power System Master Plan (MSMP). But now changing circumstances requires further updating. It has now become a bit uncertain whether or not visions 2021 and 2030 of Power sector can be achieved. This write-up will attempt to objectively evaluate the performance of the government in the energy and power sector.In the prevailing socio economic and geo political environment managing energy sector challenges of Bangladesh is definitely not an easy task.But while making analysis and review of energy and power sector achievement and performance of the government one must recognize the major improvement achieved compared to situation of 2009.Though many major challenges still exist but the deepening crisis of 2009 could be successfully overcome.Objectives of PSMP 2010The prime objectives of Power System Master Plan 2010 were- Fuel diversity and sustainable supply of Fuels- Harnessing renewable energy sources - Demand Side Management (DSM) and- Energy Efficiency improvement proGram- Rationalize power tariff- Cross Boarder Power TradeFuel Diversity and Sustainable Supply of FuelsIt also failed to let exploration of the last cost option of own coal mining advance. On the other hand Bangladesh also failed to make significant progress in importing coal and LNG.In end 2015 the energy vision of 2021: power to all and achieving 24,000 MW power generation capacity appears truly uncertain.Comparative Scenario Power SystemAreas of Comparison As It Was in 2009 As it is in End 2015Generation Capacity (MW) 4942 11,817Highest Generation (MW) 3268 (6/01/2009) 8,177 (19/08/2015)Grid Substation Capacity (MVA) 15,870 24,720Distribution Line (KM) 2,60,000 3,41,000 Consumers (Million) 10.80 18.06Access to Electricity (%) 47% 74%System Loss (%) 18.45% 13.54% The late realization of very difficult challenges of importing coal and injudicious dilemma in mining own coal now requires government reviewing PSMP 2010 regarding fuel options. Coal dependence may need to be reduced and even generation target may need to be revised.Bangladesh must also think about own carbon foot print. Being among the most vulnerable country itself Bangladesh cannot go for major emissions in energy generation. Bangladesh must seriously consider increasing generation from relatively lesser polluting energy generation from renewable resources, LNG import, power from regional grid etc.A close review of the above will evidence that achieving the 50% coal dependent power generation target by 2030 has now become impossible. Nothing has been done to commence own coal exploration over the last 7 years. Several projects initiated for importing coal has run into crisis. Very little progress is visible in coal port development. Not much has been done about coal sourcing. Even land development at some areas like Matarbari now appears very expensive and lengthy.Rampal power plant still has to address and clarify credible environmental impacts especially from coal transshipment.Even the investment matters have not been clarified yet. It is to be seen how Government addresses the matter in COP21 if UNESCO and other stakeholders raise the matter in Paris.Bangladesh has used over 8.25 Tcf of gas over the last 15 years against which the less than minimum exploration efforts have added only 1 Tcf of gas to national gas reserve. Consequently the proven reserve of natural gas is fast depleting and may complete be exhausted by 2031 or even before if no new large gas fields are added by then. The extensive nationwide gas grid may become dry unless gas either in the form of LNG or pipel"
"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh201","From coal to renewable sources: Green hues from brown and blue","February 4, 2016 Thursday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Feb. 4 -- President Mohammed Abdul Hamid has been pitching for a ""blue Bangladesh economy"" all year long. On January 10 he mentioned to the then Navy Chief, Vice Admiral M. Farid Habib to make ""effective use of marine resources"" while addressing an Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS), a theme he repeated to current Navy Chief, Vice Admiral Mohammed Nizamuddin on February 01. The proposal connects with (a) the June 2012 U.S. Conference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD) in Rio de Janeiro, though which the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) built its SIDS (Small Island Development States) programme to protect coastal states, such as Bangladesh, in January 2014; (b) the Zero Emissions Research and Initiatives (ZERI) founder, Gunter Pauli, who authored a ""blue economy"" book in 2014; and (c) the United Nations's MDG (Millennium Development Goals) agenda for the rest of the century.All three connections ultimately seek a ""green"" economy, built upon the principles of low-carbon diffusion, resource efficiency, and social inclusion, and characterised by environmental-friendly policy-making and mindset, with oceans and seas seen as ""development spaces."" The oceanic extension, where the ""blue"" economy strictly lies, also feeds into climate-change and rising ocean-levels, as depicted by the December 2015 COP-21 agreement in Paris. Our low-profile Paris role energises the president's ""blue economy"" promotion.Yet, both may be held hostages to a stubborn ""brown"" economy, driven, as it has been for the entire 20th Century, by fossil-fuels. Changing the ""brown"" economy's mode and media, highlighted, for instance, by the automobile and petroleum industries, is central to retaining control over climatic changes. The ""green"" movement cannot do it alone: it is only one escape-door away from a gas-guzzling civilisation. Any ""blue"" movement, like the above-mentioned UNEP/UNCSD, along with its SIDS plan, the ZERI thrust, and the MDG reforms, also opens other escape doors, yet without clinching a complete victory: unless the ""brown"" economic infrastructure is reformed, both the ""green"" and ""blue"" jargons become meaningless.Part of the ""brown"" economy's permanence can be traced to the vested industries that have thrived upon it for so long (not just the oil and auto industries, but also other spin-off industries like steel, construction, and so forth): note how global oil-price reductions have only produced marginal domestic price changes. That rigidity is also evident in the ease with which the economy is ignited, especially for a less developed country (LDC), like Bangladesh, seeking to leapfrog the modernisation journey: like China's, our approach to development conveys a sine qua non posturing (that is, nothing but development), rather than a quid pro quo approach (dealing with constraints, like environmental protection, as and when they arise). This ""damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead"" mindset beckons a industrialisation-sustainability clash.Future historians might find the year 2015 to be watershed in Bangladesh's development sojourn. Its key infrastructural development projects were not only finalised, but also placed on the government's fast-track list. These included ports and supporting facilities in Matarbari, Payra, and Sonadia, as well as the Rampal and Rooppur energy projects. The country's burgeoning economic development requires more deep-sea ports, while the acute shortage of energy sources only climbed from priority to urgency. Yet, that these energy projects were pinned upon coal, one of them (Rampal) even adjacent to the sensitive Sunderbans mangrove, while others dot the Bay coastl"
"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh202","Climate change: Catalysing private money","November 22, 2015 Sunday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Nov. 22 -- Climate Change is a stark reality today, as pronounced in vulnerable countries like Bangladesh through increasing frequency of floods, cyclones, droughts and myriads of climatic shocks and stresses. In this scenario of exacerbating impact of climate change, batting it by the public sector alone is no longer sufficient, and a holistic approach engaging the private sector in preparing for and reducing the threats posed by climate change is becoming increasingly vital.Funding is essential in this context, and the newest source of climate finance, established under the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change (UNFCCC), is the Green Climate Fund (GCF). With the ambitious target of raising $100 billion a year by 2020, the Fund was established following the Cancun Conference of Parties (COP) in 2010. While it aims to support activities in developing countries for climate change mitigation (i.e. measures to reduce carbon dioxide emission) and adaptation (i.e. measures to reduce vulnerability to climate change), what sets this fund apart from others is its innovative private sector facility (PSF).The PSF, in GCF's words, ""will promote the participation of private sector actors in developing countries, in particular local actors, including small and medium-sized enterprises and local financial intermediaries. The facility will also support activities to enable private sector involvement in Small Island developing States (SIDS) and least developed countries (LDCs)."" It can play a substantial role in catalysing the private sector for climate action by supporting a plethora of investments ranging from increasing access to affordable finance for micro-enterprises to mobilising long-term institutional investors for supporting national mitigation and adaptation programs in affected countries.The transformative potential of the GSF private sector facility comes in the form of its support for creation and capacity building of local enterprises that undertake low emission and climate resilient pathways. Its support for private sector microenterprises and SMEs in developing countries will ensure environment-friendly green indigenous development as opposed to traditional development pathways that involve substantial environmental degradation and lead to adverse climatic impacts.The PSF provision implies that the GCF not only will raise money from institutional private investors, but also support local, small-scale businesses to invest in climate responsive technologies and ventures. The GCF, via PSF, will collaborate with local private entities, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which often struggle to access affordable finance As such it has pledged to make $100 million available for SME pilot projects. Moreover, to ensure that start-up SMEs are eligible to access the facility, track record requirements of financial and commercial viability have been partially relaxed.While the details of the PSF are still being worked out, some of the proposed objectives include increasing the viability of investments by enabling intermediaries to offer a range of financial instruments, reducing investment risks by underwriting demonstration projects, establishing pilots to prove effectiveness of certain technologies or improving insurance access, building capacity and readiness for pursuing climate related opportunities, supporting technology development of climate related investment options and aiding dissemination for business communities to be better able to understand their exposure to climate risks and mechanisms to mitigate and adapt to climate change.The proposed financial instruments and modalities for PSF financing, which will be provided based on case specific needs, include tariff support and guarantees for small-scale renewables, viability gap support, country risk insurance for low carbon infrastructure in risky country business environments and PSF guarantees on carbon prices. These features can all act as a boon for green private sector firms.Bangladesh has made significant strides in engaging the private sector for combating climate change. The country now accounts for half the solar home systems in the world, which were delivered by the private sector through a public-private partnership. The two major breakthroughs that allowed this to scale up are on one side the technical side: While there has been a long history of solar system installation in Bangladesh, there was a graveyard of solar systems all over the country for many years because once a device malfunctioned people could not fix it. The solution came in the form of after sale service provided by the private sector. The second innovation that has allowed this to scale is that since the relatively poor households could not afford the upfront costs of capital, the vendor provided them loans - this was started by Grameen Shakti but is now adopted by all providers. Having the provision to repay the loans on a weekly basis has made the solar systems affordable for the rural poor, making it a sustainable venture.While engaging the private sector on the mitigation side, especially with regard to energy, is relatively easy, engaging it on the adaptation side is trickier, as a profit motive is often absent. Least-developed countries receive a very small fraction of international foreign direct investment and a minuscule portion of funding is allocated for adaptation measures. For instance, in 2011 US$1.1 billion of foreign private investment flowed into Bangladesh, but less than one per cent of that figure was channelled into the agriculture, which is a priority area for adapting to the impacts of climate change.There are some examples of private sector involvement in climate change adaptation, such as agri-businesses in Bangladesh trying to develop salt-tolerant varieties of rice in collaboration with BRRI, and pilot schemes on weather-based index and insurance for farmers where the insured farmers get covered if flood water reaches a certain level in their crop fields. While such promising pilots exist, scaling them is still an uphill struggle. In this context, the PSF provides an unprecedented opportunity for the private sector organisations of countries like Bangladesh, and they need to focus on building their capacity to be able to utilise this facility.The world's leaders will convene in Paris this December aiming to negotiate a legally binding emission reduction treaty that will determine the future of the planet. In contrast to the situation in the run up to COP 15 six years ago in Copenhagen when the financial sector was still reeling from crisis and paid little attention to climate change, global private sector organisations have shown some encouraging signs of a fundamental shift over the last few years in the run up to COP 21 this December. Six major American banks including Bank of America, Citi and JPMorgan Chase issued a joint statement calling global leaders to create a strong climate agreement in Paris. Financial giants Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo, for instance, have committed to allocating $30 billion by 2020 towards a low carbon economy. Increasingly, private firms are adopting internal carbon prices. Initiatives such as the public private partnership Danish Climate Investment Fund are enabling institutional investment in renewable energy and adaptation projects. Moreover, the fast growing green bond market is supporting climate resilient investment in energy, water and infrastructure. Furthermore, investors have committed to track carbon performance of assets, are decarbonising greater portfolios, and even opt for divestment, thus signalling their desire to finance environmentally-sustainable business strategies.Despite these positive developments, the overall low-carbon investment levels are still below those needed to avoid exceeding the critical 2 degree C temperature rise mark, which will lead to catastrophic climate change impacts. Adaptation funding gaps remain, specially for developing countries, as most of the initiatives and financing commitments outl"

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh210","Optimal Use of Natural Gas Resource","January 15, 2016 Friday","Energy & Power","Bangladesh is desperately looking for the best possible option for the diversification of the fuel mix for energy generation in the wake of depleting its major fuel Natural Gas. Policy makers very often state that proven resource of discovered natural gas may completely run out at the present rate of use by 2031. If no major new resource is added soon. We are not sure about technical justifications of such forecasts. But in the absence of extensive reservoir study we have to rely on available information. Bangladesh now produces about 2,750 MMCD from 101 gas wells of 20 gas fields. The coincident peak demand of connected consumers is 3,200 MMCFD plus.Gas supply crisis has not only stagnated the industrial growth but also made operation of existing gas based industries extremely challenging. Government has adopted plan for diversifying fuel options for energy generation in its PSMP 2010.It has also initiated several projects for importing Coal and LNG. Side by side efforts are ongoing for expediting exploration for petroleum in onshore and offshore. But till December 2015 there is very little achievement.In this scenario Bangladesh must rationalize the use of remaining gas resources restricting this to value added use only and ensuring efficiency in use. Wherever possible and feasible, natural gas use must be replaced with alternate fuel. This write up will try to explore the feasible options for fuel diversification and rationalization of natural gas use.Gas Resource and Challenges in UseNatural Gas in 2013 -14 accounted for 72% of commercial energy supply. Own coal contributed only 6%.Bangladesh in desperate situation had to opt for imported liquid fuel based power generation which accounted for 19%. While diversifying fuel options Bangladesh cannot afford to increase its carbon footprint irrationally in its own backyard as Bangladesh is also among the most vulnerable countries of the world from adverse climatic change effected from emissions. Dirty fossil fuel use must be kept in check and state of the art modern technologies must be adopted for energy generation from dirty fossil fuel like coal. Extensive monitoring must also be done in importing, transportation and treatment of coal.Natural gas is presently used for fertilizer production as basic raw material, fuel for power generation, industrial, commercial and domestic sector. In Bangladesh gas also fuels CNG. All these use have alternate feasible options. But it takes time, sustained efforts and investment to make these happen.Bangladesh actually cared less in using its precious natural gas resources. Valuable energy was lost in using gas in very inefficient fertilizer plants, power plants and industries. It is true that when commercial use of gas started in the then East Pakistan and expanded after liberation very little attention was given for efficient use. Most of the fertilizer plants used old outdated technologies. Same thing was true for power plants. TGTDCL the pioneer company for gas distribution and marketing had a gas utilization cell in Sales Department. It used to review boilers and furnaces design of industrial consumers before approving the gas connections. But over time this activities took back bench. Connections were given generously and gas system was expanded without bothering for production capacity and capacities of gas transmission and distribution networks.Very cheap and uneconomic pricing of gas also contributed to inefficient use.Bangabandhu inspired Petrobangla took over five major gas fields in 1975 almost free from Shell BV. The transmission and distribution systems in 1970s and 1980s were constructed using soft loans of donor agencies and development partners.Bangladesh could afford supplying gas to all end users at much lower than economic price. Power generation using this cheap fuel was also very cheap. Taking advantage of cheap fuel and power as well as cheap labor many sunset industries from other countries were relocated to Bangladesh apart from phenomenal growth of own RMG industry. Despite of repeated suggestions of donor agencies for updating and rationalizing gas price Governments for political reasons hardly paid heed to these. Consequently users hardly bothered for using energy efficient appliances. Bangladesh lost valuable energy through misuse. When it realized it already reached a stage when natural gas resource is fast depleting. Energy auditing conduct in the recent past has identified end users where appropriate actions if taken can save and conserve substantial gas resource which can prolong the use of existing resource a little longer and ensure economic use.Areas Where Actions Must Be TakenIt may be seen from above that domestic sector, captive power and CNG consume about 35% of natural gas.These categories of consumers have better options.Government has taken right initiative for suspending all new connections for domestic consumers and adjusting gas price of domestic consumers.No More Pipel"

This was done to underscore the importance of this year - 2015 - in the context of climate negotiations. Participants highlighted the importance and benefits of enhancing coordinated action ahead of the next International Climate Conference- COP-21 (the UN Climate Agenda aimed at reaching a new global Agreement) scheduled to be held in Paris, France from November 30 to December 11 this year. Dhaka was urged to actively lobby and try to find the common denominators that would help Bangladesh in the Agreement that would be reached in Paris. References were made to the steps taken in this regard in Geneva earlier this year.Since the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), participants and stakeholders involved with this process have been moving forward at a snail's pace. The common equation has been to agree to disagree. Certain countries faced with dire consequences and civil society in general have, however, remained consistent in their anxiety and have continued to reiterate the need to find acceptable solutions to existing and prospective problems.In the meantime, the effects of climate change and climate variability have become very apparent - melting Polar ice, less snowfall on mountains, increasing number of typhoons and cyclones, rise in sea-levels (creating greater salinity in the coastal regions), inordinate hot spells (this summer has seen more than 2000 deaths in India and about a 1000 in Pakistan from heat wave) and floods.In this context we watched with interest the negotiations that were undertaken in the meeting held from February 08 to 13 earlier this year at the UN Headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.

This is about markets and investments. We see this as a trillion-dollar opportunity, not a trillion-dollar challenge,"" he said.Some 1.1 billion people worldwide have no access to electricity, and nearly three billion rely on dangerous and polluting traditional fuels such as wood, charcoal and dung to cook and heat their homes.At the same time, extensive energy use, especially in high-income countries, creates pollution, emits greenhouse gases and depletes non-renewable fossil fuels.Commitments already made under the SE4All initiative by the EU, Germany and the United States alone are set to help developing countries to provide energy access for a total of nearly one billion people by 2030, but population growth means this will remain well short of universal access.Partners at the four-day Forum in New York announced further significant commitments in both funding and tangible action, but there is still far to go.The second edition of SE4All's Global Tracking Framework, released by the World Bank at the SE4All Forum, estimates total annual investment of up to US$ 1.2 trillion will be needed to 2030 in order to achieve these ambitious targets "" triple the current flows of around $400 billion a year.Governments do not have that kind of resource. Only public-private partnerships will generate this kind of resource flow,"" Yumkella said. The framework we show requires investment not only in the South, but in the rich North.""Catalyst for Action and Investment Building momentum on energy issues ahead of both the September UN Summit to adopt the post-2015 development agenda, and the December Climate Conference in Paris, the Forum aimed to help shape the direction of energy policy and act as a catalyst for vital investment in the crucial decades to come.Two days were devoted to a Global Energy Ministerial' "" the first to be held at the United Nations "" in the UN General Assembly Hall.Around 40 ministers and top figures from business, international organizations and development banks attended the event, which has attracted well over a thousand participants from the developed and developing world alike.Also taking part is the multi-platinumselling musician Akon, who co-founded Akon Lighting Africa in 2014 to provide solar power to millions of households across the continent.Commitments at the Forum Commitments made at the Forum, which runs from May 18-21 under the theme of Financing Sustainable Energy for All', include the following:The European Union said grants of EUR3.5 billion from 2014-2020 would leverage sustainable energy investments of up to EUR 30 billion for electricity generation, transmission and access. This includes funding through a new facility, ElectriFI, aiming to boost private sector investments by bridging gaps in project financing.The Global Environment Facility said its new Sustainable Cities program, expected to be approved next month, would support 11 countries and 23 cities with $150 million and leverage $1.4 billion to promote sustainable urban development planning. It also pledged $3 billion in projects and programs to support climate change mitigation and adaptation in 2014-2018.The OPEC Fund for International Development said it would turn an earlier one-time pledge to provide $1 billion to alleviate energy poverty into a revolving fund, to be replenished on an ongoing basis. Its commitments to funding under the original pledge have already exceeded $1.4 billion.China said plans to provide all its people with electricity by 2015 would be completed on time, and the country was committed to increasing the nonfossil fuel share of its energy consumption to 15% in 2020 and 20% by 2030, compared with about 11% last year.Netherlands-based NGO ENERGIA said it was committing EUR 13 million of its donor-government funding over the next five years to energy-related activities, including capacity-building for more than 3,000 women-led businesses to deliver energy services to more than 2 million consumers.Barbados, which already has universal access to modern energy services, said it was working to generate half its energy from renewables and cut electricity consumption by 22 per cent by 2020.As well as providing fresh budget funding for SE4All's small Global Facilitation Team, the United Kingdom pledged to support a new Green Mini-Grids in Africa program to provide clean, safe energy access to one million people in Kenya and Tanzania.PowerGen Renewable Energy said it would provide 800,000 beneficiaries in East Africa with electricity by 2020 through 1100 solar micro-grids.Italian utility ENEL pledged to invest EUR 8.8 billion in 2015-2019 on developing renewable energy capacity, a 50% increase from previous plans, adding up to 7,100 MW to its installed capacity worldwide.BackgroundLaunched in September 2011, the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) initiative is a multi-stakeholder partnership working with governments, businesses, civil society, banks and international institutions to meet three interlinked goals by 2030: ensuring universal access to modern energy services; doubling the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix; and doubling the rate of improvement in energy efficiency worldwide.UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim co-chaired the SE4All initiative, which addressed the crucial global challenge of addressing energy poverty while at the same time mitigating climate change.The Forum included the first-ever Global Energy Ministerial Dialogue at the UN. More than 1,500 people attended events over the four days. An Advisory Board meeting, co-convened by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim also convened during the week.The event opened with two days of multi-stakeholder discussions at the Sheraton Times Square Hotel, New York.

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh214","China's year","December 31, 2015 Thursday","Dhaka Courier","Dhaka, Dec. 31 -- China was successful throughout the year in its trade and military diplomacy, increasing its military capabilities, manoeuvring international politics at its favour and holding onto the attention of the global audiences all through. It was China's political, diplomatic and security stunts that dominated the conventional and social media all over the globe.Europe's ""China obsession""Warm reception of Chinese President Xi Jinping by British royals and politicians, which was followed by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande's visit to China, reflect how European states are competing among themselves to benefit from China's growing economic might. Britain, Germany and France have well understood the scope of the China's growing global influence and the enormous opportunities that close relations with China will bring about for businesses in Britain, Germany and France- both as individual states and as part of the European Union (EU). Moreover, perhaps these European states also understood well that the ""One Belt, One Road"" initiative of China, which is aimed at more closely integrating Europe and Asia via land and maritime infrastructure, would enhance economic growth and development of those states that are associated with the initiative.In Britain, state-banquet arranged in Buckingham Palace in honour of President Xi, during his visit in October 2015, reflects China's importance to Britain. Not all heads of state are honoured with such banquets. British government proclaimed that Britain is ""China's best partner in the West"" and a ""golden era"" in British-China relations had opened. During Xi's visit to Britain, more than \£330 billion worth of commercial deals were agreed upon, spanning a wide range of sectors, such as energy, retail, financial services, aerospace, healthcare, transport, education, the creative industries, etc.After the British episode, the French and German heads of state visited China. While economic cooperation agreements sealed during Merkel's visit (late October) amounted to a total of around 20 billion Euros, around 17 documents were signed (early November) between Chinese and French government bodies, institutes and companies in order to enhance cooperation in areas including nuclear energy, aerospace and electricity. Clearly three of these U.S. allies are engaged in an unprecedented competition with each other in order to win over favour from China, causing frustration and anger for the U.S., which is China global rival. These states are literally appearing to be appeasing China with the expectation of gaining from greater cooperation with this economic powerhouse of Asia. No doubt China's leadership must be enjoying such comforting scenario - which is a clear for-the-time-being-victory over its global rival the U.S.China dominated a number of summits and conferencesCOP-21 to UNFCCC) and so on. However, the most important one was the China-Africa Summit, where President Xi pledged $60 billion in development projects across the continent over the next three years. The Chinese and African leaders agreed to enhance cooperation on the international stage to safeguard their common interests as well as the overall interests of developing countries. The overall China-Africa relations have been elevated to a new height in 2015.One Belt, One Road initiativeChina's ""One Belt, One Road"" initiative, which is aimed at more closely integrating Europe and Asia via land and maritime infrastructure, could help enhance regional economic growth, development and integration. In 2015, Xi Jinping visited Pakistan and promised $46 billion in investment, much of which is allocated for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which is part of the ""One Belt, One Road"" initiative. The CPEC has the potential to transform the economies of Pakistan and, if accommodated, of Iran, India and Afghanistan. The CPEC will also bring peace and prosperity to the long-neglected and conflict-torn Baluchistan province within Pakistan.As China is seeking to include Africa within its ""One Belt, One Road"" initiative, the 2015 China-Africa Summit was important for Africans in order to tighten their ties with China. ""One Belt, One Road"" initiative will bring prosperity for Africa as it will bring prosperity to all the countries associated with it.AIIBThe U.S. has been dominating the global economic system since the end of the Second World War through World Bank (WB), Asian Development Bank (ADB) and International Monetary Fund (IMF), and this dominance remained unchallenged since the end of the cold war. The U.S. was afraid that the impact of the establishment of China-led Asian Infrastructural Investment Bank (AIIB) would negatively impact the U.S.'s dominance on global economic system. That is why, the U.S. politicians and diplomats spent too much time on lobbying with its allies to restrain them from joining the AIIB. But, on 29th June 2015, fifty countries, including close U.S. allies Australia, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and South Korea, signed the AoA of AIIB in an attempt to bring the AIIB formally into existence. This, clearly, is a great achievement on the part of China and a great triumph over its global rival the U.S.The AIIB is largely viewed as China's response to the limited role allowed to it in the WB and the likes. The AIIB would likely to pose a challenge to the Western dominated WB and ADB.TPP, RCEP & FTAAPWith the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) spearheaded by the U.S. and China respectively, the two countries are using the free trade agreements (FTAs) to benefit themselves and keep each other out of their respective regional (Asia-Pacific) economic arrangements.The U.S. was successful in achieving a deal on the TPP signed on October 5, 2015. But China is yet to achieve a deal on RCEP by all parties involved. This is where China is lagging behind the U.S. with regard to FTAs. However, China was quick to counter the U.S. move by urging (during November 2015's APEC Summit) to turn RCEP talks towards a broader pact that would encompass TPP into a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP), which is likely to include all Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies. China first made the proposal for FTAAP during 2014's APEC Summit.Victory day paradeChina's victory day parade on 3rd September, 2015 was not only a sheer showcase of its military might, but also the showcase of the standing that it has within the political reality of different countries around the globe, especially the eastern and southern ones. Delegates of 17 foreign national armies took part in the Parade. China hosted 30 heads of state, including South Korean President Park Geun-hye. Attendance of these leaders, even at the cost of annoying the U.S., shows their trust on China's ability to accommodate their interest at the regional and global stage. Such attendance also reflects China's success as a regional and global player in achieving the confidence of these countries - especially the trust of China's once-regional-headache South Korea, which is an important ally of China's global rival the U.S. Such parade also reflects China's military readiness to act anytime in order to maintain and secure peace and stability in the Asia Pacific region and the globe.Portraying as peaceful powerChina has always attempted to portray itself a peaceful economic power with largely a non-interference approach towards foreign entities in order to promote and campaign their rise as peaceful. President Xi, during victory day parade, announced to reduce the Chinese military force (world's largest in respect of its number of troops) by more than 10 percent (from 2.3 to 2 million). It is worth mentioning that Chinese troops numbered 6.27 million back in October 1949. There is no other country that has made so many reductions in number of troops on such large scales. The promised reduction have proven wrong the so-called ""China Threat"" theory which is being hyped every now and then by the western media. Indeed, the decision to reduce the troops depicts that China neither have any interest in scheming against its neighbours nor have any intention of expansion that would harm other countries.Maturity as global powerThroughout 2015, the U.S. had involved in highly provocative and inflammatory conducts in South China Sea, a region that faces territorial and maritime disputes among China and its ASEAN neighbours. In an instance, the U.S. sent its naval ships within the 12 miles of a Chinese-controlled isle, while in another instance it sent military aircraft over the disputed territories. China reacted to such provocations only by condemning and protesting the incidents in press-conferences, and thus, so far refrained from heating up the situation. Such calm moves by China surely reflect its maturity in handling heated situations in such a manner that is expected from a global power.In Singapore, President Xi's meeting with Ma Ying-jeou of Taiwan, which China considers to be its part, not only hyped the strong bilateral ties, but also surprised the world. This shows Chinese leadership's new and matured strategy to engage even its disentangled portion.Wrapping upChina truly spent a busy year in 2015 in terms of its international relations. China's year-long activities reflect China's political sphere of influence in global stage, richness in handling economic diplomacy, military diplomacy, depth of military relations with other national militaries, intention to defend and uphold peace, and ability to design and work for implementation of mega initiatives. In 2015, China emerged as a top player in today's global geo-politics and a modern military power on a global scale. Although the year 2015 belongs to China, it is the U.S. that still comparatively is the strongest country on our planet. Although there is no denial of the fact that gradual erosion of U.S. hegemony has been creating scopes for China in global stage, China is yet to takeover the comprehensive global roles of its global rival U.S.Published by HT Syndication with permission from Dhaka Courier.

"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh215","Adding global value and private sector","November 22, 2015 Sunday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Nov. 22 -- The Commonwealth Business Forum (CBF), the major business event in the Commonwealth calendar, brings together Heads of Government, Ministers and top business leaders from around the world. This year the event will take place on 24 - 26 November as one of the parallel events of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) which is going to be held in Malta on November 27-29, 2015. The theme of this year's CHOGM is 'The Commonwealth - Adding Global Value.'The Forum, the Edinburgh CHOGM of 1997 being the first of its kind, will highlight the role the private sector can play in helping deliver the Sustainable Development Goals within the post-2015 development framework of trade, investment, entrepreneurship and employment, sustainability, including financial services, infrastructure, technology, health care, tourism and the maritime industry. So it is very important for Bangladesh.This year the theme of CHOGM is ""The Commonwealth - Adding Global Value"". And the Business Forum will reassess how the Commonwealth can provide practical and tangible support to help Governments and the private sector work together to create prosperity and sustainable economic development across all member countries.Adding global value and private sectorFour major areas are likely to get priorities in the forum. These are: (1) Commonwealth political values: Global security challenges and the domestic, regional and global policy responses to address them; (2) Commonwealth development values: Assessing the sustainable development goals and related financing for development; (3) Climate Change COP21; and (4) Commonwealth relevance and impact: Further reform of Commonwealth and CHOGM.Engagement of Bangladesh: Bangladesh needs to contribute in this global forum. In this connection, the broad goals in respect of trade and employment of the Perspective Plan for a Transformed Bangladesh by 2021 have greater relevance. The plan emphasises changing the sectoral composition of output with the shares of agriculture, industry, and services approximating 15 per cent, 38 per cent, and 47 per cent respectively by 2021.The government has set a priority to arrange over 10,000 acres of land for industrial plots across the country in the next three years. The government will set up five special economic zones and seven specialised industrial areas across the country during the period.Plan is also there to generate 8,500 MW of electricity by 2013, 11,500 MW by 2015, and make provisions to meet the expected demand for power of 20,000 MW by 2021, so that it ensures per capita energy consumption of 600 kWh.Reducing the unemployment rate to 15 per cent is another major priority. According to UNDP-Bangladesh Bank joint statistics, out of nearly 90 million eligible workers of Bangladesh, 35 million are out of employment which is appalling and we, at all levels, must be ever vigilant against this.Bangladesh's Development Needs: According to a World Bank report, Bangladesh needs to invest as much as $74bn in infrastructure by 2020 to bring its power grids, roads and water supplies up to the standard. The amount is 7.38 per cent of the country's GDP per year and second highest in South Asian region that needs $2.5tn on infrastructure by 2020 to serve its growing population, the bank said in a new report.Bangladesh will have to spend $7.4 billion to $10 billion a year until 2020 to bring its power grids, roads and water supplies up to the standard needed to serve its growing population. ""In total, the country will require between $74 billion and $100 billion between 2011 and 2020 or 7.38 per cent to 10.02 per cent of its gross domestic product to improve infrastructure,"" said Luis Andres, one of the co-authors of the report.Bangladesh will have to give the highest priority to its transport sector, as the report said the country needs to spend between $36 billion and $45 billion for expanding its communication network. The power sector will require an investment between $11 billion and $16.5 billion to supply electricity to the poor in the country where about half of the population is still not brought under the national grid coverage.Improving water supply and sanitation will need a flow of investment of $12 billion to $18 billion, solid waste management $2.1 billion to $4.2 billion, telecom $5 billion, and irrigation $7.7 billion to $11.6 billion until 2020.Mobilising financial resources for SDGs: Financing the SDGs is critical. The developed countries and the development partners need to expedite the implementation of their commitment under the Istanbul Programme of Action (IPoA) and SDG 2030 with comprehensive, enhanced, quantifiable, predictable, and strengthened global funding partnership for the least developed countries.Funding mechanisms or modalities should ensure predictable, sustained, simple and time-bound funding programmes and procedures.Donors should report and notify annually on funds dedicated respectively under specific target issues, how they intend to meet the recipient country's need-based projects, and their progress in mainstreaming LDC capacity building in trade and development into their aid programming.The debt servicing obligation of LDCs have compelled them to use limited resources to finance debt re-payments and this, in turn, prevents them from financing remedial measures against the adverse impacts of climate change, trade facilitation, production, infrastructure and capacity building activities for development. The amount payable as debt service by LDCs should therefore be converted into an additional annual fund as grant.The Goal 17 of SDGs includes some specific targets for financing. These is provided are: 17.3 developed countries, implement fully ODA commitments to provide 0.7 per cent of GNI in ODA to developing countries of which 0.15-0.20 per cent to least-developed countries following an agreed timel"
"COP21","Bangladesh","COP21_Bangladesh216","India stands for opportunity and dignity of all humans","November 14, 2015 Saturday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 14 -- Prime Minister of IndiaI am delighted to be in London. Even in this globalised world, London is still the standard for our times. The city has embraced the world's diversity and represents the finest in human achievements. And, I am truly honoured to speak in the British Parliament.Mr. Speaker, thank you for opening the doors to us, here in this magnificent setting of the Royal Court. I know that the Parliament is not in Session. Prime Minister Cameron looks relaxed and relieved.But, I want to remind you, Mr. Prime Minister, that you owe me royalty for an election slogan. I know that you are hosting me at the Chequers this evening. But, I also know that you will understand if I am fair to both sides of the floor. Especially since British MPs of Indian Origin are evenly balanced between the Treasury and the Opposition benches. So, I also extend my good wishes to the Labour. Indeed, since these are still early days after the election, my warm congratulations to the Members of the House. And, greetings to the eminent leaders of Britain and great friends of India present here today.So much of the modern history of India is linked to this building. So much history looms across our relationship. There are others who have spoken forcefully on the debts and dues of history. I will only say that many freedom fighters of India found their calling in the institutions of Britain. And, many makers of modern India, including several of my distinguished predecessors, from Jawaharlal Nehru to Dr. Manmohan Singh, passed through their doors.There are many things on which it is hard to tell anymore if they are British or Indian: The Jaguar or the Scotland Yard, for example. The Brooke Bond tea or my friend late Lord Ghulam Nun's curry. And, our strongest debates are whether the Lord's pitch swings unfairly or the wicket at Eden Gardens cracks too early. And, we love the Bhangra rap from London just as you like the English novel from India.On the way to this event, Prime Minister Cameron and I paid homage to Mahatma Gandhi outside the Parliament. I was reminded of a question I was asked on a tour abroad. How is it that the statue of Gandhi stands outside the British Parliament? To that question, my answer is: The British are wise enough to recognise his greatness; Indians are generous enough to share him; we are both fortunate enough to have been touched by his life and mission; and, we are both smart enough to use the strengths of our connected histories to power the future of our relationship.So, I stand here today, not as a visiting Head of Government, given the honour to speak in this temple of democracy. I am here as a representative of a fellow institution and a shared tradition.And, tomorrow, Prime Minister and I will be at the Wembley. Even in India, every young footballer wants to bend it like Beckham. Wembley will be a celebration of one-half-million threads of life that bind us; one and half million people - proud of their heritage in India; proud of their home in Britain.It will be an expression of joy for all that we share: values, institutions, political system, sports, culture and art. And, it will be a recognition of our vibrant partnerships and a shared future.The United Kingdom is the third largest investor in India behind Singapore and Mauritius. India is the third largest source of Foreign Direct Investment projects in the United Kingdom. Indians invest more in Britain than in the rest of European Union combined. It is not because they want to save on interpretation costs, but because they find an environment that is welcoming and familiar.It takes an Indian icon, Tata, to run a British icon and become your nation's largest private sector employer.The UK remains a preferred destination for Indian students. And, I am pleased that an Indian company is taking a thousand British students to India to skill them in Information Technology.We are working together in the most advanced areas of science and technology. We are finding solutions to the enduring human problems of food and health security, and seeking answers to emerging challenges like climate change.Our security agencies work together so that our children return home safe and our increasingly networked lives are not prey to the threats on cyber space.Our Armed Forces exercise with each other, so that they can stand more strongly for the values we represent. This year alone, we have had three exercises together.And, in the international arena, your support has made it more possible for India to take her rightful place in global institutions and regimes. And, it has helped us both advance our common interests.Strong as our partnership is, for a relationship such as ours, we must set higher ambitions. We are two democracies; two strong economies; and, two innovative societies.We have the comfort of familiarity and the experience of a long partnership. Britain's resurgence is impressive. Its influence on the future of the global economy remains strong.And, Mr. Speaker, India is new bright spot of hope and opportunity for the world. It is not just the universal judgment of international institutions. It is not just the logic of numbers: a nation of 1.25 billion people with 800 million under the age of 35 years.This optimism comes from the energy and enterprise of our youth; eager for change and confident of achieving it. It is the result of bold and sustained measures to reform our laws, policies, institutions and processes.We are igniting the engines of our manufacturing sector; making our farms more productive and more resilient; making our services more innovative and efficient; moving with urgency on building global skills for our youth; creating a revolution in Startup enterprises; and, building the next generation infrastructure that will have a light footprint on the Earth.Our momentum comes not just from the growth we pursue, but from the transformation that we seek in the quality of life for every citizen.Much of India that we dream of still lies ahead of us: housing, power, water and sanitation for all; bank accounts and insurance for every citizen; connected and prosperous villages; and, smart and sustainable cities. These are goals with a definite date, not just a mirage of hope.And, inspired by Gandhiji, the change has begun with us - the way the government works. There is transparency and accountability in governance. There is boldness and speed in decisions. (To be continued)Federalism is no longer the fault l"

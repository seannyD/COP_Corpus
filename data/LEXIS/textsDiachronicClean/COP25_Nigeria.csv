He added that there was the need for youths to understand what is expected of them.He said: 'Addressing Climate Change is costly. It will cost us lots of money, so the conversation should not just be on how to get the money but mobilise other resources too. Youths must see this as the beginning of a long struggle. The climate with continue to change, this means we have a challenge that no one knows when it will end.'Youths need to be strategic, climate action is beyond carrying placards and shouting, you need to add more to your knowledge and research so that you can have science evidence-based materials to negotiate.'Stressing the need for research, Prof Oladipo said that 'A major challenge we face in many of the developing countries is that while the developed countries will come with models built from results of analyses that proofs their position, we mostly end up using conjured presentations that may not be scientific.'\l"

He cited the devastating impact of Cyclones Idai and Kenneth in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Tanzania and the Comoros earlier this year.""However, Africa also offers climate smart investment opportunities \- from country-led innovation centers, to transformative renewable energy initiatives. For example, this year, the Bank approved financing for the first on-grid solar power public-private partnership in Chad, under the Desert to Power initiative,"" Shonibare said.Projects like Desert to Power will be highlighted at COP 25, which will from 2 to 13 December bring together leaders and institutions from 196 nations plus the European Union, who have signed up to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. At the heart of the matter are the Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs, which form part of the landmark Paris Agreement, signed in 2015 during COP21 in the French capital. The NDCs are specific climate change targets that each country must set.The Paris Agreement has been ratified by 51 out of 54 African countries. It binds countries to cutting carbon emissions to ensure that global temperatures do not rise by more than 2\'b0C by the end of this century, while attempting to contain it within 1.5\'b0C.Climate finance is another issue that will top the agenda at COP25 in Madrid.""2020 is a critical year in securing adequate resources for African countries to meet their Paris Agreement commitments, clarity and transparency on global climate finance access is essential to deliver climate action faster and at scale,"" said Anthony Nyong, Director Climate Change and Green Growth Department at the African Development Bank.The African Development Bank is joining the other Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) in a pavilion to showcase the joint commitment to combatting climate change.

This posture rides on the same track as slavery, colonialism, neocolonialism and their cousin, neo-liberalism.'Head, Media and Campaigns of ERA, Philip said: 'All through the negotiations, we saw the footprints of Big Polluters. From their sponsorships to their back to back meetings to promote markets. Unfortunately, delegates from Africa who constituted the largest delegations were busy in their confusion and doing nothing to advance real solutions demanded by their people.'As gloomy as the situation is, we will continue raising our voices until they wake up from their slumber, hear us and take action.'Both organisations say the real solution to the climate crisis are in the non-market mechanisms embedded in Article 6. 8 of the Paris Agreement which includes adaptation, mitigation, finance and technology transfer.In a similar vein, Friends of the Earth International said that COP25 should also have delivered urgent support, including finance, for Southern countries already suffering loss and damage from climate breakdown - due to floods, forest fires, droughts, rising seas. Instead, the response of Northern countries and elites everywhere is to sacrifice the global majority: the lives and livelihoods of the many to pay for the lifestyles of the few.FoEI Chair, Karin Nansen from Uruguay, commented: 'The £mbition' claimed by developed country governments is a false ambition. They are serving the interests of the corporations aiming to make profits out of the crisis and secure capital accumulation. But peoples - from Madrid to Santiago and around the world - are rising up and will continue to fight for environmental, social, gender and economic justice and system change. We will continue to demand that governments be accountable to their people and not to corporate polluters.'Sara Shaw, FOEI Climate Justice and Energy Programme Coordinator said: 'Just as we thought the slow pace and weak ambition shown at the climate talks couldn't get worse, along comes COP25. Here, we have witnessed the gutting of the already weak ParisThe agreement, with the advance of dodgy carbon trading that will only exacerbate the climate crisis and harm Southern communities. We have seen a refusal by developed countries to pay up for the loss and damage finance, while they try to block any language that would make them liable for the impacts their emissions have caused. We are furious that while so many are already suffering the impacts of climate change, corporations and rich country governments are working to destroy any hope of keeping global temperature rise below 1.5 degrees. And when we stood up in peaceful protest at COP25, we were aggressively suppressed.'Sriram Madhusoodanan, climate campaign director of Corporate Accountability said: 'The US is lighting the house on fire on its way out of the door and global North countries in the EU, Canada and Australia are backing it every step of the way. It is not too late for these countries to countries to stop backing the US. Developing nations must unite as a bloc to reject a bad deal on Article 6 and pave the way for real solutions'The groups insisted that big polluters who are really set to gain from market mechanisms, like Shell, Chevron and BP, have been out in force at COP25.

They ensured that policy recommendations to insulate the negotiations from Big Polluters' interference were shut down while discussions to place carbon markets at the center of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement threatened to derail real solutions including non market mechanisms.Last month, the U.S. government began the process of withdrawing from the Paris Agreement after President Donald Trump said the agreement imposed unfair economic burdens on American workers, businesses, and taxpayers.COP25""Big polluters must be rubbing their hands in glee that carbon market mechanisms, which further dilute the already weak and inadequate Paris emissions targets, are back on the agenda,"" said Dipti Bhatnagar, Climate Justice and Energy Programme Coordinator for Friends of the Earth International.""We will fight them tooth and nail. The climate crisis is already devastating lives. Emissions are still rising. Now is not the time to offer an escape route to polluting Northern country governments and big oil.""COP25 must decide if the global response to the climate crisis centres real solutions or prioritizes more giveaways to the fossil fuel industry and other Big Polluters - especially those who have knowingly fueled this crisis for decades.READ ALSO: Nigerian Red Cross demands creation of Ministry of Reconciliation""Instead of green-lighting the fossil fuel industry's wish-list, governments must heed peoples' movements around the world and advance real solutions, including opportunity to lay the groundwork for real, transformative pathways to 1.5 within Article 6.8.

We have not come here to point fingers and accuse our leaders. We are here to bring solutions to the table.'In Nigeria, we recently harvested over 1000 youth-led, climate-focused creative ideas, some of which are now being groomed into profitable businesses. What matters now is that we must hold leaders to account for promises made and agreements signed.'Adebote spoke alongside other youth delegates representing other regions of the world including Zuzanna Borowska from Poland, Kisha Erah Mua\'f1a from the Philippines, Irfan Ullah from Pakistan, Komal Kumar from Fiji and Juan Jose Martin from Chile.UNFCCC's Executive Secretary, Patricia Espinosa had earlier called on the youth to help in educating people around the world. 'For every decision, we make in our life, we need to think about the consequences of that decision,' she said.Africa has had its share of the climate crisis. In 2000, flood in Mozambique was responsible for 800 deaths, 329,000 displaced people and almost 2 million were people affected in all.Between July 2011 and 2012, the entire East Africa region suffered a severe drought, said to be 'the worst drought in 60 years.' Across the Lake Chad region, the drying up of the water bodies has badly affected over 17 million people in North-Eastern Nigeria, Cameroon's Far North, Western Chad and South-East Niger.By 2050, between 350 million and 601 million people are projected to experience increased water stress due to climate change across Africa with women, children and the elderly more vulnerable.

""No deal is better than a bad deal for our people,"" said Ambassador Mohammed Nasr, chair of African Group of Negotiators (AGN) at a press briefing today which is the last day of the conference. ""Several items for developing countries did not see any conclusion as we speak"" Nasr said. Also speaking during the briefing Tongie Gahoma, incoming chair of the AGN said that Africa is ready to continue the negotiations at the 2020 COP taking place in Glasgow, Scotland. ""We are ready to continue these discussions next year. We want to avoid the Kyoto disease,"" he said. ""For us it is important that the work here is for Africa by Africa and our concern is mainly adaptation,"" he further said. Africa accounts for less than 4percent of global carbon emissions and the continent is the most vulnerable in terms of the impact of climate change, the United Nations says. To adapt to these climate change shocks, African negotiators at COP25 have been pressing for funds to adapt to the impact of climate change. ""Africa is highly impacted by climate change adversity all across and the cost are very high for the governments that are already putting between 2-9 percent of their GDP for adaptation,"" Nasr who is also an ambassador in Egypt said. A UN study says Sub-Saharan Africa would need an estimated climate adaptation finance of around $50bn (Pound 37bn) annually by 2050. ""The overall assessment is not a good situation. There is still no clarity on the number of issues that are dear to Africa,"" said Seynu Nafo, former chair of the AGN.

But we must flag our concern at the apparent reluctance by our interlocutors to engage on issues of priority to developing countries, as evidenced by a large number of such issues which have simply been pushed from session to session without any progress.""Africa contributes the least to global warming emissions yet is the continent most vulnerable to climate change, as witnessed by devastating natural disasters recently. Africa Day has been held at the conference every year since COP 17 in 2011 to rally support for the continent's cause.""The climate disaster issues confronting the continent demand a predictable and unified response,"" said UN ASG Mohamed Beavogui, Director General of African Risk Capacity, an agency of the African Union that helps governments respond to natural disasters.""Africa needs to move towards market-based innovative financing models to achieve a strong, united, resilient and globally influential continent.

"COP25","Nigeria","COP25_Nigeria17","Climate Change Accounting: The Failure of COP25","December 16, 2019 Monday","News Chronicle (Nigeria)","Prior to the UN Convention on Climate Change talks held in Madrid, the sense that tradition would assert itself was hard to buck. Weariness and frustration came in the wake of initial high minded optimism. Delegates spent an extra two days and nights attempting to reach a deal covering carbon reduction measures before the Glasgow conference in 2020. The gathering became the longest set of climate talks in history, exceeding the time spent at the 2011 Durban meeting by 44 hours.As Climate Home News noted, Durban still stood out as being worthier for having ""produced a deal between countries that laid the foundations for the Paris Agreement."" In stark contrast, ""Madrid produced a weak gesture toward raising climate targets and failed to agree for the second year in a row on rules to govern carbon markets.""The UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres was all lament. ""The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaption, and finance to tackle the climate crisis."" He hoped that the next year would see ""all countries commit to do what science tells us is necessary to reach carbon neutrality in 2050 and no more than 1.5-degree temperature rise.""The wisdom of COP25 remains similar to that of previous gatherings on climate: politics and environment do not mix well. Big powers and heavy polluters stuck to their stubborn positions, stressing the merits of loose, open markets to solve the problem, notably in terms of reducing carbon emissions; smaller states more concerned by their actual disappearance lobbied European, Latin American and African allies for firmer commitments and pledges.Australia was also confirmed as one of the chief spoilers, if not outright saboteurs, at the show, noted for its insistence that it be allowed to claim a reduction of its abatement for the 2021-30 Paris Accord. This, went the argument, was due to its own excelling in meeting the 2012-20 Kyoto Protocol period. Previous good conduct could justify current bad and future behaviour. What Canberra offered the globe was an accounting model of deception, exploiting a regulatory loophole in place of lowering emissions. It lacked legal plausibility, given that both Kyoto and Paris are separate treaties.Former French environment minister Luciana Tubiana was clear about the implications of this idea. ""If you want this carryover,"" she told the Financial Times, ""it is just cheating. Australia was willing in a way to destroy the whole system because that is the way to destroy the whole Paris agreement.""Other states were also noted in performing roles of obstruction, including Saudi Arabia, Brazil, and the United States. These parties were particularly keen to push their differences with other states over Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, a provision dealing with mechanisms and models of trading in emission reductions. Such trade can have a habit of losing validity when putting into practice; the issue of transparency remains a considerable problem in such markets.The US statement at the conference emphasized realism and pragmatism ""backed by a record of real-world results."" (Real-world results tend to exclude environmental ruination for unrepentant polluters.) Market results were primary; environmental matters were subordinate to such dictates. Usual mantras were proffered: innovation and open markets produced wealth, but also ""fewer emissions, and more secure sources of energy."" Despite leaving as a party to the Paris Agreement, ""We remain fully committed to working with you, our global partners, to enhance resilience, mitigate the impacts of climate change, and prepare for and respond to natural disasters.""Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro reconfirmed his climate change skepticism, claiming that the entire issue of COP25 could be put down to commerce. ""I don't know why people don't understand that it's just a commercial game."" The Europeans, he suggested, were merely being irksome about cash and meddling. ""I'd like to know,"" he posed rhetorically to journalists, ""has there been a resolution for Europe to be reforested, or are they just going to keep bothering Brazil?""Brazil's environment minister Ricardo Salles, known to some as Minister for Deforestation, was similarly keen to place the blame elsewhere. He had demanded, bowl in hand, some $10 billion under the Paris Climate deal to combat deforestation in 2020. All in all, he was not optimistic. ""Rich countries did not want to pay up.""Like Australia, Brazil's environmental ploy is driven by creative accounting, an attempt to leverage previous supposed good conduct in the climate change stakes, playing accumulated carbon credits from Kyoto to meet those under the Paris arrangements. Using open market rationales, Salles condemned the ""protectionist vision"" that had taken hold: ""Brazil and other countries that could provide carbon credits because of their forests and good environmental practices came out losers."" In an act of some spite, the minister would subsequently post a tweet featuring a photo of a platter heavy with meats. ""To compensate for our emissions at COP, a vegetarian lunch!""Madrid will be remembered for its stalemate on carbon credits and the botched rule book on carbon trading. An effort spearheaded by Costa Rica, including Germany, Britain and New Zealand, to convince states to adopt the San Jose principles, with a prohibition on the use of carbon credit carryover along with other Kyoto gains, was rejected.COP25 again exposed that degree of prevalent anarchy, if not gangsterism, in global climate change policy. The emphasis, then, is on attempts and arrangements made within regional areas: EU policy on de-carbonized economies (albeit resisted within by such states as Poland), and bilateral arrangements (the EU and China). As these take place, the apocalyptic message led by activists such as Greta Thunberg will become more desperate.Dr. Binoy Kampmark was a Commonwealth Scholar at Selwyn College, Cambridge.

Thousands of East Africans have been displaced in the wake of heavy rains that have battered the region since October, and more wet weather is expected due to an Indian Ocean Dipole attributed to the warming of the ocean.Such extreme weather events should galvanise Africans; their governments are spending 2% of GDP on climate related disasters, said Anthony Nyong, Director for Climate Change and Green Growth at the African Development Bank. He encouraged the global community to remain steadfast in finding effective solutions to climate change. The annual negotiations are now in their 25th year.""The global community, and in particular Africa has a lot to offer in terms of solutions; what is evidently lacking is the global political will to turn potential into wealth to serve humanity and the planet,"" said Nyong, who led the Bank's delegation to the UN conference.At the conference, African delegates pushed for support for climate finance to build resilience against the impact of climate change and for special consideration for Africa around targets contained in the treaties under discussion.The discussions at COP 25 centred around the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement, which calls on countries to cut carbon emissions to ensure that global temperatures do not rise by more than 2\'b0C by the end of this century, while attempting to contain it within 1.5\'b0C. The conference ended with a declaration on the ""urgent need"" to close the gap between existing emissions pledges and the temperature goals of the Paris agreement.The African Development Bank attended the conference to lend strategic support to its regional member countries in the negotiations.Nyong pointed out that Africa is committed; 51 of the 54 African countries have already ratified their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement signed at the landmark COP21 in Paris. The NDCs are specific climate change targets that each country must set.Support for the Bank-funded Desert to Power project highlighted Africa's determination to strive for a climate-friendly world, especially for its local populations, said Nyong. Desert to Power is a $20 billion initiative to deploy solar energy solutions across the entire Sahel region, generating 10,000 MW to provide 250 million people with clean electricity.""The African Development Bank stands ready as ever to assist its regional member countries to build resilience against climate change, as indicated by the Bank's decision to join the Alliance for Hydromet Development, announced at COP 25 ( HYPERLINK http://bit.ly/35sye5Shttp://bit.ly/35sye5SThe Bank will also continue to drive initiatives to strengthen the ability of regional member countries to advocate robustly at global forums such as COP 25, Nyong added. One example was the Bank's participation at the annual African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN) and support for the Africa Group of Negotiations (AGN).""We look forward to engaging further with regional member countries and other parties to ensure that the continent's development agenda remains on track,"" Nyong added.Leaders and institutions from 196 nations plus the European Union, who have signed up to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, attended the conference in Madrid.Distributed by APO Group on behalf of African Development Bank Group (AfDB).Media Contact:Gershwin WanneburgCommunication and External Relations DepartmentAfrican Development BankEmail: HYPERLINK mailto:g.wanneburg@afdb.orgg.wanneburg@afdb.orgAbout the African Development Bank Group:The African Development Bank Group ( HYPERLINK http://www.AfDB.orgwww.AfDB.org ) is Africa's premier development finance institution.

Climate action is the most important cause of our generation and is therefore worth it. If there is a time to be useful for others, it is now,' said the president of Costa Rica, Carlos Alvarado Quesada, whose country promised to make an unconventional PreCOP.The gathering provided fresh impetus on the road towards the 25th Conference of the Parties (COP25) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to be held in Santiago, Chile, this December.There, more countries, cities, companies and local governments are expected to increase ambition and present new goals.Current national climate action plans under the Paris Agreement put the world on a path towards global warming of 3\'b0 Celsius, so ambition needs to be urgently raised.Ovais Sarmad, deputy executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, said: 'It has been hugely encouraging to hear everyone at PreCOP25 talking about the need to raise ambition on climate action.'Governments and all stakeholders have heard the message of young people to protect their future loud and clear, along with the message of science which states that time is running out and we have only a very narrow window of opportunity to act.'At COP25Ovais Sarmad commended the progress made to lift ambition, build a bridge from the September UN Climate Summit in New York to COP25 in Chile and then on to COP26 in the UK. He thanked the President of Costa Rica for hosting the meeting and generating positive momentum.Participants of the PreCOP emphasized the importance of increasing ambition of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) in each country. For that, the three focus areas of the conference are key: nature-based solutions, sustainable cities and the blue economy.'This PreCOP25 demonstrated that there are ambitious solutions and successful experiences that can guide us towards the 1.5 C goal. We have achieved technical strength and political depth. Nature-based solutions are 30 per cent of the climate solution and Costa Rica has demonstrated in the last three decades that it is possible to grow economically and conserve nature at the same time,' said Costa Rican Minister of Environment and Energy, Carlos Manuel Rodr\'edguez.Minister Rodr\'edguez stressed that the meeting emphasized the link between the climate change process and the biodiversity process within the United Nations.Alicia B\'e1rcena, Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) added: 'Costa Rica demonstrates that it is possible to put the economy at the service of environmental protection in a region like ours that has depended on hydrocarbons in the past.'The meeting allowed the discussion of issues unresolved by the Katowice climate summit regarding the operating guidel"

"COP25","Nigeria","COP25_Nigeria24","Cop25 - Cse Wants Humanity to Recognise Climate Change, Take Decisive Action","December 24, 2019","This Day (Lagos)","Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) has urged governments around the world not to just recognise the urgency of climate action, but also the fact that this action must be decisive.Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) is a public interest research and advocacy organisation based in New Delhi. CSE researches into, lobbies for and communicates the urgency of development that is both sustainable and equitable.CSE stated in a position paper at the just concluded climate conference, CoP25 that ""The imperative of transformation and the idea of net zero targets by 2050 should not mean that governments get the liberty to delay domestic action to mitigate emissions; or to design another cheap and convoluted market-based system so that rich countries can buy their way out of the climate crisis.""The fact remains that climate impacts are affecting the poor today. As temperatures increase, they will hit us all - climate change is a great leveller. Without cooperation based on equity, climate change action will not be effective or ambitious. CSE would like to remind governments of the need for both ambition and equity in the negotiations.""What is clear is that climate change is happening, and a climate emergency is upon us. The poor, particularly farmers in the countries of the South, who are not responsible for the stock of emissions in the atmosphere, are the worst hit. They are the victims of climate change. In India, official figures reveal that 2,405 people died due to extreme weather events in 2018-19. Dust storms in northern India linked to global weather patterns killed over 500 in 2018. Cloud-burst like events have increased in numbers and frequency, as have climate-change linked heat waves and forest fires. Variable and extreme rain is leading to increased flooding and water scarcity. Intense heat spikes in northern India have been making the ground dry, exacerbating a flood-drought cycle which is playing havoc with the livelihoods of subsistence farmers.The impact is also visible in Africa, where the predominantly rain-fed agriculture is very vulnerable to climate change. The entire continent is experiencing rising temperatures and reducing precipitation, which could make it more food-insecure. We also know that the impact of extreme weather events is not limited to a short period as they cripple lives, destroy livelihoods, and extinguish the development dividend.""What we would like to state unambiguously is that the world is not on track to stay below 1.5\'b0C - seen as the guardrail, as temperature increase beyond this will spiral the world out of control. In fact, according to the UNEP's Emissions Gap Report, the current emission targets, called Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), are so unambitious that even if all countries adhered to what they had agreed to, the world would still be heading towards being 3.2\'b0C warmer by the end of the century. But that is not the bad news. The bad news is that countries are not even close to meeting the weak and unambitious NDCs that they have set for themselves. According to the same UNEP report, current emissions are way above this and many G20 countries are unlikely to meet the targets.Countries must raise their ambition and the NDC targets due next year must be set consistent with at least a 2\'b0C trajectory, if not a 1.5\'b0C trajectory -- but these targets must be based on equity and climate justice. Past consumption has been highly iniquitous with developed countries having consumed a disproportionate share of the carbon pie. CSE's analysis of the past and future carbon budgets finds that only China will increase its share of the carbon budget by 2030; there will be nothing left for the rest of the world - by 2030, at current rates of emissions, the carbon budget to keep the world below 1.5\'b0C will be exhausted. What then happens to the right to development of the rest of the countries of the South?CSE is also deeply concerned that the current discussions on net zero targets and its corresponding market mechanism could delay the much-needed domestic action and also lead the world to designing (once again) a convoluted market mechanism, which will look for cheap mitigation options in the developing world. This would be disastrous. The world has run out of time and space and needs transformative solutions. The market mechanism must be designed to promote high-cost and transformative actions and not lock the world into creative carbon fudging once again. The mistakes of the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which flooded the market with cheap carbon credits, must not be repeated. CSE is demanding that credits should only be created for expensive mitigation solutions, which cost more than a defined threshold -- say US $100-150 per tonne of CO2 abatement. This will ensure that only genuinely challenging projects which involve meaningful technology transfer to developing countries will take place. It will also mitigate the risk of developing countries selling off their cheaper mitigation options and then being left with only expensive options to meet their own targets.The net zero carbon emissions targets of countries - set to allow countries to emit and to take out of the atmosphere through forest sequestration and other technologies the excess of their domestic emissions - must not end up delaying domestic action; countries should not be led to believe that they can use technology to mop up the excess. This is just not acceptable. The net zero target must be designed to allow countries to undertake drastic action domestically to reduce emissions and then, if there is a gap, to buy high-cost transformative emission reduction from the developing world.CSE said, ""The bottom l"

He called for international support to enable Nigeria to make substantial progress.He, however, expressed the readiness of the National Assembly to partner with the parliament and government of Britain to combat environmental challenges, including climate change.He said:' The commitment of the Nigerian government to addressing the myriads of environmental challenges is not in doubt. However, funding has been a major challenge. Budgetary provisions would never be enough, given the enormity of the challenges Nigeria is already grappling within various other areas.'There are also issues of policy, enlightenment, national consciousness, and capacity building.'However, environmental issues are global, hence the need for global cooperation because no country is isolated. What affects one country virtually impacts the rest of the world directly or indirectly.'Therefore, we are eager to learn, eager to work, and eager to collaborate with the Government of Britain and the rest of the international community in a mutually beneficial partnership to make our environment safer for us and the future generations', he said.He also expressed the willingness of the National Assembly to partner with the parliament of the United Kingdom through exchanges to build the requisite legislative capacity and share legal ideas on legal frameworks on environmental issues.'We are also strong believers in parliamentary diplomacy. And it is important we partner at the level of parliament to parliament, government to government, for the mutual benefit of our peoples and the world', he added.Speaking earlier, Mr Melbourne expressed the readiness of the British government to work with Nigeria to address environmental challenges.He said that Nigeria, given her size, should be able to tap into global resources for addressing environmental challenges.He added that the UK would be hosting the 26th Session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 26), United Nations Climate Change Conference, in Glasgow, Scotland in 2020 and would therefore relate further with the Committee and the Nigerian government on the event in the days ahead, stressing that the country's full participation would add to the success of the summit, being a very important country in Africa.Also at the meeting were the Vice-Chairman, Senate Committee on Environment, Senator Ibrahim Hassan Hadejia and a member of the Committee, Senator Michael Nnachi.\l"

It is addressed in a number of the negotiation streams in relation to Long-Term Finance, the Green Climate Fund, Reporting on climate finance, Loss and Damage finance and support for the implementation of the Gender Action Plan.Head of ACT Alliance's delegation to COP25, Mattias S\'f6derberg said, ""Climate finance continues to be a difficult topic in these talks. Parties should remember that climate action will not be possible unless climate finance is made available and is accessible. We cannot accept another agreement where support to developing countries remains merely a wishful possibility.""The ACT Alliance is a global network of churches and church-based agencies that does humanitarian response, sustainable development, and advocacy work. ACT is made up of 156 members working in over 125 countries.""Developing countries are eager to take climate action and to build their resilience while transitioning towards low carbon development. It is therefore important that climate finance is scaled up, made predictable, accessible and is delivered by developed country parties.""It should be acknowledged that there are already climate finance flows going to developing countries, however, there are numerous examples of climate finance being used for projects that are not necessarily related to climate change in developing countries.""Mattias said, ""A lack of agreement about what climate finance is and what it can be used for challenges the trust amongst parties in these talks. What we have seen is that developed countries claim that they offer support, while developing countries question where the money is. Without trust, the talks on climate finance will not be solved.""Developed countries must ensure that their support is transparent and adequate and that it facilitates timely climate action where it is needed most, the group said.The majority of existing climate finance is delivered to mitigation and the rest to adaptation. However, currently, there is no support allocated for loss and damage, making this a hot topic at COP25. Developing countries are calling for loss and damage finance and support for those who are most affected by cyclones, droughts and floods and other climate impacts.""Loss and damage finance is a necessity and it should not be channelled from finance for adaptation or mitigation. Finance for loss and damage needs to be additional, new and predictable to allow countries to plan and respond effectively to the climate crisis,"" says Julius Mbatia of ACT member Christian Aid and ACT Kenya Forum.""Innovative sources of finance are needed to close the existing loss and damage finance gap. It is of utmost importance that loss and damage is given the priority that it deserves here at COP25,"" says Julius.""It makes no sense to have a debate where parties accept that loss and damage should be addressed, yet no support is made available. This summit should deliver a clear commitment on adequate support for those most in need, parties must promise to not leave anyone behind,"" Mattias said.\l"

""They need to wake up in 2020.""The gathering had been due to end at the two-week mark on Friday but ran on for two extra days \- a long delay even by the standards of often torturous climate summits.Chile had earlier triggered outrage after drafting a version of the text that campaigners complained was so weak it betrayed the spirit of the Paris Agreement.The process set out in that deal hinges on countries ratcheting up emissions cuts next year.'A CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY'?The final draft did acknowledge the ""significant gap"" between existing pledges and the temperature goals adopted in 2015.Nevertheless, it was still seen as a weak response to the sense of urgency felt by communities around the world afflicted by floods, droughts, wildfires and cyclones that scientists say have become more intense as the Earth rapidly warms.""COP25The Madrid talks became mired in disputes over the rules that should govern international carbon trading, favored by wealthier countries to reduce the cost of cutting emissions. Brazil and Australia were among the main holdouts, delegates said, and the summit deferred big decisions on carbon markets for later.""As many others have expressed, we are disappointed that we once again failed to find agreement,"" said Felipe De Leon, a climate official speaking on behalf of Costa Rica. ""We engaged actively, we delivered our homework, and yet we did not quite get there.""Smaller nations had also hoped to win guarantees of financial aid to cope with climate change.

On the other hand, it's expected to increase fuel costs.UNCTAD Deputy Secretary-General, Isabelle Durant, who led the organization's delegation to the UN Climate Change Conference () in Madrid, Spain said ""we have to embrace the change to create a healthier planet for all of us"", pointing out that trade can be a driver for climate action.UNCTAD is also part of the Getting to Zero Coalition that is committed to getting commercially viable deep-sea zero-emission vessels powered by zero-emission fuels into operation by 2030.The coalition held an event on sustainable maritime transport during COP25 on December 10. The event examined the prospects of zero-emissions shipping for developing countries and large ocean states or small island developing states (SIDS).""The same countries that suffer most from climate change might also be the ones that would potentially suffer from higher shipping costs due to more expensive fuel"", Ms. Durant said, adding that this raises the question of inequality.Continuing, Ms. Durant said, ""the fact is that we are not all equal in the face of the negative impacts resulting from climate change and environmental degradation."" According to her, global action against climate change should consider this inequality and ensure the special needs of the most vulnerable economies are duly considered in the quest to reduce shipping emissions to zero.These include least developed countries and SIDS, where transport costs can reach 21% and 22% of the value of imports, respectively, as opposed to 1.00% in developed economies, based on UNCTAD data. Discussions at COP25 were also focused on how to bolster actions on resilience and adaption in the face of the severe impacts of the climate emergency.A round table discussion on accelerating action to build a resilient world at 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming was held on December 10. Ms. Durant, who participated in the round table discussion, cited the case of the Bahamas, where Hurricane Dorian, the most intense tropical cyclone on record to strike the country.It resulted in losses worth $3.4 billion, wiping out over a quarter of the country's gross domestic product.Namibia is experiencing its worst drought in 90 years. The drought has ravaged agricultural production, undermined export crops, triggered food shortages and put pressure on the country's debt, undermining years of efforts to reduce it.""In both cases, what needs to be addressed is the development and economic approach to climate and disaster resilience"", Ms. Durant said.Required measures include economic diversification, which increases the ability of economies to adapt to shocks. In addition, infrastructure should be built and operated in a way that anticipates, prepares for, and adapts to changing climate conditions, Ms. Durant said.SIDS are already seeing the devastating effects of climate change, including sea-level rise and coastal erosion, which are affecting their infrastructure and economies. These countries remain at risk because they do not have the finances to firstly mitigate, and critically, to adapt their infrastructure.Coastal infrastructure is particularly critical for SIDS, where ports and coastal airports are lifel"

We want to remind him and equally ask him to fulfill that promise.Williams, expressed optimism that ending gas flaring was achievable specially as the Minister of State for Petroleum was from the south-south region which was adversely affected by the effects of gas flaring.""This is also a clarion call for us to mobilise our voices to support mr president and his government to end gas flaring even this year, it is doable with technology, it only needs somebody to push these oil companies to be willing to do it.""

However, environment groups are of the opinion that little progress was made in advancing real solutions to the global climate crisis due to the interests of certain nations.Philip Jakpor, Head of Media and Campaigns, Environmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria, in a release sent to Ecoscope said, 'We face another dangerous reality: governments have failed yet again to deliver what the world needs for real climate action. Across policy areas, instead of action, the ills of corporate interference and influence were on full display.'Parties had an opportunity to finally begin to root out the corrosive influence of the fossil fuel industry. Instead, Trump's delegation along with Australia and other Global North countries went to new lows to prevent the undue and proven influence of the fossil fuel industry from even being acknowledged - let alone addressed.'He said, 'Time and again, the US has gone out of its way to undermine the talks on behalf of the fossil fuel industry. The result was an injustice - not only for governments and civil society - but for people around the world who desperately need real climate action.'This is what corporate capture looks like when it's threatened. And that's why this policy is so vital for the future of this process. In the end, a small minority of countries with clear ties to the fossil fuel industry was able to drown out the demands of almost 50 Global South countries and four civil society constituencies at this meeting.''But the call to kick polluters out is not confined to the walls of the UNFCCC. Following the call from countries collectively representing more than 70 per cent of the world's population, over 600,000 people and hundreds of organizations in more than 130 countries are ensuring this call is inescapable from the UN Climate Summit in September to COP25 in December.'Sriram Madhusoodanan, Deputy Campaigns Director at Corporate Accountability, on his part said, 'Although the obstruction of polluting corporations and the governments in their pockets was on full display at these talks, Global South governments fighting for climate justice seized every opportunity to prioritize the real climate action needed to keep warming below 1.5 degrees. In the Article 6 negotiations, historically overrun by industry interests, governments began to expand the toolbox of policies that don't rely on polluter-backed policies, like markets.'In the AIM discussions, the negotiating bloc representing nearly 50 Global South countries stood unwaveringly with people in the face of unprecedented bullying and intimidation from the US, Australia, the EU and Norway. Their dedication gives hope that something meaningful can come still out of this process. Government champions and hundreds of thousands of people around the world will not stand by while this process and the future of our planet are sold off to the highest bidder. COP25 will be about people holding governments and polluters accountable. It's time for governments in these talks to heed this call and firewall international climate policy from the polluting corporations that have fueled this crisis.'\l"

'But whilst the mood was constructive, we need to resolve all outstanding issues by COP25 in order to live up to our collective responsibility and ensure that ambition is raised to the extent that the worst impacts of climate change can be avoided.'While the meeting took place, multiple heat records were broken for June in Europe, including in the conference host country, Germany.

During the last decade, many planning researchers have focused on growth management and sustainability and have not always seen these factors as directly connected to climate change. Climatological research over the past decades has proved that the Earth's climate is changing in response to anthropogenic increase of atmospheric greenhouse gases. Thus, global warming can be considered as one of the priority environmental risks generating long-term hazards for society and so they requires efficient political response.Climate change policy is the principal response to the problem of global warming and thus climate change policy studies should stressed the importance of integration of climate change issues in all our sectors.Therefore, for government to effectively implement policies and measures and to monitor progress in achieving climate change mitigation targets, we need to use a wide mix of policy instruments, including regulations, economic and fiscal instruments, and voluntary agreements, raising public awareness because the consequences of lack of action by the world's nations including Nigeria, is that, the planet will be warmer, sea level will rise, and patterns of rainfall will change. But the future is also partly uncertain - there is considerable uncertainty about how we will arrive at that different climate.

"COP25","Nigeria","COP25_Nigeria41","What we are doing to tackle climate change - Minister","January 18, 2020 Saturday","Weekly Trust","Campaigns on climate change have been resisted in some quarters. What is your view on this?Today, what dominates our thinking and concern is the climate change issue which is really affecting everything and everyone. Human, animal and plant species are being impacted by climate change. We must all know that this is because of the way we mishandled our planet. Maybe from the beginning, it was ignorance that action or lack of it can cause damage to our environment which will translate to damage to ourselves.But I think, even after we realised that, we continued unfortunately to do same things and that injured the planet. The unfortunate part is that today, there are some leaders who don't even believe in climate change issues. But the truth is that it is real and if you ask island nations,those in the middle of the Pacific, Indian or Atlantic oceans, they will tell you that they are losing land mass because the oceans are rising. This is because of the melting of the polar ice cap in Antarctica and other places and they are melting because the temperature of our planet has increased.Since the pre-industrial time to today, temperature has so increased that it is causing the melting. Increase in temperature can cause other things on animals, plants and humans because certain species can only operate within a certain temperature. By the time the temperature is too high, they just can't survive.What is your assessment of the just concluded COP25 in Spain?I can say it was very successful and Nigeria had a very good showing. We participated in the negotiation and went with a credible team of negotiators, technical support team and we participated in several other functions. I represented Mr President and delivered the national statement in which we sent the point home including the issue of developed countries coming through with their pledges, the ratification of any treaty or agreement that has been signed. It was a good show as civil societies made their case. The leaders have gotten their messages. I will say that people are really ready for action and the time for talking is over.There are accusations that governments are not serious on the issue of climate change and countries that are the highest polluters are withdrawing aid from the victims. What are the African ministers of environment doing to strengthen action on climate change?It is a very thorny issue because some of the developed countries are withdrawing but a good majority of them are there sticking with the climate change action programme. I remember that at the recent UN General Assembly, Angel Merkel of Germany admitted that countries responsible for the climate crisis are the developed countries but the developing countries are the ones bearing the brunt of the crisis. She also pledged that they will double their efforts in terms of financing.At the last COP25If these countries completely pull out of the climate change agreement, does Africa have the resources to fight climate change?We will have to, just as we are being innovative now with finances. We will not just fold our hands; we will have to be innovative as we should to continue the fight against climate change. But I can assure you that very few countries will probably pull out.

"COP25","Nigeria","COP25_Nigeria42","Climate Crisis Takes Centre Stage At UN Trade Forum","September 9, 2019 Monday","News Chronicle (Nigeria)","Climate CrisisExpectedly, the climate crisis will be far-reaching for all people and nations, but small island development states are at the forefront of its impacts. It also stands to wipe out trade gains of these vulnerable islands if not addressed now.This reality has brought the world's island nations, the trade community, policy-makers, and the United Nations' top agencies together for the first-ever United Nations Trade Forum slated for this September 9-13.The insights and inputs will fed into the much anticipated United Nations Climate Action Summit later this month, on September 23 at the organisation's headquarters in New York.Forum participants will explore the linkages between trade, climate change, oceans economy and biodiversity, and exchange innovative ideas and approaches on how global trade and related policies may enable and support the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Secretary-General, Mukhisa Kituyi, said ''tackling the climate crisis brings many added benefits, such as economic diversification, jobs and innovation, which form the base for shared prosperity and financial stability. Trade has an important role to play in leveraging those co-benefits. Trade can be part of the solution to the climate crisis.''As the climate changes, the trade regime is also evolving. Purely commercial considerations are now only part of the trade policy equation, with much more being placed on sustainable development. Articulating a positive agenda on climate and trade, signals an important departure from the past two decades of treating trade as a taboo subject in climate policy.Director of UNCTAD's Trade and Commodities Division, Pamela Coke-Hamilton, said ''the Paris Agreement does not contain any references to trade, but in a sense it's the most important trade agreement.''Once countries' commitments under the landmark agreement start playing out in trade patterns around the world, they will bring about big changes \- positive and negative, intended and unintended \- for trading partners.Coke-Hamilton said forward-looking approaches are required to explore any opportunities for including trade elements in countries' climate commitments, and that the Paris Agreement opens the prospects for a collective transformation, not just for individual economies, but for the global economy as well.This transformation will require a massive reallocation of resources at the international level. At the domestic level, it will necessitate structural changes, which are bound to raise equity and distributional concerns that have been central to UNCTAD's work for decades.The forum will explore how to change the approach from one of allocating or shifting burdens among countries through trade-restrictive measures, to figuring out ways in which trade could help all countries, developing and developed, big and small, share the benefits of transforming their economies.Delegates will deliberate on how to accelerate action on the means of implementation \- finance, technology and capacity-building \- and the role of trade as an enabling factor in meeting this need and leveraging the various co-benefits of tackling the climate emergency.The forum will, through the lens of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 12, 13, 14, 15 and 17, focus on the value of oceans, circular economy and biotrade in building diversification and resilience to climate change, especially in small island developing states (SIDS).SIDS are on the frontl"

Launched in 2018, this has seen 111,542 canisters given to families.LPG eliminates the need for wood burning and has set the stage for a reforestation effort. This initiative also improves indoor air quality in shelters, protecting the health of women and girls and other family members from smoke-induced illnesses.There is also a reforestation drive which has already planted 775,000 trees on 778 hectares (the equivalent of 1,089 football pitches), in and around the refugee camps. In addition to absorbing carbon dioxide \- trees reduce landslide risk by increasing soil retention.To the credit of the UN agency, 1,889 solar lamps have been distributed to households and placed in public areas in and around the Rohingya refugee camps. In addition to increasing protection and safety, residents are less reliant on wood fires or oil lamps.IOM is equally installing solar electricity systems and battery storage at most of its 23 local health clinics to provide clean, reliable electricity. We aim to increase this green electrification effort in other facilities.The humanitarian world's largest solar-powered well system was launched this year, bringing over 20,000 litres of clean water to beneficiaries daily, supplied by a 60 KVa solar park.Those who know better say IOM's tree-planting initiative could lead up to 37 million pounds of C02 emissions reduction since 2018.Deputy Chief of Mission Manuel Pereira said that the efforts have both local and global significance: ''Bangladesh is a climate vulnerable country and one that is on the forefront of migration. ''We urge other partners, donors and governments to stand with us on this fight. The lessons learned from our host community and government support projects are significant to other parts of Bangladesh and to its objectives for the 2030 Agenda and SDGs.''

"COP25","Nigeria","COP25_Nigeria45","What We Are Doing to Tackle Climate Change - Minister [interview]","January 15, 2020","Daily Trust (Abuja)","Minister of Environment, Dr. Mohammad Mahmood Abubakar in this interview with Daily Trust, says the federal government will issue the third Green Bond in March and commence the planting of 25 million trees as part of efforts to tackle climate change issues, among other initiatives.Campaigns on climate change have been resisted in some quarters. What is your view on this?Today, what dominates our thinking and concern is the climate change issue which is really affecting everything and everyone. Human, animal and plant species are being impacted by climate change. We must all know that this is because of the way we mishandled our planet. Maybe from the beginning, it was ignorance that action or lack of it can cause damage to our environment which will translate to damage to ourselves.But I think, even after we realised that, we continued unfortunately to do same things and that injured the planet. The unfortunate part is that today, there are some leaders who don't even believe in climate change issues. But the truth is that it is real and if you ask island nations,those in the middle of the Pacific, Indian or Atlantic oceans, they will tell you that they are losing land mass because the oceans are rising. This is because of the melting of the polar ice cap in Antarctica and other places and they are melting because the temperature of our planet has increased.Since the pre-industrial time to today, temperature has so increased that it is causing the melting. Increase in temperature can cause other things on animals, plants and humans because certain species can only operate within a certain temperature. By the time the temperature is too high, they just can't survive.What is your assessment of the just concluded COP25 in Spain?I can say it was very successful and Nigeria had a very good showing. We participated in the negotiation and went with a credible team of negotiators, technical support team and we participated in several other functions. I represented Mr President and delivered the national statement in which we sent the point home including the issue of developed countries coming through with their pledges, the ratification of any treaty or agreement that has been signed. It was a good show as civil societies made their case. The leaders have gotten their messages. I will say that people are really ready for action and the time for talking is over.There are accusations that governments are not serious on the issue of climate change and countries that are the highest polluters are withdrawing aid from the victims. What are the African ministers of environment doing to strengthen action on climate change?It is a very thorny issue because some of the developed countries are withdrawing but a good majority of them are there sticking with the climate change action programme. I remember that at the recent UN General Assembly, Angel Merkel of Germany admitted that countries responsible for the climate crisis are the developed countries but the developing countries are the ones bearing the brunt of the crisis. She also pledged that they will double their efforts in terms of financing.At the last COP25If these countries completely pull out of the climate change agreement, does Africa have the resources to fight climate change?We will have to, just as we are being innovative now with finances. We will not just fold our hands; we will have to be innovative as we should to continue the fight against climate change. But I can assure you that very few countries will probably pull out. I know the United States has started pulling out but I don't see major countries following suit.What's the place of green bond and green financing?This was also a big topic at the just concluded COP25 that I attended and there are lots of funding agencies and banks that are willing to go green and provide funds for such projects.

And for obvious reasons, too.Image Credit: ICIRFor a nation of nearly 200 million people - where darkness persists and where power generation only reached 5,090MW in April 2018 - Nigerians are not in the best position to negotiate the type of energy they consume.To confirm that desperation, between 1999 and 2007, Nigerian government, under the administration of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, expended an estimated $16billion on power. Yet, the situation left Nigeria in dire straits. By the time Obasanjo left office in 2007, power generation had dipped further, hovering around 2,700MW.Anxious to meet the nation's energy needs, Nigeria is turning to coal, with an initial projection that would see coal-fired electricity accounting for 30% of its power generation. According to Bawa, the Federal Government had reviewed its policies on exploration and mining to support this ambition.One step forward, two backwardsOn September 22, 2016, before a mixed crowd of civil society groups and political leaders, President Muhammadu Buhari signed the Paris Agreement as Nigeria's commitment to combating the impact of climate in the country.By May 2017, the agreement was ratified, making Nigeria the 146th nation to sign the global treaty as a major provision of the United Nations Framework on Climate Change (UNFCC).Since signing the treaty, Nigeria has played a major role in all Conference of Parties events, policy roundtables and negotiations, including the recently concluded 2019 COP25 Negotiations held in Madrid, Spain.Yet, these efforts have translated to little or nothing. Even though Nigeria clearly articulated eight core areas of interest to reduce green gas emission - including the 2030 target to end gas flaring, 45% conditional and 20% unconditional carbon emission reduction - rhetoric still trumps action, and Nigeria faces grimmer climate prospects in the coming years.During the COP25'Nigeria faces grave social, economic and environmental threats consequent to climate change due to our country's dependence on climate-sensitive resources.

The coalition, co-led by Finland and Chile, comprises 51 countries including Nigeria that accounts for 30 percent of global Gross Domestic Product (GDP). ""We will not achieve our climate goals unless we have unity and cooperation on a global scale to tackle climate change which is an existential threat to all of us,"" said Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). ""Finance is at the heart of our economies and it must be at the very center of our efforts to transform them. It is the lifeblood of production and consumption worldwide and it must become the seed of a new global economy,"" Espinosa said. ""Without it, a sustainable, greener world will be impossible,"" she added. The coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action was launched at the World Bank Group IMF Spring Meetings in April 2019, with members endorsing six principles known as the 'Helsinki Principles.' Nigeria is among the countries that have endorsed the Helsinki Principles and the Santiago Action Plan. The Helsinki Principle promotes national climate action, especially through carbon pricing, macro-fiscal policy, public budgeting, and financial sector initiatives. Ignacio Briones, Minister of Finance, Chile, reaffirmed the political commitment of the Finance Ministers to climate change and sustainable development. ""People are the ones who suffer the pernicious effects of the temperature increase. Also, people are the ones who are suffering the transition to a low emission economy when this transition is not fair,"" Briones said. Under the plan, with individual countries' national content recognised, Finance Ministers have agreed to work together by sharing best practices and experiences and initiating analytical work to support policy action to reach evidenced-based cost-efficient solutions. ""The time to come as a global community and accelerate the transition to low carbon and climate-resilient future is now.

"COP25","Nigeria","COP25_Nigeria56","Morocco Has Africa's 'First Fully Solar Village'","December 13, 2019 Friday","Nigerian Tribune","Near Morocco's sunny Atlantic coast, the tiny community of Id Mjahdi is being touted as Africa's first completely solar-powered village.Solar power has the potential to become one of Africa's top energy sources, according to the International Energy Agency, but more infrastructure needs to be installed - of all solar power in use globally, less than 1% currently comes from the continent.Morocco is leading efforts to fulfill that potential. It already meets 35 percent of its electricity needs from renewables and aims to increase its use of renewable energy to 52 percent by 2030, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).'Morocco is unquestionably a leader in sustainable energy,' says Francesco La Camera, director-general of IRENA.The country already has the world's largest solar farm, the Noor-Ouarzazate complex. Now, Id Mjahdi, on the outskirts of the city of Essaouira, is being pitched as a blueprint for how to power remote villages that would be expensive to connect to the national electricity grid.While many other African villages use solar power to some extent, Id Mjahdi uses it for all its energy needs.Self sufficientWhen Moroccan solar power company Cleanergy came up with the idea of testing a sustainable model for electrifying remote communities, it looked for a village 'where they need everything,' according to the company's founder, Mohamed Lasry.Before the scheme began, villagers relied on candles for light, and they typically could afford only around an hour of candlelight for working or studying in the evenings. They would burn tree bark for heating and cooking, which was bad for their health, says Lasry.Id Mjahdi did not even have a nearby source of water, and girls in particular often missed school days to walk several miles to a well, says Lasry.The first step in the $188,000 project was to build a water tower for the community. The next stage was to install a power station with 32 solar photovoltaic panels, which generate 8.32 kilowatts of electricity for distribution via a mini-grid.The power station is connected to around 20 homes in the village, serving more than 50 people. Each house was provided with a fridge, water heater, television, oven and an outlet to charge devices. The solar network has a battery that can supply up to five hours of electricity outside daylight hours.The project was also assisted by Cluster Solaire, a Moroccan non-profit that supports green-tech companies, which enlisted financial help from the Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy and French businesses Intermarch\'e9 and Petit Olivier.In October, Cleanergy unveiled several solar-powered buildings - a hammam (public baths), a workshop where women study and produce argan oil, and a preschool for children between the ages of three to six, which enables their mothers to workWhile the children play and draw, 30 women - many of whom did not go to school as children - learn reading and writing, train for scholarships, and use traditional techniques to create argan oil, crushing kernels from local argan trees. Cosmetics company Petit Olivier buys all the argan oil the women produce, giving them an income.'People that were not working at all and not having any sustainable revenue, the fact that they are working in their village and creating value is very important and very, very valuable,' says Fatima El Khalifa, from Cluster Solaire, who is giving a presentation on the project at the COP25 climate summit in Madrid this week. 'We created an association like a cooperative at the village and they own the whole production.'The association takes a small fee from the argan oil sales to maintain the solar network, and men and women in the village were trained by Cleanergy in how to manage it.Lasry says the mini-grid is simple to replicate for villages of 100 to 1,000 people, and it is sustainable, because locals can maintain it themselves. 'It is possible to duplicate anywhere in the world,' he says. 'It is not a complex system, it is easy to do, it is robust.'Cluster Solaire is now seeking funding to build more solar villages. El Khalifa says there are 800 villages without electricity in Morocco alone and the World Bank estimates that 840 million people lack access to electricity worldwide.Around 650 million people will still lack access to electricity in 2030, nine out of 10 of them in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the World Bank. It says mini-grids could be the most cost-effective solution for remote areas with a high enough demand, and could provide electricity for 500 million people by 2030.'Our plan is to show [Id Mjahdi] as an example,' says Lasry. 'People change - they have more time, they can have money, they can go to the market, they can buy what they need.'For deprived communities seeking economic stability that won't hurt the environment, this solar village shines bright.\l"

Speaking on her expectations for the environment in the year ahead, especially in the area of climate change, waste management and recycling, Lawani said, 'The world can no longer deny or live in ignorance as the realities of climate change are biting hard. The major contribution to these changes is human activities. I would like to see more people care enough for the environment, and to actually start taking practical measureable steps towards making a difference and quit complaining!'She added that, 'It would be great if the authorities can set up schemes that reward and celebrate good behaviour.' If the government authorities do this, 'many more people can join in the train.' 'And the next step after that would be to put up penalties for noncompliance. I mean in Rwanda, if you are caught littering, you would be arrested. It's that serious!She explained further her blueprint for environmental action, 'Before we get there, people must be encouraged to become responsible stewards of the environment first, and get them to gradually change behaviour - by incentivising and celebrating. And then those who still refuse, sanction them!'Else, we will just be playing lip service and will not achieve any real change.'The Greenhill Recycling boss added that 'More producers of these plastics (companies) should rise up to their responsibility of recovering their products from the environment. They must support recycling aggregators and set aside funds to ensure effective collection.'Everyone has a role to play: consumers must also become more responsible knowing that they are the first recipients of the consequences of their behaviour, whether good or bad.'Seyifunmi Adebote, an environmentalist and a youth delegate to the recent UN COP25 climate conference, told Ecoscope that 'The Federal Government of Nigeria should make environmental actions priority. 2019 was an opportunity for the government to appreciate the roles of young people. In 2020, I believe the roles of youths will be increased and we will continue to push the government to work, as well as, show readiness to contribute when called upon.'As of today, we know that environmental issues in Nigeria are not on the government's priority list, hence, the government keeps shooting itself in the leg with many anti-environmental policies, partnerships and structures that outright negate the verbal commitment to be environmentally responsible.'The most important thing will be that the young people continue to use founded approaches and the experiences of other counterparts to get the government of Nigeria and the people to do better.' President of the Environmental Health Students Association (EHSA) at the University of Ibadan, Jentle Esuong speaks on his expectations on environment in 2020 with specific reference to waste management.'The poor waste management in Nigeria is no longer news and is very evident in the city of Ibadan.'We in the academic sector have been committed to education, awareness and advocacy, and a number of non-governmentals have been contributing meritoriously to ensure proper waste management around the city of Ibadan.'In provision of adequate facilities for proper and sustainable waste disposal and general management, more has to be done by the government in the coming year 2020. With the rate of awareness and advocacies that have been done, if adequate facilities are provided and accessible in terms of reach and cost, the public will subscribe to them and if made sustainable, the results, outcome and impact will speak for themselves.'He explains further: 'Waste management agencies in Nigeria generally should adopt waste segregation strategy, not segregating after collection but at the point of generation of waste. Every individual and household should be provided with facilities (waste collection drums or containers) to segregate their waste at the point of generation into at least three categories, namely: plastics, biodegradables, paper/sand/metals, with specific colours of containers for various categories. This will make recycling possible and collection by waste management agencies easy.'Waste management agencies should be strengthened in their operations by provision of adequate and efficient waste evacuation truck services, training of workers and provision of safety materials, especially personal protective equipment.'Esuong said there should be upgrade on existing dumpsites into landfills. He said there must be 'provision of modern sanitary landfills in place of dump sites widely in practice.'Temporary dump sites can be established as catchment centres where waste is collected with the intension to transport same to the sanitary landfills. At major points at streets and markets, sizeable tanks for collecting waste in various segregations should be provided, this will end the wide dropping of waste bags in the middle of the road around the city.'He said that authorities must 'educate the public on each step in the introduction of new innovations in waste management and ensure community participation and ensure compliance by reasonable sanctions and enforcement of regulations on waste disposal.'However, it will be unfair to enforce laws where the public has no means of keeping to the law.'On his expectation from the public, the EHSA president said, 'As I mentioned earlier, when a working system is put in place, the members of the public are more likely to subscribe positively.'\l"

"COP25","Nigeria","COP25_Nigeria60","Kogi: Bello, Achuba face-off worsens","August 10, 2019 Saturday","Weekly Trust","The feud between Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State and his Deputy, Elder Simon Achuba, took a new dimension recently with a seven-day ultimatum issued by the deputy governor to Bello to settle his unpaid entitlements or face legal action.Besides, the deputy governor has also alleged that governor Yahaya Bello plans to attack him, an allegation the governor has denied.Achuba had particularly threatened to seek a legal redress at the National Industrial Court if Governor Bello fails to release the statutory allocations allegedly due to his office after the expiration of the ultimatum.A demand notice to the governor, signed by Femi Falana (SAN) on the instructions of the deputy governor, called for the release of all statutory allocations due to the office of the deputy governor for 2017, 2018 and 2019 amounting to over N819million.The letter addressed to Governor Yahaya Bello and dated July 17, read: 'As you are no doubt aware, our client's office is a creation of the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (As Amended). Accordingly, the office is statutorily entitled to the prompt release of all allocations due to it as appropriated by the Kogi State House of Assembly and signed into law as the budget by your Excellency.'Our client has informed us that your Excellency's administration has consistently refused to give approval for the release of funds for the smooth running of the office of the Deputy Governor even after memos to that effect have been approved for the office. In particular, the statutory allocations approved for the office of the Deputy Governor have been withheld by the state government since 2017.'The accumulated statutory allocations as withheld is N819, 709,980.00 which includes travel allowances, hotel bills, pledges and outstanding monthly impress and salaries due to our client as the Deputy Governor of Kogi State.'This said statutory allocations are duly captured in the Kogi State appropriation laws of 2017, 2018, and 2019 supported by various memos sent to your office since 2017 which were duly approved without cash backing till date.'Notwithstanding the fact that the statutory allocations have been illegally withheld, our client has continued to carry out his functions as the Deputy Governor of Kogi State.'In as much as our client is prepared to continue to discharge the enormous responsibilities of his office, he is currently hampered by lack of funds which has wide ranging implications for the state even as it prepares for the forthcoming gubernatorial election.'In view of the foregoing, we have our client's instructions to request your Excellency to use your good offices to ensure the immediate payment of the withheld statutory allocations legitimately appropriated for the office of the Deputy Governor of Kogi state since 2017.'Take notice that if our client's request is not granted within seven days of the receipt of this letter, we have our client's instructions to seek redress in the National Industrial Court.'Few days after Achuba issued an ultimatum to the governor over his unpaid entitlements, he (Achuba) was sighted at the Presidential Villa where he was said to have met with Abba Kyari, Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari.The deputy governor, did not reveal details of the deliberation when asked by State House correspondents.He, however, revealed that discussions were ongoing to resolve the 'problems' between him and the state governor who, he said, was responsible for the stoppage of his allowances for the past two years.'Well, it is a private discussion in relation to my office. From my discussions with him, there is hope that all the issues will be resolved. With God, all things are possible,'' he said.On how he has been 'coping' as deputy governor without allowances and impress in the past two years, Mr Achuba said: 'Well, you know in life, what sustains a man is God. So if your hope is in God, you will be very much alive.'If you have money and don't have God, you will be living like a dead person. But if you have God you can live; He is the one who provides to man. So, if one source closes, God opens another source for you to live. Supposing I was not a Deputy Governor, won't I be alive?'On whether he will support or contest against Governor Bello, who has since indicated interest in the governorship election slated for November 16, the deputy governor ruled out the possibility of doing that because of what he described as 'unfair treatment' being meted against him by his boss.Kogi State Governor Yahaya Bello in his reaction said the salaries of his deputy, Simon Achuba, were not stopped at any point since he became deputy governor.Bello, in a statement by his spokesman, Kingsley Fanwo, was responding to a demand notice and ultimatum by Achuba over alleged non-payment of his entitlements of over N800 million.He said Achuba's salaries had been paid up to the same date as that of Bello and other political office holders in the state.Fanwo, while describing the claims contained in the deputy governor's demand notice as 'bogus', expressed the readiness of the state government to meet him in court should he proceed there to ventilate his alleged grievances.'It is our belief that the claim for salaries at paragraph 4 of the letter of demand was done to generate sensational headl"

Nakate's demonstrations have led to her attending UN Climate Change Conference (COP25) and the World Economic Forum's annual meeting, and her Rise Up Movement spread to several countries on the continent. She no longer protests alone.Muigai says the pressures facing the Congo Basin are worsened by climate change and corruption, even as the World Resources Institute reported in 2019 that its continued disappearance could exacerbate insecurity over fresh water and food supplies among the most vulnerable populations.""There are many conflicts that could arise from climate change and when we do not take care of our environment. There could be higher rates of death, higher chances of getting ill and worsening food insecurity due to unforeseen calamities like the locust invasion in eastern Africa,"" said Muigai.That could upset Africa's economic transition and increase tensions among communities faced with diminishing resources like water, food, and healthcare, said Gita Gopinath, the chief economist at International Monetary Fund, during a February presentation in Nairobi.While much growth in Africa will be posted by energy economies as the continent transits into the new decade, African countries locked in conflicts over resources risk slowing down their economic engine, which is currently growing at a rate of between 2.3 and 3.5 percent, Gopinath said.""There are no simple answers on how Africa can build cohesive and peaceful institutions when there is much reliance on natural resources,"" said Gopinath.But governments and the public can start by taking the little steps that boost peacebuilding, like weeding out corruption, xenophobia, and promoting environmental protection, says Muigai, who has been a climate activist for over a year.For instance, the Grade 11 student at Aga Khan Academy in Nairobi stopped eating beef when research she was conducting for a school project indicated that the beef industry is a large contributor towards greenhouse gas emissions and deforestation in some areas in the world.Her insights echo SDG Goal 16, a section of which states that ""peace, stability, human rights and effective governance based on the rule of law are important conduits for sustainable development"", which goes on to state that ""high levels of armed violence and insecurity have a destructive impact on a country's development, affecting economic growth and often resulting in long standing grievances among communities that can last for generations"".Those generations could represent young climate change activists like Muigai. And the young activists have the support of veteran musicians like Nairobi-based Kombo Chokwe Burns who signs about the importance of good governance and environmental protection.When he started singing, producing, arranging and writing music more than a decade ago, he knew that the l"

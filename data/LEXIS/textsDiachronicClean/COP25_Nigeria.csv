Speakers called for a united front to tackle the challenges of climate change in Africa. In the opening statement for Africa Day on Tuesday, Yasmin Fouad, Egypt's Minister of Environmental Affairs, on behalf of the African Union, said: ""We have, and will continue to engage and to seek landing grounds on the outstanding issues. But we must flag our concern at the apparent reluctance by our interlocutors to engage on issues of priority to developing countries, as evidenced by the large number of such issues which have simply been pushed from session to session without any progress."" Africa contributes the least to global warming emissions yet is the continent most vulnerable to climate change, as witnessed by devastating natural disasters recently. Africa Day has been held at the conference every year since COP 17 in 2011 to rally support for the continent's cause. ""The climate disaster issues confronting the continent demand a predictable and unified response,"" said UN ASG Mohamed Beavogui, Director General of African Risk Capacity, an agency of the African Union ( http://www.AU.int www.AU.int ) that helps governments respond to natural disasters. ""Africa needs to move towards market-based innovative financing models to achieve a strong, united, resilient and globally influential continent. The future of Africa depends on solidarity."" Vera Songwe, Executive Secretary of the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), said the ECA would support African countries to revise their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to attract private sector investments in clean energy. ""The lack of concerted and meaningful global ambition and action to tackle climate change poses an existential threat to African populations,"" Songwe said. The Paris Agreement is the guiding force of current climate negotiations. It calls on nations to curb temperature increases at 2\'b0C by the end of this century, while attempting to contain rises within 1.5\'b0C. The next step is to implement NDCs, which set out national targets under the Paris Agreement. While African countries outlined bold aspirations to build climate resilient and low-carbon economies in their NDCs, the continent's position is that it should not be treated the same as developed nations as its carbon emissions constitute a fraction of the world's big economies. ""The African Union Development Agency (AUDA-NEPAD) remains committed to partnering with other institutions in providing the requisite support to AU member states in reviewing and updating their NDCs,"" said Estherine Fotabong, Director of Programmes at AUDA-NEPAD. Barbara Creecy, South Africa's Environment Minister and current chair of the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment, said the Africa Day event should come up with new ideas to enhance the implementation of NDCs in Africa. Africa is already responding positively to the challenge of climate change, said Anthony Nyong, Director for Climate Change and Green Growth at the African Development Bank, citing huge investment interest in renewables at the Bank's Africa Investment Forum in Johannesburg. ""Clearly, we are a continent that has what it takes to create the Africa that we want to see happen. I believe what has been the missing link is the ability to brand right and to act on the market signals,"" Nyong said. ""We continue to present Africa as a vulnerable case and not as a business case with opportunities. In fact, where we have attempted the latter, the results have been spot-on."" Chief Fortune Charumbira, Vice President of the Pan-African Parliament, said robust climate legislation was key. ""The world's response to the challenge has shown that legislation is imperative to cement efforts employed by various stakeholders; from the Paris Agreement to Nationally Determined Contributions,"" he said. Amb. Josefa Sacko, Commissioner for Rural Economy and Agriculture at the African Union Commission, said climate change affected sectors key to Africa's socio-economic development, such as agriculture, livestock and fisheries, energy, biodiversity and tourism. She called on African countries to take stock of the Paris Agreement, and its implementation around finance capacity building and technology.

Speaking to a group of youth delegates at the ongoing climate conference in Madrid, Spain, Profesor Oladipo said that it was good that the developing world now recognises the urgency of climate action. He added that there was the need for youths to understand what is expected of them. He said: 'Addressing Climate Change is costly. It will cost us lots of money, so the conversation should not just be on how to get the money but mobilise other resources too. Youths must see this as the beginning of a long struggle. The climate with continue to change, this means we have a challenge that no one knows when it will end. 'Youths need to be strategic, climate action is beyond carrying placards and shouting, you need to add more to your knowledge and research so that you can have science evidence-based materials to negotiate.' Stressing the need for research, Prof Oladipo said that 'A major challenge we face in many of the developing countries is that while the developed countries will come with models built from results of analyses that proofs their position, we mostly end up using conjured presentations that may not be scientific.' \"
"COP25","Nigeria","COP25_Nigeria7","COP25: The Long, Winding Journey To Spain","November 5, 2019 Tuesday","Nigerian Tribune","The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) is an international environmental treaty adopted on May 9, 1992. It entered into force on March 21, 1994 after a sufficient number of countries had ratified the convention. These countries, 197 of them, are called 'parties' to the Convention. Each year, UNFCCC organises what it calls conference of parties (COP). The 2019 conference tagged COP25 has witnessed a winding journey occasioned by political and economic conditions in the countries that were built to host it. According to the UNFCCC, 'hosting a climate COP is a significant political, financial and logistical commitment.' Serving as a host rotates every year among the five regional groups, and in 2019 it was the turn of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean Countries (GRULAC) to host the conference. The UNFCCC secretariat had received a letter from GRULAC presenting the offer of Brazil to host COP25 However, in November 2018, Brazil announced that it was withdrawing this offer. Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro decided to withdraw from hosting COP25 due to economic reasons. The next step was for the GRULAC members to discuss among themselves whether another country in the region will offer to host COP25 . Chile, a country in the region, stepped up to the plate. All roads were leading to a city called Santiago, in Chile, where COP25 was to hold from 2 to 13 December this year. This was until, Wednesday last week, Wednesday, October 30. In the wake of weeks of civil unrest in which millions have taken to the street in protest over economic inequality, embattled Chilean president, Sebasti\'e1n Pi\'f1era made the announcement that it was withdrawing from hosting COP25 , along with the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit which it was also meant to host. In her reaction, UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa, said, 'Earlier today, I was informed of the decision by the Government of Chile not to host COP25 in view of the difficult situation that the country is undergoing. We are currently exploring alternative hosting options.' Thankfully, a bailout came from Europe in 24 hours when Spain offered to be the latest COP25 host. The government of Chile informed that they received an offer of support from the government of Spain to host COP25 in Madrid on the same dates as originally planned. With this development, Espinosa said, 'It is encouraging to see countries working together in the spirit of multilateralism to address climate change, the biggest challenge facing this and future generations.' COP25 will take place from 2-13 December in IFEMA - Feria de Madrid in Madrid, Spain.' Spain has its own problems stemming from the self-actualisation agitation from Catalonia, a region in northeastern Spain. It is, however, hoped that despite this, Spain will indeed be the last stop for COP25 which is now less than a month away. \"

With the youths involvement, it is expected that they will play central roles such that Nigeria will have increased outcomes from the negotiations. Samira Ibrahim, Adenike Oladosu, Farid Labaran, Glory Ogbuegbo and Seyifunmi Adebote are some of the Nigerian youths selected to be part of Nigeria's official delegation at the ongoing COP25 . 'This is the first time that youths are included as part of the government delegates to play technical roles. Although the issues are too diverse, we are trying to map out issues of national priority in line with our respective strengths. We also understand the political will and international processes, so we are putting them in perspective in our engagements,' she said. In a discussion with the youth delegates, one of Nigeria's lead negotiators at COP25 , Professor Emmanuel Oladipo, provided guidance on how the youths can maximise the global engagements and make solid inputs as part of the global negotiations in Madrid. He said, 'Climate has been changing and it will continue to change. The role of the youths is to lay emphasis on previous commitment and make sure the people making decision begin to understand the need for all hands to be on the deck to urgently address this challenge.' COP25 has been designed to take crucial steps in the UN climate change process and is equally building on the implementation guidelines of the Paris Agreement agreed to at COP 24 in Poland. COP25 is furthermore meant to build ambition ahead of 2020, the year in which countries have committed to submit new and updated national climate action plans. \"

The Bank has doubled its total climate change commitment to $25 billion between 2020 and 2025.

He cited the devastating impact of Cyclones Idai and Kenneth in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Tanzania and the Comoros earlier this year. ""However, Africa also offers climate smart investment opportunities \- from country-led innovation centers, to transformative renewable energy initiatives. For example, this year, the Bank approved financing for the first on-grid solar power public-private partnership in Chad, under the Desert to Power initiative,"" Shonibare said. Projects like Desert to Power will be highlighted at COP 25 , which will from 2 to 13 December bring together leaders and institutions from 196 nations plus the European Union, who have signed up to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. At the heart of the matter are the Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs, which form part of the landmark Paris Agreement, signed in 2015 during COP21 in the French capital. The NDCs are specific climate change targets that each country must set. The Paris Agreement has been ratified by 51 out of 54 African countries. It binds countries to cutting carbon emissions to ensure that global temperatures do not rise by more than 2\'b0C by the end of this century, while attempting to contain it within 1.5\'b0C. Climate finance is another issue that will top the agenda at COP25 in Madrid. ""2020 is a critical year in securing adequate resources for African countries to meet their Paris Agreement commitments, clarity and transparency on global climate finance access is essential to deliver climate action faster and at scale,"" said Anthony Nyong, Director Climate Change and Green Growth Department at the African Development Bank. The African Development Bank is joining the other Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) in a pavilion to showcase the joint commitment to combatting climate change. The Bank will participate in several panel discussions at COP25 , and will support the advocacy efforts of its regional member countries. The Bank is playing a leading role in guiding progress on climate change on the continent. Some of its achievements are: 85% of investments are screened for climate risk and for greenhouse gas emissions. The Bank's ambition is to screen all projects by 2020. By next year, 40% of the Bank's own investments will be dedicated to climate finance. The Bank has doubled its total climate change commitment to $25 billion between 2020 and 2025, with more than half of it going to adaptation.

"COP25","Nigeria","COP25_Nigeria10","COP25: African Delegates Criticised For Being Passive","December 17, 2019 Tuesday","Nigerian Tribune","The refusal of the United States and rich countries of the global north to advance negotiations on loss and damage and their insistence on pushing ahead with carbon markets are clear indications that they are not set to address the climate crisis, civil society from Africa have alleged. In a statement, the Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF) and the Environmental Rights Action said COP25 has been no different from previous COPs and went further to add that the promoters of fossil fuels ensured that voices of the oppressed people represented by civil society were thrown out of the venue on Wednesday, December 11. Executive Director of HOMEF, Nnimmo Bassey said: 'It is very disheartening that all through the negotiations climate politicians from the global North were churning out new seductive words to obscure intentions and focused their energies on avoiding actions and responsibility while the Africa delegates were acting confused' 'With the acceptance of carbon offsetting and similar notions promoted by the US and the rich nations, the burden of climate action is being forced on the victims without any regard for historical responsibilities, without regard for justice. This posture rides on the same track as slavery, colonialism, neocolonialism and their cousin, neo-liberalism.' Head, Media and Campaigns of ERA, Philip said: 'All through the negotiations, we saw the footprints of Big Polluters. From their sponsorships to their back to back meetings to promote markets. Unfortunately, delegates from Africa who constituted the largest delegations were busy in their confusion and doing nothing to advance real solutions demanded by their people. 'As gloomy as the situation is, we will continue raising our voices until they wake up from their slumber, hear us and take action.' Both organisations say the real solution to the climate crisis are in the non-market mechanisms embedded in Article 6. 8 of the Paris Agreement which includes adaptation, mitigation, finance and technology transfer. In a similar vein, Friends of the Earth International said that COP25 should also have delivered urgent support, including finance, for Southern countries already suffering loss and damage from climate breakdown - due to floods, forest fires, droughts, rising seas. Instead, the response of Northern countries and elites everywhere is to sacrifice the global majority: the lives and livelihoods of the many to pay for the lifestyles of the few. FoEI Chair, Karin Nansen from Uruguay, commented: 'The £mbition' claimed by developed country governments is a false ambition. They are serving the interests of the corporations aiming to make profits out of the crisis and secure capital accumulation. But peoples - from Madrid to Santiago and around the world - are rising up and will continue to fight for environmental, social, gender and economic justice and system change. We will continue to demand that governments be accountable to their people and not to corporate polluters.' Sara Shaw, FOEI Climate Justice and Energy Programme Coordinator said: 'Just as we thought the slow pace and weak ambition shown at the climate talks couldn't get worse, along comes COP25 . Here, we have witnessed the gutting of the already weak Paris The agreement, with the advance of dodgy carbon trading that will only exacerbate the climate crisis and harm Southern communities. We have seen a refusal by developed countries to pay up for the loss and damage finance, while they try to block any language that would make them liable for the impacts their emissions have caused. We are furious that while so many are already suffering the impacts of climate change, corporations and rich country governments are working to destroy any hope of keeping global temperature rise below 1.5 degrees. And when we stood up in peaceful protest at COP25 , we were aggressively suppressed.' Sriram Madhusoodanan, climate campaign director of Corporate Accountability said: 'The US is lighting the house on fire on its way out of the door and global North countries in the EU, Canada and Australia are backing it every step of the way. It is not too late for these countries to countries to stop backing the US. Developing nations must unite as a bloc to reject a bad deal on Article 6 and pave the way for real solutions' The groups insisted that big polluters who are really set to gain from market mechanisms, like Shell, Chevron and BP, have been out in force at COP25 . Carbon markets will allow big polluters to wash themselves green while continuing business as usual for decades to come, sacrificing vulnerable communities on the way. \"

After the two extra days, exhausted delegates finally agreed a deal that will see new, improved carbon cutting plans on the table by the time of the climate conference in Glasgow, next year.

The groups include Friends of the Earth International, Corporate Accountability, and the Environmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria (ERA/FoEN), representing a broad spectrum of grassroots and climate justice movements. In previous negotiations, countries of the global north led by the United States ensured that no meaningful advancements towards the real solutions were reached. They ensured that policy recommendations to insulate the negotiations from Big Polluters' interference were shut down while discussions to place carbon markets at the center of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement threatened to derail real solutions including non market mechanisms. Last month, the U.S. government began the process of withdrawing from the Paris Agreement after President Donald Trump said the agreement imposed unfair economic burdens on American workers, businesses, and taxpayers. COP25 ""Big polluters must be rubbing their hands in glee that carbon market mechanisms, which further dilute the already weak and inadequate Paris emissions targets, are back on the agenda,"" said Dipti Bhatnagar, Climate Justice and Energy Programme Coordinator for Friends of the Earth International. ""We will fight them tooth and nail. The climate crisis is already devastating lives. Emissions are still rising. Now is not the time to offer an escape route to polluting Northern country governments and big oil."" COP25 must decide if the global response to the climate crisis centres real solutions or prioritizes more giveaways to the fossil fuel industry and other Big Polluters - especially those who have knowingly fueled this crisis for decades. READ ALSO: Nigerian Red Cross demands creation of Ministry of Reconciliation ""Instead of green-lighting the fossil fuel industry's wish-list, governments must heed peoples' movements around the world and advance real solutions, including opportunity to lay the groundwork for real, transformative pathways to 1.5 within Article 6.8. Pathways to real change that are made clear in the Peoples Demands - a set of demands issued to governments by hundreds of thousands of people, organizations, and peoples' movements around the world."" Philip Jakpor of the ERA/FoEN said the promotion of carbon markets within the climate space poses the singular most dangerous distraction that has allowed Big Polluters and their allies to infiltrate the negotiation and steer delegates away from solutions. "" COP25 The groups believe that if there is no progress in the talks, the status quo would lock the world into decades more of soaring emissions, and frontline communities into further loss of life and livelihood. They insist that at COP25 , governments must clear a way forward for real solutions which will deliver real action, equity and ambition. ""Real solutions to the climate crisis and moving the negotiations forward lies in the people's demands which outlines real climate solutions like an equitable managed decline of fossil fuels production, a just and equitable transition, real climate finance, and securing land and tenure rights for indigenous peoples and local communities"", the groups insist.

Addressing high-level members of the UN with hundreds of youth leaders and climate change activists present, Adebote said, 'I understand that the future of over 225 million youths across the African continent stands at great risk, so I speak with a huge sense of responsibility and urgency. We have not come here to point fingers and accuse our leaders. We are here to bring solutions to the table. 'In Nigeria, we recently harvested over 1000 youth-led, climate-focused creative ideas, some of which are now being groomed into profitable businesses. What matters now is that we must hold leaders to account for promises made and agreements signed.' Adebote spoke alongside other youth delegates representing other regions of the world including Zuzanna Borowska from Poland, Kisha Erah Mua\'f1a from the Philippines, Irfan Ullah from Pakistan, Komal Kumar from Fiji and Juan Jose Martin from Chile. UNFCCC's Executive Secretary, Patricia Espinosa had earlier called on the youth to help in educating people around the world. 'For every decision, we make in our life, we need to think about the consequences of that decision,' she said. Africa has had its share of the climate crisis. In 2000, flood in Mozambique was responsible for 800 deaths, 329,000 displaced people and almost 2 million were people affected in all. Between July 2011 and 2012, the entire East Africa region suffered a severe drought, said to be 'the worst drought in 60 years.' Across the Lake Chad region, the drying up of the water bodies has badly affected over 17 million people in North-Eastern Nigeria, Cameroon's Far North, Western Chad and South-East Niger. By 2050, between 350 million and 601 million people are projected to experience increased water stress due to climate change across Africa with women, children and the elderly more vulnerable. Driven by this, young people across the African continent are putting their feet on the ground and striving to change this narrative. \"
"COP25","Nigeria","COP25_Nigeria14","Africa may leave COP25 climate change conference with a 'No deal'","December 13, 2019 Friday","Business Day","As final negotiations among parties takes place today the closing day of the Madrid climate change conference, Africa may leave the 25th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP25 ) with a no deal. Issues such as adaptation, loss and damage and Article 6 are the contentious issues Africa negotiators have locked horns over with other parties from developed countries. ""No deal is better than a bad deal for our people,"" said Ambassador Mohammed Nasr, chair of African Group of Negotiators (AGN) at a press briefing today which is the last day of the conference. ""Several items for developing countries did not see any conclusion as we speak"" Nasr said. Also speaking during the briefing Tongie Gahoma, incoming chair of the AGN said that Africa is ready to continue the negotiations at the 2020 COP taking place in Glasgow, Scotland. ""We are ready to continue these discussions next year. We want to avoid the Kyoto disease,"" he said. ""For us it is important that the work here is for Africa by Africa and our concern is mainly adaptation,"" he further said. Africa accounts for less than 4percent of global carbon emissions and the continent is the most vulnerable in terms of the impact of climate change, the United Nations says. To adapt to these climate change shocks, African negotiators at COP25 have been pressing for funds to adapt to the impact of climate change. ""Africa is highly impacted by climate change adversity all across and the cost are very high for the governments that are already putting between 2-9 percent of their GDP for adaptation,"" Nasr who is also an ambassador in Egypt said. A UN study says Sub-Saharan Africa would need an estimated climate adaptation finance of around $50bn (Pound 37bn) annually by 2050. ""The overall assessment is not a good situation. There is still no clarity on the number of issues that are dear to Africa,"" said Seynu Nafo, former chair of the AGN. At a high ambition and coalition meeting today also, Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Minister of Environment, Costa Rica have accused Brazil, Australia and the United State of stalling negotiations. \"
"COP25","Nigeria","COP25_Nigeria15","COP 25: As Nations negotiate plans to limit global warming to 1.5C","December 14, 2019 Saturday","Weekly Trust","A new United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) report has warned that unless global greenhouse gas emissions fall by 7.6 per cent each year between 2020 and 2030, the world will miss the opportunity to get on track towards the 1.5\'b0C temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. It called for collective ambition to attain increase of more than fivefold over current levels to deliver the cuts needed over the next decade for the 1.5\'b0C goal. ADVERTISEMENT Presently, 197 countries that are party to the Paris Agreement and various other groups are engaged in continued negotiation for more ambitious plans to limit global warming to 1.5\'b0C, in line with the agreement at the ongoing UN Climate Change Conference - COP 25 (short for Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)) with the 'Time for Action', taking place in Madrid, Spain. ADVERTISEMENT HOW OVER 5000 NIGERIA MEN HAVE PERMANENTLY OVERCOME TERRIBLE BEDROOM PERFORMANCE DUE TO THIS RECENT BRILLIANT DISCOVERY BY MEDICAL CONSULTANTS Hopes are high that nations will rise to act and increase their climate commitments to their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The NDCs are efforts by each country to reduce national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. Speaking at the opening of the conference, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said it must convey a firm determination to change course, demonstrate that the world is seriously committed to stopping the 'war against nature', and has the political will to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. He said COP25 That, to him is a path where more fossil fuels remained where they should be- in the ground - and where 'we are on the way to carbon neutrality by 2050. That is the only way to limit global temperature rise to the necessary 1.5 degrees by the end of this century.' 'Millions throughout the world - especially young people - are calling on leaders from all sectors to do more, much more, to address the climate emergency we face. 'They know we need to get on the right path today, not tomorrow. That means important decisions must be made now,' he said. While noting that the last five years have been the hottest ever recorded, he said the consequences are already being felt in the form of more extreme weather events and associated disasters, from hurricanes to drought to floods to wildfires. 'Three major reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - on land, on the oceans and cryosphere, and on the 1.5 degree Celsius climate goal - each confirm that we are knowingly destroying the very support systems keeping us alive,' he said. 'Either we stop this addiction to coal or all our efforts to tackle climate change will be doomed,' he said. On his part, the minister of Environment Dr. Mohammad Mahmood Abubakar urged Nigeria's delegates to the convention to actively engage in International Climate Policy Negotiations that would facilitate the realisation of Nigeria's NDC. Dr Abubakar said: 'Nigeria sees climate change as an opportunity, thus approaching it to help diversify its economy and build resilience towards achieving sustainable development, lifting its people out of poverty and providing greater physical and economic security.' Nigeria's participation at this year's convention, according to the minister in a statement signed by the Director Press, Saghir el Mohammed, would be characterised by its commitment to implementing an all-inclusive natural response to climate change through emission reduction and optimal solution to climate change response. He said towards realising the objectives of the Paris Agreement, Nigeria issued a Sovereign Green Bond, making it the first African country and fourth globally to achieve this milestone towards financing green projects. He said faced with the challenges of increased vulnerability to extreme weather events, Nigeria expects to see to the conclusion of the review of the Warsaw International Mechanism ahead of the updating of its NDC to include additional sectors (water and waste management) \"
"COP25","Nigeria","COP25_Nigeria16","COP 25: 'Africa's future depends on solidarity' Leaders and development partners rally around climate change goals","December 13, 2019 Friday","News Chronicle (Nigeria)","There was standing room only as ministers, diplomats, activists and journalists gathered at the IFEMA conference center in Madrid to mark Africa Day at the COP 25 climate meeting. Speakers called for a united front to tackle the challenges of climate change in Africa. In the opening statement for Africa Day on Tuesday, Yasmin Fouad, Egypt's Minister of Environmental Affairs, on behalf of the African Union, said: ""We have, and will continue to engage and to seek landing grounds on the outstanding issues. But we must flag our concern at the apparent reluctance by our interlocutors to engage on issues of priority to developing countries, as evidenced by a large number of such issues which have simply been pushed from session to session without any progress."" Africa contributes the least to global warming emissions yet is the continent most vulnerable to climate change, as witnessed by devastating natural disasters recently. Africa Day has been held at the conference every year since COP 17 in 2011 to rally support for the continent's cause. ""The climate disaster issues confronting the continent demand a predictable and unified response,"" said UN ASG Mohamed Beavogui, Director General of African Risk Capacity, an agency of the African Union that helps governments respond to natural disasters. ""Africa needs to move towards market-based innovative financing models to achieve a strong, united, resilient and globally influential continent. The future of Africa depends on solidarity."" Vera Songwe, Executive Secretary of the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), said the ECA would support African countries to revise their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to attract private sector investments in clean energy. ""The lack of concerted and meaningful global ambition and action to tackle climate change poses an existential threat to African populations,"" Songwe said. The Paris Agreement is the guiding force of current climate negotiations. It calls on nations to curb temperature increases at 2\'b0C by the end of this century while attempting to contain rises within 1.5\'b0C. The next step is to implement NDCs, which set out national targets under the Paris Agreement. While African countries outlined bold aspirations to build climate-resilient and low-carbon economies in their NDCs, the continent's position is that it should not be treated the same as developed nations as its carbon emissions constitute a fraction of the world's big economies. ""The African Union Development Agency (AUDA-NEPAD) remains committed to partnering with other institutions in providing the requisite support to AU member states in reviewing and updating their NDCs,"" said Estherine Fotabong, Director of Programmes at AUDA-NEPAD. Barbara Creecy, South Africa's Environment Minister and current chair of the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment, said the Africa Day event should come up with new ideas to enhance the implementation of NDCs in Africa. Africa is already responding positively to the challenge of climate change, said Anthony Nyong, Director for Climate Change and Green Growth at the African Development Bank, citing huge investment interest in renewables at the Bank's Africa Investment Forum in Johannesburg. ""Clearly, we are a continent that has what it takes to create the Africa that we want to see happen. I believe what has been the missing link is the ability to brand right and to act on the market signals,"" Nyong said. ""We continue to present Africa as a vulnerable case and not as a business case with opportunities. In fact, where we have attempted the latter, the results have been spot-on."" Chief Fortune Charumbira, Vice President of the Pan-African Parliament, said robust climate legislation was key. ""The world's response to the challenge has shown that legislation is imperative to cement efforts employed by various stakeholders; from the Paris Agreement to Nationally Determined Contributions,"" he said. Amb. Josefa Sacko, Commissioner for Rural Economy and Agriculture at the African Union Commission, said climate change affected sectors key to Africa's socio-economic development, such as agriculture, livestock, and fisheries, energy, biodiversity, and tourism. She called on African countries to take stock of the Paris Agreement, and its implementation around finance capacity building and technology.

"COP25","Nigeria","COP25_Nigeria17","Climate Change Accounting: The Failure of COP25","December 16, 2019 Monday","News Chronicle (Nigeria)","Prior to the UN Convention on Climate Change talks held in Madrid, the sense that tradition would assert itself was hard to buck. Weariness and frustration came in the wake of initial high minded optimism. Delegates spent an extra two days and nights attempting to reach a deal covering carbon reduction measures before the Glasgow conference in 2020. The gathering became the longest set of climate talks in history, exceeding the time spent at the 2011 Durban meeting by 44 hours. As Climate Home News noted, Durban still stood out as being worthier for having ""produced a deal between countries that laid the foundations for the Paris Agreement."" In stark contrast, ""Madrid produced a weak gesture toward raising climate targets and failed to agree for the second year in a row on rules to govern carbon markets."" The UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres was all lament. ""The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaption, and finance to tackle the climate crisis."" He hoped that the next year would see ""all countries commit to do what science tells us is necessary to reach carbon neutrality in 2050 and no more than 1.5-degree temperature rise."" The wisdom of COP25 remains similar to that of previous gatherings on climate: politics and environment do not mix well. Big powers and heavy polluters stuck to their stubborn positions, stressing the merits of loose, open markets to solve the problem, notably in terms of reducing carbon emissions; smaller states more concerned by their actual disappearance lobbied European, Latin American and African allies for firmer commitments and pledges. Australia was also confirmed as one of the chief spoilers, if not outright saboteurs, at the show, noted for its insistence that it be allowed to claim a reduction of its abatement for the 2021-30 Paris Accord. This, went the argument, was due to its own excelling in meeting the 2012-20 Kyoto Protocol period. Previous good conduct could justify current bad and future behaviour. What Canberra offered the globe was an accounting model of deception, exploiting a regulatory loophole in place of lowering emissions. It lacked legal plausibility, given that both Kyoto and Paris are separate treaties. Former French environment minister Luciana Tubiana was clear about the implications of this idea. ""If you want this carryover,"" she told the Financial Times, ""it is just cheating. Australia was willing in a way to destroy the whole system because that is the way to destroy the whole Paris agreement."" Other states were also noted in performing roles of obstruction, including Saudi Arabia, Brazil, and the United States. These parties were particularly keen to push their differences with other states over Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, a provision dealing with mechanisms and models of trading in emission reductions. Such trade can have a habit of losing validity when putting into practice; the issue of transparency remains a considerable problem in such markets. The US statement at the conference emphasized realism and pragmatism ""backed by a record of real-world results."" (Real-world results tend to exclude environmental ruination for unrepentant polluters.) Market results were primary; environmental matters were subordinate to such dictates. Usual mantras were proffered: innovation and open markets produced wealth, but also ""fewer emissions, and more secure sources of energy."" Despite leaving as a party to the Paris Agreement, ""We remain fully committed to working with you, our global partners, to enhance resilience, mitigate the impacts of climate change, and prepare for and respond to natural disasters."" Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro reconfirmed his climate change skepticism, claiming that the entire issue of COP25 could be put down to commerce. ""I don't know why people don't understand that it's just a commercial game."" The Europeans, he suggested, were merely being irksome about cash and meddling. ""I'd like to know,"" he posed rhetorically to journalists, ""has there been a resolution for Europe to be reforested, or are they just going to keep bothering Brazil?"" Brazil's environment minister Ricardo Salles, known to some as Minister for Deforestation, was similarly keen to place the blame elsewhere. He had demanded, bowl in hand, some $10 billion under the Paris Climate deal to combat deforestation in 2020. All in all, he was not optimistic. ""Rich countries did not want to pay up."" Like Australia, Brazil's environmental ploy is driven by creative accounting, an attempt to leverage previous supposed good conduct in the climate change stakes, playing accumulated carbon credits from Kyoto to meet those under the Paris arrangements. Using open market rationales, Salles condemned the ""protectionist vision"" that had taken hold: ""Brazil and other countries that could provide carbon credits because of their forests and good environmental practices came out losers."" In an act of some spite, the minister would subsequently post a tweet featuring a photo of a platter heavy with meats. ""To compensate for our emissions at COP, a vegetarian lunch!"" Madrid will be remembered for its stalemate on carbon credits and the botched rule book on carbon trading. An effort spearheaded by Costa Rica, including Germany, Britain and New Zealand, to convince states to adopt the San Jose principles, with a prohibition on the use of carbon credit carryover along with other Kyoto gains, was rejected. COP25 again exposed that degree of prevalent anarchy, if not gangsterism, in global climate change policy. The emphasis, then, is on attempts and arrangements made within regional areas: EU policy on de-carbonized economies (albeit resisted within by such states as Poland), and bilateral arrangements (the EU and China). As these take place, the apocalyptic message led by activists such as Greta Thunberg will become more desperate. Dr. Binoy Kampmark was a Commonwealth Scholar at Selwyn College, Cambridge.

"COP25","Nigeria","COP25_Nigeria18","2019 UN climate change conference (COP25): African Development Bank urges African nations to persist with climate change ambitions as marathon talks end in Madr....","December 16, 2019 Monday","Ventures Africa","The African Development Bank ( HYPERLINK http://www.AfDB.org www.AfDB.org ) has urged the continent's nations to stay the course on climate action, after a marathon session of talks at the twenty-fifth Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP 25 ) in Madrid. The conference was scheduled to run from 2 to 13 December, but only concluded business on Sunday, two days after the official programme ended. Meanwhile, back home, Africans were reminded of the all-too-real consequences if these talks fail to deliver results. Thousands of East Africans have been displaced in the wake of heavy rains that have battered the region since October, and more wet weather is expected due to an Indian Ocean Dipole attributed to the warming of the ocean. Such extreme weather events should galvanise Africans; their governments are spending 2% of GDP on climate related disasters, said Anthony Nyong, Director for Climate Change and Green Growth at the African Development Bank. He encouraged the global community to remain steadfast in finding effective solutions to climate change. The annual negotiations are now in their 25th year. ""The global community, and in particular Africa has a lot to offer in terms of solutions; what is evidently lacking is the global political will to turn potential into wealth to serve humanity and the planet,"" said Nyong, who led the Bank's delegation to the UN conference. At the conference, African delegates pushed for support for climate finance to build resilience against the impact of climate change and for special consideration for Africa around targets contained in the treaties under discussion. The discussions at COP 25 centred around the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement, which calls on countries to cut carbon emissions to ensure that global temperatures do not rise by more than 2\'b0C by the end of this century, while attempting to contain it within 1.5\'b0C. The conference ended with a declaration on the ""urgent need"" to close the gap between existing emissions pledges and the temperature goals of the Paris agreement. The African Development Bank attended the conference to lend strategic support to its regional member countries in the negotiations. Nyong pointed out that Africa is committed; 51 of the 54 African countries have already ratified their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement signed at the landmark COP21 in Paris. The NDCs are specific climate change targets that each country must set. Support for the Bank-funded Desert to Power project highlighted Africa's determination to strive for a climate-friendly world, especially for its local populations, said Nyong. Desert to Power is a $20 billion initiative to deploy solar energy solutions across the entire Sahel region, generating 10,000 MW to provide 250 million people with clean electricity. ""The African Development Bank stands ready as ever to assist its regional member countries to build resilience against climate change, as indicated by the Bank's decision to join the Alliance for Hydromet Development, announced at COP 25 ( HYPERLINK http://bit.ly/35sye5S http://bit.ly/35sye5S The Bank will also continue to drive initiatives to strengthen the ability of regional member countries to advocate robustly at global forums such as COP 25 , Nyong added. One example was the Bank's participation at the annual African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN) and support for the Africa Group of Negotiations (AGN). ""We look forward to engaging further with regional member countries and other parties to ensure that the continent's development agenda remains on track,"" Nyong added. Leaders and institutions from 196 nations plus the European Union, who have signed up to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, attended the conference in Madrid.

"COP25","Nigeria","COP25_Nigeria19","'PreCOP25 In Costa Rica Serves As Springboard For Climate Ambition At COP25'","October 15, 2019 Tuesday","Nigerian Tribune","After three days of panels, high-level discussions and exchanging best practices for climate action, PreCOP25 in San Jos\'e9 concluded with calls for more climate ambition. The gathering, from 8 to 10 October, saw more than 1,500 attendees, with delegates representing more than 90 countries and more than 60 parallel events with 264 panelists on topics ranging from blue carbon to electric mobility. The event put an additional emphasis on climate finance and the gender agenda as transformational focus areas of climate solutions. 'We are honoured to be part of this effort. Climate action is the most important cause of our generation and is therefore worth it. If there is a time to be useful for others, it is now,' said the president of Costa Rica, Carlos Alvarado Quesada, whose country promised to make an unconventional PreCOP. The gathering provided fresh impetus on the road towards the 25th Conference of the Parties ( COP25 ) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to be held in Santiago, Chile, this December. There, more countries, cities, companies and local governments are expected to increase ambition and present new goals. Current national climate action plans under the Paris Agreement put the world on a path towards global warming of 3\'b0 Celsius, so ambition needs to be urgently raised. Ovais Sarmad, deputy executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, said: 'It has been hugely encouraging to hear everyone at PreCOP25 talking about the need to raise ambition on climate action. 'Governments and all stakeholders have heard the message of young people to protect their future loud and clear, along with the message of science which states that time is running out and we have only a very narrow window of opportunity to act. 'At COP25 Ovais Sarmad commended the progress made to lift ambition, build a bridge from the September UN Climate Summit in New York to COP25 in Chile and then on to COP26 in the UK. He thanked the President of Costa Rica for hosting the meeting and generating positive momentum. Participants of the PreCOP emphasized the importance of increasing ambition of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) in each country. For that, the three focus areas of the conference are key: nature-based solutions, sustainable cities and the blue economy. 'This PreCOP25 demonstrated that there are ambitious solutions and successful experiences that can guide us towards the 1.5 C goal. We have achieved technical strength and political depth. Nature-based solutions are 30 per cent of the climate solution and Costa Rica has demonstrated in the last three decades that it is possible to grow economically and conserve nature at the same time,' said Costa Rican Minister of Environment and Energy, Carlos Manuel Rodr\'edguez. Minister Rodr\'edguez stressed that the meeting emphasized the link between the climate change process and the biodiversity process within the United Nations. Alicia B\'e1rcena, Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) added: 'Costa Rica demonstrates that it is possible to put the economy at the service of environmental protection in a region like ours that has depended on hydrocarbons in the past.' The meeting allowed the discussion of issues unresolved by the Katowice climate summit regarding the operating guidelines of the Paris Agreement in 2018. Four thematic areas chosen by Costa Rica and of interest for Latin America were discussed: the acceleration of climate action, Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, the mechanism of loss and damage and linkages between gender and effective climate action. \"

It made history as the longest UN climate conference, dragging on for two more days, yet it failed to achieve the outcome its organisers desired. The UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres had said he 'was disappointed' as the conference finally ended on December 15, instead of the 13th as scheduled. Now, the Executive Secretary of UN Climate Change, Patricia Espinosa, has issued an official statement on the outcome of COP25 . She said, 'Several days have passed since the closing of the UN Climate Change Conference COP25 in Madrid, and it is important to conduct an honest and realistic assessment of what happened so that appropriate measures can be taken by the international community in guiding the next crucial steps in the multilateral climate process next year. 'We need to be clear that the conference did not result in agreement on the guidelines for a much-needed carbon market - an essential part of the toolkit to raise ambition that can harness the potential of the private sector and generate finance for adaptation. 'Developed countries have yet to fully address the calls from developing countries for enhanced support in finance, technology and capacity building, without which they cannot green their economies and build adequate resilience to climate change. High-emitting countries did not send a clear enough signal that they are ready to improve their climate strategies and ramp up ambition through the Nationally Determined Contributions they will submit next year. 'At the same time, in the final decision texts, governments did express the need for more ambition by parties and non-state actors alike, and they agreed to improve the ability of the most vulnerable to adapt to climate change. 'Many decisions that emerged from the conference in Madrid at least acknowledge the role of climate finance, essential for concrete action. And decisions were taken in areas including technology, oceans and agriculture, gender and capacity building. 'A large group of countries, regions, cities, businesses and investors signaled their intention to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050, as part of the Climate Ambition Alliance led by Chile. Also rallying under the Climate Ambition Alliance, 114 nations have meanwhile signaled their intention to submit an enhanced climate action plan next year. The caveat here is that not enough major economies have signaled that they are ready to shift the needle on climate ambition through improved plans. 'Commitments from many sectors of society showed an overwhelming agreement on the only way forward: that we need to follow what science is telling us, with the sense of urgency and seriousness that this requires. What we need now is to focus our undivided attention on the next steps to further strengthen the trust in the multilateral process.' Espinosa added that 'As we head towards the UN Climate Change Conference COP26 in Glasgow, we must be united and work in a true spirit of inclusive multilateralism in order to realise the promises of the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.' \"

According to a statement from the Federal Ministry of Environment, Nigeria recognises its need for a national carbon registry and will enter final discussions to use GEM's technology to deliver the ITMO registry for registering and issuing International Transfer Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) projects. With the environment minister, working with the director, Climate Change Department of Nigeria, Dr Peter Tarfa, this technology is expected to enable Nigeria to launch its own ITMO registry and become one of the first countries in the world to be ready to sell ITMOs internationally. 'It is noteworthy to say GEM's ITMO registry has the capacity to register projects, originate and house carbon credit projects and carbon credits originated in the country, and as well transfer them electronically to buyers globally who have accounts in the registry or a linked registry, and/or Over The Counter (OTC) or via Carbon Trade Exchange (CTX) globally.

The 197 Parties that make up the treaty \- 196 nations plus the European Union \- will seek to move towards the implementation of the agreements that have been reached under the Convention that lays down specific obligations for all Parties to fight climate change. Having signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, nearly all African countries have committed to enhanced climate action through reducing their greenhouse gas emissions and building resilience. For the continent, adaptation to the adverse impact of climate change is urgent. Now is the time to translate the commitments made by African countries under the Paris Agreement into action, by safeguarding development gains and building resilience against extreme weather events that are increasing in frequency and intensity. This annual conference is the single global platform for all nations to negotiate an internationally agreed way forward to combat climate change. It also represents a key event that brings together all the major stakeholders engaged on climate change issues from across governments, private sector and civil society, including the African Development Bank's main partners in the climate change domain. Highly represented in previous COP summits, the African Development Bank, the continent's premier development finance institution, will be present in Madrid to support regional member countries to engage in an informed and effective manner in the negotiations through support to the African group of negotiators and through advocacy to make Africa's voice heard in the international arena. The Bank has, through its climate change action plan, made important commitments to integrate climate considerations across its operations and to scale up its climate investments in African countries. Last September, the Multilateral Development Banks announced their plan to increase the global climate action investments each year to $175 billion by 2025. In Madrid, the African Development Bank will join the other MDBs to showcase our joint commitment to combatting climate change. A delegation of experts from the African Development Bank, led by Anthony Nyong, Director of Climate Change and Green Growth, will engage with public and private actors to build and strengthen partnerships to promote climate-resilient and low-carbon development in Africa.

"COP25","Nigeria","COP25_Nigeria23","COP25: Renewable energy ambition in NDCs must double by 2030","December 6, 2019 Friday","SweetCrude Reports","New IRENA report calls on policy makers to enhance NDCs through renewables and turn the tide against global warming Madrid, Spain -\- Countries are being urged to significantly raise renewable energy ambition and adopt targets to transform the global energy system in the next round of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), according to a new report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) that will be released at the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) in Madrid. The report will show that renewable energy ambition within NDCs would have to more than double by 2030 to put the world in line with the Paris Agreement goals, cost-effectively reaching 7.7 terawatts (TW) of globally installed capacity by then. Today's renewable energy pledges under the NDCs are falling short of this, targeting only 3.2 TW. The report NDCs in 2020: Advancing Renewables in the Power Sector and Beyond will be released at IRENA's official side event on enhancing NDCs and raising ambition on 11 December 2019. It will state that with over 2.3 TW installed renewable capacity today, almost half of the additional renewable energy capacity foreseen by current NDCs has already been installed. The analysis will also highlight that delivering on increased renewable energy ambition can be achieved in a cost-effective way and with considerable socio-economic benefits across the world. ""Increasing renewable energy targets is absolutly necessary,"" said IRENA's Director-General Francesco La Camera. ""Much more is possible. There is a decisive opportunity for policy makers to step up climate action by raising ambition on renewables, which are the only immediate solution to meet rising energy demand whilst decarbonizing the economy and building resilience"". ""IRENA's analysis shows that a pathway to a decarbonised economy is technologically possible and socially and economically beneficial,"" continued Mr. La Camera. ""Renewables are good for growth, good for job creation and deliver significant welfare benefits. With renewables, we can also expand energy access and help eradicate energy poverty in line with the UN Sustainable Development Agenda 2030. IRENA will promote knowledge exchange, strengthen partnerships and work with all stakeholders to catalyse action on the ground. We are engaging with countries and regions worldwide to facilitate renewable energy projects and raise their ambitions"". NDCs must become a driving force for an accelerated global energy transformation. The current pledges reflect neither the past decade's rapid growth nor the ongoing market trends for renewables. Through a higher renewable energy ambition, NDCs could serve to advance multiple climate and development objectives. SweetCrude Reports 2019.

"COP25","Nigeria","COP25_Nigeria24","Cop25 - Cse Wants Humanity to Recognise Climate Change, Take Decisive Action","December 24, 2019","This Day (Lagos)","Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) has urged governments around the world not to just recognise the urgency of climate action, but also the fact that this action must be decisive. Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) is a public interest research and advocacy organisation based in New Delhi. CSE researches into, lobbies for and communicates the urgency of development that is both sustainable and equitable. CSE stated in a position paper at the just concluded climate conference, CoP25 that ""The imperative of transformation and the idea of net zero targets by 2050 should not mean that governments get the liberty to delay domestic action to mitigate emissions; or to design another cheap and convoluted market-based system so that rich countries can buy their way out of the climate crisis. ""The fact remains that climate impacts are affecting the poor today. As temperatures increase, they will hit us all - climate change is a great leveller. Without cooperation based on equity, climate change action will not be effective or ambitious. CSE would like to remind governments of the need for both ambition and equity in the negotiations. ""What is clear is that climate change is happening, and a climate emergency is upon us. The poor, particularly farmers in the countries of the South, who are not responsible for the stock of emissions in the atmosphere, are the worst hit. They are the victims of climate change. In India, official figures reveal that 2,405 people died due to extreme weather events in 2018-19. Dust storms in northern India linked to global weather patterns killed over 500 in 2018. Cloud-burst like events have increased in numbers and frequency, as have climate-change linked heat waves and forest fires. Variable and extreme rain is leading to increased flooding and water scarcity. Intense heat spikes in northern India have been making the ground dry, exacerbating a flood-drought cycle which is playing havoc with the livelihoods of subsistence farmers. The impact is also visible in Africa, where the predominantly rain-fed agriculture is very vulnerable to climate change. The entire continent is experiencing rising temperatures and reducing precipitation, which could make it more food-insecure. We also know that the impact of extreme weather events is not limited to a short period as they cripple lives, destroy livelihoods, and extinguish the development dividend. ""What we would like to state unambiguously is that the world is not on track to stay below 1.5\'b0C - seen as the guardrail, as temperature increase beyond this will spiral the world out of control. In fact, according to the UNEP's Emissions Gap Report, the current emission targets, called Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), are so unambitious that even if all countries adhered to what they had agreed to, the world would still be heading towards being 3.2\'b0C warmer by the end of the century. But that is not the bad news. The bad news is that countries are not even close to meeting the weak and unambitious NDCs that they have set for themselves. According to the same UNEP report, current emissions are way above this and many G20 countries are unlikely to meet the targets. Countries must raise their ambition and the NDC targets due next year must be set consistent with at least a 2\'b0C trajectory, if not a 1.5\'b0C trajectory -- but these targets must be based on equity and climate justice. Past consumption has been highly iniquitous with developed countries having consumed a disproportionate share of the carbon pie. CSE's analysis of the past and future carbon budgets finds that only China will increase its share of the carbon budget by 2030; there will be nothing left for the rest of the world - by 2030, at current rates of emissions, the carbon budget to keep the world below 1.5\'b0C will be exhausted. What then happens to the right to development of the rest of the countries of the South? CSE is also deeply concerned that the current discussions on net zero targets and its corresponding market mechanism could delay the much-needed domestic action and also lead the world to designing (once again) a convoluted market mechanism, which will look for cheap mitigation options in the developing world. This would be disastrous. The world has run out of time and space and needs transformative solutions. The market mechanism must be designed to promote high-cost and transformative actions and not lock the world into creative carbon fudging once again. The mistakes of the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which flooded the market with cheap carbon credits, must not be repeated. CSE is demanding that credits should only be created for expensive mitigation solutions, which cost more than a defined threshold -- say US $100-150 per tonne of CO2 abatement. This will ensure that only genuinely challenging projects which involve meaningful technology transfer to developing countries will take place. It will also mitigate the risk of developing countries selling off their cheaper mitigation options and then being left with only expensive options to meet their own targets. The net zero carbon emissions targets of countries - set to allow countries to emit and to take out of the atmosphere through forest sequestration and other technologies the excess of their domestic emissions - must not end up delaying domestic action; countries should not be led to believe that they can use technology to mop up the excess. This is just not acceptable. The net zero target must be designed to allow countries to undertake drastic action domestically to reduce emissions and then, if there is a gap, to buy high-cost transformative emission reduction from the developing world. CSE said, ""The bottom line is that the world is facing an existential threat. But it is also clear that without equity, ambition is not possible. The ongoing CoP25 must not duck this question any further. It must not end up with more convoluted and compromised rules for weak and inadequate global action. The time for procrastination has been over for many years now. It is time that we understood this and acted accordingly."" \"
"COP25","Nigeria","COP25_Nigeria25","Perspective on UN Climate Change conference and matters arising in 24 years","December 21, 2019 Saturday","Weekly Trust","The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is the highest decision body on matters related climate change faced by the Earth. The just concluded Conference of Parties (COP) COP 25 talks in Madrid, Spain on climate change which is tagged 'Climate Emergency' has ended with a big disappointment. Even the United Nations Secretary General, Antonio Guterres expressed his disappointment immediately after the meeting has come to an end on Sunday 15th December, 2019 with a message 'I am disappointed with the results of #` COP25 , the international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle climate crisis. But we must not give up, and I will not give up. I am more determined than ever to work for 2020 to be better to be the year in which all countries commit to do what science tells us is necessary to reach carbon neutrality in 2050 and no more than 1.5 degree temperature rise.' The Theme of COP 25 conference is TIME FOR ACTION for the rulebook that was adopted during the 2018 COP 24 Climate Change conference in Katowice, Poland for the Paris Agreement. We should all know that a goal without a plan is just a wish and therefore COP25 is putting its best towards tackling climate change. Nigeria should continue to commit herself to her Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), the document Mr. President deposited during the United Nations General Assembly in New York in 2016 so as to be in line with the 1.5o threshold. The 2020 budgets of all the three tiers of governments should factor in peculiarities of climate change issues. This is so important because climate change is affecting our daily life in so many ways and there is evidence in several dimensions, depending on the region, from drought and desertification in the north, erosion in the east, flooding along the coastal zones and patches of other environmental disasters which are directly or indirectly linked to climate change. ADVERTISEMENT One might need to wonder what has been happening since the beginning of the 1st COP in Berlin, Germany in 1995. COP 1 which was tagged Berlin Mandate which was a ruling reached at the first Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in March 1995. COP 2 took place in July 1996 in Geneva, Switzerland. During the COP, ministerial declaration was noted but not adopted so as to reflect the position statement made by the United States. COP 3 took place in Kyoto, Japan in 1997. The COP was tagged 'Kyoto Protocol' which outlined the greenhouse gas emissions reduction obligation for developed countries. COP 4 took place in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1998. The expectation was that, outstanding issues unresolved during COP 3 in Kyoto would be concluded in the COP 4 but however, things went complex and difficult and thus participating countries adopted a 2-year PLAN OF ACTION to advance efforts and to devise mechanisms for implementing the Kyoto Protocol, to be completed by 2000. The fifth UNFCCC Conference, COP 5 took place in Bonn, Germany in 1999. The conference was mainly a technical meeting and no major conclusions reach. COP 6 took place in the city of Hague, Netherlands in 2000. The conference discussions centered on a high-level negotiation over the major political issues especially on the position of the United States' proposal to allow credit for carbon 'sinks' in forests and agricultural lands that would satisfy a major proportion of the U.S. emissions reductions. Unfortunately, no agreement was reached and all decisions collapsed due to the suspension by the then President of COP 6, Jan Pronk and further informed parties that meetings will resume in Bonn later. COP 7 took place on African soil Marrakech, Morocco in 2001 with negotiators wrapped up the work on the Buenos Aires Plan of Action, thus finalizing most of the operational details and setting the stage for nations to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. The main decisions at COP 7 included operational rules for international emissions trading among parties to the Protocol and for the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and joint implementation among others. The COP was tagged MARRAKESH ACCORD. ADVERTISEMENT HOW OVER 5000 NIGERIA MEN HAVE PERMANENTLY OVERCOME TERRIBLE BEDROOM PERFORMANCE DUE TO THIS RECENT BRILLIANT DISCOVERY BY MEDICAL CONSULTANTS The UNFCCC COP 8 took place in New Delhi, India in 2002 and adopted Delhi Ministerial Declaration which called for developed countries to transfer technology and more action from parties to the convention. Milan, Italy hosted COP 9 in December, 2003. Most of the decisions reached during the meeting were centered on the review of the first national communication from parties included in Annex 1 to the convention and the use of Adaptation Fund that was established at COP 7 among others. The city of Buenos Aires, Argentina hosted the UNFCCC Conference again in 2004 as COP 10. The meeting was in support of developing countries towards coping with climate change and programme of work on adaptation and response measures. The fate of Kyoto Protocol was extensively discussed especially modalities and procedures for afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM into the guidelines under Articles 7 and 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. The conference was tagged BUENOS AIRES PLAN OF ACTION. COP 11 took place in Montreal, Canada in 2005. This was the first meeting of parties the marked the entry force of the Kyoto Protocol. The major objectives emerged include; implementation of Kyoto Protocol, improvement on Kyoto Protocol and the innovation for the future COPs. Therefore, the Montreal climate conference adopted the rulebook of the Kyoto Protocol and it was called Montreal Action Plan to extend the life of Kyoto Protocol. For the second time, the UNFCCC conference took place on African soil and now in Nairobi, Kenya in 2006. The COP 12 Conference was tagged Nairobi Framework and focused on four issues; moving forward on adaptation, improving equity and accessibility of the CDM, reviewing the mandate of the expert group on technology transfer and maintaining momentum in discussions on future climate regime. The COP 13 took place in Bali, Indonesia in 2007 and it set a timetable for negotiations for a new international agreement to replace the Kyoto Protocol and include all countries. The conference was known as Bali Roadmap. The roadmap also included a decision to launch an Adaptation Fund and further decisions on technology transfer and on reducing emissions from deforestation. The UNFCCC COP 14 was held in Poznan, Poland in December, 2008. The meeting resulted in delegates agreed on principles for the funding of the poor nations in order to cope with the effect of climate change and the meeting also approved a mechanism to incorporate forest protection into the efforts of the international community to combat climate change. The 15th COP meeting of the UNFCCC was hosted by the Danish Government in 2009 and was as tagged Copenhagen Accord. The objective of the conference was to keep the global warming below 2oC which was validated and developed countries committed to financing developing countries in the long term. The conference raised climate change conference to the highest political level with over 110 world leaders attended the high level segment. More than 40,000 people attended representing governments, NGOs, intergovernmental, faith-based organization, media and UN agencies. For the third time, African country hosted the COP 17 in Durban, South Africa in December, 2011 and the COP 17 was tagged Durban Platform for Enhanced Action. This time around, all countries agree to start reducing emissions, including the US and emerging countries (Brazil, China, India and South Africa). It was decided to negotiate a global agreement that would be into force in 2020. Progress was also made regarding creation of Green Climate Fund and the framework was adopted. COP 18 was held in Doha, Qatar in 2012 and the meeting decided to extend the Kyoto Protocol until 2020. Countries like US, Canada, Russia and China did not support the extension. The theme of the conference was Doha Climate Gateway. COP 19 was held in Warsaw, Poland in 2013 and all parties agreed on seven decisions and build on the Cancun Agreement especially framework for REDD+. The decision includes framework on national forest, monitoring systems, safeguards, forest references emission levels, measuring, reporting and verification and the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation. The 20th UNFCCC COP took place in Lima, Peru in 2014 and the parties adopted LIMA CALL FOR CLIMATE ACTION and also with a roadmap to 2015 climate conference in Paris. Lima conference was also a platform where all countries agree to develop and share their commitment to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. After 20 years of negotiation, the COP 21 was held in Paris, France in December, 2015 and all parties unanimously adopted to keep the global warming below two degrees centigrade above pre-industrial and continue efforts to limit it to 1.5oC. The conference was tagged PARIS AGREEMENT. For the fourth time, African country hosted the COP 22 in 2016. Now it was in Marrakesh, Morocco and the second time the city hosted UNFCCC COP after COP 7 in 2001. The Paris Agreement came into force a few days before the summit, after being ratified by most nations. COP 23 was hosted in UNFCCC headquarters in Bonn, Germany under the Presidency of Fiji and the conference was tagged TALANOA DIALOGUE. The summit made progress on the rulebook to detail how the Paris Agreement will work in practice (Paris rulebook) with the aim of concluding it in 2018. The dialogue was launched to promote the participation and dialogue of local and indigenous Communities. A gender action plan was adopted to ensure the role of women in decision-making related to climate issues. The last Conference of Parties to UNFCCC was held in Katowice, Poland in 2018 as COP 24 with over 23,000 delegates in attendance. The main aim of the conference was the hashing out the Paris Agreement 'rulebook' and the progress in cutting them for every 2 year from 2024. At the end of the conference, the parties failed to agree the rules for voluntary market mechanisms, pushing part of the progress to COP 25 . Here we come, the COP 25 was originally supposed to be in Brazil but upon election of the President, they country withdrew and Santiago, Chile took the baton and unfortunately also, due to the uncertainty in their country, the city of Madrid, Spain came to the rescue. The city of Madrid is called the Green Capital. The conference theme is TIME FOR ACTION and is now. As you might have heard previously, the COP 25 is over and no concluding results reach and expert are currently given their own view on the outcome. The next COP 26 is expected to take place from 9 to 19 November 2020, in Glasgow, Scotland, UK. What are we expecting? What have we learned from COP 25 in Madrid, Spain? Was there disconnect between politicians and the people? What has science shown to us regarding the hottest temperature in recent years? Who are the big emitters and what are currently doing? Is time on our side as temperature continues to rise? As a country, are we really prepared to adapt to the climate emergency? Are we restructuring our economy? What are we doing about carbon credit and capture and storage? Are we undertaking research on adaptations and mitigations in line with global best practice? How far have we gone with our Nationally Determined Contribution? We should also note that most decisions taken during COPs meetings will affect African growth and transformation but it will also be an opportunity for Africa to take advantage if we intend to do well because resources are very sufficient. Therefore, climate change will affect African development if we are not been careful but however, private sector has a role to play to drive this crusade. Preparation for 'COP 26' in the UK Early preparation with representative of everybody in Nigeria will help in showcasing what Nigeria is doing as a country and what we intend to do in specific number years. Finally can Nigeria host future UNFCCC COP as there is likely possibility that COP 27 or COP 28 will be on African soil. Are we ready? \"

He also explained that the high cost of clean energy technologies remained a major impediment to their use in the country. He stated this when he received the Head of Climate Change and Energy, West Africa, British High Commission, Sean Melbourne, in Abuja on Wednesday. Ekweremadu said the enormity of challenges the nation grappled with meant that the budgetary allocation for the environment was perennially low. He called for international support to enable Nigeria to make substantial progress. He, however, expressed the readiness of the National Assembly to partner with the parliament and government of Britain to combat environmental challenges, including climate change. He said:' The commitment of the Nigerian government to addressing the myriads of environmental challenges is not in doubt. However, funding has been a major challenge. Budgetary provisions would never be enough, given the enormity of the challenges Nigeria is already grappling within various other areas. 'There are also issues of policy, enlightenment, national consciousness, and capacity building. 'However, environmental issues are global, hence the need for global cooperation because no country is isolated. What affects one country virtually impacts the rest of the world directly or indirectly. 'Therefore, we are eager to learn, eager to work, and eager to collaborate with the Government of Britain and the rest of the international community in a mutually beneficial partnership to make our environment safer for us and the future generations', he said. He also expressed the willingness of the National Assembly to partner with the parliament of the United Kingdom through exchanges to build the requisite legislative capacity and share legal ideas on legal frameworks on environmental issues. 'We are also strong believers in parliamentary diplomacy. And it is important we partner at the level of parliament to parliament, government to government, for the mutual benefit of our peoples and the world', he added. Speaking earlier, Mr Melbourne expressed the readiness of the British government to work with Nigeria to address environmental challenges. He said that Nigeria, given her size, should be able to tap into global resources for addressing environmental challenges. He added that the UK would be hosting the 26th Session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 26), United Nations Climate Change Conference , in Glasgow, Scotland in 2020 and would therefore relate further with the Committee and the Nigerian government on the event in the days ahead, stressing that the country's full participation would add to the success of the summit, being a very important country in Africa. Also at the meeting were the Vice-Chairman, Senate Committee on Environment, Senator Ibrahim Hassan Hadejia and a member of the Committee, Senator Michael Nnachi. \"
"COP25","Nigeria","COP25_Nigeria27","Without Climate Finance, No Climate Action, Says Act Alliance","December 17, 2019","This Day (Lagos)","A group, ACT Alliance has said without climate finance, there would be no climate action, concerned that almost a week into the UN Climate Talks of COP25 in Madrid, Spain negotiations were not yet at the point that is necessary to deliver ambitious results. ACT Alliance said in a statement that one of the increasingly contentious topics was climate finance. It is addressed in a number of the negotiation streams in relation to Long-Term Finance, the Green Climate Fund, Reporting on climate finance, Loss and Damage finance and support for the implementation of the Gender Action Plan. Head of ACT Alliance's delegation to COP25 , Mattias S\'f6derberg said, ""Climate finance continues to be a difficult topic in these talks. Parties should remember that climate action will not be possible unless climate finance is made available and is accessible. We cannot accept another agreement where support to developing countries remains merely a wishful possibility."" The ACT Alliance is a global network of churches and church-based agencies that does humanitarian response, sustainable development, and advocacy work. ACT is made up of 156 members working in over 125 countries. ""Developing countries are eager to take climate action and to build their resilience while transitioning towards low carbon development. It is therefore important that climate finance is scaled up, made predictable, accessible and is delivered by developed country parties. ""It should be acknowledged that there are already climate finance flows going to developing countries, however, there are numerous examples of climate finance being used for projects that are not necessarily related to climate change in developing countries."" Mattias said, ""A lack of agreement about what climate finance is and what it can be used for challenges the trust amongst parties in these talks. What we have seen is that developed countries claim that they offer support, while developing countries question where the money is. Without trust, the talks on climate finance will not be solved."" Developed countries must ensure that their support is transparent and adequate and that it facilitates timely climate action where it is needed most, the group said. The majority of existing climate finance is delivered to mitigation and the rest to adaptation. However, currently, there is no support allocated for loss and damage, making this a hot topic at COP25 . Developing countries are calling for loss and damage finance and support for those who are most affected by cyclones, droughts and floods and other climate impacts. ""Loss and damage finance is a necessity and it should not be channelled from finance for adaptation or mitigation. Finance for loss and damage needs to be additional, new and predictable to allow countries to plan and respond effectively to the climate crisis,"" says Julius Mbatia of ACT member Christian Aid and ACT Kenya Forum. ""Innovative sources of finance are needed to close the existing loss and damage finance gap. It is of utmost importance that loss and damage is given the priority that it deserves here at COP25 ,"" says Julius. ""It makes no sense to have a debate where parties accept that loss and damage should be addressed, yet no support is made available. This summit should deliver a clear commitment on adequate support for those most in need, parties must promise to not leave anyone behind,"" Mattias said. \"

Minister of Environment, Dr Mahmood Muhammad Abubakar, stated this while addressing the Ministerial High-Level Segment of the 25th Session of the Conference of Parties ( COP25 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; and related meetings on behalf of President Muhammadu Buhari and the Nigerian delegation in Madrid, Spain In his words, 'It is obvious that the challenges of climate change are enormous, Nigeria calls for sustainable joint and collaborative efforts to tackle the problem. Nigeria is willing to continue to be part of the solution.' Speaking further, the minister emphasised that Nigeria faces grave social, economic and environmental threats consequent to climate change due to its dependence on climate-sensitive resources. 'Climate change impacts are already threatening the survival and livelihoods of our people. The devastating loss of range and crop lands to desertification each year in the northern part of the country, resource use conflicts, loss of forest cover and threatening sea-level rise on the significant coastline in the southern part of the country are a stark reminder of our vulnerability to climate change,' Dr Mahmood emphasised. Enumerating some of the steps taken by the Buhari administration to mitigate the effect of climate change, the minister revealed that: 'Nigeria is advancing policies and initiatives aimed at addressing significant challenges occasioned by climate change such as reviving the Lake Chad, increasing forest cover, deploying smart renewable energy solutions, halting and reversing desertification and land degradation, flooding, ocean surge; gender mainstreaming as well as engaging the youths in climate governance. 'Nigeria has also embraced issuances of Green Bond to raise finance for implementation of green project, which has helped the government to fundamentally reorient its financial flows, within the economy, through the greening of the Federal budget and capital market. It is hoped that the issuance of the third Sovereign Green Bond would triple Nigeria's GHG emission reductions, stimulate more economic growth and catalyse investment in social programmes.' Speaking further, he reiterated the commitment of Nigeria towards the fulfilment of its country's obligation under the Paris Agreement and actualisation of goals of its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). COP-25 expeditiously, as a matter of priority, conclude negotiation on the special needs and circumstances of Africa; and the call for the simplification of the guidelines for accessing funds under the Green Climate Fund (GCF) as well as the need for the GCF to remain accountable under the COP. He added that Nigeria expects to see the conclusion of the review of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage; agreement on Article 6 on market mechanism; continued support and enhanced financial provision by developed parties towards NDC enhancement processes and full implementation of the activities thereof to raise ambition and pursue a long-term climate agenda; goal of mobilizing $100 billion by 2020; refining the technical aspects of the transparency framework; capacity building; adaptation; and decision on Gender Action Plans amongst others. The minister stressed that Nigeria hoped that the conference will result in quick resolutions of all outstanding issues pertaining to the Paris Agreement Rulebook as carried over from COP24 to enable its operationalization and strengthening global response to the threat of climate changeto ensure a sustainable future for our people and planet. and lt;!-- and lt;guid and gt; HYPERLINK https://tribuneonlineng.com/climate-change-fg-reiterates-resolve-to-support-global-efforts https://tribuneonlineng.com/climate-change-fg-reiterates-resolve-to-support-global-efforts / and lt;/guid and gt;-- and gt; \"

He quoted the minister as saying that Nigeria was facing social, economic, and environmental consequences of climate change due to its dependence on climate-sensitive resources. 'Climate change impacts are already threatening the survival and livelihoods of our people. 'The devastating loss of range and croplands to desertification each year in the northern part of Nigeria, loss of forest cover, and sea-level rise in the coastline are stark reminders of our vulnerability to climate change,' he said. The minister said that President Muhammadu Buhari had put in place advanced policies and initiatives aimed at mitigating significant challenges occasioned by climate change. According to him, some of the initiatives are, reviving the Lake Chad, increasing forest cover, deploying smart renewable energy solutions, as well as halting and reversing desertification. Others include land degradation, flooding, ocean surge, gender mainstreaming and the engagement of youths in climate governance. 'Nigeria has embraced issuances of Green Bond to raise finance for the implementation of a green project, which has helped the government to fundamentally reorient its financial flows within the economy through the federal budget and capital market. 'It is hoped that the issuance of the third Sovereign Green Bond recently launched will triple Nigeria's Green House Gas (GHG) emission reductions, stimulate more economic growth, and catalyse investment in social programmes,' the minister said. Abubakar reiterated the unwavering commitment of Nigeria to fulfilling its obligation under the Paris Agreement and actualisation of goals of its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). On expectations of Nigeria from the conference, he said that Nigeria had fully aligned itself with the call by the African Group of Climate Change Negotiators (AGN), an alliance of African member states. The AGN represents the region in the international climate change negotiations with a common and unified voice. The group often faces significant barriers to effective participation in climate change negotiations, which in part is due to a lack of strategic and technical assistance on complex negotiating issues tailored to the interests and priorities of Africa. As a result, the ability of African countries to constructively contribute and influence the UNFCCC process is hindered. The group, according to Abubakar, plans to take advantage of COP-25 currently ongoing in Madrid to expeditiously and as a matter of priority, conclude negotiations on the special needs and circumstances of Africa. He stated that Nigeria expects to see the conclusion of the review of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage as well as the agreement on Article 6 on the market mechanism. He added that Nigeria would expect full implementation of a long-term climate agenda, mobilisation of 100 billion dollars by 2020, and refining of the technical aspects of the transparency framework. The minister also said that it was Nigeria's expectation to see the capacity building, adaptation and decision on Gender Action Plans, as well as the adoption of quick resolutions, amongst other things, at the end of the conference. 'Nigeria also wishes that all outstanding issues pertaining to the Paris Agreement Rulebook carried over from COP24 would be operationalised and strengthened to ensure a sustainable future for our people and planet.' \"

The COP25 ""We are of mixed emotions,"" said Carolina Schmidt, Chile's environment minister, who served as president of the talks, after final decisions were made. Many developing countries and campaigners had wanted to see much more explicit language spelling out the importance of countries submitting bolder pledges on emissions as the Paris process enters a crucial implementation phase next year. Brazil, China, Australia, Saudi Arabia and the United States had led resistance to bolder action, delegates said. ""These talks reflect how disconnected country leaders are from the urgency of the science and the demands of their citizens in the streets,"" said Helen Mountford, Vice President for Climate and Economics, at the World Resources Institute think-tank. ""They need to wake up in 2020."" The gathering had been due to end at the two-week mark on Friday but ran on for two extra days \- a long delay even by the standards of often torturous climate summits. Chile had earlier triggered outrage after drafting a version of the text that campaigners complained was so weak it betrayed the spirit of the Paris Agreement. The process set out in that deal hinges on countries ratcheting up emissions cuts next year. 'A CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY'? The final draft did acknowledge the ""significant gap"" between existing pledges and the temperature goals adopted in 2015. Nevertheless, it was still seen as a weak response to the sense of urgency felt by communities around the world afflicted by floods, droughts, wildfires and cyclones that scientists say have become more intense as the Earth rapidly warms. "" COP25 The Madrid talks became mired in disputes over the rules that should govern international carbon trading, favored by wealthier countries to reduce the cost of cutting emissions. Brazil and Australia were among the main holdouts, delegates said, and the summit deferred big decisions on carbon markets for later. ""As many others have expressed, we are disappointed that we once again failed to find agreement,"" said Felipe De Leon, a climate official speaking on behalf of Costa Rica. ""We engaged actively, we delivered our homework, and yet we did not quite get there."" Smaller nations had also hoped to win guarantees of financial aid to cope with climate change. The Pacific island of Tuvalu accused the United States, which began withdrawing from the Paris process last month, of blocking progress. ""There are millions of people all around the world who are already suffering from the impacts of climate change,"" Ian Fry, Tuvalu's representative, told delegates. ""Denying this fact could be interpreted by some to be a crime against humanity.""

"COP25","Nigeria","COP25_Nigeria31","Developing Countries: UNCTAD Parleys With World Bank, IMO On Implications Of Carbon Dioxide Reduction","December 16, 2019 Monday","News Chronicle (Nigeria)","The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) is currently cooperating with the World Bank and the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) to assess the potential implications of carbon dioxide reduction measures on developing countries. This is so because over 80% of the goods consumed around the world are transported by sea, thus making shipping the engine of the global economy. Maritime transport relies heavily on bunker fuels that have a high carbon footprint and contribute to the climate emergency facing the world. One major side effect from the shipping industry is the release of climate-warming gases (such as sulphur oxides) produced from a ship's consumption of bunker fuel. In the face of climate risk, the maritime industry has embraced an accelerated environmental sustainability agenda to fast-track an energy transition towards cleaner fuel sources. A new regulation by the IMO reducing the limit on sulphur in ships' fuel oil from 3.50% to 0.5% will be taking effect on this coming January 1, 2020. It will be one of the most dramatic fuel regulation changes ever implemented and is expected to bring significant benefits for human health and the environment. On the other hand, it's expected to increase fuel costs. UNCTAD Deputy Secretary-General, Isabelle Durant, who led the organization's delegation to the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) in Madrid, Spain said ""we have to embrace the change to create a healthier planet for all of us"", pointing out that trade can be a driver for climate action. UNCTAD is also part of the Getting to Zero Coalition that is committed to getting commercially viable deep-sea zero-emission vessels powered by zero-emission fuels into operation by 2030. The coalition held an event on sustainable maritime transport during COP25 on December 10. The event examined the prospects of zero-emissions shipping for developing countries and large ocean states or small island developing states (SIDS). ""The same countries that suffer most from climate change might also be the ones that would potentially suffer from higher shipping costs due to more expensive fuel"", Ms. Durant said, adding that this raises the question of inequality. Continuing, Ms. Durant said, ""the fact is that we are not all equal in the face of the negative impacts resulting from climate change and environmental degradation."" According to her, global action against climate change should consider this inequality and ensure the special needs of the most vulnerable economies are duly considered in the quest to reduce shipping emissions to zero. These include least developed countries and SIDS, where transport costs can reach 21% and 22% of the value of imports, respectively, as opposed to 1.00% in developed economies, based on UNCTAD data. Discussions at COP25 were also focused on how to bolster actions on resilience and adaption in the face of the severe impacts of the climate emergency. A round table discussion on accelerating action to build a resilient world at 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming was held on December 10. Ms. Durant, who participated in the round table discussion, cited the case of the Bahamas, where Hurricane Dorian, the most intense tropical cyclone on record to strike the country. It resulted in losses worth $3.4 billion, wiping out over a quarter of the country's gross domestic product. Namibia is experiencing its worst drought in 90 years. The drought has ravaged agricultural production, undermined export crops, triggered food shortages and put pressure on the country's debt, undermining years of efforts to reduce it. ""In both cases, what needs to be addressed is the development and economic approach to climate and disaster resilience"", Ms. Durant said. Required measures include economic diversification, which increases the ability of economies to adapt to shocks. In addition, infrastructure should be built and operated in a way that anticipates, prepares for, and adapts to changing climate conditions, Ms. Durant said. SIDS are already seeing the devastating effects of climate change, including sea-level rise and coastal erosion, which are affecting their infrastructure and economies. These countries remain at risk because they do not have the finances to firstly mitigate, and critically, to adapt their infrastructure. Coastal infrastructure is particularly critical for SIDS, where ports and coastal airports are lifelines for external trade, food, energy, and tourism. ""Building the climate-resilience of global ports is of strategic economic and human importance,"" Ms. Durant said, ""given the potential economic implications of climate-related damage, disruption, and delay."" Ms. Durant was on the panel of a high-level discussion on climate-resilient transport infrastructure for sustainable trade, tourism, and development in SIDS during COP25 on December 10. UNCTAD has been working on the implications of climate change for maritime transportation for over a decade, since 2008, with an emphasis on impacts and adaptation needs of seaports and other coastal transport infrastructure. Its recent work includes a technical assistance project on climate change impacts and adaptation for coastal transport infrastructure in the Caribbean, focusing on Jamaica and Saint-Lucia. Some of the project's substantive findings informed the IPCC assessment of climate change impacts at 1.5 degrees global warming, highlighting the risk of marine flooding to coastal transport infrastructure in SIDS, which could occur as early as the 2030s.

Mkpoikana Udoma Port Harcourt  Environmental rights activists in the country on Tuesday charged the Federal Government to ensure the installation of meters in every oil and gas production facilities, in order to ascertain the quantity of gas produced and flared by oil companies. Speaking in Port Harcourt, at the 1st Peoples' Dialogue on the State of Gas Flaring in Nigeria, organised by Chima Williams and Associates, the environmentalists urged the Federal Government to make it a policy that oil companies who flare gas, are made to pay the commercial value of the gas flared. Director, Health of Mother Earth Foundation, Dr Nnimmo Bassey, decried that Nigeria has not been able to quantify to volume of gas produced and flared, just like the government doesn't know the quantity of oil produced, except the data given by the oil companies. Bassey, called on the federal government to ensure oil firms in the country install meters in every oil and gas production facilities, in order to ascertain the quantity of gas produced and flared, so they can pay for any amount of gas flared into the environment. He lamented that gas flaring has been lingering problem in the country since 1956 up till now, with no serious intention to end it in country. ""For companies to flare gas, they should pay the commercial value of that gas, then they can flare it. ""To know the volume of gas being extracted and flared in Nigeria, we need the federal government to sit up and insist that there is proper metering in the oil and gas fields, so we can know what we are talking about, so that anyone who flares gas would pay for the commercial quantity of what is being flared. ""Knowing how much gas flared is simply to install all the metres and the oil and gas exploration companies have been resisting this according to what we heard from the Department of Petroleum Resources."" For his part, Convener of the event, Chima Williams and Associate, recalled that during the 2016 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Morocco, President Buhari stated that the federal government will end gas flaring in 2020. Williams stated that the reason for the meeting was to bring together different actors on the issue of gas flaring, to tackle the issue and unanimously influence the government to within the ambit of the law end the gas flare in Nigeria. ""One of the reasons for this dialogue, is to tell President Buhari to remember the actions he took as a military head of state to end gas flaring, because he understood the importance of ending gas flaring in Nigeria, now that he is a civilian president, he is more responsible to Nigerians who elected him. ""I believe that the President was honest when he made that promise in Marrakech, Morocco in November 2016 that the government would do everything within its power to end gas flaring in 2020. We want to remind him and equally ask him to fulfill that promise. Williams, expressed optimism that ending gas flaring was achievable specially as the Minister of State for Petroleum was from the south-south region which was adversely affected by the effects of gas flaring. ""This is also a clarion call for us to mobilise our voices to support mr president and his government to end gas flaring even this year, it is doable with technology, it only needs somebody to push these oil companies to be willing to do it.""

However, environment groups are of the opinion that little progress was made in advancing real solutions to the global climate crisis due to the interests of certain nations. Philip Jakpor, Head of Media and Campaigns, Environmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria, in a release sent to Ecoscope said, 'We face another dangerous reality: governments have failed yet again to deliver what the world needs for real climate action. Across policy areas, instead of action, the ills of corporate interference and influence were on full display. 'Parties had an opportunity to finally begin to root out the corrosive influence of the fossil fuel industry. Instead, Trump's delegation along with Australia and other Global North countries went to new lows to prevent the undue and proven influence of the fossil fuel industry from even being acknowledged - let alone addressed.' He said, 'Time and again, the US has gone out of its way to undermine the talks on behalf of the fossil fuel industry. The result was an injustice - not only for governments and civil society - but for people around the world who desperately need real climate action. 'This is what corporate capture looks like when it's threatened. And that's why this policy is so vital for the future of this process. In the end, a small minority of countries with clear ties to the fossil fuel industry was able to drown out the demands of almost 50 Global South countries and four civil society constituencies at this meeting.' 'But the call to kick polluters out is not confined to the walls of the UNFCCC. Following the call from countries collectively representing more than 70 per cent of the world's population, over 600,000 people and hundreds of organizations in more than 130 countries are ensuring this call is inescapable from the UN Climate Summit in September to COP25 in December.' Sriram Madhusoodanan, Deputy Campaigns Director at Corporate Accountability, on his part said, 'Although the obstruction of polluting corporations and the governments in their pockets was on full display at these talks, Global South governments fighting for climate justice seized every opportunity to prioritize the real climate action needed to keep warming below 1.5 degrees. In the Article 6 negotiations, historically overrun by industry interests, governments began to expand the toolbox of policies that don't rely on polluter-backed policies, like markets. 'In the AIM discussions, the negotiating bloc representing nearly 50 Global South countries stood unwaveringly with people in the face of unprecedented bullying and intimidation from the US, Australia, the EU and Norway. Their dedication gives hope that something meaningful can come still out of this process. Government champions and hundreds of thousands of people around the world will not stand by while this process and the future of our planet are sold off to the highest bidder. COP25 will be about people holding governments and polluters accountable.

'Governments have made progress in several important areas,' said UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa. 'But whilst the mood was constructive, we need to resolve all outstanding issues by COP25 in order to live up to our collective responsibility and ensure that ambition is raised to the extent that the worst impacts of climate change can be avoided.' While the meeting took place, multiple heat records were broken for June in Europe, including in the conference host country, Germany. The heatwave in Europe follows extreme heat episodes in Australia, India, Pakistan and parts of the Middle East this year. 'We can no longer afford incremental progress when tackling climate change - we need deep, transformational and systemic change throughout society which is crucial for a low-emissions, highly-resilient and more sustainable future,' Ms Espinosa said. In order to achieve the central Paris Agreement goal of holding the global average temperature rise to as close as possible to 1.5 degrees Celsius, greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced 45 per cent by 2030, and climate neutrality achieved by 2050. Governments in Bonn discussed Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which would support countries to meet a part of their domestic goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions through the use of so-called 'market mechanisms'. Article 6 is one of the few issues left unresolved following that adoption last year of the bulk of the guidelines to make the Paris Agreement operational. 'I urge governments to use the rest of this year to find solutions, allowing solid rules for carbon markets to finally take shape. Businesses want this and they are looking for positive signals from governments that they will do this. They know it's a good way to reduce emissions globally,' Ms Espinosa said. Highlighting the importance of markets for effective climate action, the Executive Secretary noted that this week, investors managing more than USD 34 trillion in assets made a strong call to governments to design and implement policies in line with the Paris Agreement goals. The UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn is part of a series of meetings this year to drive forward climate action at all levels and work towards reaching the goals of the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development.

"COP25","Nigeria","COP25_Nigeria35","Why should we care: Nigeria in a mess - rising debt levels","November 11, 2019 Monday","Business Day","We must all (whether young or old) wake up as matters have reached frightening proportions and dimensions. Our country is in a mess. Here is a front-page report in 'The Punch' newspaper of 1st October 2019 (Independence Day Special Report) headlined 'Federal government plans ?4.6 trillion borrowings, debt to hit ?30 trillion.' 'The federal government is planning to borrow fresh N4.6 trillion within the next three years, covering 2020 to 2022, to finance its programmes, figures obtained from the Ministry of Budget and National Planning have revealed. If the N4.6 trillion new borrowings scale through legislative scrutiny and get executed, then Nigeria's indebtedness to local and foreign creditors would hit about N29.55 trillion by 2022, going by the country's current debt profile of N24.95 trillion. The fresh borrowings were contained in the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) recently submitted to the National Assembly by President Muhammadu Buhari. The MTEF, which is currently being worked on by the committees on finance and appropriation, contains the fiscal strategy of the federal government for the next three years. An analysis of the document shows that the federal government is planning to borrow N1.7 trillion in the 2020 fiscal period. A breakdown of the N1.7 trillion shows that the sum of N850 billion is expected to be sourced locally while the balance of N850 billion is expected to be raised from foreign creditors. In the 2021 fiscal period, the government plans to borrow N1.6 trillion which would be sourced in equal proportion of N800 billion each from domestic and foreign sources. For 2022, the government projects to raise N1.3 trillion through debt instruments to finance its operations. This is made up of foreign borrowing of N650 billion and domestic borrowing of N650 billion. Experts said there was the need to be concerned about the nation's debt as a huge chunk of government revenue was being spent on debt servicing. A professor of economics at the Olabisi Onabanjo University Ago-Iwoye, Ogun, Sheriffdeen Tella, told our correspondent that the country currently had a debt problem. Tella said that with the federal government spending about 20 percent of its budget size servicing the country's debt, it was practically impossible for Nigeria not to have a debt problem. He called on the government to discontinue borrowing in order to avoid the current situation where a huge chunk of the country's annual budget was spent on debt servicing. Tella said, 'We have a debt problem because when you have problem with debt servicing, then you have a serious debt problem. Currently, what we are still doing is debt servicing using a huge proportion of the annual budget to pay debt. That is serious because the money that you would have used for other things is now being used to pay debt. We have a serious problem with debt. We should not even accumulate further debts beyond what we currently owe.' Also speaking, a former Director-General, Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Chijioke Ekechukwu, said the rising debt portends danger for the economy.' It is not unlikely that, unwittingly, the teachers (and parents) of students of Dowen College may have overprotected those who are graduating. Their sheltered existence is about to come to an end. Once they venture into the larger society where the rule of the jungle has overwhelmed the rule of law, it is going to be a different ball game where there is no umpire to mitigate the survival of only the fittest. Nevertheless, we must not underestimate the resourcefulness of students. You should draw inspiration from the young Pakistani woman Malala Yousafzai who is now studying at the University of Oxford. Malala defied the Taliban as a young girl in Pakistan and demanded that girls be allowed to receive an education. For her activism, she was shot in the head by a Taliban gunman in 2012, but survived and went on to receive the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014. Equally impressive are the guts and tenacity of purpose demonstrated by Greta Thunberg of Sweden who has carried the message of climate change and the danger it poses for the entire At the mere age of 15, she began protesting outside the Swedish parliament in August 2018 about the need for immediate action to combat climate change. Soon, other students engaged in similar protests in their own communities which then led to an organized school climate strike movement under the name 'Fridays for Future'. After Thunberg addressed the 2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference , student strikes took place every week somewhere in the world. In 2019, there were at least two coordinated multi-city protests involving over one million students each. \"

Hosted by the government of Monaco and the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation, the IPCC session will consider the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate, which assesses the impacts of climate change on ocean, coastal, polar and mountain ecosystems, consequences for human communities that depend on them, and options for adaptation and climate resilient development. The IPCC said it is meeting in Monaco from September 20 to 23, 2019.

"COP25","Nigeria","COP25_Nigeria39","Communicating climate change in Nigeria","March 7, 2020 Saturday","Weekly Trust","There is increasing scientific evidence and growing concern about climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions and recognition of their significant adverse impacts on humans, the local environment, economy, and safety. During the last decade, many planning researchers have focused on growth management and sustainability and have not always seen these factors as directly connected to climate change. Climatological research over the past decades has proved that the Earth's climate is changing in response to anthropogenic increase of atmospheric greenhouse gases. Thus, global warming can be considered as one of the priority environmental risks generating long-term hazards for society and so they requires efficient political response. Climate change policy is the principal response to the problem of global warming and thus climate change policy studies should stressed the importance of integration of climate change issues in all our sectors. Therefore, for government to effectively implement policies and measures and to monitor progress in achieving climate change mitigation targets, we need to use a wide mix of policy instruments, including regulations, economic and fiscal instruments, and voluntary agreements, raising public awareness because the consequences of lack of action by the world's nations including Nigeria, is that, the planet will be warmer, sea level will rise, and patterns of rainfall will change. But the future is also partly uncertain - there is considerable uncertainty about how we will arrive at that different climate. Will the changes be gradual, allowing natural systems and societal infrastructure to adjust in a timely fashion? Or will some of the changes be more abrupt, crossing some threshold or 'tipping point' to change so fast that the time between when a problem is recognized and when action is required shrinks to the point where orderly adaptation is not possible? Nigeria is one of the countries expected to be most affected by the impacts of climate change through rising sea level along her coastline, intensified desertification, erosion and flooding disasters and general land degradation. Nigeria is losing huge amount of money worth billions of naira as a result of the catastrophe while, at least, 80 per cent of the inhabitants of the Niger Delta region of the country will be displaced due to the low level of the region. Nigeria is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and the country's fragile economy makes the local ability to respond difficult. Nigeria has a variety of ecosystems, from mangroves and rainforests on the Atlantic coast in the south to the savannah in the north bordering the Sahara. Whether dry or wet, those ecosystems are being battered by global warming. While excessive flooding during the past decade has hurt farming in coastal communities, desertification is ravaging the Sahel. Traditionally, desertification in the Sahel has been blamed on overgrazing practices of the local population. But it has been discovered that the real problem is climate change. Rainfall in the Sahel has been declining steadily since the 1960s and this has resulted in the loss of farmlands and conflicts between farmers and herdsmen over ever decreasing land. Many different communities, including fishermen, farmers and herdsmen, are now confronted with difficulties arising from climatic changes. The livelihoods of people are being harmed, and people who are already poor are becoming even more impoverished. Climate refugees are the result, as the changes make some land unlivable and affect water supplies. Nigeria is experiencing adverse climate conditions with adverse impacts on the welfare of millions of its population. Persistent droughts and flooding, off season rains and dry spells have sent growing seasons out of orbit, in a country dependent on a rain fed agriculture. Alarm bells are ringing with lakes drying up and a reduction in river flow in the arid and semi-arid region of the country. The result is fewer water supplies for use in agriculture, hydro power generation and other uses. Nigeria will be worst hit by the effects of Climate Change. Droughts are getting worse and climate uncertainty is growing, Climate change is an unprecedented threat to food security. Arid and semi-arid areas in northern Nigeria are becoming drier, while the southern part of the country are getting wetter. Global warming means that many dry areas are going to get drier and wet areas are going to get wetter. Many are going to be caught between the devil of drought and the deep blue seas of floods. Unless climate change is tackled, all the 'best efforts' to help this great country could come to nothing. One of the biggest threats is growing climate unpredictability, which makes subsistence farming difficult. The impact of the change will be difficult to handle and it will be potentially very long lasting. The disproportionate impact on Nigeria will be for a combination of reasons. Global warming will be greater over land than over sea because land retains heat more than water. Now with 25 years of United Nations Climate Change Conference . Is it a talk show? Are there progresses made so far? For how long will the annual event continues? For Nigeria, how far have we gone with our Nationally Determined Contribution? But we should also note that most decisions taken during United Nations COPs meetings will affect African growth and transformation but it will also be an opportunity for Africa to take advantage if we intend to do well because resources are very sufficient. Therefore, climate change will affect African development if we are not been careful but however, private sector has a role to play to drive this crusade. In conclusion, there is no doubt that mankind contributes to climate change through activities connected with emissions of climatically relevant gases. Hence, to manage the situation, reduction measures of climate gases and other relevant actions, are urgently necessary on all levels of government as well as the involvement of the stakeholders in other to address this climate change phenomenon. \"

He said at the same time Nigeria would be innovative to generate its own green funds. ""We will do whatever it takes in our own capacity to see that we acquire as much as we can while at the same time be as innovative as we can to generate our own green fund internally,"" Mahmood said. He added that climate financing required cooperation of many countries for global survival. ""We will aim as high as we can. This is something many countries are aiming at; it is a global cooperation for survival because we belong to one planet. ""Whatever happens in Nigeria can affect America and vice-versa. The minister urged\~nations across the globe to give adequate attention to issue of climate change due to its\~threat to the\~peace and development of the world. ""Every single nation, either near the ocean or in the desert needs to do something about climate adaptation, mitigation, resilient and nationally determine contributions in addressing climate change. ""There are common denominators in the climate change issue that every country across the globe must do something about, and Nigeria is not an exception. ""We have been very active in climate adaption and we will continue to progress in this regard to contribute to global efforts at ameliorating climate change threats.""

"COP25","Nigeria","COP25_Nigeria41","What we are doing to tackle climate change - Minister","January 18, 2020 Saturday","Weekly Trust","Campaigns on climate change have been resisted in some quarters. What is your view on this? Today, what dominates our thinking and concern is the climate change issue which is really affecting everything and everyone. Human, animal and plant species are being impacted by climate change. We must all know that this is because of the way we mishandled our planet. Maybe from the beginning, it was ignorance that action or lack of it can cause damage to our environment which will translate to damage to ourselves. But I think, even after we realised that, we continued unfortunately to do same things and that injured the planet. The unfortunate part is that today, there are some leaders who don't even believe in climate change issues. But the truth is that it is real and if you ask island nations,those in the middle of the Pacific, Indian or Atlantic oceans, they will tell you that they are losing land mass because the oceans are rising. This is because of the melting of the polar ice cap in Antarctica and other places and they are melting because the temperature of our planet has increased. Since the pre-industrial time to today, temperature has so increased that it is causing the melting. Increase in temperature can cause other things on animals, plants and humans because certain species can only operate within a certain temperature. By the time the temperature is too high, they just can't survive. What is your assessment of the just concluded COP25 in Spain? I can say it was very successful and Nigeria had a very good showing. We participated in the negotiation and went with a credible team of negotiators, technical support team and we participated in several other functions. I represented Mr President and delivered the national statement in which we sent the point home including the issue of developed countries coming through with their pledges, the ratification of any treaty or agreement that has been signed. It was a good show as civil societies made their case. The leaders have gotten their messages. I will say that people are really ready for action and the time for talking is over. There are accusations that governments are not serious on the issue of climate change and countries that are the highest polluters are withdrawing aid from the victims. What are the African ministers of environment doing to strengthen action on climate change? It is a very thorny issue because some of the developed countries are withdrawing but a good majority of them are there sticking with the climate change action programme. I remember that at the recent UN General Assembly, Angel Merkel of Germany admitted that countries responsible for the climate crisis are the developed countries but the developing countries are the ones bearing the brunt of the crisis. She also pledged that they will double their efforts in terms of financing. At the last COP25 If these countries completely pull out of the climate change agreement, does Africa have the resources to fight climate change? We will have to, just as we are being innovative now with finances. We will not just fold our hands; we will have to be innovative as we should to continue the fight against climate change. But I can assure you that very few countries will probably pull out. I know the United States has started pulling out but I don't see major countries following suit. What's the place of green bond and green financing? This was also a big topic at the just concluded COP25 that I attended and there are lots of funding agencies and banks that are willing to go green and provide funds for such projects. One of those projects is the provision of solar energy and that is part of our project which we call the Energising Education Project (EEP) where federal universities are being powered by solar. We are concerned about emissions because they are the one heating up the ozone layer. So if we reduce emission, we will reduce the chemicals that are letting in harsh ultra violet coming into the atmosphere thereby heating it up. For the first issuance of the green bond, the proceeds were used in two areas: power and afforestation. Even in the second one which was more successful than the first with over N15 billion realised,we continued along that path.So we have imitated the third green bond which will go into agriculture, water, and transportation. Also, the ministries of Science and Technology along with Environment are working on the methanol policy which is also going green. Methanol is hydrogen and water and when you burn it, you get cleaner emission or almost nothing. These are ways that we are going green through the green bond. It does not just stop there, international funding agencies like the Green Climate Fund, the Global Environment Facility are trying to support any project that is green. Another example is that at the ministry, we have built plastic recycling plants which are a means of going green. It is to collect used plastic, recycle and produce. Like the one we commissioned in Karu, Abuja, we pick used plastics, process them and produce pellets to be used for interlocks. The beauty of it is that with the finished product, we can add another plant to use the finished product as raw materials and produce new plastics. When that new plastics become over used, we can recycle them. That makes it a circular economy instead of the previous linear economy that entails production, usage or consumption to disposal. Today we have the Reduction of the waste produced, then we have Re-use, Recycle, and we have added Repair, and Recover which means instead of three R's we now have five R's and it's about going green. What is the status of the projects under the second phase of the Green Bond? They are ongoing. Even the EEP, we still have more universities coming on board. Projects have a timeline beginning from initiation to completion. We have commissioned some and those of other universities are being worked on and soon, they will be commissioned. We have commissioned the first seven. What about the cars to buses initiative. Is there any success with that? Some of these things are transitional and take time. You have to educate the people to go green and give up the luxury of their cars. Just like in some developed nations, they have ride sharing in which people living in the same area will park their cars and join others to reduce the cars on the road. This is something that we are embracing and we are educating the people on. Right before this administration, there was the idea of getting buses that would be used for that and one of the issues was getting the methanol policy so that we can start moving away from fossil fuel to enable the buses use methanol instead of fossil fuel. What is your leadership doing about deforestation challenge in the country? Forestry plays a big role in climate change, especially in stabilising the climate. Trees absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen, and by reducing the level of carbon dioxide in the air, we reduce the potentiality of the climate heating up. We are planning something about the tree planting campaign; we will get that together and unveil it to the general public. It is a project that involves the mass planting of millions of trees. This is a commitment that President Muhammadu Buhari made on the climate, for Nigeria and for the rest of the world at the United Nations General Assembly in September 2019. This is a promise that we intend to keep and we will go beyond the call of duty by planting more than 25 million trees and it will involve everybody. What is your outlook for the year 2020? We are gearing towards a much brighter 2020. We are going greener and greener and by the first quarter of 2020, the third green bond will be issued; the planting of trees will come up too. We look forward to a successful year and a more educated public in terms of the environment and sanitation. \"
"COP25","Nigeria","COP25_Nigeria42","Climate Crisis Takes Centre Stage At UN Trade Forum","September 9, 2019 Monday","News Chronicle (Nigeria)","Climate Crisis Expectedly, the climate crisis will be far-reaching for all people and nations, but small island development states are at the forefront of its impacts. It also stands to wipe out trade gains of these vulnerable islands if not addressed now. This reality has brought the world's island nations, the trade community, policy-makers, and the United Nations' top agencies together for the first-ever United Nations Trade Forum slated for this September 9-13. The insights and inputs will fed into the much anticipated United Nations Climate Action Summit later this month, on September 23 at the organisation's headquarters in New York. Forum participants will explore the linkages between trade, climate change, oceans economy and biodiversity, and exchange innovative ideas and approaches on how global trade and related policies may enable and support the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Secretary-General, Mukhisa Kituyi, said ''tackling the climate crisis brings many added benefits, such as economic diversification, jobs and innovation, which form the base for shared prosperity and financial stability. Trade has an important role to play in leveraging those co-benefits. Trade can be part of the solution to the climate crisis.'' As the climate changes, the trade regime is also evolving. Purely commercial considerations are now only part of the trade policy equation, with much more being placed on sustainable development. Articulating a positive agenda on climate and trade, signals an important departure from the past two decades of treating trade as a taboo subject in climate policy. Director of UNCTAD's Trade and Commodities Division, Pamela Coke-Hamilton, said ''the Paris Agreement does not contain any references to trade, but in a sense it's the most important trade agreement.'' Once countries' commitments under the landmark agreement start playing out in trade patterns around the world, they will bring about big changes \- positive and negative, intended and unintended \- for trading partners. Coke-Hamilton said forward-looking approaches are required to explore any opportunities for including trade elements in countries' climate commitments, and that the Paris Agreement opens the prospects for a collective transformation, not just for individual economies, but for the global economy as well. This transformation will require a massive reallocation of resources at the international level. At the domestic level, it will necessitate structural changes, which are bound to raise equity and distributional concerns that have been central to UNCTAD's work for decades. The forum will explore how to change the approach from one of allocating or shifting burdens among countries through trade-restrictive measures, to figuring out ways in which trade could help all countries, developing and developed, big and small, share the benefits of transforming their economies. Delegates will deliberate on how to accelerate action on the means of implementation \- finance, technology and capacity-building \- and the role of trade as an enabling factor in meeting this need and leveraging the various co-benefits of tackling the climate emergency. The forum will, through the lens of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 12, 13, 14, 15 and 17, focus on the value of oceans, circular economy and biotrade in building diversification and resilience to climate change, especially in small island developing states (SIDS). SIDS are on the frontline of climate change and are among the first and most-affected nations. They tend to lose from changes in terms of trade because they are net food importers or from limited adaptation through trade because of high trade costs and specialization in goods with little trade. The impacts of unchecked climate change are enough to more than wipe out their trade gains. ''It is important to provide SIDS with flexibilities in line with their vulnerability to risks induced by climate change, including strong safeguards which can be triggered after a natural disaster to provide enough policy space for recovery'', Coke-Hamilton said. The forum's focus on islands and coastal communities mirrors that of the 25th United Nations Climate Change Conference to be hosted by Chile in December. This convergence is indicative of the urgency of changing the political course of efforts to tackle climate change to protect SIDS and other coastal communities. The forum will also explore how oceans-based economic diversification could enhance the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Trade can be an enabling factor in adaptation and in mainstreaming oceans-based economic activities in SIDS, where domestic markets remain small and remoteness is an intractable hindering factor. UNCTAD, UN Environment and the Food and Agriculture Organisation have crafted a joint action plan to help countries achieve the trade-related targets of SDG 14, which seeks to advance the conservation and sustainable use of oceans. The plan, which requires $8.2 million to implement, underscores multidisciplinary and coordinated efforts due to the complexity of multilateral rules on the law of the sea, fisheries and trade. Improvement in global fisheries management can bring additional economic gains estimated at $83 billion, according to the World Bank. Plastic pollution constitutes a serious threat to world's oceans, affecting biodiversity, ecosystem services and livelihoods.?The forum will examine the research, industrial and behavioural initiatives required to deal with this problem. It will also focus on the change needed for businesses and trade to curb biodiversity loss. According to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, biodiversity loss is rapidly accelerating, with an estimated 1 million animal and plant species threatened with extinction. With 70% of the world's poor depending directly on biodiversity, this ongoing decline undermines development gains achieved in recent decades and may even reverse them. BioTrade can generate critical incentives for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. Value chains respecting strict BioTrade principles and criteria are being developed in over 50 countries in Asia, Africa, Americas and Europe in sectors such as personal care, phytopharma, food, fashion, ornamental flora and fauna, handicrafts, textiles and natural fibers or sustainable tourism. During the forum, the Prime Minister of Barbados, Mia Amor Mottley, will deliver UNCTAD's 16th Prebisch Lecture on 10 September, stressing that climate change is far from a concept, but a lived reality for the whole world. In her lecture entitled ""Invisible yet Indispensable"", Mottley will speak about the fate of small island states, coastal and low-lying countries and the need for solidarity in a reinvented international order aimed at building resilience. \"

In a statement issued by his media office, Amaechi said IPOB lied by claiming that he was beaten by its members. ""IPOB members did not ""beat"", physically assault or cause any bodily harm to the honourable Minister"", the statement clarified. ""We read with utter disgust and disdain the sickening propagandist lies credited to one Emma Powerful, who claims to be the Spokesman of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), that IPOB members in Madrid, Spain ""beat"" (physically assaulted) the Minister of Transportation Rt.

""We must clarify that in the incident of the attack yesterday on the Minister in Madrid, where Amaechi was part of the official Nigerian government delegation to the United Nations (UN) climate change conference ( COP25 ), IPOB members did not ""beat"", physically assault or cause any bodily harm to the honourable Minister. ""As they charged towards and at the minister during the attack, it was apparent that their plan was to ""beat"" (quoting Emma Powerful) him, hurt him, cause bodily harm or even do worse! But their violent evil plot failed woefully due to the dexterity of Amaechi to resist them, protect and defend himself, and the prompt intervention of the Spanish police who repelled the motley crowd of misguided attackers. Even the video circulated online by the attackers confirmed this much. Everyone could clearly hear one of them shouting, ""we didn't get him"" expressing his frustrations of their inability to get and ""beat"" the Minister. ""We must commend the Spanish police in Madrid for their timely intervention to protect Amaechi and their investigation of the attack and attempt on the life of the honourable minister in Spanish territory.

"COP25","Nigeria","COP25_Nigeria44","IOM: Climate Change Confab Highlights Our Efforts To Promote Green Energy","December 8, 2019 Sunday","News Chronicle (Nigeria)","The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) says the 25th Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) in Spain highlights its increasing efforts in Bangladesh to promote green energy in Rohingya refugee camps and the Bangladeshi host community. Since the refugee crisis erupted in August 2017, the United Nations migration agency has launched ambitious environmentally sustainable actions in its humanitarian portfolio, actions that both improve services to beneficiaries and reduce its carbon footprint. These include: A comprehensive programme to limit heavy deforestation by distributing Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) to Rohingya refugees and the Bangladeshi host community. Launched in 2018, this has seen 111,542 canisters given to families. LPG eliminates the need for wood burning and has set the stage for a reforestation effort. This initiative also improves indoor air quality in shelters, protecting the health of women and girls and other family members from smoke-induced illnesses. There is also a reforestation drive which has already planted 775,000 trees on 778 hectares (the equivalent of 1,089 football pitches), in and around the refugee camps. In addition to absorbing carbon dioxide \- trees reduce landslide risk by increasing soil retention. To the credit of the UN agency, 1,889 solar lamps have been distributed to households and placed in public areas in and around the Rohingya refugee camps. In addition to increasing protection and safety, residents are less reliant on wood fires or oil lamps. IOM is equally installing solar electricity systems and battery storage at most of its 23 local health clinics to provide clean, reliable electricity. We aim to increase this green electrification effort in other facilities. The humanitarian world's largest solar-powered well system was launched this year, bringing over 20,000 litres of clean water to beneficiaries daily, supplied by a 60 KVa solar park. Those who know better say IOM's tree-planting initiative could lead up to 37 million pounds of C02 emissions reduction since 2018. Deputy Chief of Mission Manuel Pereira said that the efforts have both local and global significance: ''Bangladesh is a climate vulnerable country and one that is on the forefront of migration. ''We urge other partners, donors and governments to stand with us on this fight. The lessons learned from our host community and government support projects are significant to other parts of Bangladesh and to its objectives for the 2030 Agenda and SDGs.''

"COP25","Nigeria","COP25_Nigeria46","IRENA, UNFCC Partner To Accelerate Renewables As Solution To Climate Change","August 6, 2019 Tuesday","Nigerian Tribune","The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and UN Climate Change (UNFCCC) are jointly ramping up efforts to fight climate change by promoting the widespread adoption and sustainable use of renewable energy. The new strategic partnership builds on a long history of cooperation that aims to ensure a low-carbon climate-resilient world in line with the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement, the UN body stated in a press release. In a Memorandum of Understanding signed August 1 in Bonn between the heads of IRENA and UN Climate Change, the two organisations agreed to step up the exchange of knowledge on the energy transition, collaborate more closely at expert meetings, increase capacity building to promote renewables and undertake joint outreach activities. Patricia Espinosa, UNFCCC Executive Secretary, said: 'The rapid transition to clean energy is crucial to meet the central goal of the Paris Climate Change Agreement, which is to hold the global average temperature rise to as close as possible to 1.5 degrees Celsius. 'Time is running out - we are already seeing worsening climate change impacts around the world - including unprecedented heatwaves, floods and wildfires - and we need to grasp all opportunities to rapidly deploy clean, renewable energy at scale to prevent the worst climate scenarios form becoming a reality.' IRENA Director-General, Francesco La Camera, added: 'Falling technology costs have made solar, wind and other renewables the competitive backbone of energy decarbonization and, together with energy efficiency, the most effective climate action tool available. 'Renewable energy delivers jobs, delivers on sustainable development and will deliver a viable climate solution. Renewables-based energy transition provides a clear opportunity to increase ambition in the reviewing process of the national climate commitments under the Paris Agreement. IRENA will fully support countries in realizing this opportunity on the way to COP25 in Chile this year and to COP26 in 2020.' UN Climate Change and IRENA are already working together to promote renewable energy, notably at expert meetings and through publications. At a practical level, the organisations have jointly provided capacity building on renewable energy through training sessions, for example to several African countries. IRENA is also one of the biggest supporters of the UNFCCC's Global Climate Action work, designed to mobilise climate-related activities of cities, regions, businesses and investors. The new agreement is designed to build on this work, and to expand regional activities in the field of clean technology. \"
"COP25","Nigeria","COP25_Nigeria47","Why Nigeria's coal-fired electricity project is a big contradiction","January 14, 2020 Tuesday","The Nation (Nigeria)","Nigeria is like a thirsty man but would rather swallow coals of fire than gulp water. So, when the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Mr. Abubakar Bawa, announced plans by the Federal Government to boost power generation through coal in 2020, it sounded like good music to the ears of most Nigerians. And for obvious reasons, too. Image Credit: ICIR For a nation of nearly 200 million people - where darkness persists and where power generation only reached 5,090MW in April 2018 - Nigerians are not in the best position to negotiate the type of energy they consume. To confirm that desperation, between 1999 and 2007, Nigerian government, under the administration of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, expended an estimated $16billion on power. Yet, the situation left Nigeria in dire straits. By the time Obasanjo left office in 2007, power generation had dipped further, hovering around 2,700MW. Anxious to meet the nation's energy needs, Nigeria is turning to coal, with an initial projection that would see coal-fired electricity accounting for 30% of its power generation. According to Bawa, the Federal Government had reviewed its policies on exploration and mining to support this ambition. One step forward, two backwards On September 22, 2016, before a mixed crowd of civil society groups and political leaders, President Muhammadu Buhari signed the Paris Agreement as Nigeria's commitment to combating the impact of climate in the country. By May 2017, the agreement was ratified, making Nigeria the 146th nation to sign the global treaty as a major provision of the United Nations Framework on Climate Change (UNFCC). Since signing the treaty, Nigeria has played a major role in all Conference of Parties events, policy roundtables and negotiations, including the recently concluded 2019 COP25 Negotiations held in Madrid, Spain. Yet, these efforts have translated to little or nothing. Even though Nigeria clearly articulated eight core areas of interest to reduce green gas emission - including the 2030 target to end gas flaring, 45% conditional and 20% unconditional carbon emission reduction - rhetoric still trumps action, and Nigeria faces grimmer climate prospects in the coming years. During the COP25 'Nigeria faces grave social, economic and environmental threats consequent to climate change due to our country's dependence on climate-sensitive resources. Climate change impacts are already threatening the survival and livelihoods of our people,' he said. 'The devastating loss of range and crop lands to desertification each year in the northern part of the country, resource use conflicts, loss of forest cover and threatening sea-level rise on the significant coastline in the southern part of the country are a stark reminder of our vulnerability to Climate Change.' Yet, everything points further south. As at May 2019, Nigeria saw its gas reserve rise to 200.79 trillion cubic feet from 187 tcf, representing a growth of 7.3%. Yet, an estimated 425.9 billion standard cubic feet of gas was flared during the same year, leaving bleak any hope of solving her 60-year-old environmental problem. According to the Nigerian Gas Flare Tracker, a satellite gas flare tracking platform by the National Oil Spill Detention and Response Agency (NOSDRA), of the total gas flared in 2019, 22.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide was emitted into the environment in 2019 alone. For a nation with the most polluted and deadliest air in Africa and fourth globally, gas flaring continues unabated. Despite the 1984 ban that compelled International Oil Companies (IOCs) to end the dangerous practice, Nigeria continues to adopt policies that question its sincerity to reduce its troubling carbon thresholds. While Nigeria grapples with the damage caused by these activities, especially in its oil-rich Niger Delta region, where pollution has destroyed communities and wrecked livelihoods, toying with an ambitious coal electricity project of this scale defies logic. If anything, the new coal-fired electricity project would only escalate the situation. Paris Agreement: Another formality for Nigeria? Consider the issue of gas flare. Nigeria has pledged to end the deadly practice within the last 36 years without keeping to its word. In 2017, in its National Gas Policy approved by the Federal Executive Council, Nigerian government pledged yet again to end gas flaring by 2020. After about two years of yet more talk and less action, in August 2019, Justice Derefaka, who heads the Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialization Programme (NGFCP), said the 2020 deadline was no longer realistic. Even though 2030 is the official deadline set by the United Nations for oil-producing countries to end flare, Nigeria's failure to end the practice for more than three decades raises doubt about its commitment to these agreements. Africa's population growth is projected to equal more than half of the world's within the next three decades. By implication, energy need in Nigeria, which is currently 10 times below the current power output according to Minister of Power Babatunde Fashola, would more than double. This shows why fossil-fuel dependency is not likely to reduce any soon, despite the implications on climate and the environment. Instead, Africa remains the favorite destination for curious energy projects. Between 2014 and 2016, nearly $20 billion was invested in energy projects across the continent by government-backed financial institutions. Oil Change International, a clean energy advocacy group that conducted the study, said fossil fuels accounted for about 60% of public aid for energy projects in Africa during the period. Except Nigeria is not committed to the terms of the Paris Agreement, which it willingly assented to in 2016, the new coal-fired electricity project only contradicts its efforts to combat climate change. it is an own goal for the people. \"

Participating organisations and signatories hail from more than 63 countries including Bolivia, The Philippines, and Nigeria. Fossil fuel industry liability is a growing area of focus for climate experts, academics and governments alike as the industry's long history of denial and the link between industry emissions and climate impacts becomes more evidenced. From USA to Vanuatu to Peru, elected officials and people are exploring holding the fossil fuel industry liable for its long history of deceit and environmental destruction. Earlier this year, the European Parliament held a hearing investigating Exxon's attempts to mislead the public. The Philippines' commission on human rights is considering the fossil fuel industry's responsibility for human rights violations in connection to climate change. And in Peru, a farmer is suing a German utility for its role in the crisis harming his livelihood. 'This year's climate talks are a crucial opportunity to hold polluting industries accountable for the climate crisis, especially the 100 fossil fuel companies that are responsible for 71% of greenhouse gas emissions since 1988. Citizens around the world are rising up to demand climate action, to demand an end to the immense suffering global temperatures are already causing in the Global South. The dirty fossil fuel party is over,' said Harjeet Singh, Global Lead on Climate Change for Action Aid International. 'For decades, big polluters have gone to any length to block, weaken and delay policy. That time is over.

The coalition, co-led by Finland and Chile, comprises 51 countries including Nigeria that accounts for 30 percent of global Gross Domestic Product (GDP). ""We will not achieve our climate goals unless we have unity and cooperation on a global scale to tackle climate change which is an existential threat to all of us,"" said Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). ""Finance is at the heart of our economies and it must be at the very center of our efforts to transform them. It is the lifeblood of production and consumption worldwide and it must become the seed of a new global economy,"" Espinosa said. ""Without it, a sustainable, greener world will be impossible,"" she added. The coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action was launched at the World Bank Group IMF Spring Meetings in April 2019, with members endorsing six principles known as the 'Helsinki Principles.' Nigeria is among the countries that have endorsed the Helsinki Principles and the Santiago Action Plan. The Helsinki Principle promotes national climate action, especially through carbon pricing, macro-fiscal policy, public budgeting, and financial sector initiatives. Ignacio Briones, Minister of Finance, Chile, reaffirmed the political commitment of the Finance Ministers to climate change and sustainable development. ""People are the ones who suffer the pernicious effects of the temperature increase. Also, people are the ones who are suffering the transition to a low emission economy when this transition is not fair,"" Briones said. Under the plan, with individual countries' national content recognised, Finance Ministers have agreed to work together by sharing best practices and experiences and initiating analytical work to support policy action to reach evidenced-based cost-efficient solutions. ""The time to come as a global community and accelerate the transition to low carbon and climate-resilient future is now. As Finance Ministers, we stand ready to do our part,"" said Mika Lintila, Minister of Finance, Finland. ""Through the coalition and with this Santiago Action Plan, we can support the design of policies to help address climate change and deliver sustainable growth,"" he added. \"

World Environment Day takes place every year on 5 June. It is the United Nations' flagship day for promoting worldwide awareness and action for the environment. Making the announcement on the margins of the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) in Madrid, Spain, Ricardo Lozano, Colombia's Minister of Environment and Sustainable Development, Jochen Flasbarth, Germany's State Secretary for Environment, and Inger Andersen, Executive Director of the UN Environment Programme, stressed that with one million plant and animal species facing extinction, there has never been a more important time to focus on the issue of biodiversity. '2020 is a year for urgency, ambition and action to address the crisis facing nature; it is also an opportunity to more fully incorporate nature-based solutions into global climate action,' said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of the UNEP. 'Each year, World Environment Day is a powerful platform to accelerate, amplify and engage people, communities and governments around the world to take action on critical environmental challenges facing the planet. We are grateful to Colombia and Germany for demonstrating leadership in this effort,' she added. UNEP in a statement noted that 2020 is a critical year for nations' commitments to preserving and restoring biodiversity, with China hosting the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP15) to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity in Kunming. Next year also provides an opportunity to ramp up to the start of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030), intended to massively scale up the restoration of degraded and destroyed ecosystems to fight the climate crisis and enhance food security, water supply and biodiversity. 'In Colombia we will face an important challenge in 2020, and it is to host the 3rd and last OEWG [open-ended working group] meeting of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework before the COP in China. In Colombia, we are willing to work together to reach an agreement that allows us to move forward positively towards ambitious results in the COP that will meet us in China; we welcome Germany's gesture of support in this global effort and look forward to a successful collaboration,' said Lozano, Colombia's Environment Minister. Listed as one of the world's 'megadiverse' countries and sustaining close to 10 per cent of the planet's biodiversity, Colombia ranks first in bird and orchid species diversity and second in plants, butterflies, freshwater fish and amphibians. The country has several areas of high biological diversity in Andean ecosystems, with a significant variety of endemic species. It also has part of the Amazon rainforest and the humid ecosystems of the Choc\'f3 biogeographical area. 'There is no better time to come together for the planet than now,' said Jochen Flasbarth, Germany's State Secretary for the Environment. 'Climate action and biodiversity conservation are two sides of the same coin. We need to develop policies that stop the extinction of plant and animal species. Germany is pleased to support Colombia and other member states in making 2020 a year that kicks off action for biodiversity.'

The report, launched recently, also looks ahead at the work to come, in particular the need to put the final touches to the Paris Agreement Work Programme in 2019, for nations to revise upwards their Nationally Determined Contributions. According to a statement by UN Climate Change, the Annual Report highlights the progress made on tackling climate change in 2018 and the ways in which the international community can raise ambition and achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. ""Stepping up action has never been more urgent. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) special report on the impacts of global warming at 1.5 \'b0C, requested at COP21, made this crystal clear,"" said UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa. ""We are running out of time to stay under this limit,"" she added. ""I have hope. Alongside new scientific evidence and the increasingly observable signs of climate change - from melting glaciers to massive storms - 2018 showed that the world is now ready and determined to act. As this annual report illustrates, the UNFCCC secretariat continued to support tirelessly the global climate platform that supports and encourages this progress."" The report covers the key achievements of the UNFCCC intergovernmental process and the activities of the secretariat, particularly the impacts of those activities in support of the Convention, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement. The statement said, ""For example, at COP24 in December 2018 the world agreed the majority of the guidelines to put the Paris Agreement into action through the Katowice climate package. ""The package provides the operational framework for climate action and guidance on tracking and evaluating efforts at the national and international levels. It outlines how countries will report on their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs - national climate action plans under the Paris Agreement), the specific actions they will take and how they can communicate their progress. This includes efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions and build resilience to the inevitable impacts of climate change, as well as financial support for climate action in developing countries."" While current pledges under the NDCs fall far short of where the international community needs to go to achieve its climate goals, by finalising the Katowice climate package nations showed they are committed to increasing their ambition. The conference saw many other commitments, from pledges of billions of dollars in climate funding to a host of businesses and international organisations committing to reducing their emissions. By efficiently supporting the negotiations and helping to establish the mechanisms for the Paris Agreement, measuring and analysing commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, and increasing the capacity of developing countries to adapt to climate change through support, training and access to the latest information, UN Climate Change helped build this increased momentum. In 2019, events such as regional climate weeks, regional dialogues, capacity-building sessions and meetings, as well as COP25 in Chile in December, will provide vital opportunities to collectively advance efforts and set the stage for the greater action that will be needed over the next years. Another key moment will be the 23 September UN Climate Action Summit convened by the UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres. He said: ""With the adoption of the Paris Agreement Work Programme, we have the framework for an era of action and ambition that will allow us to build a better tomorrow. The time for action is now. In that spirit, I commend this UNFCCC annual report to a wide global audience."" \"

"COP25","Nigeria","COP25_Nigeria56","Morocco Has Africa's 'First Fully Solar Village'","December 13, 2019 Friday","Nigerian Tribune","Near Morocco's sunny Atlantic coast, the tiny community of Id Mjahdi is being touted as Africa's first completely solar-powered village. Solar power has the potential to become one of Africa's top energy sources, according to the International Energy Agency, but more infrastructure needs to be installed - of all solar power in use globally, less than 1% currently comes from the continent. Morocco is leading efforts to fulfill that potential. It already meets 35 percent of its electricity needs from renewables and aims to increase its use of renewable energy to 52 percent by 2030, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). 'Morocco is unquestionably a leader in sustainable energy,' says Francesco La Camera, director-general of IRENA. The country already has the world's largest solar farm, the Noor-Ouarzazate complex. Now, Id Mjahdi, on the outskirts of the city of Essaouira, is being pitched as a blueprint for how to power remote villages that would be expensive to connect to the national electricity grid. While many other African villages use solar power to some extent, Id Mjahdi uses it for all its energy needs. Self sufficient When Moroccan solar power company Cleanergy came up with the idea of testing a sustainable model for electrifying remote communities, it looked for a village 'where they need everything,' according to the company's founder, Mohamed Lasry. Before the scheme began, villagers relied on candles for light, and they typically could afford only around an hour of candlelight for working or studying in the evenings. They would burn tree bark for heating and cooking, which was bad for their health, says Lasry. Id Mjahdi did not even have a nearby source of water, and girls in particular often missed school days to walk several miles to a well, says Lasry. The first step in the $188,000 project was to build a water tower for the community. The next stage was to install a power station with 32 solar photovoltaic panels, which generate 8.32 kilowatts of electricity for distribution via a mini-grid. The power station is connected to around 20 homes in the village, serving more than 50 people. Each house was provided with a fridge, water heater, television, oven and an outlet to charge devices. The solar network has a battery that can supply up to five hours of electricity outside daylight hours. The project was also assisted by Cluster Solaire, a Moroccan non-profit that supports green-tech companies, which enlisted financial help from the Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy and French businesses Intermarch\'e9 and Petit Olivier. In October, Cleanergy unveiled several solar-powered buildings - a hammam (public baths), a workshop where women study and produce argan oil, and a preschool for children between the ages of three to six, which enables their mothers to work While the children play and draw, 30 women - many of whom did not go to school as children - learn reading and writing, train for scholarships, and use traditional techniques to create argan oil, crushing kernels from local argan trees. Cosmetics company Petit Olivier buys all the argan oil the women produce, giving them an income. 'People that were not working at all and not having any sustainable revenue, the fact that they are working in their village and creating value is very important and very, very valuable,' says Fatima El Khalifa, from Cluster Solaire, who is giving a presentation on the project at the COP25 climate summit in Madrid this week. 'We created an association like a cooperative at the village and they own the whole production.' The association takes a small fee from the argan oil sales to maintain the solar network, and men and women in the village were trained by Cleanergy in how to manage it. Lasry says the mini-grid is simple to replicate for villages of 100 to 1,000 people, and it is sustainable, because locals can maintain it themselves. 'It is possible to duplicate anywhere in the world,' he says. 'It is not a complex system, it is easy to do, it is robust.' Cluster Solaire is now seeking funding to build more solar villages. El Khalifa says there are 800 villages without electricity in Morocco alone and the World Bank estimates that 840 million people lack access to electricity worldwide. Around 650 million people will still lack access to electricity in 2030, nine out of 10 of them in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the World Bank. It says mini-grids could be the most cost-effective solution for remote areas with a high enough demand, and could provide electricity for 500 million people by 2030. 'Our plan is to show [Id Mjahdi] as an example,' says Lasry. 'People change - they have more time, they can have money, they can go to the market, they can buy what they need.' For deprived communities seeking economic stability that won't hurt the environment, this solar village shines bright. \"

Speaking on her expectations for the environment in the year ahead, especially in the area of climate change, waste management and recycling, Lawani said, 'The world can no longer deny or live in ignorance as the realities of climate change are biting hard. The major contribution to these changes is human activities. I would like to see more people care enough for the environment, and to actually start taking practical measureable steps towards making a difference and quit complaining!' She added that, 'It would be great if the authorities can set up schemes that reward and celebrate good behaviour.' If the government authorities do this, 'many more people can join in the train.' 'And the next step after that would be to put up penalties for noncompliance. I mean in Rwanda, if you are caught littering, you would be arrested. It's that serious! She explained further her blueprint for environmental action, 'Before we get there, people must be encouraged to become responsible stewards of the environment first, and get them to gradually change behaviour - by incentivising and celebrating. And then those who still refuse, sanction them! 'Else, we will just be playing lip service and will not achieve any real change.' The Greenhill Recycling boss added that 'More producers of these plastics (companies) should rise up to their responsibility of recovering their products from the environment. They must support recycling aggregators and set aside funds to ensure effective collection. 'Everyone has a role to play: consumers must also become more responsible knowing that they are the first recipients of the consequences of their behaviour, whether good or bad.' Seyifunmi Adebote, an environmentalist and a youth delegate to the recent UN COP25 climate conference, told Ecoscope that 'The Federal Government of Nigeria should make environmental actions priority. 2019 was an opportunity for the government to appreciate the roles of young people. In 2020, I believe the roles of youths will be increased and we will continue to push the government to work, as well as, show readiness to contribute when called upon. 'As of today, we know that environmental issues in Nigeria are not on the government's priority list, hence, the government keeps shooting itself in the leg with many anti-environmental policies, partnerships and structures that outright negate the verbal commitment to be environmentally responsible. 'The most important thing will be that the young people continue to use founded approaches and the experiences of other counterparts to get the government of Nigeria and the people to do better.' President of the Environmental Health Students Association (EHSA) at the University of Ibadan, Jentle Esuong speaks on his expectations on environment in 2020 with specific reference to waste management. 'The poor waste management in Nigeria is no longer news and is very evident in the city of Ibadan. 'We in the academic sector have been committed to education, awareness and advocacy, and a number of non-governmentals have been contributing meritoriously to ensure proper waste management around the city of Ibadan. 'In provision of adequate facilities for proper and sustainable waste disposal and general management, more has to be done by the government in the coming year 2020. With the rate of awareness and advocacies that have been done, if adequate facilities are provided and accessible in terms of reach and cost, the public will subscribe to them and if made sustainable, the results, outcome and impact will speak for themselves.' He explains further: 'Waste management agencies in Nigeria generally should adopt waste segregation strategy, not segregating after collection but at the point of generation of waste. Every individual and household should be provided with facilities (waste collection drums or containers) to segregate their waste at the point of generation into at least three categories, namely: plastics, biodegradables, paper/sand/metals, with specific colours of containers for various categories. This will make recycling possible and collection by waste management agencies easy. 'Waste management agencies should be strengthened in their operations by provision of adequate and efficient waste evacuation truck services, training of workers and provision of safety materials, especially personal protective equipment.' Esuong said there should be upgrade on existing dumpsites into landfills. He said there must be 'provision of modern sanitary landfills in place of dump sites widely in practice. 'Temporary dump sites can be established as catchment centres where waste is collected with the intension to transport same to the sanitary landfills. At major points at streets and markets, sizeable tanks for collecting waste in various segregations should be provided, this will end the wide dropping of waste bags in the middle of the road around the city.' He said that authorities must 'educate the public on each step in the introduction of new innovations in waste management and ensure community participation and ensure compliance by reasonable sanctions and enforcement of regulations on waste disposal. 'However, it will be unfair to enforce laws where the public has no means of keeping to the law.' On his expectation from the public, the EHSA president said, 'As I mentioned earlier, when a working system is put in place, the members of the public are more likely to subscribe positively.' \"

Mr. Seyifunmi Adebote, the Leader of Nigeria's Youth Delegate to the meeting made this known in a statement on Sunday, that the event was holding at the Presidential Palace in Abu Dhabi from June 30 to July 1. Adebote said the meeting was structured to evaluate and strengthen the initiatives, commitments, and achievements that would be announced at the UN Climate Summit in September. He said that the meeting was also discussing key and emerging political barriers and opportunities for global climate action. ""The UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, who is expected to open the meeting, has remained deeply concerned about the need for world leaders to come up with concrete and realistic plans to enhance their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) by 2020. ""It is expected that the Abu Dhabi Climate Meeting will be the global milestone for the United Nations' Climate Action Summit which will hold in New York, U. S. on Sept. 23. ""Nigeria, being a member country of Youth Engagement and Public Mobilisation, one of the Summit's nine transformational areas has shown its commitment towards mobilising people to take action on climate change and ensure that young people are integrated and represented.

"COP25","Nigeria","COP25_Nigeria60","Kogi: Bello, Achuba face-off worsens","August 10, 2019 Saturday","Weekly Trust","The feud between Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State and his Deputy, Elder Simon Achuba, took a new dimension recently with a seven-day ultimatum issued by the deputy governor to Bello to settle his unpaid entitlements or face legal action. Besides, the deputy governor has also alleged that governor Yahaya Bello plans to attack him, an allegation the governor has denied. Achuba had particularly threatened to seek a legal redress at the National Industrial Court if Governor Bello fails to release the statutory allocations allegedly due to his office after the expiration of the ultimatum. A demand notice to the governor, signed by Femi Falana (SAN) on the instructions of the deputy governor, called for the release of all statutory allocations due to the office of the deputy governor for 2017, 2018 and 2019 amounting to over N819million. The letter addressed to Governor Yahaya Bello and dated July 17, read: 'As you are no doubt aware, our client's office is a creation of the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (As Amended). Accordingly, the office is statutorily entitled to the prompt release of all allocations due to it as appropriated by the Kogi State House of Assembly and signed into law as the budget by your Excellency. 'Our client has informed us that your Excellency's administration has consistently refused to give approval for the release of funds for the smooth running of the office of the Deputy Governor even after memos to that effect have been approved for the office. In particular, the statutory allocations approved for the office of the Deputy Governor have been withheld by the state government since 2017. 'The accumulated statutory allocations as withheld is N819, 709,980.00 which includes travel allowances, hotel bills, pledges and outstanding monthly impress and salaries due to our client as the Deputy Governor of Kogi State. 'This said statutory allocations are duly captured in the Kogi State appropriation laws of 2017, 2018, and 2019 supported by various memos sent to your office since 2017 which were duly approved without cash backing till date. 'Notwithstanding the fact that the statutory allocations have been illegally withheld, our client has continued to carry out his functions as the Deputy Governor of Kogi State. 'In as much as our client is prepared to continue to discharge the enormous responsibilities of his office, he is currently hampered by lack of funds which has wide ranging implications for the state even as it prepares for the forthcoming gubernatorial election. 'In view of the foregoing, we have our client's instructions to request your Excellency to use your good offices to ensure the immediate payment of the withheld statutory allocations legitimately appropriated for the office of the Deputy Governor of Kogi state since 2017. 'Take notice that if our client's request is not granted within seven days of the receipt of this letter, we have our client's instructions to seek redress in the National Industrial Court.' Few days after Achuba issued an ultimatum to the governor over his unpaid entitlements, he (Achuba) was sighted at the Presidential Villa where he was said to have met with Abba Kyari, Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari. The deputy governor, did not reveal details of the deliberation when asked by State House correspondents. He, however, revealed that discussions were ongoing to resolve the 'problems' between him and the state governor who, he said, was responsible for the stoppage of his allowances for the past two years. 'Well, it is a private discussion in relation to my office. From my discussions with him, there is hope that all the issues will be resolved. With God, all things are possible,'' he said. On how he has been 'coping' as deputy governor without allowances and impress in the past two years, Mr Achuba said: 'Well, you know in life, what sustains a man is God. So if your hope is in God, you will be very much alive. 'If you have money and don't have God, you will be living like a dead person. But if you have God you can live; He is the one who provides to man. So, if one source closes, God opens another source for you to live. Supposing I was not a Deputy Governor, won't I be alive?' On whether he will support or contest against Governor Bello, who has since indicated interest in the governorship election slated for November 16, the deputy governor ruled out the possibility of doing that because of what he described as 'unfair treatment' being meted against him by his boss. Kogi State Governor Yahaya Bello in his reaction said the salaries of his deputy, Simon Achuba, were not stopped at any point since he became deputy governor. Bello, in a statement by his spokesman, Kingsley Fanwo, was responding to a demand notice and ultimatum by Achuba over alleged non-payment of his entitlements of over N800 million. He said Achuba's salaries had been paid up to the same date as that of Bello and other political office holders in the state. Fanwo, while describing the claims contained in the deputy governor's demand notice as 'bogus', expressed the readiness of the state government to meet him in court should he proceed there to ventilate his alleged grievances. 'It is our belief that the claim for salaries at paragraph 4 of the letter of demand was done to generate sensational headlines in the news as there is no stated salary arrears in the prepared breakdown of claimed entitlements attached to the letter of demand. 'The sum of N786, 427,480 of the outrageous N819, 709,980 claimed by the Deputy Governor have not been approved let alone processed for payment by the government. 'The deputy governor is aware that by virtue of extant financial regulations, even where expenditures are provided for in the budget, they are still subject to approvals based on an estimation that funds to defray will be available; and where they are approved, the release of such funds still depends on the availability of funds. 'While we are certain that the Deputy Governor's claims are frivolous, bogus and borne out of mischief and an attempt to embarrass the Kogi State Government where he currently serves and draws immense benefits; we reiterate our readiness should he be ready to proceed to court to meet him in court for the ventilation of his alleged grievances', Fanwo said. There has been a strained relationship between the governor and his deputy for quite some time, and perhaps, the latest development might be the climax in the lingering feud. Achuba was sworn in as deputy governor on February 10, 2016, following the refusal of James Faleke, the then running mate to the late Prince Abubakar Audu to deputize for Bello. However, not too long into the 'political honeymoon', some cracks and cold war began to manifest between the governor and his deputy. It all started with reports of alleged sidelining of Achuba in the running of affairs of the state. Political watchers are of the view that the deputy governor's office has been less active or largely 'redundant' for a greater part of the administration. Perhaps, one of the earliest signs of the existence of a crack between the governor and his deputy was when the former travelled out of the country for about two weeks to seek medical attention sometime in November, 2016. There were indications that the governor did not hand over power to his deputy before travelling out, thus sparking concerns of existence of a crack in their relationship. Another scenario was when the governor went on a trip to Poland in December, 2018, alongside President Muhammadu Buhari, for the United Nations ( UN ) Conference on Climate Change . The governor handed over power to the Speaker of the House of Assembly, Matthew Kolawole, to hold forte as acting governor. The development created an uproar from some stakeholders, but within 24 hours, a circular granting the deputy governor a two-month leave was released. Dramatic enough, the deputy governor was said to have applied for and was granted a two-month annual leave almost the same period the governor was away from the country. Analysts, however, observed that the development was an indication that all might not be well between the governor and his deputy. They said it was unusual for a deputy governor to have proceeded on leave at the same time as the governor. Achuba's ordeal, it was learnt, must have heightened following his alleged secret hobnobbing with the opposition PDP. The face-off became public after Achuba addressed a press conference sometimes in February this year, where he opened up on some of the predicaments he was battling. Achuba, at the press conference, raised alarm that his life and those of his family members were in danger following the withdrawal of his security details allegedly on the orders of the ADC to the governor. According to him, he was set to go to his village at Iyano in Ibaji for the 'postponed' elections when all his security aides were withdrawn. He alleged that the ADC to the governor had summoned all his security details to the Government House on February 15, 2019, for a briefing and kept them in detention without any explanation. Although the security details of the deputy governor were eventually restored, there are still indications that the feud is far from being over. One of the implications of the feud between the governor and his deputy is that the likelihood of Achuba being fielded as running mate to governor Bello in an event he picks the party's ticket is very doubtful. \"

The Climate Investment Platform, CIP, is an inclusive partnership welcoming all stakeholders from governments and international organizations to the private sector to scale-up climate action and translate ambitious national climate targets into concrete investments on the ground. The CIP partnership. With energy accounting for two thirds of total greenhouse gas emissions, the platform's first service line is dedicated to the global transition to clean energy. Other service lines, such as adaptation, land use, cities and infrastructure will be launched in the first quarter of 2020. By decluttering and streamlining support to developing countries, the platform aims to accelerate action and advance climate investment in developing countries. Progress will be presented at UNFCCC COP 25 in December 2019. The service offered by the CIP covers four key building blocks along the climate finance value-chain: supporting governments to specify ambitious energy targets and scale up their nationally determined contributions (NDCs), establishing well-designed, implemented and enforced clean energy policies and regulations, financial de-risking of energy projects, and a market-place to connect clean energy investors and project sponsors. ""The Climate Investment Platform is a crucial initiative that will simplify access to climate finance. It will catalyze investment for mitigation and adaptation in developing countries, supporting those most in need of climate action,"" said Green Climate Fund Executive Director Yannick Glemarec. ""Renewable energy is the most effective and ready solution to rising carbon emissions. Together with energy efficiency, they can deliver 90 per cent of the emission reductions needed under the Paris Agreement, but investment and deployment must increase significantly,"" said IRENA Director-General Francesco La Camera. ""This partnership combines the strengths of the respective organisations to deliver tailored, proactive policy and investment support to set the energy transformation on a climate-safe path. ""Finance is the lynchpin to achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 and countries' Paris Agreement commitments. However, the evidence is clear that global investment is dramatically off track to meet universal access to energy by 2030,"" said Rachel Kyte, CEO and Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL). ""The Climate Investment Platform will help bridge the gap between supply and demand to accelerate capital and scale up climate resilient investments, allowing countries to raise their climate targets and develop policy environments that allow investment to flow."" ""A powerful partnership of key institutions in the energy sector, the Climate Investment Platform will help to accelerate system-wide change and deliver co-benefits across the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \- from employment and economic growth to reduced inequalities and improved health."" said UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner.

"COP25","Nigeria","COP25_Nigeria65","How scramble for resources fuels conflict across Africa","March 25, 2020 Wednesday","Premium Times","Nigeria, March 25 -- By David Njagi Nairobi - She may not be from central Africa, but 17-year-old Makenna Muigai would like African leaders to rally their political muscle to save the endangered Congo Basin - for a good reason. As the world's second largest rain forest supports over 80 million people in the region, the young Kenyan climate activist is concerned that the scramble for its resources is one of the leading causes of conflicts in central and eastern Africa. Fellow climate activist Vanessa Nakate from Uganda highlighted the devastating fires in the Congo Basin with her one-person protests on the streets of Kampala started in early 2019. Nakate's demonstrations have led to her attending UN Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) and the World Economic Forum's annual meeting, and her Rise Up Movement spread to several countries on the continent. She no longer protests alone. Muigai says the pressures facing the Congo Basin are worsened by climate change and corruption, even as the World Resources Institute reported in 2019 that its continued disappearance could exacerbate insecurity over fresh water and food supplies among the most vulnerable populations. ""There are many conflicts that could arise from climate change and when we do not take care of our environment. There could be higher rates of death, higher chances of getting ill and worsening food insecurity due to unforeseen calamities like the locust invasion in eastern Africa,"" said Muigai. That could upset Africa's economic transition and increase tensions among communities faced with diminishing resources like water, food, and healthcare, said Gita Gopinath, the chief economist at International Monetary Fund, during a February presentation in Nairobi. While much growth in Africa will be posted by energy economies as the continent transits into the new decade, African countries locked in conflicts over resources risk slowing down their economic engine, which is currently growing at a rate of between 2.3 and 3.5 percent, Gopinath said. ""There are no simple answers on how Africa can build cohesive and peaceful institutions when there is much reliance on natural resources,"" said Gopinath. But governments and the public can start by taking the little steps that boost peacebuilding, like weeding out corruption, xenophobia, and promoting environmental protection, says Muigai, who has been a climate activist for over a year. For instance, the Grade 11 student at Aga Khan Academy in Nairobi stopped eating beef when research she was conducting for a school project indicated that the beef industry is a large contributor towards greenhouse gas emissions and deforestation in some areas in the world. Her insights echo SDG Goal 16, a section of which states that ""peace, stability, human rights and effective governance based on the rule of law are important conduits for sustainable development"", which goes on to state that ""high levels of armed violence and insecurity have a destructive impact on a country's development, affecting economic growth and often resulting in long standing grievances among communities that can last for generations"". Those generations could represent young climate change activists like Muigai. And the young activists have the support of veteran musicians like Nairobi-based Kombo Chokwe Burns who signs about the importance of good governance and environmental protection. When he started singing, producing, arranging and writing music more than a decade ago, he knew that the line about armed violence and insecurity would inform the need for peaceful foundations in the continent. In 2013, he travelled to Somalia his group Afro Simba to perform for a peace festival, meant to help the youth there understand that violence is not good for African societies. While there, he found out that lack of education, religious radicalism, poor leadership, corruption and decaying moral values were some of the leading causes of conflict among the young generation in the continent. Feeling that growth opportunities have been denied to them unfairly, the young generation will put aside moral values and follow the examples of their leaders, hence falling into the trap of radicalization, said Burns. ""How do we nurture the generation that is coming? They know you need to steal and make quick money for people to love you. They will do that and tell you they are doing it because people in government also steal,"" says Kombo. Still, communities, especially those living in rural areas are forced to fight over resources because climate change has worsened livelihoods already struggling to come out of the poverty grip, says Muigai. ""People care a lot about money instead of what the future generation is going to have. We need policies both at the school and government level. We should understand that even little efforts collectively could create a big change in terms of building peace in Africa."" These little efforts, especially the ones that mitigate the impacts of climate change, seem to be working where they have been established in some African countries, according to Arif Neky, Senior Advisor for UN Strategic Partnerships and Coordinator of the SDG Partnership Platform (SDGPP) in Kenya. For instance, his office, working with leaders and other partners has created a cross border integrated programme between Kenya and Ethiopia which has so far shown great promise of reducing conflict over water and pasture. Around the Karamojong area, the office has also persuaded the Kenya and Uganda heads of states to sign a cross border programme aimed at peace building, promoting livelihoods and economic growth opportunities, says Neky. According to him, the cross-border programmes aim to provide a stimulus for development, identify water and land management opportunities; identify opportunities for strengthening peace committees and community engagement between neighboring countries. ""When there is no development there is no peace and when there is no peace there is no development. It becomes a vicious cycle. But this cycle can be broken if we can identify opportunities for strengthening peace committees and community engagement,"" said Neky, during Kenya's national agriculture summit in Nairobi. But Mulat Demeke, senior policy officer at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, is not convinced that cross-border programmes alone can help Africa achieve its peacebuilding agenda. Instead, he says, African governments should invest more in agriculture to boost the continent's food security basket by allocating 10 percent of their budgets to the agricultural sector as required by the Malabo Declaration. According to Demeke, for every US dollar invested in agriculture, it can yield more than three of them to the GDP. This translates to about 63 percent of returns in agriculture every year. However, only Rwanda has crossed the halfway mark of the Malabo target with a 6.1 score, according to the 2017 Malabo Biennial report, which was released in January 2018. ""A healthy nation is a peaceful nation. African governments can help build peaceful coexistent among their people by investing more in agriculture,"" says Demeke. According to data posted by the World Bank in 2018, violent conflict adversely affects a country's economic progress and costs growing economies like Africa between 2.0 percent and 8.4 percent loss in annual GDP. While countries that border conflict zones also suffer by posting a 1.4 percentage point decline in annual GPD, they also experience a 1.7 percentage point rise in inflation. By 2016, the World Bank says, the cost of maintaining peacekeeping missions in the field cost almost US$ 8 billion every year. Still, development aid spent in donor countries on refugees doubled between 2014 and 2015, and increased six fold since 2010. Muigai says that the average person in Africa does care about the environment and climate change. But there could be many reasons why they do not take action, like perhaps, not knowing much about the subject. But that should not be an excuse not to take action because Africa is at the forefront of the negative impacts of climate change, and will greatly impact the whole continent, the 17-year-old climate activist says.

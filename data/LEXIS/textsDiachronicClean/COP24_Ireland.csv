"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland1","Many issues still undecided on last day of COP24","December 14, 2018 Friday 8:18 PM GMT","RTE News","After two weeks of haggling negotiators at the COP24 climate talks in Katowice in Poland entered their last scheduled day with many issues still undecided. At issue is the precise rule book for how the Paris Climate Change Agreement agreed three years ago will be implemented, including how a country's emissions and commitments are to be measured and interpreted. There are also big arguments to be resolved about where the $100bn per year of climate finance promised by richer developed countries is to come from. With the United States pulling out of the Paris accord that issue of climate finance is now proving very difficult to resolve. The third main issue at stake is how to ensure that nations ratchet up their commitment to take action to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. This was made particularly urgent by the publication of the IPCC report on the impact of 1.5 degrees of warming two months ago. This showed that hundreds of millions of people and countless species face climate devastation if global warming is not contained to 1.5 degrees and also that greenhouse gas emissions need to be reduced three times faster than previously expected. There is a growing expectation that the negotiations in Poland, which are due to finish later today, could yet spill over into the weekend. Sources close to the COP24 talks said that delegates from nearly 200 nations were still far apart on several issues, from adopting the latest environmental science to how future climate action is funded. The Conference of the Parties (COP) is the supreme body of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). \"
"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland2","ESB subsidiary coal contract in the Phillippines criticised","December 13, 2018 Thursday","The Irish Times","The Government should cancel a 10 -year contract won by ESB International to run a new coal-fired electricity power station in the Philippines, environmental campaigners have demanded. The ESB subsidiary signed a contract last December with the Philippines' largest electricity supplier, Manila Electric Company, to run the Atimonan power, once it is built in Quezon province. However, environmental campaigners, speaking on the margins of a major United Nations climate change conference in Katowice in Poland, are now lobbying Dublin to back away from the deal. The Government should cancel the contract since Ireland is a member of the international ""Power Past Coal"" alliance, which pledges to stop burning coal for electricity. The Atimonan project is being fought by a range of civil-society organisations in the Philippines, which remains committed to coal-burning even it is suffering the detrimental effects of climate change. ""We cannot allow our communities to suffer from the double whammy of coal-fired power plant projects that come in the form of negative health and environmental impacts,"" said Ian Rivera of the Philippine Movement for Climate Justice, who is attending the UN climate conference in Katowice, Poland. Clean power generation In a letter this week to Minister for Climate Action and Environment Richard Bruton, he urged the Government to honour its commitment to phase out unabated coal power generation and to support clean power generation through its policies. Part of Ireland's commitment to climate action and decarbonisation is the planned shutdown of the Moneypoint coal-burning plant by 2025, said Ian Lumley of An Taisce. ""However, ESB International, a State-owned company subsidiary under the Minister's direct control, is providing the engineering and project-management services for a new 1,200 megawatt coal-fired power plant in the Philippines,"" he said. ""The damage caused by this proposed project is undermining international solidarity on climate action and decarbonisation of energy eclipses the increased climate funding announced [at the UN summit] by the Minister"", said Mr Lumley, who also attending the COP24 conference. Mr Bruton said he was not aware of the project, its context and the extent of involvement by ESB International. The decision to build the Atimonan power plant and its fuel mix in the Philippines would be made by the Philippine authorities, an ESB spokeswoman said. ""ESB International does not have any influence or input in those decisions."" ESB International agreed the contract in 2017 to operate and manage the power plant on behalf of Meralco PowerGen Corporation, she confirmed. \"
"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland3","Difficult end to first week of COP24 negotiations","December 10, 2018 Monday","The Irish Times","Four big oil and gas producer states have attempted to block the UN climate talks in Poland from welcoming the most stark climate science report in years, marking a difficult end to the first week of negotiations. The COP24 The response met with a backlash from a broad range of other rich countries, as well as poor and developing ones. The standoff was over whether to ""note"" or ""welcome"" the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report published in October. Saudi Arabia, the US, Kuwait and Russia wanted the final statement to merely ""note"" the report on the effects of a 1.5-degree rise in the global temperatures, which warned of climate chaos in less than 20 years unless more meaningful decarbonisation was pursued. An alliance of small island states pushed to ""welcome"" the findings. The standoff arose during a long plenary session on Saturday, at the end of which negotiators were still aiming to have simplified a draft for high-level ministerial debate starting today. ""We still have a lot to do,"" Michal Kurtyka, Polish president of the COP24 , told a news conference. ""It is very technical, very complex, very difficult."" Delegates continued to flag another major outstanding issue: how to reassure developing countries that richer nations would deliver on promises to help finance the cost of shifting to a lower-carbon economy. Environmental campaigners and NGOs are concerned the talks outcome will lack ambition in the wake of the planned withdrawal by the US from the Paris agreement, as an increasing number of countries who have fossil fuels at the heart of their economies are failing to scale up ambition as required under the pact. ""It's a question of 'who wins' - the likes of the EU and China, with economies deeply invested in climate action and dependent on multilateralism for global trade, or the likes of Saudi dissenters on climate science, with vested interests that put us all in the firing line?"" said Camilla Born, senior policy advisor with E3G, a non-governmental organisation. The plenary chair's attempt to find a compromise fell flat, setting the scene for a larger political row when ministers arrive in Katowice. Earlier, Africa stood firm as UN officials tried to finalise a draft of the rules that will govern the agreement. ""You can't bully Africa, it's 54 countries,"" one negotiator said. These obvious issues will mean new proposals could come this week for consideration. On the streets of Katowice, the capital of Poland's Silesian coal-mining region, hundreds of demonstrators marched to demand a global deal to limit temperature rises to no more than 1.5 degrees. School striker Swedish teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, who sat outside her country's parliament when on ""strike"" from school in September in an attempt to get politicians to act, and self-described ""recovering climate negotiator"" Yeb Sa\'f1o - now director of Greenpeace Southeast Asia - addressed the gathering in Plac Wolnosci. The demonstration stayed upbeat in the face of a large presence of police with riot shields and a water cannon. Many delegates in Katowice have stressed the French yellow vests protests were unrelated to the UN climate debate, but US president Donald Trump seized on the protests to call for an end to ""the ridiculous and extremely expensive Paris Agreement"". Tensions are expected to be further heightened tonight, when the small US delegation is due to stage a side event promoting fossil fuels as part of the solution to global warming. The title of the briefing is ""US innovative technologies spur economic dynamism"". The US State Department said it was meant to showcase ways to use fossil fuels as cleanly and efficiently as possible, as well as the use of emission-free nuclear energy. Last year the delegation gave a pro-coal presentation. ""It is beyond absurd for the administration to sponsor an international event purporting to discuss ways to use fossil fuels as cleanly as possible"" while attempting to cut Obama-era rules to make fossil-fuel use less polluting, World Resources Institute director Dan Lashof told the Washington Post . Meanwhile, leading climate campaign group 350.org has outlined its ""deep concern"" that increasing numbers of colleagues, volunteers and climate activists attempting to attend the talks are being denied entry and/or deported. ""There are currently at least 15 members of civil society groups that were due to attend, who are being held at the borders or who have been removed. They are from Ukraine, Germany, Belgium and Kyrgyzstan,"" said spokeswoman Svitlana Romanko.- Additional reporting: Reuters \"
"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland4","A stark, eloquent challenge to all; David Attenborough at COP24","December 8, 2018 Saturday","The Irish Times","'Right now, we are facing a man-made disaster of global scale. Our greatest threat in thousands of years. Climate change. If we don't take action the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon Leaders of the world, you must lead. The continuation of our civilisations and the natural world upon which we depend, is in your hands."" David Attenborough's speech to the COP24 climate change conference in the Polish city of Katowice this week starkly and eloquently dramatises the challenge facing humanity from climate change. It falls to this generation and its leaders to take the necessary action to mitigate and reverse the damage already done. We must also find new ways to care for the natural world and humanity's place in it. Unless this message gets through to ordinary people and leaders alike we face breakdown in our ways of living, according to the best scientific research and advice available to this United Nations gathering and the global process it represents. For progress to be made these threats must be communicated accurately and repeatedly to bring them into popular consciousness and prepare for the radical action required. Attenborough spoke on behalf of the public in Katowice as part of an agreed programme to include civil society in the UN process. He publicised the new online ActNow.Bot urging individual action to reduce our carbon footprint, such as taking public transport and eating less meat. Many people feel overwhelmed and immobilised by the scale of the challenge. That is why it is so important that individual action to tackle it be linked to collective action and political leadership. It needs a message of hope and enablement that it can be overcome. We have the technology and knowledge to make that transition but lack the political will and public support to take the action needed. If that will and support are to be found individuals and peoples must be assured the transition to a carbon-free world will be just and fair. Those most vulnerable are among the poorest and most marginal communities and states in the world who are least responsible for producing greenhouse gases. Responsibility rests overwhelmingly with the richest and most privileged minorities in the world - within and between all the states party to the UN climate change process. The rejection of fuel-price increases by the gilets jaunes movement in France dramatises fairness in tackling this question and has implications throughout the world. Attenborough should be thanked for putting the existential challenge facing humanity so simply and well. We need many more such warnings if we are to find the will and resources to prevent our civilisations collapsing and our natural world being destroyed by the breakdown of our climate. \"
"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland5","Climate change threatens collapse of civilisation, UN conference told; Attenborough calls on world leaders at COP24 in Katowice to 'act now'","December 4, 2018 Tuesday","The Irish Times","The collapse of civilisation and extinction of much of the natural world is ""on the horizon"" due to climate change, Sir David Attenborough declared at the opening day of UN climate talks in Poland. The naturalist and TV presenter called on global leaders and decision-makers, who have gathered in Katowice for the COP24 conference, to take charge on driving down greenhouse gas emissions as climate change was the greatest threat facing the world ""in thousands of years"". ""The world's people have spoken, their message is clear, time is running out, they want you, the decision-makers, to act now. They're supporting you in making tough decisions but they're also willing to make sacrifices in their daily lives,"" he added. 'You must lead' Sir David was speaking on behalf of the UN's ""People's Seat"" initiative to give ordinary people a voice at the international talks by gathering their thoughts, ideas and concerns through social media. He endorsed the ""ActNow.bot"" which helps people discover simple everyday actions they can take to tackle climate change. ""The people have spoken: leaders of the world, you must lead, the continuation of our civilisations and the natural world upon which we depend are in your hands,"" he added. UN secretary general Antonio Guterres warned negotiators at the meeting that the world was in deep trouble. ""Climate change is running faster than we are and we must catch up sooner rather than later, before it's too late. For many people, regions and even countries, this is already a matter of life and death,"" he said. Climate action was not just the right thing to do, it made social and economic sense, Mr Guterres said, pointing to how action to cut emissions would curb air pollution deaths, generate millions of jobs and trillions of dollars. Mr Guterres said he had four simple messages: Minister for Climate Action and Environment Richard Bruton, who attended the opening session, said: ""The decisions we take now will define the next century. I recently received Government approval to develop an all-of-government plan to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change."" Ireland was fully committed to the implementation of the Paris Agreement, he added. ""Over the next two weeks, we will work with countries all over the world to put together a rule book to make sure we all fulfil our commitments. We also look forward to . . . getting an honest evaluation of our climate efforts to date. We need to be honest with where we are at so that we get to where we need to be,"" Mr Bruton said. Financing The World Bank announced it is doubling investments in climate action with $200 billion for 2021-2025, including $50 billion towards helping countries adapt to the impacts of global warming. World Bank president Jim Yong Kim said the poorest and most vulnerable people were at the greatest risk, and urged other financial institutions to follow its lead. Following Brazil's recent withdrawal as host for COP25, a spokeswoman for Mr Bruton said it would be relocated to a country in South America, as was required under UN rules. As to the possibility of Ireland hosting a COP, she said it was due to be staged in western Europe in 2020 but a conversation had yet to be had on where it would be staged. - Additional reporting Guardian \"
"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland6","COP24 rulebook agreed in Katowice How will countries implement Paris?","December 17, 2018 Monday","The Irish Times","The Katowice summit has yielded a common rulebook that will apply across the world on implementing the historic Paris Agreement on climate change, including greater transparency on efforts to reduce carbon emissions contributing to global warming. Parties agreed to revise and enhance their commitments in the form of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) before 2020, according to the 156-page rulebook. They must outline mitigation and adaptation measures as well as details of financial support for climate action in developing countries. Parties agreed how to undertake a 'global stocktake' of the effectiveness of climate action in 2023, and how to assess progress. Discussions on robust measures to ensure that countries are held to proper standards and find it harder to wriggle out of commitments dominated the final stages. As current pledges are not enough to limit warming to 1.5 degrees and to achieve the pact's goals, countries must commit to greater levels of climate action and support and follow through on those commitments. The final text omits a previous reference to specific reductions in emissions by 2030, and merely welcomes the 'timely completion' of the IPCC report; not its conclusions. nCLIMATE FINANCE A delicate balance was struck between concerns of the smallest, poorest and most vulnerable countries; the developed nations most responsible for global warming and the emerging economies wary of being saddled with a bigger burden. A process for establishing new targets on finance from 2025 onwards to follow-on from the current target of mobilising $100 billion per year from 2020 to support developing countries was agreed. The text urges developed-country parties to channel more grant-based resources for adaptation to climate change as against loans. There is some acknowledgment of the long-standing ""loss and damage"" issue; notably how to provide financial support to countries whose economies are too vulnerable to cope with the impact of climate change. Critical to this is how to finance and compensate losses and damages that have already occurred and are irreversible. \"

He said: ""Halting and reversing land degradation and tropical deforestation could provide up to 30% of the climate change solution."" Mr Elvestuen told the Oslo Tropical Forest Forum that the partnership includes Interpol, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and a UN-supported centre combating illegal deforestation.

"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland8","To tackle climate change, start by ending overfishing","December 20, 2018 Thursday","Irish Independent","commitment to the climate and the ocean goes beyond greenhouse gas emissions. Michael Creed has presided over fishing limits that have continued overfishing to Ireland's ""benefit"". This has typically been celebrated as a ""win"" for Ireland after theatrically long negotiations in Brussels. Just two weeks ago, Mr Creed celebrated an agreement on mackerel, claiming it reflected ""the scientific advice"". The agreement reached is to catch 653,438 tonnes in 2019, whereas the scientific advice was to catch no more than 318,403 tonnes. This is overfishing; and it is putting unnecessary pressure on the ocean. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates ""33.1pc (of fish stocks globally) are being fished at biologically unsustainable levels"". In 2013, during Ireland's presidency of the EU, member states committed to ending overfishing by 2015, ""where possible, and by 2020 at the latest"". So while Ireland was trying to recover its reputation on climate change in Katowice, the rubber meets the road as Mr Creed is representing us at the Fisheries Council in Brussels. Any decision to continue overfishing in 2019 by ministers will not only minimise the chances of realising the 2020 Common Fisheries Policy commitment, it will be another needless assault on the health of the ocean and the long-term viability of coastal communities. As the 2020 deadline approaches, there has been some reduction, but not enough. According to the New Economics Foundation's 'Landing the Blame: Overfishing in the Atlantic 2018', the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) awarded to Ireland was 17.8pc above scientific advice. In other words, it is overfishing. Mike Walker is a consultant for Our Fish, which works to end overfishing and wasteful discarding in Europe Since taking over from Simon Coveney as the minister with responsibility for fisheries, THE ocean is incredible: not only is it the origin of all life, it stores the most carbon, regulates the climate and provides us with every second breath. It is estimated the ocean has absorbed over 90pc of human-induced global warming; without it, the global temperature would have already increased by more than 30C. A staggering fact, given the risks associated with just a 2C increase. The ocean provides food and livelihoods for billions of people around the world, and if it were an economy, it is estimated that it would be the seventh largest. The value of the ocean to the Irish economy was estimated at (EURO)1.97bn in 2017, but as an island nation, the value to our culture and well-being is priceless. The ocean is an incredibly rich and dynamic ecosystem, about which we still know comparatively little - more people have been to the moon than to the deepest part of the ocean. One thing we do know is that if our exploitation is carefully managed, then the ocean can sustain countless benefits. But this is not our track record: pollution, overexploitation, acidification and marine litter are just a few of the ways we have been putting the ocean under pressure. In September 2019, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will publish its 'Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate', which is expected to make explicit the critical role of the ocean with regard to climate and the pressure we are putting it under. On Saturday, after two weeks of negotiations, COP24 - the United Nations Climate Change Conference - concluded in Katowice, Poland. Ireland, along with other states, were negotiating renewed climate pledges, or Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), this despite the fact Ireland is currently the worst-performing EU member state on responding to climate change. We have much to do - but our commitment to the climate and the ocean goes beyond greenhouse gas emissions. Overfishing - catching more fish than can be naturally replaced - has the greatest single negative impact on the ocean. Some 90pc of the big fish in the ocean have gone since 1950 - we have simply eaten them. And despite EU member states agreeing to an ambitious reform of the Common Fisheries Policy in 2013, the appetite for EU overfishing has continued. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates ""33.1pc (of fish stocks globally) are being fished at biologically unsustainable levels"". In 2013, during Ireland's presidency of the EU, member states committed to ending overfishing by 2015, ""where possible, and by 2020 at the latest"".

"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland9","Forget about the bigger picture - we can cut down on plastic","December 8, 2018 Saturday","Irish Independent","ometimes when you're trying to win an argument, change minds and, apparently, save the planet, you need to bring out the big guns. s. You can introduce all the new taxes you want but you'll just annoy those who are already struggling and don't appreciate what little money they have being sacrificed on the altar of a fashionable obsession. Speaking at the United Nations Climate Change conference in Katowice the other day, broadcaster Attenborough (92) spoke on behalf of the UN's so-called 'People's Seat', an initiative designed to give so called 'ordinary people' a voice when it comes to expressing concern about the damage that's being caused by greenhouse gas emissions. His words seem to have had a more galvanising effect than any of the hot air emitted by all our politicians and green campaigners. According to the renowned naturalist: ""If we don't take action, the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon. The world's people have spoken, their message is clear, time is running out, they want you, the decision-makers, to act now. They're supporting you in making tough decisions but they're also willing to make sacrifices in their daily lives."" For a speech that has been hailed as a sort of Gettysburg Address for climate change, it was rather presumptuous to claim to speak for the 'world's people' - after all, there are more than seven billion of us on the planet. Attenborough gets a free pass on these issues for the simple reason that people like him. In a culture where people now seem to be controlled by their feelings rather than being in control of them, such emoting from a popular public figure was always going to make a bigger mark than, for instance, our own 'climate action' Minister, Richard Bruton, who has been dutifully singing from the UN's hymn sheet this week. As ever when it comes to politicians, Bruton's statements can be translated as a simple declaration that 'we are going to bring in new taxes.' That climate change should have become such a controversial political hot potato is largely down to the campaigners themselves. For more than two decades now, we have been issued with dire and apocalyptic warnings of impending doom which simply haven't come true. When Attenborough spoke, people listened. When Bruton spoke, people just tuned out. Only a fool would deny that climate change is happening, and only an even bigger fool would assume that man has nothing to do with it - you can't pump billions of tonnes of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere and expect no reaction. But the rank hypocrisy of so many of the leading campaigners, particularly politicians and bored celebrities looking for their latest fashionable cause, has ensured that millions of people simply ignore the whole conversation. For example, Bernie Sanders recently said that: ""Climate change is real, it is caused by human activity, and it is already causing devastating harm here in the United States and to people all around the globe."" That's the kind of double-standard guaranteed to make people roll their eyes and adds fuel to the suspicion that the whole thing is just a big con. It's not, of course. But as long as China opens new coal mines every week and as long as the most obvious solution to the problem - nuclear power - is dismissed by the very people who say the sky is falling, then it's hard to take all the posturing seriously. The truth is that when it comes to the big picture, there is very little we can do as individuals. But that doesn't mean we have no control over the impact we make on the environment. We're now heading into the Christmas shopping-frenzy period. This year is going to see the largest increase in consumer spending in a decade and we all know that means - more plastic. As much damage as we have done to the air we breathe, we have also caused incalculable damage to our oceans with discarded plastic, which takes thousands of years to degrade. It's estimated that up to 12 million tonnes of plastic enter the oceans every year and as anyone who saw the recent story of the dead whale discovered to have a stomach full of plastic will know, we are now killing our fellow creatures in ever more new and horrible ways. Numerous Irish companies now offer plastic-free packaging, and the proposed 'plastic tax' is one of the few taxes that makes sense. We know it works because we have seen it work before when the levy on plastic bags was introduced and had an immediate impact - it's now rare to see the once common sight of hedgerows festooned with bags, because people now use multi-use ones. If there's nothing much we can do about the broader environment, we can control our own, local environment and a small commitment to limit the amount of plastic you use will actually have a direct and positive impact. It's estimated that up to 12 million tonnes of plastic enter the oceans every year and we are now killing our fellow creatures in ever more new and horrible ways ; \"

The funds will also support efforts to ensure climate actions are gender-responsive and support the IPCC. Jennifer Higgins, policy and advocacy advisor at Christian Aid Ireland, said Ireland needs to ensure the outcome of the UN COP24 talks puts human rights at the heart of the global response to climate change. ""It is worrying that we are seeing an attempt by some countries to water down, or remove human rights language from the final text we will see at the end of this COP,"" she said.

Everything needs to change. And it has to start today."" Those were the words of 16-year-old Greta Thunberg in her speech at TEDXSTOCKHOLM last November. Several months earlier, as the country prepared for elections, she decided to strike outside the Swedish Parliament building to call on the government to take a radical response to climate change. Her actions attracted worldwide attention and have since inspired students across the globe to raise their own voices. Since the election, Greta has taken part in school strikes every Friday. She also addressed the United Nations Climate Change Conference last year, and in January 2019 she was invited to talk to the World Economic Forum at Davos. Time magazine named her as one of the world's most influential teenagers in 2018. Greta's activism has inspired the Fridays for Future movement, which sees students skip school each Friday in protest against government inaction towards climate change. Underlying the movement are some striking questions, as stated on their official website. ""Why study for a future, which may not be there?"" ""Why spend a lot of effort to become educated, when our governments are not listening to the educated?"" While the movement is predominantly studentled, many adults including parents, grandparents and teachers have also taken part. This wave of youth activism is gathering momentum. On Friday, a worldwide protest will see students from at least 57 countries strike from school to demand action from their respective governments. On the Fridays for Future website, 490 events around the world have already been registered. Thousands of Irish students are expected to take part, with events already registered for Dublin, Cork, Kerry, Limerick and Kildare. Many schools and parents are backing the action. Over 60 schools nationwide have signed up to participate on March 15. The rapid spread of Greta's message has been aided by the use of social media. Indeed, young people are mobilising their peers through mediums such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. The trending hashtags #FRIDAYSFORFUTURE and #Climatestrike have connected activists of all ages around the globe. The internet is also providing young people with access to scientific resources on climate change, allowing them to educate themselves on a topic which many say is not often mentioned in the classroom. ""I think that if a few children can make headlines across the world just by not going to school for a few weeks, imagine what we could do together if we wanted to?"" said Greta in her Stockholm talk. With more and more young people joining the movement each week, only time will tell what they can achieve. Amy Lewis \"

""It has been a long road. We did our best to leave no one behind,"" said COP24 President Michal Kurtyka before gavelling through the hard-won package of decisions after 13 days of gruelling negotiations.

""We continue to witness an irresponsible divide between the vulnerable island states and impoverished countries pitted against those who would block climate action or who are immorally failing to act fast enough,"" executive director of Greenpeace Jennifer Morgan said. The final decision text was repeatedly delayed as negotiators sought guidelines that are effective in warding off the worst threats posed by our heating planet while protecting the economies of rich and poor nations alike. ""Without a clear rulebook, we won't see how countries are tracking, whether they are actually doing what they say they are doing,"" Canada's Environment Minister Catherine McKenna said. At their heart, negotiations were about how each nation funds action to mitigate and adapt to climate change, as well as how those actions are reported. Developing nations wanted more clarity from richer ones over how the future climate fight will be funded and pushed for so-called ""loss and damage"" measures. \"
"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland13","Our total greed for consumer goods fans the flames of climate change","December 4, 2018 Tuesday","Irish Independent","WHILE the largest economies in the world, bar the US, come to some sort of agreement on global warming, should we as consumers take some responsibility for what's happening? The idea that Ireland alone is responsible for increases in emissions, because of our cattle herd burping, is a little bit disingenuous and allows our greener-than-green parties to further their own agendas. Fossil fuels and industrial processes account for nearly two-thirds, or 65pc, of our global emissions, while methane is only a fraction of this. In Poland, the COP24 climate talks are taking place. Poland itself is reliant on coal to keep its economy going and more than 90,000 employees at work. It is the biggest producer in Europe. The EU's plan to cut carbon emissions by 40pc by 2030 is ambitious, and to net zero by 2050 is aspirational, to say the least. Eurostat greenhouse gas emissions statistics show that emissions have dropped considerably, by 22pc, from 1990 to 2016. While countries within the EU are doing their bit, larger economies like the US, China and India are not governed by the same rules. We as consumers must realise that our hunger for consumer goods, whether online or at our local retail store, has contributed largely to the increase in carbon emissions. We don't see the exploitation of children or people in Third World countries, in sweat factories, or the pollutants that spill into their rivers. We ignore the large factories in China, India or Eastern European countries, where fossil fuels are used 24/7 to keep these factories and businesses going. Our endless appetite for new brands of clothing and electronic equipment and our demand for the latest versions of both is one of the root causes of this increase in global emissions. We must make this world a better and safer place to live in for generations to come. Our endless need for consumer goods may satisfy our cravings in the short-term, but what damage to nature have we caused by this endless greed? Christy Galligan Letterkenny, Co Donegal \"
"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland14","It's our duty to save our planet and Greta is leading by example","April 13, 2019","Kerryman (Ireland)","The name and the face have turned up on a number of occasions. I think the first time I heard her name mentioned was by President Donald Trump. He was jeering her and questioning how a teenager could have such strong opinions. Then I heard her name mentioned in the context of Irish school children staging a strike to protect our environment. Dermot A Lane is a priest of the Dublin archdiocese. He has been involved in academia most of his life, was parish priest in Balally in Dublin. These days he is placing much emphasis on ecology and the importance of caring for all of God's creation. At the end of March, I went along to a talk he gave on the environment and the need for dialogue between science and theology. And whose name pops up yet again? Greta Thunberg. Whereas Donald Trump dismissed her as a silly young girl, Dermot Lane sang her praises. Greta Thunberg is the 16-year-old Swedish schoolgirl, who has hit the world stage speaking clearly and convincingly about the climate crisis. It is Greta who started the first school strike pleading with adults and political leaders to address the crisis. She has addressed the United Nations Climate Change Conference and at the World Economic Forum at Davos in January she told world leaders that she did not want their hope, 'I want you to panic. I want you to act as if the house was on fire because it is.' Dermot Lane is a big fan of Greta. In the talk that I attended he pointed out that there is a 98 per cent agreement among scientists that climate change is manmade and that we have 10 years to change it. He was most critical of the Irish Government reneging on the commitment it gave when signing up to the Paris Climate Agreement. It is generally accepted that we are the laggards of Europe when it comes to protecting our climate Dermot Lane referred to President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement but was heartened to see how mayors in many US cities have decided to keep to the agreement. 'There is a silver lining in President Trump's decision as it has strengthened the resolve of many authorities in the US to abide by the resolutions decided at the Paris Climate Conference,' Dermot explained. Climate change affects everyone but hurts the poor most of all. Cyclone Idai, which hit Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe last month severely affected the lives of two million people. And these are the poorest of the poor on our planet, who have contributed least to causing climate change in the first place. Having spent 10 years working with Concern Worldwide I've seen first-hand how climate change is causing such hardship to the weakest and the most fragile on earth. Pope Francis in his encyclical letter 'Laudato Si'/ 'Praised Be' writes: 'Many things have to change course, but it is we human beings above all who need to change. A great cultural, spiritual and educational challenge stands before us, and it will demand that we set out on the long path of renewal.' Pope Francis reminds us how the Book of Genesis suggests that human life is grounded in three closely intertwined relationships: with God, our neighbour and with the earth itself. Mary Robinson is correct when she calls Greta Thunberg a 'superstar' and insists the time for action is now. Political leaders, industry, you and I are duty-bound to save our planet. \"
"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland15","Problem of making Paris accord stick dominates UN climate summit","December 12, 2018 Wednesday","The Irish Times","Negotiations at the UN summit in Poland, now entering their final political phase, continue to be dominated by issues around the strictness of a rulebook to bring the landmark Paris agreement on climate change to life. In addition, there are lingering issues about the standing of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, published in October, which warned the world was off course in trying to keep global temperature rise within 1.5 degrees. The US and other big oil- and gas-producing countries refused to welcome its findings in a heated COP24 ""The fact that a group of four countries were trying to diminish the value and importance of a scientific report they themselves, with all other countries, requested three years ago in Paris is pretty remarkable,"" said Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists. US State Department negotiators, however, remain deeply engaged in talks on the future of the Paris deal, a source directly involved in the negotiations told The Irish Times . ""I cannot say they are being obstructive,"" he added. Others indicated there is a US push for a deal on climate rules that president Donald Trump or his successor would be able to swallow. More tangible progress has been made under the ""Talanoa Dialogue""; a process designed to help countries implement and enhance their ""nationally determined contributions"" by 2020. It is expected to conclude and feature prominently in a final declaration at the weekend. Sharing stories The dialogue, initiated last year, seeks to break the climate deadlock by drawing participants closer together through sharing their stories of climate change. Governments, civil society, NGOs, businesses, cities and others were invited to respond to questions: ""Where are we now? How do we want to go? How do we get there?"" It is expected that it will be presented to the UN General Assembly, because of its significance in light of the UN sustainable development goals, according to a lead negotiator. ""Loss and damage"" arising from climate change was the outstanding issue highlighted by least developed states and small island countries - specifically how to provide financial support to countries whose economies are too vulnerable to cope with the impact of climate change. A particular difficulty is compensating for losses and damages that already occur and are irreversible. The task facing the COP24 was underlined by a report issued yesterday that showed average world temperatures are on course to far exceed the main goal set in the 2015 Paris Agreement on limiting global warming. The overshoot by the end of this century, however, could be less severe than expected thanks to significant efforts by some countries to combat climate change, according to Climate Action Tracker (CAT) - a consortium of three independent European research groups. Progress The CAT report highlighted progress since 2015, but current policies meant the world was heading for warming of 3.3 degrees, compared with 3.4 degrees it predicted a year ago. ""We have yet to see this translate into action in terms of what governments are prepared to put on the table,"" said Bill Hare, chief executive of Climate Analytics, one of the three CAT research groups. Since the Paris accord, countries including Argentina, Canada, Chile and India, plus the EU are moving in the right direction towards cutting emissions. \"
"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland16","Climate summit lacked urgency and ambition","December 17, 2018 Monday","The Irish Times","The backdrop coming into the UN annual climate summit was dire; from where the world is at in responding to global warming to scientific indications of how climate breakdown looms on the horizon. Three years after the optimism of Paris, the world was in a darker place having reached a point where most of its 7.6 billion people are probably aware by now of the risks they face from climate change due to more severe and more frequent floods, droughts and wildfires. Global carbon emissions are on the rise, especially in the US and China, the world's largest economies - with evidence of other countries backsliding on their commitments under the historic 2015 Paris Agreement. All that did not help the mood. As politicians and diplomats met in Katowice, Poland, seeking to sign off on a guidebook to bring the deal into effect from 2020, the days of commitments under the agreement being only as good as the willingness of national leaders to keep their word were due to come to an end. If that is delivered on in the next two short years based on what was agreed, COP24 can then be considered a success. Low point The end of the first week was a low point marked by a political stalemate when big oil and gas producer countries led by the US and Saudi Arabia refused to ""welcome"" the latest findings of the UN's climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change. IPCC chairman Hoesung Lee was to later to underline its significance; that the temperature goal (containing global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees) is achievable ""but that this can only happen if governments take urgent and far-reaching action in all aspects of society, with many implications for policymaking"". UN general-secretary Ant\'f3nio Guterres attempted to reset the agenda going into the final days: ""To waste this opportunity in Katowice would compromise our last best chance to stop runaway climate change. It would not only be immoral, it would be suicidal."" Critical issues By the last official day of negotiations, there was still no resolution in sight for critical issues such as financing for developing countries' climate efforts - though some progress on this was achieved by close of business. But an obvious alliance between the EU and China (especially on having a common rulebook) was coming good in getting a deal of significance over the line. While an earlier side meeting with US officials delivering the usual pro-coal line from Trump-generated headlines, concerns that the US would be hostile in the negotiation rooms proved mostly unfounded - the state department was a constructive force. Beside China, the US oversaw the drafting of the rules governing transparency, a central aspect of the rulebook. Ireland consistently supported EU moves to ensure greater transparency and better reporting mechanisms for accounting of national greenhouse gas commitments.The Republic did not join the 27 countries who have formed the Coalition for Higher Ambition, who committed to scaling up commitments in line to Paris targets during the COP. Minister for Climate Action Richard Bruton flagged to NGOs in Katowice that Irish climate commitments would be made when he was sure they could be delivered on. There is clearly insufficient progress on persuading countries to make firm commitments to cut their emissions further . COP24 , none the less, has produced a common rulebook after achieving consensus among 195 states. The greater ambition and urgency desperately sought by so many outside the talks remains elusive. \"

During the open day of negotiations at the COP24 gathering in Katowice, Poland, it was the voices of young people that stood out. Their importance in the global response to global warming was underlined by UN secretary general Ant\'f3nio Guterres: ""Our younger generations will have to help drive, and complete, the work we start today. We need to harness their energy, invention and political power to raise climate ambition."" Greta Thunberg began a solo climate protest by striking from school in August. More than 20,000 students around the world have joined her since. The school strikes have spread to at least 270 towns and cities in countries across the world, including Australia, the UK, Belgium, the US and Japan. ""For 25 years countless people have come to the UN climate conferences begging our world leaders to stop emissions and clearly that has not worked as emissions are continuing to rise. So I will not beg the world leaders to care for our future,"" she said. ""I will instead let them know change is coming whether they like it or not."" School strikes The teenager added: ""Since our leaders are behaving like children, we will have to take the responsibility they should have taken long ago,"" she said. ""We have to understand what the older generation has dealt to us, what mess they have created that we have to clean up and live with. We have to make our voices heard."" Also at the summit, Toby Thorpe, a student from Hobart, Tasmania, who took part in recent school strikes in Australia, said: ""We are in this together. Together we are strong and we will not give up."" Indication that major banks are becoming more conscious of their climate obligations were outlined at the talks. ING chief executive Ralph Hamers announced a landmark finance collaboration with BNP Paribas, Standard Chartered, BBVA and Soci\'e9t\'e9 G\'e9n\'e9rale ""to measure the climate alignment of their lending portfolios, with the aim of steering them in line with the Paris Agreement"". The banks have signed a commitment letter, pledging to finance change and put their balance sheets to work on climate projects. Mr Guterres said ""embracing inclusive multilateralism"" was an essential requirement, if the world was to succeed in responding to potential climate breakdown. ""Only global answers can solve global problems. Embracing inclusive multilateralism is the way to go, but it needs to adapt to meet the global challenges we currently face. We now need networked multilateralism,"" he added. Meanwhile, former president of Ireland Mary Robinson underlined the importance of COP24 . ""We're running out of time. It is important to take action now. We must be more ambitious,"" she said. In the Irish context, she acknowledged big changes were happening and there was ""more concern at political level. The Government and political parties are taking the issue more seriously."" There was a long way to catch up, she said, ""but we're on the right track"". Mrs Robinson said there were very tough emissions targets to be met. ""People need to take steps in their own lives.

After a heated debate, the ploy by the US, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to merely ""note"" the landmark UN report published in October shocked delegates at COP24 in Katowice. The four countries rejected a motion on Saturday to ""welcome"" the study, which would have made it much more difficult for governments to ignore.

"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland20","Martina Devlin","December 22, 2018 Saturday","Irish Independent","ERE'S the problem. HAs individuals we can give up our aul' sins: instead, make greater efforts to recycle, insulate our houses, install solar panels, choose public transport and/or bicycles, stop buying single-use plastics and heavily packaged goods. You know the drill. But such changes in behaviour, necessary though they are, represent a drop in our plastics-infested oceans. Political action is what's needed. Political action is what's missing - interventions at national and international levels. Let's start with national. Unfortunately, the Irish Government is on Santa's naughty list because window-dressing alone is not enough. The Government pays lip service to climate justice but has failed to fulfil its own commitments on increasing carbon tax. If it makes just one resolution for 2019 it should be to prioritise decarbonisation policies. The global warming genie is out of its bottle and the window of opportunity for dealing with it is growing ever more narrow as countries prevaricate and hesitate. Nations are sitting on their hands - Ireland included. Apocalyptic warnings from scientists are met with shrugs. Ireland was among countries which signed up to steps curbing global warming as part of 2015's landmark 'Paris Rulebook' agreement. But the situation is escalating and those measures are insufficient to stop carbon pollution reaching critical levels. COP24 , the recent Poland summit notable for its friction, accepted another set of rules. Almost 200 nations participated, Ireland included once again. However, some states continue to dispute the latest climate science, primarily the Trump administration which denies that human activity is endangering the planet by contributing to rising seas, crop failures, extinction in the natural world and extreme weather conditions. Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are also resistant to pollution-cutting pledges, treating climate science like a political football. Boo to those badboys. Oh, wait - we're not too virtuous here in Ireland. Our October Budget failed to include a carbon tax rise, as recommended by the Citizens' Assembly, ESRI and Climate Change Advisory Council. Last year, the Government's own Committee in Budgetary Oversight emphasised use of the fiscal system to support climate change policies. But it's water off a duck's back to the present administration. You'd imagine Ireland wasn't among a host of developed countries burning ever larger quantities of fossil fuels for more than 200 years, thereby increasing the carbon in Earth's atmosphere. It's reached a point where some commentators are claiming the world has left it too late and the planet is already heading for climate catastrophe. On the other hand, there may still be a sliver of time to mitigate the effects of our formerly heedless and now just plain selfish behaviour. A report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says the world has only about 12 years to avoid 1.5 degrees Celsius warming above pre-industrial levels - one of the goals of the Paris Agreement. UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres describes it as an ""ear-splitting wake-up call"". The IPCC says carbon pollution must be cut almost in half by 2030 and reach net zero by mid-century - which would require a fundamental reworking of global energy and transport systems. These summits aim to achieve results by consensus building: a peer-pressure approach encouraging countries to abandon dirty energy sources such as coal, oil and natural gas. Which brings me to Moneypoint, Ireland's largest power station: coal-fired and the State's biggest single emitter of greenhouse gases. How about if our political masters stop kicking the issue down the road and do something about that in 2019? In fact, the Government's best resolution for the coming year would be to set up a cross-party group along the same lines as the excellent Sl\'e1intecare. Call it Climatecare. Its remit should be speedy implementation of procedures that would have a dramatic effect on Ireland's emissions. These could include: closing down the two peat-burning It's reached a point where some commentators are claiming the world has left it too late and the planet is already heading for climate catastrophe stations; converting Moneypoint from coal-burning to natural gas; and ceasing any promotion of wood-burning stoves or boilers which are pollutants. Further, Climatecare should insist all new public transport vehicles are powered by electricity or based on hybrid technology; incentivise owners of trucks, taxis and coaches to do likewise; and hike investment on creating a safer environment for cyclists. Workers who become redundant as a result of any of the above measures must be compensated. The cost is minor when set against huge fines to be levied by the European Union if we fail to meet our commitments. But instead of heeding the unequivocal science, developed countries are wasting time trying to evade their responsibilities. They - we - have an obligation to secure a safe world for future generations. It's no coincidence COP24 was marked by protests from young people, who have most to lose by leaders' inaction. Inspired by a Swedish 15-year-old who called for a global school walkout, dozens of Polish students left the classroom and marched into the conference centre with a sign reading: ""12 years left."" This young generation will not look kindly on today's wishy-washy deal-makers. In Ireland, we can expect flooding to increase, along with coastal erosion, destroying land and buildings. Meanwhile, some in the Irish political system persists in denying human involvement in climate change, while other Flat Earthers around the world question whether it is happening at all. ""If we don't take climate action, the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon,"" David Attenborough warned COP24 delegates. Compelling, you'd have thought. Yet political momentum for international co-operation is sagging. To be fair, the Government is engaged in a number of schemes to encourage energy saving: retro-fitting houses, subsidising electric cars, solar panels and so on. But it's hardly sufficient. Easy to say, of course, that Ireland is a small country and any action we take would have limited impact. However, if we give a lead perhaps others would follow, as with the smoking ban. Finally, humankind is a recent arrival on Earth in terms of its history. The world can manage perfectly well without us. But space exploration notwithstanding, we are incapable of managing without the world. Food for thought at the Christmas table this year, perhaps? We have Sl\'e1intecare, now we ; ; need Climatecare.

The framework is the annual conference of the parties known as the COP; in this case COP24 in Katowice, Poland, which opens today. Governments in climate denial - under-delivery from the committed, and chilling scientific reports confirming the scale of damage to the planet from climate change - have diffused optimism. Vulnerabilities The recent UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report demonstrated the vulnerabilities, impacts and risks of further global warming. This is against a background of record global temperatures, rising emissions, accelerating extreme weather events and time running out to stave off worst-case scenarios. Parties are likely to agree on rules under the agreement; the US excluded. This relates not only to promises by individual states set for 2025 and 2030, but also long-term goals. The view that US president Donald Trump's distinct brand of climate denial can be circumvented by the actions of committed US states and corporations is, however, countered by Institute of International and European Affairs (IIEA) analysis published today that finds the ""Trump effect"" is slowing down the pace of global decarbonisation. Its author, IIEA research fellow Joseph Curtin, warns against downplaying the very real damage caused by it, but also against prematurely drawing defeatist conclusions about the future of the agreement. ""While the agreement may be taking on water, it is a mistake to suggest that it is about to sink, or that all parties are failing to live up to their commitments,"" he said. ""The agreement can resist the Trump effect - it was designed to be resilient - but in the medium and long term it will be weakened unless the factors underpinning President Trump's decision can be addressed in the US."" Fossil fuel US federal regulatory rollbacks have increased the attractiveness of investing in the dirtiest fossil fuel projects globally, while the US withdrawal from the agreement ""has created moral and political cover for others to follow suit"", it adds. Russia and Turkey have abandoned plans to ratify, while Australia has rolled back measures to comply with the agreement. Brazil was due to host COP25 next year but pulled out in recent days, which is being interpreted as a sign of president- elect Jair Bolsonaro's impending war against climate action. US withdrawal has also severely damaged goodwill at international negotiations, ""a vital ingredient for future progress"", the IIEA concludes. It was hoped national efforts to meet Paris pledges would catalyse faster deployment of green technologies, leading to economies of scale, reduced technology costs and positive spillovers all countries could benefit from. ""This was supposed to open up space for parties to take on increasingly robust commitments every five years,"" Curtin adds. Denying the importance of the Trump effect is a mistake, the report concludes, ""but it is also a mistake to suggest the agreement is in crisis, or worse still, that all parties are failing to live up to their commitments"". The EU is determined to ramp up ambition and to be seen as the global leader in climate change. It has unveiled its plan to be the first major economy to go ""climate neutral"" by 2050 - which means any greenhouse gases emitted need to be soaked up by forest growth or new technologies removing carbon from the atmosphere. Combustion engine vehicles are to be phased out and fossil fuels cut to zero. Decarbonisation targets will be much more demanding and reliance on technological solutions more pronounced through ""negative emissions"" technology - essentially use of bioenergy combined with carbon capture and storage. This amounts to an attempt to keep global temperature rise to within 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. It comes with recommendations rather than targets, but it is clear the plan will be a big part of the COP24 agenda. Emissions trajectory Critically for Ireland, it flags more onerous targets when the country is locked into a rising emissions trajectory. In spite of a raft of policy measures adopted to address this, next week's Climate Change Performance Index is likely to confirm our laggard status. Those concerned about lack of concrete actions at a time of great urgency hope the ""Talanoa Dialogue"" adopted at COP23 will compel countries to come forward with pledges to ambitiously increase current mitigation and finance targets, and communicate such improvements by 2020; thus sending a signal to other states to accelerate climate action in spite of patchy progress so far. \"
"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland26","Ambitious action on climate 'will save money and lives'","December 6, 2018 Thursday","Irish Independent","TACKLING climate change will save up to one million lives a year by 2050 by reducing air pollution, the World Health Organisation (WHO) says. A separate report from S&P Global Ratings says it makes economic sense to tackle global warming, highlighting that the 3C warming expected by 2100 unless countries take more ambitious action will cost 2pc of global economic output. More frequent extreme weather caused damage to infrastructure, leading to a lower rate of return on investment, the report said, as well as the effects on worker productivity due to heatwaves. The financial impact of climate change might be underestimated, it added. Meanwhile, a WHO report launched at the UN climate conference in Poland says that more ambitious action will result in better health outcomes across the globe. It says that exposure to air pollution leads to mass fatalities and costs up to (EURO)4.5bn in welfare losses. In the 15 countries with the highest greenhouse gas emissions, health effects are estimated to cost 4pc of GDP. In Ireland, some 1,200 premature deaths occur each year due to air quality issues, but the figure rises to seven million deaths globally, the WHO says. It also suggests that restricting warming to no more than 2C will cost around 1pc of global GDP, suggesting it is cheaper to take action than pay for poorer health outcomes. ""The evidence is clear that climate change is already having a serious impact on human lives and health,"" WHO director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. ""It threatens the basic elements we all need for good health - clean air, safe drinking water, nutritious food supply and safe shelter - and will undermine decades of progress in global health. ""We can't afford to delay action any further."" COP24 special report: health and climate change' says while countries are taking action, the scale of support remains ""woefully inadequate"". \"
"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland27","The hot topic: untangling the knot of how we tackle climate change","December 4, 2018 Tuesday","Irish Independent","ACHIEVING consensus is difficult, never more so than when dealing with almost 200 different parties, all with different priorities. But that is exactly what diplomats and negotiators will attempt to do at the UN climate talks which started yesterday in Katowice, a city in the heart of Poland's rust belt and home to one of Europe's largest coal producers. The stakes are high. In 2015, almost 200 countries signed up to the Paris Climate Accord and pledged to reduce emissions and prevent catastrophic climate change. But how that agreement, which comes into force in 2020, will work - and, crucially, how emissions cuts will be verified, which will be outlined in the so-called 'Paris Rulebook' - will be the subject of discussions running late into the night. Decarbonisation will have a profound impact on places like Katowice, on Middle East oil producers and the US fracking industry, among others. That said, the impacts of climate change will be felt globally, so rapid cuts are required, and time is running out. There is also the vexed issue to be discussed of getting countries to ramp up their ambitions in cutting emissions. Science tells us average global temperatures cannot rise more than 2C, and ideally no more than 1.5C, if catastrophic change is to be avoided. As of now, national pledges - called nationally determined contributions (NDCs) - put the world on a warming path of more than 3C. That means greater ambition is needed. ""Those are the two big-ticket items,"" one source said. ""The review of the rulebook is the major one because it brings in action on finance, mitigation (reducing emissions) and technology transfer (giving developing countries the technology to cut emissions). ""The EU already has detailed reporting and accounting rules, but the rulebook should be applicable to everybody. Ideally it should be a common set of rules."" That poses its own challenges. While the European Union takes the approach of reducing emissions from all sectors, with outside verification from the Commission, other countries do things differently. China, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, doesn't talk about emissions cuts, it refers to carbon intensity. That means reducing emissions per unit of economic activity. India, also a big emitter, takes a similar approach, with further complexity around creation of carbon sinks by planting forests to absorb emissions. Others include 1990 as the reference year, meaning emissions will be cut by a certain date against the level of emissions in 1990, while others use 2005. ""The rulebook is trying to capture all of them in a quantifiable manner,"" the source adds. ""You should be able to come up with a statement at the end of, say, 10 years, and say how they have achieved reductions."" The trick with the Paris rulebook will be ensuring it is transparent, understandable and that, crucially, emissions reductions can be accurately measured and verified. There are compelling reasons why this must happen. Global efforts are way off track, and emissions are rising again for the first time in four years. To meet the Paris goals, they must peak by 2020. As of now, that's not likely even by 2030. In addition, greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere continue to set new record highs, and the impacts are being felt - 2018 is on course to be the fourth hottest year on record. Twenty of the hottest years on record have been in the last 22 years. The climate is changing. The second challenge for COP24 negotiators will be delivering a clear political signal to increase ambition. This is being facilitated under what's called the Talanoa Dialogue. Talanoa is a word used in Fiji and across the Pacific to reflect a process of inclusive and participatory dialogue, allowing wise decisions to be made for the collective good. Three questions are asked: Where are we? Where do we want to go? How do we get there? Almost 500 stories and 280 written inputs were submitted to the dialogue by governments, NGOs and other interest groups. These will be presented to politicians at the talks, called the 24th meeting of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 24 ). But given Donald Trump's attitude to climate change - he doesn't believe his own government's report on its likely impacts - it is a real concern that the US financial commitment will not be realised. What will that mean? Will others make up the shortfall? Will that gap be filled? Politicians, including Climate Action Minister Richard Bruton, will travel to Poland this week, with sources suggesting the idea is to ""rally the troops"" at the start of the process, and give guidance to negotiators. To highlight the extent of the challenge, it's notable that while the EU NDCs take into account all member states, there are divisions. Understandably, given its reliance on fossil fuels, Poland has deep concerns about rapid decarbonisation. It's likely to seek a declaration on how to achieve cuts under a 'just transition' process - that means protecting workers in the fossil fuel industry. That could translate to calls for giving some countries a longer timeframe to decarbonise. There will be no easy wins. But the science is very clear. The climate is warming, and how we heat our homes, fuel our transport and power our economies needs to change. That's a challenge not just for negotiations in Poland, but for us all. Average global temperatures cannot rise more than 2C if catastrophic change is to be avoided ; \"
"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland28","The quiet girl whose lone protest became world outcry","March 16, 2019 Saturday","Irish Examiner","Greta Thunberg was just a child who wouldn't be comforted. The hugs and kisses, the promises that all would be fine and the grown-ups would take care of things gave her no reassurance. She stopped talking, stopped eating, and slipped into a depression that left both her and her terrified parents feeling helpless. A diagnosis of Asperger's would help Greta to understand why she felt different to other children and why the transient worries that came and left their lives clung to her with an ever-tightening grip. But Asperger's wasn't the problem. Her worries were the problem, and those worries were real. Greta's world - our world - was heading for calamity, courtesy ofclimate breakdown and society's failure to acknowledge the extent of the emergency. Greta didn't believe it would all be OK, and from that refusal to be placated grew a global movement that this week brought hundreds of thousands of children and young people out of their schools and onto the streets in more than 70 countries, all echoing her demand for an end to platitudes and the start of real action. She also got nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize this week. Not bad for a girl who has just turned 16. Greta Thunberg was born in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, in 2003, the first of two daughters of opera singer Malena Ernman and actor, producer, and writer Svante Thunberg. Her mother, a classically trained mezzo soprano, who more recently has a mixed classic and contemporary repertoire, performed around the world and represented Sweden with a pop-opera number, 'The Voice', when Greta was six. But Greta's life, by her own accounts, was ordinary. She was ""the girl in the back who doesn't say anything"" as she told The Guardian this week. She was, she said, introverted and not much of a talker. ""I could not make a difference because I was too small,"" she said of how insignificant she felt at the time. When she was around seven or eight, however, the issue of climate change crept into her consciousness. At school, she and her classmates watched documentaries on the disappearing Arctic ice and starving polar bears and cried. Then the others would wipe away their tears, tuck the troubling facts away and get back to being children. Greta couldn't find anywhere to tidy away her thoughts. They stayed with her, making her question, doubt and fear. ""I couldn't let go,"" she said. By the age of 10, the Thunberg family was in crisis. Greta hardly ate and she was both physically and mentally ill. She lost a year of school and her parents realised that they needed to make a dramatic change to their lifestyles to make their daughter believe all was not lost. They became vegetarian and later vegan. Malena stopped flying - with dramatic effect on her international career - and they began trying to live as sustainably as possible. Greta appreciated their efforts, but she continued to study the causes and effects of climate change and her frustration with the comparative ignorance of adults grew. At the UN's COP24 The Albedo effect, for all the urgency it should arouse, wasn't going to grab society's attention, however. That took the Greta effect. It was the students of Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida who got her thinking. Seventeen of their classmates and teachers were murdered by a student in February last year and they went on strike for gun control. Greta and her classmates talked about doing something similar for climateaction but in the end, it was Greta alone who took a homemade banner to the gates of the Swedish parliament and sat there from 8.30am to 3pm one Friday last August, pledging to do the same every week until those in power started working to save her planet. She did the same the following Friday, and the next, until gradually others joined her and her story spread and Fridays for Future became a global phenomenon. Critics call her a publicity stunt and claimed she is manipulated by organisations with ulterior motives but in her interviews and presentations, she has never looked anything but in complete control of her own opinions and actions. At the COP24 They had learned they must ""live as we spreech"", he said, before excusing himself and trying again. On the third attempt, Greta leaned over, bent his microphone to her and helped him out. ""Practice as we preach,"" she corrected. ""Practice as we preach."" That fixed, she allowed herself the tiniest of smiles that lit up her habitually intense expression. Next to fix the world. \"

"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland30","Climate change and geography","December 27, 2018 Thursday","The Irish Times","Sir, - I would like to congratulate the Minister for Education Joe McHugh for his decision to review the place of history as a core subject within the Junior Cycle curriculum as previously highlighted by Enrico Dal Lago, Deirdre Mac Math\'fana and Alistair Malcolm (November 24th, December 1st and December 17th). However, I urge the Minister to do the same for the position of geography. Geography is essential for our identity, sense of place and role as citizens. Current global challenges including migration, climate change and Brexit highlight the critical role of a sound geographical education. The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (October 8th, 2018) predicts there are only a dozen years for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5 degrees - beyond which even half a degree will significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. In spite of these devastating climatic events, approaches to a transition from carbon have been slow and ineffective. International climate change negotiators at the COP24 talks in Poland agreed tougher targets for cutting greenhouse gases under the Paris climate agreement, as well as stronger transparency rules for countries in disclosing their emissions. As citizens we have a vested interest in climate change. Through geography we learn to understand climate change along with its causes and impacts. Junior Cycle students can also research this topic and design age appropriate actions for change. The time for action is now. While the current Minister for Climate Change, Richard Bruton, was formerly minister for education, he never expressed an interest in climate change education. Without robust climate change education, citizens will not demand changes from our political leaders. Geography provides an important curricular space for students to engage with contemporary local and global events including climate change. There is a need for joined-up thinking between government departments. If Mr Bruton is serious about tacking climate change perhaps he should remind his Government colleague about the importance of geography as a curricular area for all Junior Cycle students. - Yours, etc, Dr ANNE DOLAN, Lecturer in Primary Geography, Mary Immaculate College, Limerick. \"

Leaders at the EU summit had welcomed the recent publication of the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) special report. They insisted that the union must step up its preparations for the forthcoming COP24 climate conference in Poland in December. In a strongly worded rebuff to US climate scepticism, they applauded the report for ""unequivocally confirming the negative impacts of climate change, including its conclusions indicating that global emission reductions in all sectors are crucial, and that further action is needed in mitigation and adaptation, notably to reach the temperature goal as set out in the Paris Agreement"". The leaders gave strong backing to proposals from the commission to create a new partnership with Africa, pledging that the new, enhanced relationship would be supported by the ""necessary resources"" through the European External Investment Plan and the EU Trust Fund for Africa . Relationship with Africa The commission president Jean-Claude Juncker insisted their new engagement with Africa ""was not about migration"" but a far wider and more profound new relationship. Leaders recalled their previous condemnation of the Salisbury attack, and deplored the cyber-attack on the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (Powder). EU security ""Such threats and attacks strengthen our common resolve to further enhance the EU's internal security and our ability and capabilities to detect, prevent, disrupt and respond to hostile activities of foreign intelligence networks and other malicious actors on our territories as well as online ,"" the summit conclusions said. Proposals to require internet platforms to take down terrorist material online within an hour of notification were endorsed. Although the leaders were expected to take Italy to task over its plans to raise its deficit in breach of EU rules, the Italian prime minister Giusesppe Conte got a polite hearing when he reported. Mr Juncker said the leaders felt it was more appropriate for them to await the commission study of all the member state budgets. \"
"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland32","A road map that must be acted on; Climate change deal","December 17, 2018 Monday","The Irish Times","The outcome of the UN climate change talks in Katowice, Poland, deserves a guarded welcome, although it is short of what is required to address a global crisis threatening civilisation in less than two decades. It brings a rules-based global order to the 2015 Paris Agreement. From 2020, it will be driven by actions rather than promises on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It defines 195 signatory states' responsibilities for tackling climate change, reporting progress and intensifying their efforts for decades to come. At a moment of deep global divisions and instability, governments have reached a deal on climate rules and secured a victory for multilateralism. There is much unfinished business and lack of collective acceptance of what is urgently required. If the key aspiration of the Paris pact - to contain the global temperature rise to within 1.5 degrees - is to have any chance of happening, the verdict of leading climate scientists in the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report must be the platform to build future actions. The blunt message at COP24 to governments was that limiting warming to 1.5 degrees is possible but the window for action is narrowing. Scientists delivered; it's up to governments to take unprecedented action. And yet a small band of countries, emboldened by Donald Trump's impending withdrawal from the agreement, while defending their huge fossil fuel interests, found it impossible to ""welcome"" its findings. Significantly, the deal introduces transparency around action and, if outstanding issues are resolved next year, will end rogue accounting practices - such as double counting of reductions. Separately, the talks struck a delicate balance between concerns of the smallest, poorest and most vulnerable countries, developed nations most responsible for global warming, and emerging economies wary of being saddled with a bigger burden to act. At last, there is a clearer path to tangible, ongoing financial supports for adaptation. Negotiators believe the rulebook is a strong enough tool that, if coupled with political leadership, can prevent the worst impacts. But reality reveals gaps; national climate pledges to date put the world on track for up to 4 degrees of warming, double the target agreed in Paris. Many will be bitterly disappointed a political statement urging governments to commit to increased ambition before 2020 did not materialise, though the EU, including Ireland and many other countries, consistently pushed for stronger ambition. Katowice was never going to be the big climate action breakthrough many demanded but it has shown once more the resilience of the Paris pact. It now has a solid road map for climate actions. The missing elements are leadership, necessary urgency and scaled-up national ambitions. \"

These cuts, combined with a series of other measures, are also needed to prevent catastrophic climate change in coming decades, it concludes. More than 50 per cent more food will be needed by 2050, the WRI notes, ""but greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture will have to fall by two-thirds at the same time"". The extra food will have to be produced without creating new farmland, it says, otherwise the world's remaining forests face destruction. Meat and dairy production use 83 per cent of farmland, and produce 60 per cent of agriculture's emissions. Increasing the amount of food produced per hectare was the most critical step, followed by cutting meat-eating and putting a stop to the wasting of one-third of food produced, it suggests. Speaking in Katowice, Poland, which is hosting the summit, Dr Tim Searchinger of the WRI and Princeton University said: ""If we tried to produce all the food needed in 2050 using today's production systems the world would have to convert most of its remaining forest, and agriculture alone would produce almost twice the emissions allowable from all human activities."" Science fiction With a recent UN report setting out the need for the global economy to go ""net-zero"" on carbon emissions by 2050 to limit warming to 1.5 degrees, ""the potential for natural solutions are much better than the science fiction of geoengineering"", a separate report by Christian Aid concludes. Report author Dr Kat Kramer, Christian Aid's global climate lead, said: ""The move to a net zero world by 2050 is gaining momentum as we realise how vital it is to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees."" The search for ways to create ""carbon sinks"" that generate negative emissions was growing, he said at briefing at COP24 , the informal name of the climate conference. ""The idea of putting mirrors in space or spraying the atmosphere with reflective aerosols gets attention but these are largely expensive science fiction fantasies. ""What we need is a renewed relationship with nature. Restoring ecosystems, especially peatlands and native forests, has the potential to create significant benefits for the climate without using our atmosphere as a school laboratory."" - Additional reporting: Guardian \"

An outline decision circulated yesterday, the last day of official talks, contained plans for a common rule book for all countries, with flexibility for poorer countries - and provision for all countries to increase their carbon-cutting commitments by 2020. Most delegations believed, however, the final outcome was still in the balance; especially on the issue of whether it will be ambitious enough in agreeing measures to contain global temperatures to a 1.5 degree rise as required under the 2015 agreement. Of critical importance to a majority of states was to ensure the rule book was compatible with the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, which concluded it was only a matter of years before the effects of catastrophic climate change would begin to hit many parts of the world. But the option of a two-tier rule book was still in the draft, which developing countries contended would let richer countries off the hook in addressing their responsibilities. Among key issues not yet decided was the question of ""loss and damage"", which is of most concern to least developed countries and small island states; how vulnerable communities and states in the front line of climate change impacts will be adequately supported. Whether the damage caused by climate change would be accounted for when countries submit their climate reports to the UN was unresolved. This is being sought by vulnerable countries as it would increase pressure on the developed world to assist. The United States has traditionally resisted all mentions of loss and damage. There was minimal progress in getting countries to make firm commitments to cut their emissions further than already committed to. A revised text issued early yesterday called for developed countries to meet long-standing promises to boost climate-related aid to $100 billion a year by 2020, ""noting with concern the urgent and emerging needs"" arising from more extreme weather events in recent years. Lockdown A further updated text was due last night, while negotiating teams were in ""lock down"" for most of the day as a series of bilateral meetings was taking place under the direction of COP24 president Michal Kurtyka. The Irish delegation under the umbrella of the European Union has supported efforts to ensure the rule book is underpinned by clarity and transparency, with tighter deadlines and ending practices such as double counting of emission reductions. A system for measuring, reporting and verifying greenhouse gas emissions in all states will be part of the rule book, including a ""global stocktake"" of overall progress on meeting the Paris goals. But the structures underpinning this had yet to be signed off, according to sources. \"

The report shows that the global average temperature for the first ten months of the year was nearly 1.0-degree Celsius above the pre-industrial era (1850-1900). ""It is worth repeating once again that we are the first generation to fully understand climate change and the last generation to be able to do something about it,"" Mr Taalas warned.

As new draft negotiating texts were circulated this week, finance elements were the most difficult to get across the line. ""We are not there yet,"" said Jo Tyndall, one of the co-chairs, at a plenary session late on Thursday. A final push was in progress overnight into yesterday, in advance of ministers and lead negotiators arriving today. Minister for Climate Action Richard Bruton is due to return to the summit on Tuesday. With developed countries having so far failed to deliver on their promise of $100 billion per year by 2020, trust has evaporated from the perspective of developing countries. Meanwhile, a stand-off between the US and China threatens to slow global action on climate change when the risks of catastrophe are accelerating. Biggest threats ""The biggest threats to the planet are the lack of US climate leadership at home and the unwillingness of the US to engage with China,"" said Joanna Lewis, a China specialist at Georgetown University. ""The rest of the world looks to the US and China for leadership, and it has become clear that, as the alliance has waned, global momentum to address climate change has slowed."" Taken together, the emissions produced by the US and China account for more than 40 per cent of the global total. In both countries emissions went up this year, according to analysis issued this week by the Global Carbon Project. While China's emissions have grown in the past two years, mainly because of continued use of coal, it is on track to meet its modest, self-imposed Paris target to reach peak emissions by 2030. Rulebook COP24 opened amid concerns that a rulebook might prove impossible to negotiate, according to Jennifer Higgins, policy and advocacy adviser at Christian Aid Ireland. Other fears, she said, ""included a roll back on ambition, a lack of strong leadership, and an inadequate response to the finding of the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] special report which clearly demonstrated that if we continue on our current path we'll breach the goal of limiting global warming of 1.5 degrees in just 12 years"". There was, however, optimism in the air, ""and instead we are looking to some better-case scenarios, a pulling together, with a proactive effort to ensure a complete rulebook by the end of the COP"". Whether this was well founded would emerge only when finalised documents emerge next week. The message from civil society organisations attending the summit was the need for urgency. This was echoed, she believed, by the renowned naturalist Sir David Attenborough who, in occupying the ""people's seat"" at the beginning of the COP, said people wanted decision-makers to act now. An Taisce advocacy officer Ian Lumley highlighted a disconnect between reality and genuine climate action. ""The display at the entry to the national exhibition pavilions featured the wonders of coal as a base ingredient in soap and cosmetic beauty treatments, and managed to ignore climate and air pollution impact,"" Mr Lumley said.

"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland38","Negotiators face uphill task to forge global deal; China accuses some rich nations of breaking pollution clean-up promises","December 14, 2018 Friday","The Irish Times","Tension, tiredness and reports of lack of progress on the issues that have repeatedly surfaced at the UN climate talks were all too evident yesterday as negotiators attempted to forge a global deal on the Paris Agreement rulebook. China accused some of the richest nations in the world of ""backsliding"" on promises to clean up pollution, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and provide $100 billion a year in climate-related aid by 2020. Poland spearheaded a push by a group of the 79 least developed countries for clarity on when those promises would be fulfilled. It indicated deepening rifts, with the talks, that were due to conclude in Katowice today, likely to run into the weekend. ""Some delegations are backsliding,"" Xie Zhenhua, China's lead envoy to the talks in Katowice, said at a briefing. ""There are still quite a number of developed countries who did not start providing financial and technological support that they had pledged in the Paris Agreement three years ago. We cannot accept any backsliding."" The remarks illustrated the divide on environmental issues between China and the US, which had worked together to seal the Paris pact in 2015. The NGO, ActionAid, warned that ambition on averting catastrophic climate change ""is at risk of fizzling out"". ""Ministers are here to agree the rulebook needed to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees and protect the planet now and for future generations,"" said Harjeet Singh, its lead on climate change. ""The alternative is unconscionable: up to 150 million more premature deaths and millions more people forced to migrate because of climate change."" Deniers A coalition of African environmental and climate justice groups said the report was ""under contemptuous attack by a coalition of climate deniers revolving around the US"". What's worrying many delegates and observers is the complexity of the task of delivering a strong rulebook. That concern was echoed by Prof John Sweeney who is representing An Taisce at COP24 . ""I think it's pretty normal for the Thursday [before the final day] but suspect there is more resistance to compromise this year,"" Prof Sweeney said. There was a notable lack of clarity on emissions targets and how they were accounted for, he added. Without a level playing field, there was a risk some countries would exploit ambiguities. Developing nations were resisting measures that would ensure transparency in the way emission cuts are measured, reported and verified. There has also been an attempt by a small number of countries to remove human rights references from the preamble of the Paris Agreement. Former president and climate justice campaigner Mary Robinson fought hard to get it more centrally featured. What might not be the final day will coincide with more school strikes across the world, notably in the US and Germany, as young people demonstrate concern about a lack on progress in addressing climate change. British energy and clean growth minister Claire Perry confirmed the UK had written to the UN offering to host the 2020 climate summit, which would coincide with the Paris pact coming into full effect. It would also come just weeks after the next US election, which is likely to see any Democrat candidate run on a ticket of returning the US to the accord, while President Trump will seek to rubber-stamp his decision to quit the treaty. The day after the election, the US must affirm its withdrawal or not. \"

Why we've warmed to the Greta effect; 'The sad thing is most children are not aware of the fate that awaits us'","April 26, 2019 Friday","Irish Independent","A 16-year-old schoolgirl with a powerful message about climate change is challenging world leaders. Just who is the real Greta Thunberg, asks Guy Kelly As anybody who has followed his political career will know all too well, it takes a lot for British Environment Secretary Michael Gove to feel shame. On Tuesday, though, after hearing the arguments of 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, he was unusually contrite. ""As I listened to you, I felt great admiration, but also a sense of responsibility and guilt... I recognise we have not done nearly enough to deal with the problem of climate change,"" he said. Thunberg - her hair in pigtails and a metal water bottle at her side - looked on, seeming unconvinced. ""Suddenly, thanks to the leadership of Greta and others, it has become inescapable that we have to act."" Thunberg had received a standing ovation from the 40 MPs and more than 100 guests she addressed inside the UK parliament where she was introduced as an ""enthusiastic and dedicated environmental campaigner"" when she appeared in the House of Commons. Not for the first time, her name began trending on Twitter. Journalists queued up to interview her. In Hyde Park, where she had spoken earlier in the week, the remaining protesters of the Extinction Rebellion movement spoke of her as a nascent church would its patron saint. And through it all, the girl in the middle remained cool, calm and remarkably composed. It was another extraordinary day in the life of an increasingly extraordinary teenager. Until last summer, the name Greta Thunberg was relatively unknown outside her family and friends in Sweden. The eldest of two girls, she is the daughter of actor Svante Thunberg and Malena Ernman, a well-known opera singer who came 21st in the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest. (She is also distantly related to Svante Arrhenius, the first scientist to predict that carbon emissions would lead to warming.) Growing up with the family's two labradors, Moses and Roxy, near the capital, Thunberg was academically sound but quiet, and became interested in the subject of climate change when she was just nine. ""[Teachers] were always talking about how we should turn off lights, save water, not throw out food. I asked why and they explained about climate change,"" she said last year. ""And I thought this was very strange. If humans could really change the climate, everyone would be talking about it and people wouldn't be talking about anything else. But this wasn't happening."" Images of melting ice and polar bears in peril became stuck in Thunberg's mind. At 11, she was uninterested in mobile phones or the trends other children followed, and her sadness turned to a crippling depression; stopping her from going to school, eating and - aside from family and one particular teacher at school - speaking. At around the same time, she and her younger sister, 13-year-old Beata, were diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, ADHD and other conditions. Thunberg says that her autism has helped her to focus on doing something about the subject that caused her depression. ""[Asperger's] makes me different, and being different is a gift, I would say. It also makes me see things from outside the box,"" she told the BBC this week. ""I don't easily fall for lies, I can see through things."" By last summer, Thunberg's focus had outgrown the home. Frustrated by what she saw as weak-to-non-existent policies on climate change from the Swedish government, and provoked by the summer heatwave, she resolved to skip school and sit alone, every Friday, on the cobblestones in front of the country's parliament. ""I am doing this because you adults are shting on my future,"" said the leaflets she handed out to passers-by. Students in other countries followed, including Ireland, and soon tens of thousands of teenagers had joined the strike. Thunberg was invited to the United Nations Climate Change Conference and the World Economic Forum, in Davos. At the latter, she told a roomful of business leaders that their financial success had ""come with an unthinkable price tag"" for the planet. It is Thunberg's refusal to defer to the authority of anybody she speaks to that has made her so effective. She is more than happy to tell people ""Sweden is not a green paradise"" and explain its crimes against the ozone layer. On Tuesday, she told British MPs: ""You lied to us. You gave us false hope. You told us that the future was something to look forward to. And the saddest thing is that most children are not even aware of the fate that awaits us. We will not understand it until it's too late."" She has met Pope Francis and Jean-Continued on Page 28 Continued from Page 26 Claude Juncker, earned social media endorsements from Barack Obama and Leonardo DiCaprio, and been touted for the Nobel Peace Prize. Like the brave Parkland Shooting survivors now fighting for gun control, 18-year-old US transgender activist Jazz Jennings and Malala Yousafzai, Thunberg is proof that the fearlessness of youth can be far more effective than decades of political experience. There has, of course, been a backlash. Not everybody is keen to have a teenager - one who has been compared to Joan of Arc and Pippi Longstocking, no less - tell them what to do, and not everybody thinks she is picking on the right foes (arguing that emissions from China, the US and other powers would be better challenged). Criticism has included the suggestion that having famous parents means Thunberg is the product of a wellorchestrated PR campaign. It is true that she started her school strike around the time the book was published. It's also true she was forced to distance herself from 'We Don't Have Time', a climate change start-up run by a Swedish PR consultant, after it had used Thunberg's image to gain funds. But there is no suggestion she is anything other than independent. Others have picked on her delivery - curious, since she speaks fluently in a second language, with a wider vocabulary than most have in their first, and articulates complex political issues with astonishing simplicity. Or they've commented on her appearance. Michael Gove's wife, the journalist Sarah Vine, complimented her on dressing ""like a girl instead of an off-duty pole dancer"", which is a roundabout way of showing your approval. And, perhaps most wildly, some have said her mother's Eurovision experience made things easy for her. On Wednesday, a surely exhausted Thunberg left London and returned home - on the train, of course. It has been reported that her parents and teachers would like her to stop protesting and go back to school, but there is the possibility of a trip to the United Nations Climate Summit in New York in September. If invited, Thunberg plans to get there on a container ship. ""All my life I've been invisible, the invisible girl in the back who doesn't say anything,"" she said last http://www.year.No www.year.No longer: ""From one day to another, people listen to me."" For all our sakes, let's hope that's true. '[Asperger's] makes me different, and being different is a gift. I don't easily fall for lies, I can see though things' ; \"
"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland40","Upgrade of all our houses to cut energy use will cost (EURO)50bn","December 6, 2018 Thursday","Irish Independent","UPGRADING the national housing stock to make it more energy-efficient and help drive down emissions will cost up to (EURO)50bn, Climate Action Minister Richard Bruton has revealed. Retrofitting two million properties so they use less energy will require public and private-sector funding, and will be among a number of projects needed to decarbonise the economy, he told the D\'e1il climate committee. His comments come as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) revealed greenhouse gas emissions fell by less than 1pc last year, more by accident than design. The slight drop in 2017 was due to warmer weather, less fuel tourism and more renewables on the power system, but they rose in the agriculture sector due to higher cattle numbers. The environmental watchdog warned that the overall emissions drop may not be sustained over the longer term, with the latest figures showing the State is off track to meet its EU 2020 targets, despite a drop of 0.9pc in emissions last year. Agriculture emissions rose by 2.9pc, but transport fell by 2.4pc, power generation by 6.9pc and household by 5pc. The State currently generates almost three million tonnes of emissions above the level needed to meet our legally binding targets. In 2017, some 60.75 million tonnes were emitted, down 530,000 tonnes on 2016. Mr Bruton welcomed the emission cuts, but highlighted that the State was ""far off course"" to meet its international obligations. He told the D\'e1il committee there were ""challenges in every sector"", with transport emissions averaging 1.6 tonnes per head of population, Questions: Dr Eimear Cotter fears emissions won't fall more which was among the highest levels in the EU. Only 16pc of housing stock was energy-efficient, meaning carbon use per dwelling was 50pc higher than in much of Europe. It would cost (EURO)50bn to upgrade all homes in the State to the required standard, he said, adding the Government's climate plan would set out targets across society which would be delivered against a ""rigid timescale"". ""It will require every government department, community, individual and enterprise playing a role but the public sector must show leadership in this area,"" he said. ""We have to look to the least cost way of achieving these targets but we have to be ambitious."" EPA director Dr Eimear Cotter said while the emission drop was welcomed, there were question marks about cuts over the longer term. ""Some of the underlying drivers of this decrease point to circumstance rather than deliberate action, a fall in cross-border refuelling and warmer weather played a role this year,"" she said. ""This would raise questions about the longevity and enduring nature of these decreases in future years."" It says that agriculture emissions increased by 2.9pc in 2017, up 570,000 tonnes, driven by higher dairy cow numbers which increased by 3.1pc year on year. This reflects plans to expand milk production, with dairy cow numbers rising by 26pc in the last five years while emissions rose by 10pc. While demand for electricity rose by 1pc, emissions fell by 6.9pc due to less coal and peat being used and more renewables on the system. This led to electricity being generated at a lower environmental cost than at any time on record, the EPA added, with wind generation up 21pc. \"
"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland41","World is now at crossroads over climate, UN conference warned","December 3, 2018 Monday","Irish Independent","THE world is at a crossroads on climate change, a major conference featuring delegates from 200 nations was warned yesterday. Two weeks of talks began yesterday in Poland to tackle deep political divisions at the most important UN meeting on global warming since the landmark 2015 Paris deal to shift away from fossil fuels. Expectations are low that negotiations in Katowice, at the heart of Poland's coal region, will fully resolve concerns laid out in reports over recent weeks on the severity of rising greenhouse gas emissions. The political climate has also been transformed since the Paris agreement and the fragile global unity that brought about that accord has shattered. ""This is a very, very important conference,"" UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa said. ""It also takes place in a scenario where we have clear signals about the urgency with which we need to address the issues of climate change."" Four former presidents of UN talks, including Laurent Fabius of France, who led negotiations for the Paris agreement, issued a statement urging ""decisive action"". ""The world is at a crossroads and decisive action in the next two years will be crucial to tackle these urgent threats,"" they said in the joint statement. However, political divisions were clear from the outset, with Brazil having withdrawn its offer to host the 2019 talks. The United States, meanwhile, reiterated at the G20 summit in Argentina on Saturday its decision to withdraw from the Paris accord and a US commitment to all energy sources. The other members of the group of industrialised nations - including the biggest polluter, China - reaffirmed their commitment to implementing the Paris deal, taking into account their national circumstances. Delegates said one of the trickiest issues could be monitoring emissions as the US, which cannot quit the pact until 2020, uses the talks to press for a level of detail it perceives as useful to its foreign policy dealings. Poland is hosting UN climate negotiations for a third time, but the nation remains hooked on coal, the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel. Coal provides about 80pc of Poland's power and has been a major source of employment and national pride. The younger generation is less emotionally attached to coal and is increasingly environmentally aware, though any phasing out of the fuel in Poland is likely to be slow. The energy ministry said only last week Poland plans to invest in new coal capacity while its long-term energy strategy assumes it will still obtain about 60pc of its power from coal in 2030. ""We are here to enable the world to act together on climate change,"" said Poland's environmental envoy, Michal Kurtyka, who is presiding over the meeting, known as COP24 . With further meetings next year meant to build on what's decided in Katowice, he urged all countries to ""show creativity and flexibility."" ""The United Nations secretary-general is counting on us, all of us to deliver,"" Mr Kurtyka said. ""There is no Plan B."" Ministers and some heads of government plan to join the discussion today, when the host nation is expected to push for a declaration ensuring a ""just transition"" for fossil fuel industries that face cuts and closures amid efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. ""Despite geopolitical instability, the climate consensus is proving highly resilient,"" said Christiana Figueres, a former head of the UN climate office. ""It is sad that the federal administration of the United States, a country that is increasingly feeling the full force of climate impacts, continues to refuse to listen to the objective voice of science."" \"
"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland42","Richest 10% cause half of lifestyle carbon emissions; We need to talk about people who drive big cars and fly business class","December 12, 2018 Wednesday","The Irish Times","It's time to have a difficult conversation about the lifestyle of wealthy people - those who drive big cars, frequently fly business class and have two homes, warned climate scientist Prof Kevin Anderson. He said the richest 10 per cent, invariably living in ""self-proclaimed climate progressive countries"", are responsible for half of the total lifestyle consumption carbon emissions in the world, while the poorest half contribute a mere 10 per cent. Reducing the carbon emissions of wealthy people to the European average would go a long way to resolving the world's carbon emissions crisis, he told a ""Scientists' Warning"" press conference at the UN climate summit. Progress on reducing the carbon footprint of the wealthy, he believed, was being hindered by the ""Davos mentality"", which is marked by ongoing growth with high levels of inequality and a ""because we're worth it"" mindset - ""a given we daren't question"". Related to this, was the ""climate glitterati"" who loved to rub shoulders with the Davos set and believed the climate crisis would be solved by some technology in the future. Consuming less was the easy win but not accepted. Two gambles were at play here: ""that the technology will work"" and that it would operate at a planetary scale. Engineering Engineering could do a lot, and the variety of plant crops could be changed to be more reflective of sunlight. Vaporising sea water to create more clouds so that more places around the world have weather like Scotland might be a geoengineering step in the right direction to reverse regional rising temperatures. Carbon taxes, while returning benefits to citizens, might work, he said, but he feared the wealthy would just continue to pay the bill, ""happy for the poor to be constrained"". An individual's emissions were not as important as how their actions catalyse change throughout their family, church, and sports clubs. ""Young people have a huge impact because they are already networked with many people. The younger generation can influence older generations on how to behave, as well: no excuses, reduce your carbon footprint or jeopardise all of our futures."" There was optimism among the young because they do not burn fossil fuels to attend meetings. Instead, they are on social media: ""Rapid-fire communications. Messages fly about without the carbon cost."" He applies a ""no fly"" principle for attending conferences, the COP24 included. In fully adopting the Paris Agreement on climate change, he believed there was a need for ""a global carbon ration"" divided between countries. And the extent of temperature rise mattered. Unfortunately, for some areas, such as Bangladesh, the difference between 1.5 degrees and 2 degrees ""is significant in the amount of suffering, while in Europe not so much"". ""There is a 5 per cent chance we'll succeed. This is a choice. If we choose to act responsibly the chances of success go up. Unfortunately, many, maybe most, politicians are going retrograde,"" he said. On air travel, he said: ""I think flying is emblematic of a very high-carbon lifestyle."" He included academics among frequent fliers. He concluded by quoting the American futurist Alex Steffen: ""The curve we've been forced on to bends so steeply that the pace of victory is part of victory itself. Winning slowly is basically the same thing as losing outright. We cannot afford to pursue past strategies, aimed at limited gains towards distant goals. ""In the face of both triumphant denialism and predatory delay, trying to achieve climate action by doing the same things, the same old ways . . . guarantees defeat."" The global rich display denialism, according to Prof Anderson, and most ""know they are in the top 10 per cent"". \"

Last year, it was an Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron duet performance that succeeded in getting the talks back on track at the exact same stage of the summit in Bonn. This year, heads of heavyweight states were notably absent, and Mr Gore stepped up to try to fill the gap. He told delegates they faced ""the single most important moral choice that humanity has ever faced"". ""The Paris Agreement gives us hope. It still gives me hope,"" he declared, but he repeatedly stressed the need for urgency: ""We do not have time for despair. We can't afford the luxury of feeling discouraged. Too much is at stake."" He outlined how an unstoppable ""sustainability revolution"" had already begun including a trillion dollar building retro-fitting industry empowered by digital tools, ""but it's not fast enough to solve the climate crises"". Public support - ""grassroots uprisings all over the world"" - technology, the moral authority and solutions were all in place. ""We need policies. We need to stop subsidising the destruction of the world,"" he roared. He cited the three big oil and gas producing countries, including the US, which were ""at least temporality unwilling to contribute to the progress we need in policy"". Mr Gore's rallying call was strongly echoed by UN secretary-general Ant\'f3nio Guterres who returned to the talks inan attempt to secure a meaningful agreement by calling on countries to ""make compromises and sacrifices"" in tackling global warming. He made the appeal amid fears that COP24 might collapse without an agreement on key issues. Paris Agreement Mr Guterres told ministers and senior negotiators from 193 signatory countries to the Paris Agreement they should consider the fate of future generations. Failure would send a ""disastrous message"", he added. ""This is the time for political compromises to be reached. This means sacrifices, but it will benefit us all collectively."" ""To waste this opportunity would compromise our last best chance to stop runaway climate change. It would not only be immoral, it would be suicidal,"" Mr Guterres said. Earlier, Ralph Regenvanu, foreign minister of the south Pacific Ocean country of Vanuatu, told Reuters technical negotiators were exhausted and had almost given up. The UN and the EU believes China could play a stronger role in the absence of leadership from the US in advancing the talks and in helping to ensure countries all follow the same rules in being transparent over their carbon emissions under the Paris agreement rulebook. NGOs including Climate Action Network Europe warned of the risks of failure and accused powerful players such as the EU of not pushing hard enough to reach an agreement. ""A new leadership must step up,"" said Vanessa Perez-Cirera of the environmental group WWF. ""We cannot afford to lose one of the 12 years we have remaining."" She was referring to an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report which suggested average global warming could only be halted at 1.5 degrees if urgent action was taken by 2030. Jean-Pascal Ypersele, a former IPCC deputy chair said whether or not countries believed the conclusions of the report was irrelevant because the science was clear. ""Nobody, even the so-called superpowers, can negotiate with the laws of physics."" Poland, which is chairing the talks, circulated a condensed draft text yesterday running to about 100 pages, down from about 300 at the start of the talks. But it has come in for criticism for not addressing its own high dependency on coal. Jennifer Morgan, head of Greenpeace, said current drafts contained too many loopholes to be effective, including how countries calculate the amount of emissions absorbed by trees when submitting their reports. \"
"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland44","Climate change effects to be far worse than previously thought; Landmark report predicts extreme weather and food shortages by 2040","October 9, 2018 Tuesday","The Irish Times","The immediate consequences of climate change are worse than previously thought, according to the world's leading climatologists. Avoiding the likely immediate damage requires transforming the world economy at a speed and scale that has ""no documented historic precedent"", they warn in their report, issued by the UN yesterday. Limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees by mid-century would require ""rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society"", it adds. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report describes a world of extreme weather events, worsening food shortages and wildfires and dying coral reefs. There is only a dozen years for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5 degrees, it finds - beyond which even half a degree will significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. With clear benefits to people and natural ecosystems, limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees - rather than 2 degrees - could go hand in hand with ensuring a more sustainable and equitable world, the IPCC said after its report was issued. The ""half-degree difference"" could also prevent corals from being completely eradicated and ease pressure on the Arctic, the report finds. It was launched after approval at a meeting of 91 lead authors and government representatives of 195 countries, including Ireland, in Incheon, South Korea. It was commissioned after the Paris Agreement was agreed in 2015. The findings have increased pressure on politicians throughout the world, as the scientific evidence presented in the report is unequivocal - and the scale of immediate threats is laid out in a variety of likely scenarios. Facts and numbers ""Scientists might want to write in capital letters, 'ACT NOW IDIOTS', but they need to say that with facts and numbers,"" said Kaisa Kosonen of Greenpeace, who was an observer at the negotiations. ""And they have."" One of the contributing authors to the study, Prof Peter Thorne of Maynooth University, underlined its stark findings, which had not been weakened in the final version ratified by governments. But he added:""Scientists can only do so much in assessing what the scenarios mean. They have handed those over to the governments of the world to respond."" He added: ""We need to transform the way we live, travel and work, but it does not mean going back to proverbial caves. We need to adopt technological solutions."" With the ball being put back in the politicians' court, he questioned the Irish Government's ""real appetite for action"", given reports that attempts were being made to minimise an increase in carbon tax in the budget. ""The true cost of carbon, if accounting for the warming impact, is likely somewhere in the range of EUR 150-EUR 200 per ton. It's currently taxed at 10 per cent of that. The result is a huge IOU to future generations."" Limiting The IPCC report, which will inform global action on climate over the next decade, finds that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees would require ""rapid and far-reaching"" transitions in land use, energy, industry, buildings, transport, and cities. Global net human-caused emissions of CO2 would need to fall by about 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching ""net zero"" by about 2050 - Ireland has committed to an 80 per cent cut in emissions by 2050. The report was approved by the IPCC on Saturday. It will be the key scientific input into the Katowice Climate Change Conference, known as COP24 , in Poland in December, when governments review the Paris Agreement to tackle climate change and reaffirm their commitments. ""It's a line in the sand and what it says to our species is that this is the moment and we must act now,"" said Dr Debra Roberts, a co-chair of the IPCC working group on climate impacts. ""This is the largest clarion bell from the science community and I hope it mobilises people and dents the mood of complacency. The decisions we make today are critical in ensuring a safe and sustainable world for everyone, both now and in the future,"" she added. The report gives policymakers the information they need to make decisions that tackle climate change while considering local context and people's needs, she believed. As a consequence, ""the next few years are probably the most important in our history"", Dr Roberts said. Flooding along the banks of the Shannon River near Athlone . Photograph: Brenda Fitzsimons \"
"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland45","Wind energy can provide a silver-bullet solution to (EURO)600m EU climate fines; Yates Country","February 9, 2019 Saturday","Irish Independent","IT'S THE most popular conversation item in the country. Weather preoccupies our talk time. The highest viewer ratings on 2018 TV news were directly associated with Ireland's first official Atlantic hurricane Storm Emma and dramatic snowfalls during the 'Beast from the East' storm. Last Sunday at the Dublin Racing Festival, in the Leopardstown parade ring Michael O'Leary criticised track management for not watering the chase track. Heretofore an unheard of notion in February. For the first time in living memory, winter ground conditions were officially described as 'good to firm' - resulting in a slate of non-runners. Climate change is blamed for summer droughts, winter floods and all extreme erratic weather conditions. But patterns seem utterly unpredictable; different conditions each year. Temperatures have risen by 1C over the past century and 0.5C within the last 30 years - although curiously Ireland's highest recorded temperature occurred in Kilkenny in 1887. Prof John Sweeney, expert climatologist from Maynooth University, predicts further global warming of 0.5C within two decades. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says we have only a dozen years to prevent temperatures rising by 1.5C or even 2C by 2050. This led the EU and Ireland signing up to the Paris climate accord in 2016, endorsed most recently at COP24 in Poland. Ireland is the second-highest EU emitter of greenhouse gases at 13.7 tonnes per capita, compared to an EU average of seven tonnes per annum. By the original target date of 2020, we'll be 15-20pc over our promised limit. With restored economic growth, we're back to a pattern of rising emissions of 2.5pc a year. However, a responsibility reality check is needed. This has to be put into a global context of collective culpability among 200 national governments for global warming. Ireland accounts for 0.18pc of global emissions, compared to China at 25pc, USA at 16pc and the entire EU at 10pc. Turning to fossil fuels output, Ireland's energy production is a tiny, paltry equivalent of two million tonnes in comparison to producers in billion tonnes of oil equivalent, China (2.5), USA (1.8), Saudi Arabia (1.3), Russia (1.3) and India (0.5). We're minnows in a 'polluter pays' league. Selfishly, we also have less frontline risk. Our moderate, equable climate means variation of average winter and summer temperatures is one of the lowest in the world. Primary dangers of flooding from melting Arctic snow, even rising seas by 10cm, apply to Polynesian and Caribbean islands - not Ireland. We've less domestic downside dangers and will benefit less from diminished risks of droughts and forest fires. Each week, scientist Dr Cara Augustenborg educates me about everything environmental on our Newstalk radio slot 'Down To Earth'. Green politicians plus a network of 30-plus NGOs in the Stop Climate Chaos Coalition devote their entire energy into making mainstream politicians adopt eco-friendly philosophies and policies. These include specific measures like carbon taxes, banning fossil fuel exploration, phasing out diesel vehicles, waste to heat schemes and building regulations based on retrofit insulation. Mainstream pragmatic politicians focus on votes over causes. Short-term electoral pain for future generations' gain isn't a viable concept. Politicos are long on great intentions about 'sustainability', short on decisions. Successive environmental ministers waffle endlessly about their green credentials, applying St Augustine's principle of making me pure, just not yet. So we get lots of transition statements, national mitigation plans and sectoral adaptation plans that amount to hot air. The best example of this was the absence of carbon tax in the last Budget, despite it being promised. The current rate of carbon tax is (EURO)20 per tonne. It was anticipated to rise by 50pc or (EURO)10. But the incremental plan is to have carbon taxation of (EURO)100 per tonne by 2030. Realities for ordinary punters are that each (EURO)10 per tonne adds (EURO)1.05c onto a 40kg bag of coal, 25c on to a bale of turf briquettes and 2.7c onto a litre of petrol/diesel. So, adopting the full implementation model of a carbon tax to deter carbon usage means a cumulative top-up price of more than (EURO)10 on a bag of coal and 27c on fuel. In terms of crude politics, this amounts to potential fuel poverty for vulnerable elderly people's heating needs and penalising commuters travelling long distances throughout rural Ireland, without public transport options. Protesting yellow vests of Paris could readily become the green jerseys of domestic disaffection. The agriculture community, especially 70,000 beef farmers, (already under the cosh with Brexit) is told it's to blame for excessive methane levels, despite the most natural extensive grass-based systems of food production and increased afforestation acreage. The farmer backlash to Leo's ""eating less meat"" was both fearsome and derisory. Yet, among these stinging political nettles, there's a populist sweet spot. We want to avoid EU fines of up to (EURO)600m a year. We must reduce our carbon emissions by 7pc annually. Electricity generation is the single most important strategic sector relating to greenhouse gases, especially if we're all driving electric cars from 2030. Ireland is set to almost achieve the target of 40pc renewable-sourced electricity production by 2020. The success story of the last two decades has been wind energy, which is within touching distance of 4,000MW, employing 4,000 people, mostly in rural areas. Wind accounts for seven-eighths of our renewable electricity. It's a natural Irish resource, adjacent to the Atlantic. On Minister Richard Bruton's desk is a proposal that by 2030, 70pc of Ireland's electricity generation would come from renewable energy sources. We've barely scratched the surface of potential offshore turbines, because there's no planning regime nor connection agreements to allow marine-based windfarms to proceed. It's been described as another unique IFSC international opportunity for IRL Inc. There's been a transformation in improved community relations and a new code of practice to facilitate benefit payments locally to deliver up to (EURO)250m to neighbours of turbines. Through new technologies, Ireland can attain 7,000MW of wind energy by 2030, with added economic benefits of pushing down wholesale electricity prices. Our low-carbon transition is literally blowing in the wind. By the target of 2020, we'll be 15-20pc over our promised limit ; \"

""The performance in the GHG Emissions category is rated very low and the country is also occupying a spot among the low-ranking performers in the Energy Use category,"" the report states. Ireland did receive some credit for its climate policy, however.

However, the report warned that Ireland's existing efforts mean it will not achieve either its EU 2020 or 2030 targets which aims to limit global warming to below 2\'b0C. ""The long-standing lack of implementation of substantive measures to put the country on a well-below-2\'b0C pathway results in a very low rating for Ireland's national policy performance,"" the report says. A spokeswoman for the Department of Communications, Climate Action & Environment said the report ""reinforces the urgency"" of Minister Richard Bruton's plan to tackle climate change. ""Minister Bruton has already highlighted the fact that Ireland is far off course in our response to climate change. Since being appointed, he has secured government approval to develop an all-of-Government plan to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change. This plan will have actions across all sectors of society and will have timelines with clear lines of responsibility,"" she said.

"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland47","Why peatlands matter in the battle against climate change; Living peatlands sequester carbon-dioxide, drawing it down from the atmosphere through plants and tra....","December 6, 2018 Thursday","The Irish Times","Hans Joosten talks about raising the profile of peatlands in the climate-change crisis with the authority of an internationally respected scientist, the passion of an evangelical preacher - and a wicked sense of humour. He is trenchant about the cost, in human lives, livelihoods and biodiversity, of our mismanagement of peatlands. But he is still confident - or at least determinedly optimistic - that reformed management of these ecosystems could make a key contribution to fulfilling the aspirations of the Paris climate agreement. He is a partner in the Mire Centre at Greifswald University, Germany; one of the world's leading institutions in the peatlands field. He was a key participant in the UN IPCC research that paved the way to the Paris accord. He describes the treaty, despite its subsequent rejection by pivotal figures such as presidents Trump and Bolsonaro (Brazil), as ""a marvellous example of global governance . . . the best sign of global hope that we have had in the history of humankind"" But he doesn't hesitate to tell us that we are still going badly wrong, and points the finger close to home. ""In Germany, peatland agriculture causes climate damage of EUR 3.6 billion annually,"" he told a conference of the Society for Ecological Restoration (Europe) in Iceland recently, ""and gets EUR 300 million in EU grants. Biogas produced from maize [on peatlands] causes eight times more climate damage than burning lignite, but receives green energy subventions. The 'polluter pays' principle is put on its head."" To illustrate his point he showed a slide of a naked man upside down, buried to his shoulders in bog, other body parts flailing helplessly above him. However, he also argues that radically improved peatland management is the hidden ace in the bad hand that humanity has dealt itself in coping with climate change. Hidden, because those who should have known better have ignored it for far too long. Even today vast peatlands are still being ""discovered"" across the globe. It outrages Joosten that only three parties to the UN Paris climate agreement have mentioned peatlands in their NDCs (the national contributions they undertake towards slowing global warming). But why, you may still be wondering, should we be so concerned about peatlands in relation to climate change? Isn't the main cause of the crisis our addiction to fossil fuels, and our perverse insistence on swelling the numbers of flatulent cattle on the planet? And isn't planting trees everywhere the best answer? These factors are certainly very important, but they are only parts of the very big and complex climate equation, within which peatlands form a significant subset. Downside Of course, peat is itself a fossil fuel, and emits more greenhouse gases than coal when burned in our beloved turf fires. This point was fully acknowledged by Bord na M\'f3na's new chief executive, Tom Donnellan, when he recently took the difficult step of advancing the date for ceasing fuel production, with the downside of losing badly- needed rural jobs. But, as Irish scientists such as David Wilson have long been telling us, there's much more to global (and local) peatlands in the climate change stakes than leaving the bales of briquettes in the ground. In their (wet) natural state, living peatlands sequester carbon dioxide, drawing it down from the atmosphere through plants, especially Sphagnum mosses, and trapping it underground as carbon. Their capacity for this vital function in regulating climate is far greater than that of forests. This means that putting conifer plantations on our bogs is not a good idea. The disturbance involved in planting and harvesting releases carbon, and the trees dry out the bog. Joosten's mantra, repeatedly used in an interview with The Irish Times after the Iceland conference, is that ""peatlands must be wet"". In fairness, Bord na M\'f3na's ecology team has been clear about this idea for years. Restoring and rewetting peatlands to capture carbon features increasingly strongly, if not yet strongly enough, in the company's policy shift. ""A 15cm thick peat layer contains more carbon per hectare than a tropical forest,"" Joosten points out. Though peatlands form only 3 per cent of the planet's land surface, they are massive ""carbon sinks"", storing twice as much carbon as all standing forests. That's the good news, but the bad news is that many peatlands are no longer in their natural state. They have been drained for fuel, or for cultivation, and in these conditions they go into reverse in climate terms. They start releasing greenhouse gases, becoming sources instead of sinks for atmospheric carbon. Worldwide, peatlands converted to farmland now produce almost one third of all agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. Joosten warns that other problems follow: drained peatlands subside, and he predicts that subsidence will lead to the ""uncontrolled flooding of 10-20 million hectares of productive land in this century"". He argues against the farming lobbies who say that we must accept the sector's greenhouse gas emissions in return for ""food security"". He says the public must come to understand that ""agriculture on drained peatlands is much more costly for society"" than the radical alternative he proposes: rewetting these areas wherever possible to restore their capacity to capture carbon. Stores carbon Some critics, however, have argued that peatland restoration can actually have negative climate impacts. While rewetted peat stores carbon, it also releases methane, a much more potent greenhouse gas in the short term. However, Joosten insists the evidence shows the bottom line of peatlands climate accounting will be very favourable. Asked for an example of a country that has taken major steps to reform its peatland management, Joosten points to Indonesia. Having drained its peatlands very rapidly for decades, Jakarta has rewetted more land - 2,000sq km - in a year (2017) than all of Europe has done so far. What caused this policy reversal? ""The enormous fires of 2015 have opened the eyes of politics. There were 100,000 deaths, an estimated $20-40 billion in domestic damage. But we should avoid,"" he adds drily, ""this type of immiseration in the rest of the world.""

"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland48","Greta's glam mammy... and a climate of suspicion; She's the girl who's inspired millions with her green message. So why do cynics say there's more to her story ....","April 29, 2019 Monday","Irish Daily Mail","AS SHE belted out her single La Voix (The Voice) to a global audience of more than 122 million people - her tight, white dress showing Aevery curve of her tanned, toned body, and her long blonde hair glossing down her back - Malena Ernman looked every inch a 2009 Eurovision Song Contest hopeful. She was 38 years old, a classically-trained opera star famous in her home country of Sweden and keen to make the crossover into pop music. Indeed, another blonde Swede - with three fellow country bandmates - had won Eurovision in 1974. Of course, they were Abba and each of the group is now estimated to be worth (EURO)220 million. But, alas, it was not to be. In the event, Malena came 21st out of 25 - meaning she remained a strictly Swedish, rather than international, celebrity. Until recently that is. Because Malena is the mother of Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish schoolgirl with pigtails, Asperger syndrome, obsessive compulsive disorder and selective mutism whom, in just eight months, has become the global superstar of the climate change movement. The official story of Greta's rise to prominence has been well documented. Furious at the world's indifference to climate change, she started to skip school every Friday and plonked herself on the cobblestones outside the Swedish parliament with a hand-drawn wooden sign declaring 'skolstrejk f\'f6r klimatet' (school strike for climate). After passers-by started to share photos of her online, her message spread rapidly and soon inspired hundreds of thousands of children to go on school climate strikes around the world. Things moved quickly from there. United Nations Climate Change Conference in Poland last December, accusing them of leaving the burden of climate change with future generations. 'I don't want your hope. I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day,' she said. She has addressed the European Parliament, the World Economic Forum at Davos and met the Pope. MEANWHILE, corporate executives, politicians, presidents and prime ministers clamour for a selfie with the young activist. In a speech in the UK Parliament last Tuesday, she accused Britain of exploiting fossil fuels. Both Malena and Greta's father Svante- a former actor whose distant relative was a Nobel Prizewinning scientist who, in 1896, first calculated the greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide emissions - put their careers on hold to look after Greta and her younger sister Beata, 13, who has similar medical challenges. That has prompted some on social media to post spiteful comments - with bloggers claiming Greta's parents were making use of her illness for their own financial and political ends. Indeed, Malena has recently revealed that the family has received thousands of threats. Many critics accuse Malena and Svante, whose apartment has Sweeping views of the centre of Stockholm, of living vicariously through their daughter. Some say Malena has orchestrated her daughter's campaign with the help of her friend, PR guru and climate change activist Ingmar Rentzhog (whom she met at a Climate Council Day conference in Stockholm) to put herself back in the public eye. They claim Rentzhog's environmentally-aware PR firm We Don't Have Time sent a freelance photographer to the first day of Greta's solo strike outside the Swedish parliament last August. A photo was then posted of her clutching her hand-drawn wooden sign on the firm's Instagram and Facebook pages. Shortly after, Greta was invited on to Rentzhog's youth advisory board and the firm's value soared by (EURO)1 million. It was also pointed out that just three days after Greta's initial strike, there was an interview with her parents in Sweden's top broadsheet newspaper, Dagens Nyheter. Coincidentally, the following day Malena's memoir, Scenes From The Heart, about their family, climate change and sustainability was published. Incidentally, the cover has since been changed from a portrait of Malena to one of Greta. Some have been brazen in their scepticism. The leader of the far-Right Sweden Democrats party, Jimmie Akesson, has dismissed Greta's crusade as a 'staged promotional campaign' for the book. 'This isn't a spontaneous initiative, this is staged PR campaign, which the media has fallen for. That's how it is,' he said, adding: 'It's commonly known that there's a PR bureau behind this.' It goes without saying that Malena, Svante and Greta firmly deny all the allegations. Indeed her parents say they initially tried to dissuade Greta from her public campaign. Writing on Facebook, Malena said: 'We, as parents, advised her against it [the strike] and said we couldn't support her because we have to make sure she goes to school. 'She does not have and has never had anyone standing behind her telling her what to do ... she did all the planning herself. 'She has certainly had no help or support from any PR agency.' So why such scepticism from her critics? Perhaps because it is so hard to comprehend how a desperately shy, friendless teenager who was routinely bullied at school, could be challenging the world's natural order. Whatever the case, Greta is clearly very different to the rest of us. She is phenomenally bright, displays a total mastery of climate science in interviews, and always maintains that she is her own young woman. Naturally, she embraced the need to turn off unwanted lights, save water and use up surplus food. But she couldn't understand why, if there really was a problem, so little action had been taken by politicians. 'At first when I heard about climate change, I was a climate denier,' she has said. 'I didn't think it was happening. Because if there really was an existential crisis like that, that would threaten our civilisation, we wouldn't be focusing on anything else. 'That would be our first priority. So I didn't understand how that added up.' So she got to work on solving the problem herself - researching climate change with extraordinary focus until she found she couldn't stop. She became a vegan, refused to fly anywhere, stopped buying anything non-essential - then sank into chronic depression. 'I was so sad because the world was so wrong, everything was so wrong, and then I thought there is no point in living...I became depressed,' she said. She stopped talking, other than to her parents, sister Beata and one teacher. Then she stopped going to school and cut herself off from the few friends she had. Next, she gave up food. For a two-month period while aged 11, she stopped eating all together. Her heart-rate and blood pressure showed signs of starvation, she lost 22lb and her growth was stunted. This explains her tiny stature. Her parents, who married in 2004 shortly after Greta was born, must have been deeply worried. Meanwhile Beata, now 13, also has Asperger's, ADHD and OCD. Lord knows how Malena and Svante coped. While battling for their daughters to receive the best available care, Malena continued performing as an opera star while Svante managed her career. The family maintain that it was only when Greta started persuading her parents to join her cause that things started looking up. 'Some people claim my parents have brainwashed me, but it was the opposite. I brainwashed them,' she has said. Soon they'd bought an electric car, become vegans (though Malena apparently still sneaks a chunk of cheese), started to grow their own vegetables and stopped buying non-essentials. In 2016 they decided to stop travelling on planes - which effectively ended Malena's international career. Whether their 'green' actions were the reasons or not, Greta began to recover. 'I have a few scientists that I frequently ask for help on how to express certain complicated matters. I want everything to be absolutely correct so I don't spread incorrect facts, or things that can be misunderstood,' she said. Meanwhile, Greta and her family insist she was simply in the right place at a bleak time for the planet. Global emissions of carbon dioxide hit a new high last year, despite decades of climate negotiations. The last five years are the hottest since modern records began. A string of natural disasters have made matters worse and a report from scientists convened by the UN claimed that the world is less than 11 years away from irreversible climate change impacts. It helps that Greta's message is gloriously simple. She says her Asperger's makes her see things in unyielding black and white and push on in unrelenting pursuit of a solution. Greta routinely spends 15 to 20-hour days writing speeches and researching environmental developments, all around her school work. (It goes without saying that she's top of her class and is considering taking a year's sabbatical from school to focus on her campaigning.) To be at the centre of such a vicious media swirl must be extraordinarily tough for an innately shy 16-year-old. Using philosophic language beyond her years, she says: 'All my life I've been invisible, the invisible girl in the back who doesn't say anything,' she said. '[Now] from one day to another, people listen to me. That's a weird contrast. It's hard.' She's getting better at it, but will always be happier discussing climate change, emissions targets, her Asperger's - anything but small talk, which she will never master - and says her life is 'quite exhausting'. Whatever is or is not going on behind the scenes, such is Greta Thunberg's black-and-white approach to everything that her brain doesn't allow for inconsistency. And therein lies a problem. For, increasingly, the fraught climate change debate isn't black and white. GOVERNMENTS have not been doing nothing to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, as she insists. More than 30 years ago, they set up the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) specifically to advise them on climate change - and have sought its advice ever since, most recently on what must be done to limit global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees Celsius. And no one, not even Greta Thunberg (or her mother) can answer the billion-dollar question: how in our high-tech world we can reduce global emissions by 50 per cent by 2025? Or, far more pressingly, who will pay for it? It is of course wonderful that this Swedish schoolgirl is proving an inspiration to the world, but what a shame it's tinged with cynicism from some quarters. Let's hope that, as she runs herself ragged in a bid to protect us all from climatic catastrophe, her parents and all who surround her have Greta's very best interests at heart. \"
"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland49","Health benefits a selling point of climate action; Pace of response to climate change will shape world health for centuries to come","December 6, 2018 Thursday","The Irish Times","This year has been filled with reports about the catastrophic effects of climate change - extreme flooding, prolonged periods of drought, record-breaking heatwaves and crop failures which threaten food supplies. And while more and more people are now alert to the global risks of runaway climate change, many still lack the incentive to change their behaviours to reduce the harmful greenhouse gas emissions that create the problem. Some experts argue that we feel disempowered when facing the doom and gloom messages of more frequent extreme weather events. And, the common response to disempowerment is disengagement. But, what if policymakers - and more importantly politicians - started to talk about how responding to climate change could in fact improve the health of our communities in ways that most of us haven't yet taken on board. So, for example, we now know that travelling by public transport instead of using diesel or petrol cars will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, but what if we also realised that it would reduce common respiratory diseases such as emphysema, asthma and bronchitis? We know that insulating our home will cut our energy bills but consider also the reduction in influenza, colds and respiratory infections with warmer, cosier homes. Switching from fossil fuel heating systems to ones fuelled by renewable energies will also mean better indoor air quality. Research collaboration Research into these so-called health co-benefits of responding to climate change has been central to the work of the Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change, a research collaboration between 27 different academic institutions, intergovernmental agencies and the United Nations. Their latest report - released in advance of COP 24 , the UN Climate Change conference being held in Poland this week - points out that older people in Europe are now more vulnerable to heatwaves than those in Africa and southeast Asia. And, the warmer it is, the more easily infectious diseases spread (for example, the rise in Lyme disease in Ireland). Some 51 per cent of more than 450 cities surveyed expect climate change to seriously compromise their public health infrastructure. The commission has called climate change a medical emergency but has also said that a comprehensive response ""could be the greatest global health opportunity of the 21st century"". Prof Hugh Montgomery, director of the institute for human health and performance at University College London says climate change threatens to undermine the last 50 years of public health gains. But he also says that if more people walk to work or walk to get public transport - the levels of obesity and type 2 diabetes will fall. There will also be fewer deaths from strokes and heart disease, less peripheral vascular disease, less osteoporosis, less cancer and lower levels of dementia. Budgets Researchers working for the Lancet commission say the form and pace of the world's response to climate change will shape the health of nations for centuries to come. The latest Lancet Countdown Report states ""at a time when national health budgets and health services face a growing epidemic of lifestyle disease, continued delay in unlocking the potential health co-benefits of climate change mitigation is short-sighted and damaging to human health"". Another study, published in the Lancet in March, found that the health benefits of reducing air pollution and pollution-related diseases significantly outweigh the costs of mitigation measures across the world. In Ireland, the Environmental Protection Agency has teamed up with the Health Service Executive for the last three years to explore the health co-benefits that flow from policy action on climate change - such as better air quality, water protection, sustainable consumption and production. Put bluntly, the vast bulk of research concludes that responding to climate change is quite simply also good for our health. Now is the time for policymakers and politicians to start talking about the health co-benefits of responding to climate change and for the rest of us to start changing our behaviour. Sylvia Thompson writes for The Irish Times on health and other issues \"

"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland51","Agribusiness finds it's not easy going green; FARMING ; Action needed as Ireland faces threat of huge EU fines for missing emission targets, writes Ailish O'Hor....","December 9, 2018","Sunday Independent","THE Government is facing a number of challenges as we enter 2019. And while Brexit is one of the biggest, another is how to square the circle of protecting and growing our agribusiness sector while meeting EU environment commitments and targets that we have already signed up to. While protecting the environment is a global issue, Ireland has committed to ambitious 2030 climate and energy targets, where all sectors, including agriculture, have to make a contribution. These EU targets include a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 40pc by 2030, based on 1990 levels; to have 32pc renewables in our energy mix and to improve energy efficiency by 32.5pc The Commission also plans to adopt a longterm EU strategy to achieve zero-emissions by 2050. In addition, failure to meet targets set for 2020 would mean hundreds of millions of euro in fines. Unfortunately, it is the Irish economy's focus on beef and dairy that is one of the key components of our emissions problems. Ruminants, such as cattle, produce carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), livestock are responsible for 14.5pc of global greenhouse gas emissions. Some experts put the livestock sector up there with transport in relation to emissions. For example, the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says the transport sector is responsible for 14pc of emissions. And while scientists across the globe are working on ways to reduce those emissions including the breeding animals that burp less by adjusting their diets, given our current Government policy it would seem that we are on a collision course with the EU as we struggle to meet these targets. A key plank of Government agriculture policy is Food Wise 2025 under the subtitle Local Roots, Global Reach, reflecting the emphasis on export. According to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Food Wise 2025 identifies ambitious and challenging growth projections for the industry over the next 10 years including an 85pc increase in exports to (EURO)19bn as well as a 65pc hike in primary production to (EURO)10bn, plus the creation of 23,000 jobs along the supply chain. But increasing exports means increasing the size of herds - and that means more emissions, while the removal of milk quotas here has also resulted in big increases in the size of dairy herds. ""Food Wise 2025 recognises that a significant increase in food production cannot be considered in isolation from its environmental impact, particularly in relation to the depletion of natural resources and the potential impact on climate change,"" Hogan told the Sunday Independent. ""But there is a gulf between this welcome rhetoric and the operational reality. The Environmental Protection Agency has warned that Ireland needs to adopt a much greater sense of urgency about reducing its dependence on fossil fuels after official figures showed a 3.5pc increase in greenhouse gas emissions in 2016. ""Ireland is one of only four countries in the European area where greenhouse gas emissions are still above 1990 levels. A failure to tackle the issue could cost the country large sums of money in relation to carbon credits by 2020,"" he said. There is no question that the agribusiness sector is a significant contributor to our economy and it needs to be respected as we navigate these choppy climate commitments. For example, agri-food exports in 2017 were (EURO)13.6bn, an increase of 11pc over 2016 including beef access to China and the opening of the Qatari market to beef, lamb and poultry. There are 300,000 people employed in the agriculture industry. In addition, our reputation as a quality food producer with high standards of food safety and traceability needs to be maintained - there's a reason why Kerrygold is a household name in other countries and our rolling green fields with happily grazing cows are used to sell Ireland. But it seems there is a Government policy malfunction in relation to marrying environmental commitments and the development of the agriculture industry. ""Farmers need government support to be there and that support hasn't been there - you need farmer and community participation when it comes to policy,"" said Joe Healy, president of the Irish Farmers Association. ""We need the various links in the chain to be joined up. We've requested the Taoiseach to provide the climate leadership required by coordinating a 'whole of government' approach to the delivery of climate abatement potential of the Teagasc climate roadmap which is a scientific report that contains 27 measures that the agri-sector can implement with the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by nine megatonnes of Co2 equivalents by 2030. ""It can be very frustrating for farmers when they hear European officials pontificate on climate change and the need for farmers to get real at the same time as the European Commission for Trade, Cecilia Malmstrom, is doing all in her power to negotiate a trade deal with Mercosur countries of South America where, for example, in Brazil they are four times less carbon efficient than Europe in the production of beef. ""Climate change is a global issue, we are the most carbon-efficient producers of dairy product in Europe and the top five in beef and if we don't produce those products to satisfy the growing demand from an increasing world population, less efficient countries will produce it,"" he added. He believes that sometimes it seems that farming is an easy target when it comes to environmental issues, as there are other contributors like the energy and transport sectors. The agriculture sector is already facing challenges in relation to farm incomes and the potential impact of Brexit on food prices but according to environmental scientist Dr Cara Augustenborg, many farmers are willing to make changes but need help in relation to diversification planning, and other areas. ""Many of the farmers I talk to are eager to do something and are looking for ways to diversify out of intensified beef and dairy,"" she said. ""But we do need to change the model. It isn't working. We should be looking more at renewables and biogas too."" While at an early stage and small scale, there are plans to use cattle slurry to produce enough gas to power 56,000 homes in Mitchelstown, Co Cork. Gas Networks Ireland (GNI) has confirmed its multi-million plan to pump the renewable gas into the national grid near the north Cork town. Its large number of cattle as well as access to the national grid made Mitchelstown the choice for the plant. The IFA's Healy also pointed out that there are other programmes in place and being developed to make the agriculture industry more environmentally friendly. Its Smart Farming Programme is run in association with the EPA, and involves farmers participating in carbon monitoring while Bord Bia's has its Origin Programme and forestry is also used as a way to mitigate emissions. ""We cannot ignore climate change, the farming community saw that with the fodder crises in the past and it is a global problem,"" said Augustenborg. ""As long as we keep increasing herd sizes we keep increasing absolute emissions but no matter how efficient we make agri production it will make no difference. That's been the problem with the narrative from the agribusiness side for a long time,"" she added. So it seems there's recognition from all sides that we need a joined-up plan in order to address the problems facing the agriculture industry if it is to meet EU targets. Finding a palatable way for taxpayers to address the climate change issue and pay the price might need to involve a carrot approach, for example, carbon credits as is the Canada plan. The momentum is growing for changes worldwide and, earlier this month, environmentalist David Attenborough urged world leaders to tackle ""our greatest threat in thousands of years"" at the COP24 summit in Poland. In the meantime, Hogan said that the European Commission Common Agriculture Programme reform proposal for 2021 to 2027 can be a help for Ireland. ""The proposal aims to increase the environmental performance of the Cap in relation to three clear objectives: contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as sustainable energy; fostering sustainable development and efficient management of natural resources such as water, soil and air; and contributing to the protection of biodiversity, enhanced ecosystem services and preservation of our habitats and landscapes,"" he said. ""A new delivery model fundamentally redesigns not only the tools to achieve better climate and environment outcomes, but also, crucially, the designation of responsibility. ""The goal is to increase flexibility and enhance effectiveness by ensuring that problems are addressed at a level where they are best understood. ""So instead of complying with a standard list of requirements from Brussels, Irish farmers and other key stakeholders will have the opportunity to be involved in the process of identifying local climate and environment challenges and outlining the best way to take action in a national 'Cap Strategic Plan'."" 6.9 million ; ; hectares in Ireland ; ; 4.5 million ; ; hectares dedicated ; ; to agriculture ; ; 730,000 ; ; hectares of forestry ; ; (EURO)13.6bn ; ; agri-food exports in ; ; 2017 ; ; AGRI-BUSINESS BY THE NUMBERS ; \"
"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland52","Climate change is fundamentally a moral issue","December 14, 2018 Friday","The Irish Times","Sir, - The Minister for Climate Action and the Environment Richard Bruton has said that we require a ""revolution in how we live"" in order to combat climate change. We welcome this acknowledgement and the recent steps he has taken. We hope that his resolve to take meaningful action will be strengthened as the COP 24 climate conference comes to a close in Katowice, Poland. We write from a faith perspective. Inspired by the leadership of Pope Francis expressed in his ecological encyclical Laudato Si , which he addressed to all the peoples of the world, we believe that all are stewards of the Earth with a duty of care. Many of our religious congregations are working in countries where climate change has already caused destruction through droughts, typhoons and rising seas. The situation will get worse if the average global temperature rises above 1.5 degrees Celsius of pre-industrial levels. At present we are hurtling towards 3 or 4 degrees of warming. This will be catastrophic and Ireland, at present, is one of the worst contributors. Ireland emits the same amount of greenhouse gases as the 400 million poorest people on Earth. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is fundamentally a moral issue. Ireland is failing to meet its obligation to take action on climate change: according the Climate Change Performance Index, published on December 10th, Ireland ranks worst in the EU, and without radical change we will fail to meet both our 2020 and 2030 targets. At the summit in Poland, renowned naturalist and broadcaster David Attenborough called on leaders to take action: ""The continuation of our civilisations, and the natural world upon which we depend, is in your hands."" We too believe that real political leadership is needed to get our country's efforts back on track. People will remember that over the past decade the Irish Government insisted on our obligation to repay irresponsible bank debts, no matter the level of austerity required. The responsibilities arising from Government commitments to safeguard and protect the earth, our common home, must be treated just as seriously. If we could do what was needed to protect the banking system, surely we can do what is needed to protect the environment and our eco-systems. In signing the 2015 Paris Agreement, Ireland committed to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions to specified levels by 2020 and 2030. Our target for 2020 is to achieve a 20 per cent reduction of non-ETS (Emissions Trading Scheme) emissions. However, the Environmental Protection Agency reported that Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions were actually 300 million tonnes over the limit in 2017. According to the Department of Climate Action and Environment itself, we will fall short of our targets unless we take decisive action: ""It is clear that further policies and measures beyond those that are already in place will be necessary to address compliance with Ireland's obligations"". Irish people recognise the need for effective action on climate change, and we understand that the costs will be much higher if we delay. The Citizens' Assembly expressed this concern, and laid out 13 recommendations that would aid the State in achieving its targets. These recommendations stressed the need to place climate change considerations at the centre of policy-making, to address energy policy, transport policy, and agricultural and land use policy. We urge the Government to implement the recommendations immediately. Paying for climate change is unavoidable: penalties and fines are inevitable. The cost to Ireland of missing our targets is estimated at EUR 600 million per annum from 2021 to 2030, as stated by Joseph Curtin of UCC at an Oireachtas Committee hearing on May 16th. However, spending tax-money to pay fines instead of tackling the problem is totally unacceptable. We believe that, if necessary, green bonds, newly announced by the NTMA, should be used to borrow the funding required to implement the appropriate measures to meet our targets. This is infinitely preferable to the alternative of missing our agreed targets, facing the environmental consequences, and paying the penalties. As Mr Bruton assumes stewardship of his new department, he has the opportunity to refocus the Government's efforts; to constantly press Cabinet to put our common home front and centre of all Government policy; to make up for our shortfalls; and to meet our national target to reduce our carbon emissions and achieve a carbon neutral economy by 2050. As the summit in Katowice comes to a close, our work is only beginning. We sincerely wish Mr Bruton well, and offer him our full support in the urgent work that needs to be done. - Yours, etc, Sr KATHLEEN McGARVEY, Provincial Leader, Sisters of Our Lady of Apostles; Fr MAURICE HENRY, JPIC Coordinator, Society of African Missions; Justice Coordinator, Association of Leaders of Missionaries and Religious of Ireland; Sr TR\'cdONA O'DRISCOLL, Brigidine Sisters; Fr RAYMOND HUSBAND, Regional Director, Columban Missionaries; Fr RUBEN PADILLA, Community Superior, Sr ANNETTE BYRNE, Provincial, Congregation of Our Lady of the Cenacle; Fr DAN BARAGRY, Provincial, Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer (Redemptorists); Sr JOAN RODDY, Regional Team Member, Daughters of Mary and Joseph; Sr KATHLEEN MURPHY, Country Leader, Franciscan Missionaries of the Divine Motherhood; Abbot BRENDAN COFFEY, Glenstal Abbey (Order of St Benedict); Fr MARTIN KELLY, Provincial, Holy Spirit Congregation (Spiritans); and 28 others.

"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland53","Irish agriculture must address the challenge of environmental sustainability","March 19, 2019","Eolas Magazine","Forget Brexit as the core challenge facing agriculture in Ireland over the coming years. Given the scope of the recent reports on climate change from the UN, dealing with the fast-changing demands on how the world produces its food, environmental sustainability will be the real nut to crack for Irish farmers as they plan ahead, writes Richard Halleron. Worryingly, the UN is calling for a move away from animal-based food production systems. This is a policy shift that does not fit in with the agribusiness models followed in Ireland, given farmers' strong reliance on beef, dairy and sheep production systems. At the same time, it's far from bad news, given Ireland's reliance on grass-based production systems. In fact, it could be argued that Ireland has always hidden its light under a bushel, where this is concerned. The reality is that long-term pasture represents a 'carbon sink' of immense proportions. However, it's now certain that Irish farmers and their representatives will have to tell the world just how good our grass-based production model really is, from a climate change perspective, that's if we want to continue as is in regard to farming. The other reality, of course, is that Irish farmers do not have an alternative to grass. It is the country's greatest asset and one that must be developed sustainably over the coming years. All the research carried out over recent decades confirms just how much Irish farmers can add to the value of the country's farming output simply by making better use of grass and silage. This can be achieved in ways that do not in any way compromise the targets set within the latest climate change recommendations from the UN, but, again, unless Ireland tell the world this is actually the case, the country's cause could be lost amid the general clamour that will surely follow to put further pressure on animal-based production systems. Production agriculture employs many thousands of people in those areas of the country where jobs are needed most. Moreover, the sector underpins the entire food processing sector, another key component of the Irish economy. There is too much to risk by not actively participating in the climate change debate. The time to start arguing these points is now, not in a decade's time when the real decisions on how the world reacts to global warming have already been taken. Adding to the concerns of Irish farmers will be the recent report from the EAT-Lancet Commission, which has put international pressure on red meat consumption levels. Specifically, it cites red meat as being unhealthy and recommends that consumption of beef should be reduced drastically both as a means of improving human health and countering the challenge of global warming. Eating one steak a month or one hamburger per week are cited as acceptable levels of red meat consumption for the future. The Commission convenes leading global researchers from diverse scientific disciplines. Their mission is to advance the development of scientific targets for healthy diets from environmentally sustainable food production. According to the report, international food systems have the potential to nurture human health and support environmental sustainability. Changes in food production and consumption patterns will be required in order to make this a reality, with the publication addressing the need to feed a growing global population a healthy diet while also defining sustainable food systems that will minimise damage to our planet. The Commission quantitively describes a universal healthy reference diet, based on an increase in the consumption of healthy foods (such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, and nuts), and a decrease in consumption of unhealthy foods (such as red meat, sugar, and refined grains) that would provide major health benefits, and also increase the likelihood of attainment of the sustainable development goals. Teagasc director Gerry Boyle is quick to confirm the challenge of global warming facing Irish farming. He says: ""At present, with the uncertainties in world affairs, we need to improve our energy security by reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. In the longer term we need to tackle global warming by reducing the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. ""At an individual farm level an investment in energy efficiency or renewable technologies will reduce the high cost of energy inputs. It will also give a green image to our production that is of increasing importance in the market-place."" The Teagasc director adds that global demand for food will rise over the coming decades due to increasing population, income and per capita consumption trends. ""This global landscape presents opportunities and challenges for food producers in Ireland at all levels from the larger export-oriented companies to the smaller local producers. ""Ireland's food system at national and local level cannot be isolated from these global challenges. Indeed, global food supplies and prices are of growing importance in all countries and food security in Ireland will increasingly have to be addressed within a global market place through the development of a more innovative and competitive industry."" Boyle says that this will require action at all levels of the food system, with high quality research and innovation critical in meeting these challenges, as well as promoting a thriving business sector to increase economic productivity and sustainability. Meanwhile, Ireland's Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine Michael Creed TD recognises that the country's economy is heavily reliant on agriculture. Speaking at the December 2018 COP 24 climate change conference in Poland, he said that Irish agriculture has been very successful at decoupling emissions from output. He adds: ""I am very aware that in recent years we have seen an increase in our overall emissions. The Irish Environmental Protection Agency has recently published the latest provisional greenhouse gas emissions figures and has confirmed a trend of increasing agriculture emissions. ""Reducing emissions is challenging and it is a challenge the sector must engage with. While we already have an efficient and productive agricultural system, there is no room for complacency. We must continue to make improvements in terms of sustainability and environmental performance on all our farms."" With regard to what Ireland is doing in order to address the climate change challenge, the minister confirmed that that agriculture must be part of the solution. ""It has a key role to play in transitioning to a competitive, low carbon, climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050,"" he explains. ""The long-term vision for the agricultural sector is an approach to carbon neutrality which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production. ""While carbon neutrality is yet to be fully defined we are looking at taking a three-legged stool approach: reducing agricultural emissions in so far as we can, increasing carbon sequestration while increasing fossil fuel substitution."" \"
"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland54","Carbon crusader impatient for change; No-nonsense founder of Crowley Carbon believes inventive entrepreneurs rather than governments provide green alternatives","April 26, 2019 Friday","The Irish Times","""We don't fk the customer."" The blunt sales message boldly adorns the wall of Norman Crowley's second floor office, between two sash windows overlooking the pristine gardens of Powerscourt Estate in Co Wicklow. The mantra is fitting of the man, a tech entrepreneur whose focus has shifted to the environment in the past decade. So is its juxtaposition with such a landmark Irish vista. Crowley's persona is that of a no-nonsense sweary ass-kicker from Cork, mischievously irreverent to the business establishment. Yet Crowley is also endearingly pleasant and polite. Unnoticed by the tourists perusing the impressive gardens, Crowley's environmental empire is run from the second floor of the historic house. For the last nine years the serial entrepreneur has set his sights on saving the planet, and making a healthy profit along the way. The tone of his office maxim is perhaps a reflection of his impatience, which chimes with another message on the walls of Crowley Carbon, this time from the far less profane, but equally impatient 16-year-old Swede Greta Thunberg. ""We have not come here to beg the world leaders to care for our future. They have ignored us in the past and they will ignore us again. We have come here to let them know that change is coming whether they like it or not."" Thunberg, the teenage environmental activist who has shot to fame over the past six months, delivered this message to world leaders at the COP24 conference in Poland last December. Despite his evident admiration for Thunberg, he has no time for the recent Extinction Rebellion protests. ""It's more of the same st that hasn't worked. I'm slightly conflicted by it because I greatly admire Greta Thunberg's work, and I'm a big fan of her efforts, it's stunning to watch, but I think the extinction plan is flawed."" Political will Does it not at least draw attention to the crisis at hand? ""I think in solving climate change we have a lack of technology and a lack of engineering, we don't have a lack of complaints. And the political will isn't going to change, so the willingness of politicians is not going to fix this problem in time. What will fix this problem in time are inventions, and that is what we deeply lack. We are now starting to get there but we need to move so much faster. So having a march - I admire those people - but it's not solving the problem. ""Yes, government can do more than it is doing, but technology can do 50 times more to achieve this, so our tendency is to blame government, but actually it is in our own hands to solve this and it will be solved by our own hands, it won't be solved by government, certainly not in Ireland."" Born on a farm in west Cork and trained as a welder, Crowley's entrepreneurial roots are in tech. Having started and sold his internet business, Trinity Commerce, for EUR 18 million at 29 years of age, he went on to set up Inspired Gaming Group in 2001. It was eventually floated on the London Stock Exchange in 2006 with revenues of $500 million and profits of $100 million. By then he had also met UK investor George Polk and created The Cloud, which went on to become Europe's largest wifi hotspot provider, which was bought by Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB for $80 million in 2011. He points to Polk's interest in environmental issues, along with watching Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth at the time, as the turning point. Crowley Carbon was born in 2011, with Polk as chairman. Its business is to help companies dramatically cut their energy usage. With a client list of global multinationals from every sector of business and the energy waste issue centre stage, he says it's a hectic time for his company right now. ""China is insane, as is India. Australia, which we thought would be a slow burner, has become an absolute monster for us. ""Crowley Carbon is a machine at this point and it's just about how fast we can expand. This business now has a different set of problems to the start-ups. The issues for the company today are getting the people in fast enough: the right locations and the right people."" That morning the head of the company's Dubai office phoned him with news they had just finished a project with food giant BRF at its plant in Abu Dhabi. It had taken three of his team working 11 days to save the plant 174 megawatts an hour. ""That's the equivalent of a small power plant,"" says Crowley. That day BRF posted on its Facebook page that by adopting the new energy system at the Abu Dhabi plant it was saving enough power to supply more than 4,500 mid-size homes. Crowley says at this stage he is less concerned with companies choosing his rivals - of which he says there are surprisingly few - and more with businesses that don't make the effort to change. ""Doing nothing is really not appropriate now. Financially, it's irresponsible and morally it's irresponsible."" The basis for Crowley Carbon is to make financial sense for the client at the same time as making environmental sense for the climate. ""Our job is to make better products so that these changes, they can become more obvious to them."" Crowley believes the same principles apply to consumers these days. ""The example we always use is a fictional family in Leixlip: she works in Intel and he works in Pfizer. Combined they earn about EUR 110,000 between them, so they are the Irish middle class. What is it that they can do? Well, 15 years ago they really couldn't do that much that was practical about climate change, unless you wanted to be a raving hippie. Now, they probably buy one electric car, they can put solar on the roof of their house and they can get a financial return for that, they can probably go vegetarian a couple of days a week and not suffer too much hardship."" Lifestyle change The Leixlip family's lifestyle change touches on two of Crowley's latest projects. In recent weeks he announced plans for his new electric car start-up, Electrifi, to build a factory on the Powerscourt site that will initially retrofit classic cars to run on electric power. It will employ 150 staff but that's just the start. He foresees a future where Electrifi will develop its own high-end models, low volume but with very high margins, the business modelled on the McLaren sports car set-up in the UK. As part of its entry to the market, Crowley took a 30 per cent stake in an established player in the market, the Electric Classic Cars (ECC) in Wales. Part of the EUR 50 million investment in the start-up was to deliver a new factory to ECC. So why does Electrifi need another factory here? ""Because we are an Irish company and we see our responsibilities to Ireland. We take that seriously. So we are going to do something in Powerscourt, but over the next three years we are probably going to do another car factory in a lower cost Irish location, if there is a low-cost Irish location - we don't know where that is yet."" The fictional Leixlip family's move to vegetarianism a few days a week is Crowley's other opportunity. He has a ""meatless meat"" start-up in the pipeline, which will come to market next year. Inspired by the likes of Beyond Meat, which is due to float on the stock exchange in the US in the coming months, Crowley says: ""We have all the actors in place to make it happen. We're not doing this on our own. There is one Irish and one international partner, both high-profile food giants. The level of investment is in tens of millions."" He dismisses the suggestion that consumers are still cynical about such products. ""I do a lot of public speaking on entrepreneurship and climate change and we do it to some big crowds. I started to do a thing lately where I say 'your energy will come from solar within 10 years, you will be driving an electric car within 10 years, half of your current meat diet will be 'meatless' within 10 years'. In a crowd of 400 people you can hear titters and sniggers. Well, if you're laughing at me when I'm saying this you are going to lose a lot of money in the next 10 years. That's not because I'm right, just look at the data. It's shocking. And it's all pointing this way."" Crowley has a reputation for selling his businesses after 10 years. This time it's different. He's staying put at Crowley Carbon. ""We normally sell around the 10th anniversary and it was a big decision for us. We were turning down a very attractive offer at the time - and there is a lot of money in this sector. The big guys want to come in and buy companies like us so when we said okay we're going to do another 10 years at least, then we have to make it more sustainable and take a look at how we build the team so they can be sustainable as well."" As for a flotation, Crowley says: ""No, that's the thing that could take us down. We have access to capital if we need it: but the business throws off enough money to finance the start-ups."" Crowley admits to being an optimistic environmentalist. It has changed his perspective on life. ""I was all about making money in the first 20 years and it was really only George [Polk], our chairman who woke me up. ""I don't have aspirations to be a billionaire. I don't know a lot of happy billionaires."" Paranoid billionaires Instead, there are a lot more paranoid billionaires. Richard Branson is one of the exceptions. ""Branson is one of the few happy billionaires out there."" His admiration for Branson is also evidenced in his office. A photograph of Branson opening Crowley's Cool Planet Experience at Powerscourt hangs on the wall. The world's first visitor centre dedicated to climate change was opened last year by the Virgin Atlantic founder. A more historic hero also has pride of place in the otherwise uncluttered Powerscourt office: a small statue of Michael Collins sits on Crowley's desk. It's a replica of the Collins statue in Clonakilty, which Crowley and his brother Tim helped to fund. Along with running the family farm, Tim also runs the Michael Collins Centre in Castleview. Their grandfather, also Tim, was arrested in west Cork in 1916 and jailed in Frongoch prison in Wales with Collins and a few more locals. He was released a few months later. ""You see, revolution is in the blood."" CV Name: Norman Crowley, founder and chief executive of Crowley Carbon Age: 48 Family: Married to wife Anne, with two children, Danni (18) and Alannah (20) Something you might expect: Crowley drives a Tesla and is awaiting completion of a EUR 1.4 million zero emissions electric conversion of a Lamborghini Countach. Something that might surprise: Norman Crowley's grandfather was arrested in west Cork in 1916 and jailed in Frongoch prison with Michael Collins ""and a few other local lads"". In 2001 a statue of Collins was part funded by the family and unveiled by Liam Neeson a year later. \"
"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland55","Swedish teen Greta inspiring a real climate for change","March 15, 2019 Friday 11:03 PM GMT","RTE News","""You say you love your children above all else. Yet you are stealing their future in front of their very eyes. Until you start focusing on what needs to be done rather than on what is politically possible there is no hope."" Those are the words of the now 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg addressing world leaders at the COP 24 climate negotiations at Katowice in Poland just three months ago. Greta is a Swedish girl from Stockholm. She speaks truth to power about the climate crisis with stunning clarity, devastating frankness and remarkable intelligence. Her words and her actions alone since last August have sparked a global movement and inspired young people and old people in every corner of the world to take to the street demanding climate action. School children in 105 countries and 1,600 cities around the world including at multiple locations here in Ireland are taking part in today\' s Global School Strike for climate action. This is a rapidly growing international movement that flowed from Greta\' s individual decision on 20 August last year to take Friday off school to sit on the ground outside the Swedish Parliament Building in Stockholm demanding change. In her interviews Greta comes across as blunt, honest and very smart. ""I was diagnosed Asperger\' s Syndrome, OCD and selective muteism"", she said in a recent TED Talk. ""It basically means that I only speak when I think it is absolutely necessary. Now is one of those moments. ""For those of us who are on the spectrum almost everything is black and white"", she added . ""We aren\' t very good at lying and we don\' t participate in the social games that the rest of you are so fond of."" About the fact that so many school children around the world are now following her lead Greta has this to say. ""I think it\' s amazing to see that hundreds of thousands of children all around the world are realising that we are facing an existential climate crisis and are fighting for their future, making their voices heard, and saying why should we go to school and study for a future that may not exist anymore. ""We need to hold the older generation accountable for what they are doing to us. I think that\' s the main thing."" There is little doubt that this movement which has grown with lightening speed is making politicians and big business everywhere nervous. It is difficult for them to know how to react in the face of a younger generation who don\' t yet have the right to vote but are determined to have their say. And gosh do they have some import stuff they want to say. ""For way too long the politicians and the people in power have gotten away with not doing anything to fight the climate crisis. We will make sure that they will not get away with it any longer. We will continue to school strike until they do something."" That was Greta speaking to EU politicians earlier this year. ""People always tell us that they are so hopeful, they are hopeful that the young people are going to save the world. But we are not. There is simply not enough time to wait for us to grow up and become the ones in charge. Because by the year 2020 We need to have bended the (greenhouse gas) emission curve steeply downwards. That is next year. ""We know that most politicians don\' t want to talk to us. Good. We don\' t want to talk to them either. We want them to talk to the scientists instead. Listen to them. Because we are just repeating what they are saying and have been saying for decades. ""We want you to follow the Paris Agreement and the IPCC reports. We don\' t have any other manifestos or demands. Just to unite behind the science that is our demand."" And it is not just the politicians that the young people striking today are taking aim it. It is the media too. That was made clear by Greta in this comment she gave to Rolling Stone magazine. ""On climate change we have to acknowledge that we have failed. All political movements in their present form have done so. And the media has failed to create broader public awareness. But Homo sapiens have not yet failed. Yes we are failing but there is still time to turn everything around we can still fix this. ""We still have everything in our own hands. But unless we recognise the overall failures of our current systems then we most probably don\' t stand a chance. We are facing a disaster of unspoken sufferings for enormous amounts of people. Now is not the time for speaking politely and focusing on what we can or cannot say. Now is the time to speak clearly."" For those who feel uneasy about the sight of hundreds of thousands of children worldwide taking the day off school to throw their weight and support behind everything Greta Thunberg has articulated it might be well to bear in mind, not just that this young lady has just been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, but that she has rocked some solid answers for her detractors. ""If you think that we should be in school (rather than out on the streets protesting) then we suggest that you should take our place in the streets, striking from your work, or better yet join us so we can speed up the process. We have started to clean up your mess and we will not stop until we are done."" Perhaps even stronger was contribution she made on this issue during her TED talk referred to earlier. ""Some people say that I should be in school instead. Some people say that I should study to be a climate scientist. So that I can solve the climate crisis. But the climate crisis has already been solved. We already have all the facts and solutions. ""All we have to do is to wake up and change. And why should I be studying for a future that will soon be no more, when no one is doing anything whatsoever to save the future. And what is the point of any facts in the school system when the most important facts given by the finest scientists of that school system clearly mean nothing to our politicians and our society. ""I think that if a few students can get headlines all over the world just by not going to school imagine what we could all do together if we wanted to."" \"

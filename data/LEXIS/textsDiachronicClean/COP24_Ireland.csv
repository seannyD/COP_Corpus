There are also big arguments to be resolved about where the $100bn per year of climate finance promised by richer developed countries is to come from.With the United States pulling out of the Paris accord that issue of climate finance is now proving very difficult to resolve.The third main issue at stake is how to ensure that nations ratchet up their commitment to take action to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.This was made particularly urgent by the publication of the IPCC report on the impact of 1.5 degrees of warming two months ago.This showed that hundreds of millions of people and countless species face climate devastation if global warming is not contained to 1.5 degrees and also that greenhouse gas emissions need to be reduced three times faster than previously expected.There is a growing expectation that the negotiations in Poland, which are due to finish later today, could yet spill over into the weekend.Sources close to the COP24 talks said that delegates from nearly 200 nations were still far apart on several issues, from adopting the latest environmental science to how future climate action is funded.The Conference of the Parties (COP) is the supreme body of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\l"

However, environmental campaigners, speaking on the margins of a major United Nations in Katowice in Poland, are now lobbying Dublin to back away from the deal.The Government should cancel the contract since Ireland is a member of the international ""Power Past Coal"" alliance, which pledges to stop burning coal for electricity.The Atimonan project is being fought by a range of civil-society organisations in the Philippines, which remains committed to coal-burning even it is suffering the detrimental effects of climate change. ""We cannot allow our communities to suffer from the double whammy of coal-fired power plant projects that come in the form of negative health and environmental impacts,"" said Ian Rivera of the Philippine Movement for Climate Justice, who is attending the UN climate conference in Katowice, Poland.Clean power generation In a letter this week to Minister for Climate Action and Environment Richard Bruton, he urged the Government to honour its commitment to phase out unabated coal power generation and to support clean power generation through its policies. Part of Ireland's commitment to climate action and decarbonisation is the planned shutdown of the Moneypoint coal-burning plant by 2025, said Ian Lumley of An Taisce. ""However, ESB International, a State-owned company subsidiary under the Minister's direct control, is providing the engineering and project-management services for a new 1,200 megawatt coal-fired power plant in the Philippines,"" he said. ""The damage caused by this proposed project is undermining international solidarity on climate action and decarbonisation of energy eclipses the increased climate funding announced [at the UN summit] by the Minister"", said Mr Lumley, who also attending the COP24 conference.Mr Bruton said he was not aware of the project, its context and the extent of involvement by ESB International. The decision to build the Atimonan power plant and its fuel mix in the Philippines would be made by the Philippine authorities, an ESB spokeswoman said. ""ESB International does not have any influence or input in those decisions.""ESB International agreed the contract in 2017 to operate and manage the power plant on behalf of Meralco PowerGen Corporation, she confirmed.\l"

The COP24The response met with a backlash from a broad range of other rich countries, as well as poor and developing ones. The standoff was over whether to ""note"" or ""welcome"" the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report published in October.Saudi Arabia, the US, Kuwait and Russia wanted the final statement to merely ""note"" the report on the effects of a 1.5-degree rise in the global temperatures, which warned of climate chaos in less than 20 years unless more meaningful decarbonisation was pursued. An alliance of small island states pushed to ""welcome"" the findings.The standoff arose during a long plenary session on Saturday, at the end of which negotiators were still aiming to have simplified a draft for high-level ministerial debate starting today.""We still have a lot to do,"" Michal Kurtyka, Polish president of the COP24, told a news conference. ""It is very technical, very complex, very difficult.""Delegates continued to flag another major outstanding issue: how to reassure developing countries that richer nations would deliver on promises to help finance the cost of shifting to a lower-carbon economy.Environmental campaigners and NGOs are concerned the talks outcome will lack ambition in the wake of the planned withdrawal by the US from the Paris agreement, as an increasing number of countries who have fossil fuels at the heart of their economies are failing to scale up ambition as required under the pact.""It's a question of 'who wins' - the likes of the EU and China, with economies deeply invested in climate action and dependent on multilateralism for global trade, or the likes of Saudi dissenters on climate science, with vested interests that put us all in the firing l"

They're supporting you in making tough decisions but they're also willing to make sacrifices in their daily lives,"" he added.'You must lead' Sir David was speaking on behalf of the UN's ""People's Seat"" initiative to give ordinary people a voice at the international talks by gathering their thoughts, ideas and concerns through social media. He endorsed the ""ActNow.bot"" which helps people discover simple everyday actions they can take to tackle climate change.""The people have spoken: leaders of the world, you must lead, the continuation of our civilisations and the natural world upon which we depend are in your hands,"" he added.UN secretary general Antonio Guterres warned negotiators at the meeting that the world was in deep trouble. ""Climate change is running faster than we are and we must catch up sooner rather than later, before it's too late. For many people, regions and even countries, this is already a matter of life and death,"" he said.Climate action was not just the right thing to do, it made social and economic sense, Mr Guterres said, pointing to how action to cut emissions would curb air pollution deaths, generate millions of jobs and trillions of dollars.Mr Guterres said he had four simple messages: Minister for Climate Action and Environment Richard Bruton, who attended the opening session, said: ""The decisions we take now will define the next century. I recently received Government approval to develop an all-of-government plan to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change.""Ireland was fully committed to the implementation of the Paris Agreement, he added. ""Over the next two weeks, we will work with countries all over the world to put together a rule book to make sure we all fulfil our commitments. We also look forward to . . . getting an honest evaluation of our climate efforts to date. We need to be honest with where we are at so that we get to where we need to be,"" Mr Bruton said.Financing The World Bank announced it is doubling investments in climate action with $200 billion for 2021-2025, including $50 billion towards helping countries adapt to the impacts of global warming. World Bank president Jim Yong Kim said the poorest and most vulnerable people were at the greatest risk, and urged other financial institutions to follow its lead.Following Brazil's recent withdrawal as host for COP25, a spokeswoman for Mr Bruton said it would be relocated to a country in South America, as was required under UN rules. As to the possibility of Ireland hosting a COP, she said it was due to be staged in western Europe in 2020 but a conversation had yet to be had on where it would be staged. - Additional reporting Guardian\l"

"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland8","To tackle climate change, start by ending overfishing","December 20, 2018 Thursday","Irish Independent","commitment to the climate and the ocean goes beyond greenhouse gas emissions.Michael Creed has presided over fishing limits that have continued overfishing to Ireland's ""benefit"". This has typically been celebrated as a ""win"" for Ireland after theatrically long negotiations in Brussels.Just two weeks ago, Mr Creed celebrated an agreement on mackerel, claiming it reflected ""the scientific advice"". The agreement reached is to catch 653,438 tonnes in 2019, whereas the scientific advice was to catch no more than 318,403 tonnes. This is overfishing; and it is putting unnecessary pressure on the ocean.The UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates ""33.1pc (of fish stocks globally) are being fished at biologically unsustainable levels"". In 2013, during Ireland's presidency of the EU, member states committed to ending overfishing by 2015, ""where possible, and by 2020 at the latest"".So while Ireland was trying to recover its reputation on climate change in Katowice, the rubber meets the road as Mr Creed is representing us at the Fisheries Council in Brussels.

You can introduce all the new taxes you want but you'll just annoy those who are already struggling and don't appreciate what little money they have being sacrificed on the altar of a fashionable obsession.Speaking at the in Katowice the other day, broadcaster Attenborough (92) spoke on behalf of the UN's so-called 'People's Seat', an initiative designed to give so called 'ordinary people' a voice when it comes to expressing concern about the damage that's being caused by greenhouse gas emissions.His words seem to have had a more galvanising effect than any of the hot air emitted by all our politicians and green campaigners.According to the renowned naturalist: ""If we don't take action, the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon. The world's people have spoken, their message is clear, time is running out, they want you, the decision-makers, to act now. They're supporting you in making tough decisions but they're also willing to make sacrifices in their daily lives.""For a speech that has been hailed as a sort of Gettysburg Address for climate change, it was rather presumptuous to claim to speak for the 'world's people' - after all, there are more than seven billion of us on the planet.Attenborough gets a free pass on these issues for the simple reason that people like him. In a culture where people now seem to be controlled by their feelings rather than being in control of them, such emoting from a popular public figure was always going to make a bigger mark than, for instance, our own 'climate action' Minister, Richard Bruton, who has been dutifully singing from the UN's hymn sheet this week.As ever when it comes to politicians, Bruton's statements can be translated as a simple declaration that 'we are going to bring in new taxes.' That climate change should have become such a controversial political hot potato is largely down to the campaigners themselves. For more than two decades now, we have been issued with dire and apocalyptic warnings of impending doom which simply haven't come true.When Attenborough spoke, people listened. When Bruton spoke, people just tuned out.Only a fool would deny that climate change is happening, and only an even bigger fool would assume that man has nothing to do with it - you can't pump billions of tonnes of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere and expect no reaction.But the rank hypocrisy of so many of the leading campaigners, particularly politicians and bored celebrities looking for their latest fashionable cause, has ensured that millions of people simply ignore the whole conversation.For example, Bernie Sanders recently said that: ""Climate change is real, it is caused by human activity, and it is already causing devastating harm here in the United States and to people all around the globe.""That's the kind of double-standard guaranteed to make people roll their eyes and adds fuel to the suspicion that the whole thing is just a big con.It's not, of course. But as long as China opens new coal mines every week and as long as the most obvious solution to the problem - nuclear power - is dismissed by the very people who say the sky is falling, then it's hard to take all the posturing seriously.The truth is that when it comes to the big picture, there is very little we can do as individuals. But that doesn't mean we have no control over the impact we make on the environment.We're now heading into the Christmas shopping-frenzy period. This year is going to see the largest increase in consumer spending in a decade and we all know that means - more plastic.As much damage as we have done to the air we breathe, we have also caused incalculable damage to our oceans with discarded plastic, which takes thousands of years to degrade.It's estimated that up to 12 million tonnes of plastic enter the oceans every year and as anyone who saw the recent story of the dead whale discovered to have a stomach full of plastic will know, we are now killing our fellow creatures in ever more new and horrible ways.Numerous Irish companies now offer plastic-free packaging, and the proposed 'plastic tax' is one of the few taxes that makes sense. We know it works because we have seen it work before when the levy on plastic bags was introduced and had an immediate impact - it's now rare to see the once common sight of hedgerows festooned with bags, because people now use multi-use ones.If there's nothing much we can do about the broader environment, we can control our own, local environment and a small commitment to limit the amount of plastic you use will actually have a direct and positive impact.It's estimated that up to 12 million tonnes of plastic enter the oceans every year and we are now killing our fellow creatures in ever more new and horrible ways ;\l"

Mr Bruton said ""the urgency of climate action"" was clearly understood at the COP24 opening. At its conclusion, he said he would ensure Ireland played its part, ""with the EU and our global partners to enable the Paris Agreement to fulfil its potential as the multilateral mechanism for global climate action"".

The funds will also support efforts to ensure climate actions are gender-responsive and support the IPCC. Jennifer Higgins, policy and advocacy advisor at Christian Aid Ireland, said Ireland needs to ensure the outcome of the UN talks puts human rights at the heart of the global response to climate change.""It is worrying that we are seeing an attempt by some countries to water down, or remove human rights language from the final text we will see at the end of this COP,"" she said.

Everything needs to change. And it has to start today.""Those were the words of 16-year-old Greta Thunberg in her speech at TEDXSTOCKHOLM last November. Several months earlier, as the country prepared for elections, she decided to strike outside the Swedish Parliament building to call on the government to take a radical response to climate change. Her actions attracted worldwide attention and have since inspired students across the globe to raise their own voices.Since the election, Greta has taken part in school strikes every Friday. She also addressed the United Nations Climate Change Conference last year, and in January 2019 she was invited to talk to the World Economic Forum at Davos. Time magazine named her as one of the world's most influential teenagers in 2018.Greta's activism has inspired the Fridays for Future movement, which sees students skip school each Friday in protest against government inaction towards climate change. Underlying the movement are some striking questions, as stated on their official website. ""Why study for a future, which may not be there?"" ""Why spend a lot of effort to become educated, when our governments are not listening to the educated?"" While the movement is predominantly studentled, many adults including parents, grandparents and teachers have also taken part.This wave of youth activism is gathering momentum. On Friday, a worldwide protest will see students from at least 57 countries strike from school to demand action from their respective governments. On the Fridays for Future website, 490 events around the world have already been registered. Thousands of Irish students are expected to take part, with events already registered for Dublin, Cork, Kerry, Limerick and Kildare. Many schools and parents are backing the action. Over 60 schools nationwide have signed up to participate on March 15.The rapid spread of Greta's message has been aided by the use of social media. Indeed, young people are mobilising their peers through mediums such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. The trending hashtags #FRIDAYSFORFUTURE and #Climatestrike have connected activists of all ages around the globe. The internet is also providing young people with access to scientific resources on climate change, allowing them to educate themselves on a topic which many say is not often mentioned in the classroom.""I think that if a few children can make headl"

The idea that Ireland alone is responsible for increases in emissions, because of our cattle herd burping, is a little bit disingenuous and allows our greener-than-green parties to further their own agendas.Fossil fuels and industrial processes account for nearly two-thirds, or 65pc, of our global emissions, while methane is only a fraction of this.In Poland, the COP24 climate talks are taking place.

I think the first time I heard her name mentioned was by President Donald Trump. He was jeering her and questioning how a teenager could have such strong opinions.Then I heard her name mentioned in the context of Irish school children staging a strike to protect our environment.Dermot A Lane is a priest of the Dublin archdiocese. He has been involved in academia most of his life, was parish priest in Balally in Dublin. These days he is placing much emphasis on ecology and the importance of caring for all of God's creation.At the end of March, I went along to a talk he gave on the environment and the need for dialogue between science and theology.And whose name pops up yet again? Greta Thunberg. Whereas Donald Trump dismissed her as a silly young girl, Dermot Lane sang her praises.Greta Thunberg is the 16-year-old Swedish schoolgirl, who has hit the world stage speaking clearly and convincingly about the climate crisis. It is Greta who started the first school strike pleading with adults and political leaders to address the crisis. She has addressed the United Nations and at the World Economic Forum at Davos in January she told world leaders that she did not want their hope, 'I want you to panic. I want you to act as if the house was on fire because it is.'Dermot Lane is a big fan of Greta. In the talk that I attended he pointed out that there is a 98 per cent agreement among scientists that climate change is manmade and that we have 10 years to change it.He was most critical of the Irish Government reneging on the commitment it gave when signing up to the Paris Climate Agreement. It is generally accepted that we are the laggards of Europe when it comes to protecting our climateDermot Lane referred to President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement but was heartened to see how mayors in many US cities have decided to keep to the agreement.'There is a silver lining in President Trump's decision as it has strengthened the resolve of many authorities in the US to abide by the resolutions decided at the Paris Climate Conference,' Dermot explained.Climate change affects everyone but hurts the poor most of all. Cyclone Idai, which hit Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe last month severely affected the lives of two million people. And these are the poorest of the poor on our planet, who have contributed least to causing climate change in the first place.Having spent 10 years working with Concern Worldwide I've seen first-hand how climate change is causing such hardship to the weakest and the most fragile on earth.Pope Francis in his encyclical letter 'Laudato Si'/ 'Praised Be' writes: 'Many things have to change course, but it is we human beings above all who need to change. A great cultural, spiritual and educational challenge stands before us, and it will demand that we set out on the long path of renewal.'Pope Francis reminds us how the Book of Genesis suggests that human life is grounded in three closely intertwined relationships: with God, our neighbour and with the earth itself.Mary Robinson is correct when she calls Greta Thunberg a 'superstar' and insists the time for action is now. Political leaders, industry, you and I are duty-bound to save our planet.\l"

""I cannot say they are being obstructive,"" he added.Others indicated there is a US push for a deal on climate rules that president Donald Trump or his successor would be able to swallow. More tangible progress has been made under the ""Talanoa Dialogue""; a process designed to help countries implement and enhance their ""nationally determined contributions"" by 2020. It is expected to conclude and feature prominently in a final declaration at the weekend.Sharing stories The dialogue, initiated last year, seeks to break the climate deadlock by drawing participants closer together through sharing their stories of climate change. Governments, civil society, NGOs, businesses, cities and others were invited to respond to questions: ""Where are we now? How do we want to go? How do we get there?""

Global carbon emissions are on the rise, especially in the US and China, the world's largest economies - with evidence of other countries backsliding on their commitments under the historic 2015 Paris Agreement. All that did not help the mood. As politicians and diplomats met in Katowice, Poland, seeking to sign off on a guidebook to bring the deal into effect from 2020, the days of commitments under the agreement being only as good as the willingness of national leaders to keep their word were due to come to an end.

After a heated debate, the ploy by the US, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to merely ""note"" the landmark UN report published in October shocked delegates at COP24 in Katowice.

You know the drill. But such changes in behaviour, necessary though they are, represent a drop in our plastics-infested oceans.Political action is what's needed. Political action is what's missing - interventions at national and international levels. Let's start with national. Unfortunately, the Irish Government is on Santa's naughty list because window-dressing alone is not enough.The Government pays lip service to climate justice but has failed to fulfil its own commitments on increasing carbon tax. If it makes just one resolution for 2019 it should be to prioritise decarbonisation policies.The global warming genie is out of its bottle and the window of opportunity for dealing with it is growing ever more narrow as countries prevaricate and hesitate. Nations are sitting on their hands - Ireland included. Apocalyptic warnings from scientists are met with shrugs.Ireland was among countries which signed up to steps curbing global warming as part of 2015's landmark 'Paris Rulebook' agreement. But the situation is escalating and those measures are insufficient to stop carbon pollution reaching critical levels. COP24, the recent Poland summit notable for its friction, accepted another set of rules. Almost 200 nations participated, Ireland included once again.However, some states continue to dispute the latest climate science, primarily the Trump administration which denies that human activity is endangering the planet by contributing to rising seas, crop failures, extinction in the natural world and extreme weather conditions. Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are also resistant to pollution-cutting pledges, treating climate science like a political football.Boo to those badboys. Oh, wait - we're not too virtuous here in Ireland. Our October Budget failed to include a carbon tax rise, as recommended by the Citizens' Assembly, ESRI and Climate Change Advisory Council. Last year, the Government's own Committee in Budgetary Oversight emphasised use of the fiscal system to support climate change policies. But it's water off a duck's back to the present administration.You'd imagine Ireland wasn't among a host of developed countries burning ever larger quantities of fossil fuels for more than 200 years, thereby increasing the carbon in Earth's atmosphere.It's reached a point where some commentators are claiming the world has left it too late and the planet is already heading for climate catastrophe. On the other hand, there may still be a sliver of time to mitigate the effects of our formerly heedless and now just plain selfish behaviour. A report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says the world has only about 12 years to avoid 1.5 degrees Celsius warming above pre-industrial levels - one of the goals of the Paris Agreement. UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres describes it as an ""ear-splitting wake-up call"".The IPCC says carbon pollution must be cut almost in half by 2030 and reach net zero by mid-century - which would require a fundamental reworking of global energy and transport systems.These summits aim to achieve results by consensus building: a peer-pressure approach encouraging countries to abandon dirty energy sources such as coal, oil and natural gas. Which brings me to Moneypoint, Ireland's largest power station: coal-fired and the State's biggest single emitter of greenhouse gases. How about if our political masters stop kicking the issue down the road and do something about that in 2019? In fact, the Government's best resolution for the coming year would be to set up a cross-party group along the same l"

"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland25","As Poland hosts climate talks, Paris agreement looks frayed","December 3, 2018 Monday","The Irish Times","Three years after the Paris agreement on climate change was agreed, the annual gathering of 195 signatory countries was scheduled to finalise a rulebook for delivery and to push on with implementation. The framework is the annual conference of the parties known as the COP; in this case COP24 in Katowice, Poland, which opens today. Governments in climate denial - under-delivery from the committed, and chilling scientific reports confirming the scale of damage to the planet from climate change - have diffused optimism. Vulnerabilities The recent UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report demonstrated the vulnerabilities, impacts and risks of further global warming. This is against a background of record global temperatures, rising emissions, accelerating extreme weather events and time running out to stave off worst-case scenarios. Parties are likely to agree on rules under the agreement; the US excluded. This relates not only to promises by individual states set for 2025 and 2030, but also long-term goals.The view that US president Donald Trump's distinct brand of climate denial can be circumvented by the actions of committed US states and corporations is, however, countered by Institute of International and European Affairs (IIEA) analysis published today that finds the ""Trump effect"" is slowing down the pace of global decarbonisation.Its author, IIEA research fellow Joseph Curtin, warns against downplaying the very real damage caused by it, but also against prematurely drawing defeatist conclusions about the future of the agreement. ""While the agreement may be taking on water, it is a mistake to suggest that it is about to sink, or that all parties are failing to live up to their commitments,"" he said. ""The agreement can resist the Trump effect - it was designed to be resilient - but in the medium and long term it will be weakened unless the factors underpinning President Trump's decision can be addressed in the US."" Fossil fuel US federal regulatory rollbacks have increased the attractiveness of investing in the dirtiest fossil fuel projects globally, while the US withdrawal from the agreement ""has created moral and political cover for others to follow suit"", it adds. Russia and Turkey have abandoned plans to ratify, while Australia has rolled back measures to comply with the agreement. Brazil was due to host COP25 next year but pulled out in recent days, which is being interpreted as a sign of president- elect Jair Bolsonaro's impending war against climate action. US withdrawal has also severely damaged goodwill at international negotiations, ""a vital ingredient for future progress"", the IIEA concludes. It was hoped national efforts to meet Paris pledges would catalyse faster deployment of green technologies, leading to economies of scale, reduced technology costs and positive spillovers all countries could benefit from. ""This was supposed to open up space for parties to take on increasingly robust commitments every five years,"" Curtin adds.Denying the importance of the Trump effect is a mistake, the report concludes, ""but it is also a mistake to suggest the agreement is in crisis, or worse still, that all parties are failing to live up to their commitments"". The EU is determined to ramp up ambition and to be seen as the global leader in climate change. It has unveiled its plan to be the first major economy to go ""climate neutral"" by 2050 - which means any greenhouse gases emitted need to be soaked up by forest growth or new technologies removing carbon from the atmosphere. Combustion engine vehicles are to be phased out and fossil fuels cut to zero.Decarbonisation targets will be much more demanding and reliance on technological solutions more pronounced through ""negative emissions"" technology - essentially use of bioenergy combined with carbon capture and storage.This amounts to an attempt to keep global temperature rise to within 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. It comes with recommendations rather than targets, but it is clear the plan will be a big part of the COP24 agenda. Emissions trajectory Critically for Ireland, it flags more onerous targets when the country is locked into a rising emissions trajectory. In spite of a raft of policy measures adopted to address this, next week's Climate Change Performance Index is likely to confirm our laggard status. Those concerned about lack of concrete actions at a time of great urgency hope the ""Talanoa Dialogue"" adopted at COP23 will compel countries to come forward with pledges to ambitiously increase current mitigation and finance targets, and communicate such improvements by 2020; thus sending a signal to other states to accelerate climate action in spite of patchy progress so far.\l"

The financial impact of climate change might be underestimated, it added.Meanwhile, a WHO report launched at the UN climate conference in Poland says that more ambitious action will result in better health outcomes across the globe.It says that exposure to air pollution leads to mass fatalities and costs up to (EURO)4.5bn in welfare losses.

Her worries were the problem, and those worries were real. Greta's world - our world - was heading for calamity, courtesy ofclimate breakdown and society's failure to acknowledge the extent of the emergency.Greta didn't believe it would all be OK, and from that refusal to be placated grew a global movement that this week brought hundreds of thousands of children and young people out of their schools and onto the streets in more than 70 countries, all echoing her demand for an end to platitudes and the start of real action.She also got nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize this week. Not bad for a girl who has just turned 16.Greta Thunberg was born in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, in 2003, the first of two daughters of opera singer Malena Ernman and actor, producer, and writer Svante Thunberg.Her mother, a classically trained mezzo soprano, who more recently has a mixed classic and contemporary repertoire, performed around the world and represented Sweden with a pop-opera number, 'The Voice', when Greta was six.But Greta's life, by her own accounts, was ordinary. She was ""the girl in the back who doesn't say anything"" as she told The Guardian this week. She was, she said, introverted and not much of a talker.""I could not make a difference because I was too small,"" she said of how insignificant she felt at the time.When she was around seven or eight, however, the issue of climate change crept into her consciousness. At school, she and her classmates watched documentaries on the disappearing Arctic ice and starving polar bears and cried.Then the others would wipe away their tears, tuck the troubling facts away and get back to being children. Greta couldn't find anywhere to tidy away her thoughts. They stayed with her, making her question, doubt and fear.""I couldn't let go,"" she said.By the age of 10, the Thunberg family was in crisis. Greta hardly ate and she was both physically and mentally ill. She lost a year of school and her parents realised that they needed to make a dramatic change to their lifestyles to make their daughter believe all was not lost.They became vegetarian and later vegan. Malena stopped flying - with dramatic effect on her international career - and they began trying to live as sustainably as possible.Greta appreciated their efforts, but she continued to study the causes and effects of climate change and her frustration with the comparative ignorance of adults grew.At the UN's COP24The Albedo effect, for all the urgency it should arouse, wasn't going to grab society's attention, however. That took the Greta effect.It was the students of Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida who got her thinking. Seventeen of their classmates and teachers were murdered by a student in February last year and they went on strike for gun control.Greta and her classmates talked about doing something similar for climateaction but in the end, it was Greta alone who took a homemade banner to the gates of the Swedish parliament and sat there from 8.30am to 3pm one Friday last August, pledging to do the same every week until those in power started working to save her planet.She did the same the following Friday, and the next, until gradually others joined her and her story spread and Fridays for Future became a global phenomenon.Critics call her a publicity stunt and claimed she is manipulated by organisations with ulterior motives but in her interviews and presentations, she has never looked anything but in complete control of her own opinions and actions.At the COP24They had learned they must ""live as we spreech"", he said, before excusing himself and trying again. On the third attempt, Greta leaned over, bent his microphone to her and helped him out.""Practice as we preach,"" she corrected. ""Practice as we preach.""That fixed, she allowed herself the tiniest of smiles that lit up her habitually intense expression. Next to fix the world.\l"

"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland30","Climate change and geography","December 27, 2018 Thursday","The Irish Times","Sir, - I would like to congratulate the Minister for Education Joe McHugh for his decision to review the place of history as a core subject within the Junior Cycle curriculum as previously highlighted by Enrico Dal Lago, Deirdre Mac Math\'fana and Alistair Malcolm (November 24th, December 1st and December 17th). However, I urge the Minister to do the same for the position of geography.Geography is essential for our identity, sense of place and role as citizens. Current global challenges including migration, climate change and Brexit highlight the critical role of a sound geographical education. The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (October 8th, 2018) predicts there are only a dozen years for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5 degrees - beyond which even half a degree will significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. In spite of these devastating climatic events, approaches to a transition from carbon have been slow and ineffective. International climate change negotiators at the COP24 talks in Poland agreed tougher targets for cutting greenhouse gases under the Paris climate agreement, as well as stronger transparency rules for countries in disclosing their emissions. As citizens we have a vested interest in climate change. Through geography we learn to understand climate change along with its causes and impacts. Junior Cycle students can also research this topic and design age appropriate actions for change. The time for action is now.While the current Minister for Climate Change, Richard Bruton, was formerly minister for education, he never expressed an interest in climate change education. Without robust climate change education, citizens will not demand changes from our political leaders. Geography provides an important curricular space for students to engage with contemporary local and global events including climate change. There is a need for joined-up thinking between government departments. If Mr Bruton is serious about tacking climate change perhaps he should remind his Government colleague about the importance of geography as a curricular area for all Junior Cycle students. - Yours, etc, Dr ANNE DOLAN,Lecturer in Primary Geography,Mary Immaculate College,Limerick. \l"

"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland32","A road map that must be acted on; Climate change deal","December 17, 2018 Monday","The Irish Times","The outcome of the UN climate change talks in Katowice, Poland, deserves a guarded welcome, although it is short of what is required to address a global crisis threatening civilisation in less than two decades. It brings a rules-based global order to the 2015 Paris Agreement. From 2020, it will be driven by actions rather than promises on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It defines 195 signatory states' responsibilities for tackling climate change, reporting progress and intensifying their efforts for decades to come. At a moment of deep global divisions and instability, governments have reached a deal on climate rules and secured a victory for multilateralism.There is much unfinished business and lack of collective acceptance of what is urgently required. If the key aspiration of the Paris pact - to contain the global temperature rise to within 1.5 degrees - is to have any chance of happening, the verdict of leading climate scientists in the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report must be the platform to build future actions. The blunt message at COP24 to governments was that limiting warming to 1.5 degrees is possible but the window for action is narrowing. Scientists delivered; it's up to governments to take unprecedented action. And yet a small band of countries, emboldened by Donald Trump's impending withdrawal from the agreement, while defending their huge fossil fuel interests, found it impossible to ""welcome"" its findings.Significantly, the deal introduces transparency around action and, if outstanding issues are resolved next year, will end rogue accounting practices - such as double counting of reductions. Separately, the talks struck a delicate balance between concerns of the smallest, poorest and most vulnerable countries, developed nations most responsible for global warming, and emerging economies wary of being saddled with a bigger burden to act. At last, there is a clearer path to tangible, ongoing financial supports for adaptation. Negotiators believe the rulebook is a strong enough tool that, if coupled with political leadership, can prevent the worst impacts. But reality reveals gaps; national climate pledges to date put the world on track for up to 4 degrees of warming, double the target agreed in Paris. Many will be bitterly disappointed a political statement urging governments to commit to increased ambition before 2020 did not materialise, though the EU, including Ireland and many other countries, consistently pushed for stronger ambition. Katowice was never going to be the big climate action breakthrough many demanded but it has shown once more the resilience of the Paris pact. It now has a solid road map for climate actions. The missing elements are leadership, necessary urgency and scaled-up national ambitions.\l"

The extra food will have to be produced without creating new farmland, it says, otherwise the world's remaining forests face destruction. Meat and dairy production use 83 per cent of farmland, and produce 60 per cent of agriculture's emissions.Increasing the amount of food produced per hectare was the most critical step, followed by cutting meat-eating and putting a stop to the wasting of one-third of food produced, it suggests.Speaking in Katowice, Poland, which is hosting the summit, Dr Tim Searchinger of the WRI and Princeton University said: ""If we tried to produce all the food needed in 2050 using today's production systems the world would have to convert most of its remaining forest, and agriculture alone would produce almost twice the emissions allowable from all human activities."" Science fiction With a recent UN report setting out the need for the global economy to go ""net-zero"" on carbon emissions by 2050 to limit warming to 1.5 degrees, ""the potential for natural solutions are much better than the science fiction of geoengineering"", a separate report by Christian Aid concludes. Report author Dr Kat Kramer, Christian Aid's global climate lead, said: ""The move to a net zero world by 2050 is gaining momentum as we realise how vital it is to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees.""The search for ways to create ""carbon sinks"" that generate negative emissions was growing, he said at briefing at COP24, the informal name of the climate conference. ""The idea of putting mirrors in space or spraying the atmosphere with reflective aerosols gets attention but these are largely expensive science fiction fantasies.""What we need is a renewed relationship with nature.

And it struck me - there isn't a phrase that better suits the best elements of an Irish Christmas than 'welcome home.' about plastic ' It also inspired me to never make the same mistake that I made last year.Nope, in 2018, the newer, smarter me will avoid all the Christmas Eve hassle.I'll definitely do my shopping on the 23rd instead...\l"

China accused some of the richest nations in the world of ""backsliding"" on promises to clean up pollution, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and provide $100 billion a year in climate-related aid by 2020.Poland spearheaded a push by a group of the 79 least developed countries for clarity on when those promises would be fulfilled. It indicated deepening rifts, with the talks, that were due to conclude in Katowice today, likely to run into the weekend.""Some delegations are backsliding,"" Xie Zhenhua, China's lead envoy to the talks in Katowice, said at a briefing. ""There are still quite a number of developed countries who did not start providing financial and technological support that they had pledged in the Paris Agreement three years ago. We cannot accept any backsliding.""The remarks illustrated the divide on environmental issues between China and the US, which had worked together to seal the Paris pact in 2015. The NGO, ActionAid, warned that ambition on averting catastrophic climate change ""is at risk of fizzling out"". ""Ministers are here to agree the rulebook needed to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees and protect the planet now and for future generations,"" said Harjeet Singh, its lead on climate change. ""The alternative is unconscionable: up to 150 million more premature deaths and millions more people forced to migrate because of climate change.""Deniers A coalition of African environmental and climate justice groups said the report was ""under contemptuous attack by a coalition of climate deniers revolving around the US"". What's worrying many delegates and observers is the complexity of the task of delivering a strong rulebook. That concern was echoed by Prof John Sweeney who is representing An Taisce at COP24.""I think it's pretty normal for the Thursday [before the final day] but suspect there is more resistance to compromise this year,"" Prof Sweeney said. There was a notable lack of clarity on emissions targets and how they were accounted for, he added. Without a level playing field, there was a risk some countries would exploit ambiguities. Developing nations were resisting measures that would ensure transparency in the way emission cuts are measured, reported and verified. There has also been an attempt by a small number of countries to remove human rights references from the preamble of the Paris Agreement. Former president and climate justice campaigner Mary Robinson fought hard to get it more centrally featured.What might not be the final day will coincide with more school strikes across the world, notably in the US and Germany, as young people demonstrate concern about a lack on progress in addressing climate change. British energy and clean growth minister Claire Perry confirmed the UK had written to the UN offering to host the 2020 climate summit, which would coincide with the Paris pact coming into full effect.It would also come just weeks after the next US election, which is likely to see any Democrat candidate run on a ticket of returning the US to the accord, while President Trump will seek to rubber-stamp his decision to quit the treaty. The day after the election, the US must affirm its withdrawal or not.\l"

Why we've warmed to the Greta effect; 'The sad thing is most children are not aware of the fate that awaits us'","April 26, 2019 Friday","Irish Independent","A 16-year-old schoolgirl with a powerful message about climate change is challenging world leaders.Just who is the real Greta Thunberg, asks Guy Kelly As anybody who has followed his political career will know all too well, it takes a lot for British Environment Secretary Michael Gove to feel shame. On Tuesday, though, after hearing the arguments of 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, he was unusually contrite.""As I listened to you, I felt great admiration, but also a sense of responsibility and guilt... I recognise we have not done nearly enough to deal with the problem of climate change,"" he said. Thunberg - her hair in pigtails and a metal water bottle at her side - looked on, seeming unconvinced. ""Suddenly, thanks to the leadership of Greta and others, it has become inescapable that we have to act.""Thunberg had received a standing ovation from the 40 MPs and more than 100 guests she addressed inside the UK parliament where she was introduced as an ""enthusiastic and dedicated environmental campaigner"" when she appeared in the House of Commons.Not for the first time, her name began trending on Twitter. Journalists queued up to interview her. In Hyde Park, where she had spoken earlier in the week, the remaining protesters of the Extinction Rebellion movement spoke of her as a nascent church would its patron saint. And through it all, the girl in the middle remained cool, calm and remarkably composed. It was another extraordinary day in the life of an increasingly extraordinary teenager.Until last summer, the name Greta Thunberg was relatively unknown outside her family and friends in Sweden. The eldest of two girls, she is the daughter of actor Svante Thunberg and Malena Ernman, a well-known opera singer who came 21st in the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest. (She is also distantly related to Svante Arrhenius, the first scientist to predict that carbon emissions would lead to warming.) Growing up with the family's two labradors, Moses and Roxy, near the capital, Thunberg was academically sound but quiet, and became interested in the subject of climate change when she was just nine.""[Teachers] were always talking about how we should turn off lights, save water, not throw out food. I asked why and they explained about climate change,"" she said last year. ""And I thought this was very strange. If humans could really change the climate, everyone would be talking about it and people wouldn't be talking about anything else. But this wasn't happening.""Images of melting ice and polar bears in peril became stuck in Thunberg's mind. At 11, she was uninterested in mobile phones or the trends other children followed, and her sadness turned to a crippling depression; stopping her from going to school, eating and - aside from family and one particular teacher at school - speaking.At around the same time, she and her younger sister, 13-year-old Beata, were diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, ADHD and other conditions. Thunberg says that her autism has helped her to focus on doing something about the subject that caused her depression.""[Asperger's] makes me different, and being different is a gift, I would say. It also makes me see things from outside the box,"" she told the BBC this week. ""I don't easily fall for lies, I can see through things.""By last summer, Thunberg's focus had outgrown the home. Frustrated by what she saw as weak-to-non-existent policies on climate change from the Swedish government, and provoked by the summer heatwave, she resolved to skip school and sit alone, every Friday, on the cobblestones in front of the country's parliament. ""I am doing this because you adults are shting on my future,"" said the leaflets she handed out to passers-by.Students in other countries followed, including Ireland, and soon tens of thousands of teenagers had joined the strike. Thunberg was invited to the United Nations and the World Economic Forum, in Davos. At the latter, she told a roomful of business leaders that their financial success had ""come with an unthinkable price tag"" for the planet.It is Thunberg's refusal to defer to the authority of anybody she speaks to that has made her so effective. She is more than happy to tell people ""Sweden is not a green paradise"" and explain its crimes against the ozone layer. On Tuesday, she told British MPs: ""You lied to us. You gave us false hope. You told us that the future was something to look forward to. And the saddest thing is that most children are not even aware of the fate that awaits us. We will not understand it until it's too late.""She has met Pope Francis and Jean-Continued on Page 28 Continued from Page 26 Claude Juncker, earned social media endorsements from Barack Obama and Leonardo DiCaprio, and been touted for the Nobel Peace Prize. Like the brave Parkland Shooting survivors now fighting for gun control, 18-year-old US transgender activist Jazz Jennings and Malala Yousafzai, Thunberg is proof that the fearlessness of youth can be far more effective than decades of political experience.There has, of course, been a backlash. Not everybody is keen to have a teenager - one who has been compared to Joan of Arc and Pippi Longstocking, no less - tell them what to do, and not everybody thinks she is picking on the right foes (arguing that emissions from China, the US and other powers would be better challenged).Criticism has included the suggestion that having famous parents means Thunberg is the product of a wellorchestrated PR campaign. It is true that she started her school strike around the time the book was published. It's also true she was forced to distance herself from 'We Don't Have Time', a climate change start-up run by a Swedish PR consultant, after it had used Thunberg's image to gain funds. But there is no suggestion she is anything other than independent.Others have picked on her delivery - curious, since she speaks fluently in a second language, with a wider vocabulary than most have in their first, and articulates complex political issues with astonishing simplicity. Or they've commented on her appearance. Michael Gove's wife, the journalist Sarah Vine, complimented her on dressing ""like a girl instead of an off-duty pole dancer"", which is a roundabout way of showing your approval. And, perhaps most wildly, some have said her mother's Eurovision experience made things easy for her.On Wednesday, a surely exhausted Thunberg left London and returned home - on the train, of course. It has been reported that her parents and teachers would like her to stop protesting and go back to school, but there is the possibility of a trip to the United Nations Climate Summit in New York in September. If invited, Thunberg plans to get there on a container ship.""All my life I've been invisible, the invisible girl in the back who doesn't say anything,"" she said last http://www.year.Nowww.year.No longer: ""From one day to another, people listen to me.""For all our sakes, let's hope that's true.'[Asperger's] makes me different, and being different is a gift.

The slight drop in 2017 was due to warmer weather, less fuel tourism and more renewables on the power system, but they rose in the agriculture sector due to higher cattle numbers.The environmental watchdog warned that the overall emissions drop may not be sustained over the longer term, with the latest figures showing the State is off track to meet its EU 2020 targets, despite a drop of 0.9pc in emissions last year.Agriculture emissions rose by 2.9pc, but transport fell by 2.4pc, power generation by 6.9pc and household by 5pc.The State currently generates almost three million tonnes of emissions above the level needed to meet our legally binding targets. In 2017, some 60.75 million tonnes were emitted, down 530,000 tonnes on 2016.Mr Bruton welcomed the emission cuts, but highlighted that the State was ""far off course"" to meet its international obligations.He told the D\'e1il committee there were ""challenges in every sector"", with transport emissions averaging 1.6 tonnes per head of population, Questions: Dr Eimear Cotter fears emissions won't fall more which was among the highest levels in the EU.Only 16pc of housing stock was energy-efficient, meaning carbon use per dwelling was 50pc higher than in much of Europe.It would cost (EURO)50bn to upgrade all homes in the State to the required standard, he said, adding the Government's climate plan would set out targets across society which would be delivered against a ""rigid timescale"".""It will require every government department, community, individual and enterprise playing a role but the public sector must show leadership in this area,"" he said. ""We have to look to the least cost way of achieving these targets but we have to be ambitious.""EPA director Dr Eimear Cotter said while the emission drop was welcomed, there were question marks about cuts over the longer term.""Some of the underlying drivers of this decrease point to circumstance rather than deliberate action, a fall in cross-border refuelling and warmer weather played a role this year,"" she said.""This would raise questions about the longevity and enduring nature of these decreases in future years.""It says that agriculture emissions increased by 2.9pc in 2017, up 570,000 tonnes, driven by higher dairy cow numbers which increased by 3.1pc year on year. This reflects plans to expand milk production, with dairy cow numbers rising by 26pc in the last five years while emissions rose by 10pc.While demand for electricity rose by 1pc, emissions fell by 6.9pc due to less coal and peat being used and more renewables on the system.This led to electricity being generated at a lower environmental cost than at any time on record, the EPA added, with wind generation up 21pc.\l"
"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland41","World is now at crossroads over climate, UN conference warned","December 3, 2018 Monday","Irish Independent","THE world is at a crossroads on climate change, a major conference featuring delegates from 200 nations was warned yesterday.Two weeks of talks began yesterday in Poland to tackle deep political divisions at the most important UN meeting on global warming since the landmark 2015 Paris deal to shift away from fossil fuels. Expectations are low that negotiations in Katowice, at the heart of Poland's coal region, will fully resolve concerns laid out in reports over recent weeks on the severity of rising greenhouse gas emissions.The political climate has also been transformed since the Paris agreement and the fragile global unity that brought about that accord has shattered.""This is a very, very important conference,"" UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa said. ""It also takes place in a scenario where we have clear signals about the urgency with which we need to address the issues of climate change.""Four former presidents of UN talks, including Laurent Fabius of France, who led negotiations for the Paris agreement, issued a statement urging ""decisive action"".""The world is at a crossroads and decisive action in the next two years will be crucial to tackle these urgent threats,"" they said in the joint statement.However, political divisions were clear from the outset, with Brazil having withdrawn its offer to host the 2019 talks.The United States, meanwhile, reiterated at the G20 summit in Argentina on Saturday its decision to withdraw from the Paris accord and a US commitment to all energy sources.The other members of the group of industrialised nations - including the biggest polluter, China - reaffirmed their commitment to implementing the Paris deal, taking into account their national circumstances.Delegates said one of the trickiest issues could be monitoring emissions as the US, which cannot quit the pact until 2020, uses the talks to press for a level of detail it perceives as useful to its foreign policy dealings.Poland is hosting UN climate negotiations for a third time, but the nation remains hooked on coal, the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel. Coal provides about 80pc of Poland's power and has been a major source of employment and national pride.The younger generation is less emotionally attached to coal and is increasingly environmentally aware, though any phasing out of the fuel in Poland is likely to be slow.The energy ministry said only last week Poland plans to invest in new coal capacity while its long-term energy strategy assumes it will still obtain about 60pc of its power from coal in 2030.""We are here to enable the world to act together on climate change,"" said Poland's environmental envoy, Michal Kurtyka, who is presiding over the meeting, known as COP24.With further meetings next year meant to build on what's decided in Katowice, he urged all countries to ""show creativity and flexibility.""""The United Nations secretary-general is counting on us, all of us to deliver,"" Mr Kurtyka said. ""There is no Plan B.""Ministers and some heads of government plan to join the discussion today, when the host nation is expected to push for a declaration ensuring a ""just transition"" for fossil fuel industries that face cuts and closures amid efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.""Despite geopolitical instability, the climate consensus is proving highly resilient,"" said Christiana Figueres, a former head of the UN climate office.""It is sad that the federal administration of the United States, a country that is increasingly feeling the full force of climate impacts, continues to refuse to listen to the objective voice of science.""\l"

Progress on reducing the carbon footprint of the wealthy, he believed, was being hindered by the ""Davos mentality"", which is marked by ongoing growth with high levels of inequality and a ""because we're worth it"" mindset - ""a given we daren't question"".Related to this, was the ""climate glitterati"" who loved to rub shoulders with the Davos set and believed the climate crisis would be solved by some technology in the future. Consuming less was the easy win but not accepted.Two gambles were at play here: ""that the technology will work"" and that it would operate at a planetary scale.Engineering Engineering could do a lot, and the variety of plant crops could be changed to be more reflective of sunlight. Vaporising sea water to create more clouds so that more places around the world have weather like Scotland might be a geoengineering step in the right direction to reverse regional rising temperatures. Carbon taxes, while returning benefits to citizens, might work, he said, but he feared the wealthy would just continue to pay the bill, ""happy for the poor to be constrained"". An individual's emissions were not as important as how their actions catalyse change throughout their family, church, and sports clubs.""Young people have a huge impact because they are already networked with many people. The younger generation can influence older generations on how to behave, as well: no excuses, reduce your carbon footprint or jeopardise all of our futures.""There was optimism among the young because they do not burn fossil fuels to attend meetings. Instead, they are on social media: ""Rapid-fire communications. Messages fly about without the carbon cost."" He applies a ""no fly"" principle for attending conferences, the COP24 included. In fully adopting the Paris Agreement on climate change, he believed there was a need for ""a global carbon ration"" divided between countries. And the extent of temperature rise mattered. Unfortunately, for some areas, such as Bangladesh, the difference between 1.5 degrees and 2 degrees ""is significant in the amount of suffering, while in Europe not so much"". ""There is a 5 per cent chance we'll succeed. This is a choice. If we choose to act responsibly the chances of success go up. Unfortunately, many, maybe most, politicians are going retrograde,"" he said.On air travel, he said: ""I think flying is emblematic of a very high-carbon lifestyle."" He included academics among frequent fliers. He concluded by quoting the American futurist Alex Steffen: ""The curve we've been forced on to bends so steeply that the pace of victory is part of victory itself. Winning slowly is basically the same thing as losing outright. We cannot afford to pursue past strategies, aimed at limited gains towards distant goals. ""In the face of both triumphant denialism and predatory delay, trying to achieve climate action by doing the same things, the same old ways . . . guarantees defeat.""The global rich display denialism, according to Prof Anderson, and most ""know they are in the top 10 per cent"".\l"

Avoiding the likely immediate damage requires transforming the world economy at a speed and scale that has ""no documented historic precedent"", they warn in their report, issued by the UN yesterday.Limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees by mid-century would require ""rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society"", it adds.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report describes a world of extreme weather events, worsening food shortages and wildfires and dying coral reefs.There is only a dozen years for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5 degrees, it finds - beyond which even half a degree will significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people.With clear benefits to people and natural ecosystems, limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees - rather than 2 degrees - could go hand in hand with ensuring a more sustainable and equitable world, the IPCC said after its report was issued. The ""half-degree difference"" could also prevent corals from being completely eradicated and ease pressure on the Arctic, the report finds. It was launched after approval at a meeting of 91 lead authors and government representatives of 195 countries, including Ireland, in Incheon, South Korea. It was commissioned after the Paris Agreement was agreed in 2015.The findings have increased pressure on politicians throughout the world, as the scientific evidence presented in the report is unequivocal - and the scale of immediate threats is laid out in a variety of likely scenarios.

The highest viewer ratings on 2018 TV news were directly associated with Ireland's first official Atlantic hurricane Storm Emma and dramatic snowfalls during the 'Beast from the East' storm.Last Sunday at the Dublin Racing Festival, in the Leopardstown parade ring Michael O'Leary criticised track management for not watering the chase track. Heretofore an unheard of notion in February. For the first time in living memory, winter ground conditions were officially described as 'good to firm' - resulting in a slate of non-runners.Climate change is blamed for summer droughts, winter floods and all extreme erratic weather conditions. But patterns seem utterly unpredictable; different conditions each year.Temperatures have risen by 1C over the past century and 0.5C within the last 30 years - although curiously Ireland's highest recorded temperature occurred in Kilkenny in 1887.Prof John Sweeney, expert climatologist from Maynooth University, predicts further global warming of 0.5C within two decades. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says we have only a dozen years to prevent temperatures rising by 1.5C or even 2C by 2050. This led the EU and Ireland signing up to the Paris climate accord in 2016, endorsed most recently at COP24 in Poland.Ireland is the second-highest EU emitter of greenhouse gases at 13.7 tonnes per capita, compared to an EU average of seven tonnes per annum. By the original target date of 2020, we'll be 15-20pc over our promised limit. With restored economic growth, we're back to a pattern of rising emissions of 2.5pc a year.However, a responsibility reality check is needed. This has to be put into a global context of collective culpability among 200 national governments for global warming. Ireland accounts for 0.18pc of global emissions, compared to China at 25pc, USA at 16pc and the entire EU at 10pc.Turning to fossil fuels output, Ireland's energy production is a tiny, paltry equivalent of two million tonnes in comparison to producers in billion tonnes of oil equivalent, China (2.5), USA (1.8), Saudi Arabia (1.3), Russia (1.3) and India (0.5).

He describes the treaty, despite its subsequent rejection by pivotal figures such as presidents Trump and Bolsonaro (Brazil), as ""a marvellous example of global governance . . . the best sign of global hope that we have had in the history of humankind"" But he doesn't hesitate to tell us that we are still going badly wrong, and points the finger close to home.""In Germany, peatland agriculture causes climate damage of EUR 3.6 billion annually,"" he told a conference of the Society for Ecological Restoration (Europe) in Iceland recently, ""and gets EUR 300 million in EU grants. Biogas produced from maize [on peatlands] causes eight times more climate damage than burning lignite, but receives green energy subventions. The 'polluter pays' principle is put on its head."" To illustrate his point he showed a slide of a naked man upside down, buried to his shoulders in bog, other body parts flailing helplessly above him. However, he also argues that radically improved peatland management is the hidden ace in the bad hand that humanity has dealt itself in coping with climate change. Hidden, because those who should have known better have ignored it for far too long. Even today vast peatlands are still being ""discovered"" across the globe.It outrages Joosten that only three parties to the UN Paris climate agreement have mentioned peatlands in their NDCs (the national contributions they undertake towards slowing global warming).But why, you may still be wondering, should we be so concerned about peatlands in relation to climate change? Isn't the main cause of the crisis our addiction to fossil fuels, and our perverse insistence on swelling the numbers of flatulent cattle on the planet? And isn't planting trees everywhere the best answer? These factors are certainly very important, but they are only parts of the very big and complex climate equation, within which peatlands form a significant subset. Downside Of course, peat is itself a fossil fuel, and emits more greenhouse gases than coal when burned in our beloved turf fires. This point was fully acknowledged by Bord na M\'f3na's new chief executive, Tom Donnellan, when he recently took the difficult step of advancing the date for ceasing fuel production, with the downside of losing badly- needed rural jobs.But, as Irish scientists such as David Wilson have long been telling us, there's much more to global (and local) peatlands in the climate change stakes than leaving the bales of briquettes in the ground. In their (wet) natural state, living peatlands sequester carbon dioxide, drawing it down from the atmosphere through plants, especially Sphagnum mosses, and trapping it underground as carbon. Their capacity for this vital function in regulating climate is far greater than that of forests. This means that putting conifer plantations on our bogs is not a good idea. The disturbance involved in planting and harvesting releases carbon, and the trees dry out the bog. Joosten's mantra, repeatedly used in an interview with The Irish Times after the Iceland conference, is that ""peatlands must be wet"". In fairness, Bord na M\'f3na's ecology team has been clear about this idea for years. Restoring and rewetting peatlands to capture carbon features increasingly strongly, if not yet strongly enough, in the company's policy shift. ""A 15cm thick peat layer contains more carbon per hectare than a tropical forest,"" Joosten points out. Though peatlands form only 3 per cent of the planet's land surface, they are massive ""carbon sinks"", storing twice as much carbon as all standing forests.That's the good news, but the bad news is that many peatlands are no longer in their natural state. They have been drained for fuel, or for cultivation, and in these conditions they go into reverse in climate terms. They start releasing greenhouse gases, becoming sources instead of sinks for atmospheric carbon. Worldwide, peatlands converted to farmland now produce almost one third of all agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. Joosten warns that other problems follow: drained peatlands subside, and he predicts that subsidence will lead to the ""uncontrolled flooding of 10-20 million hectares of productive land in this century"".He argues against the farming lobbies who say that we must accept the sector's greenhouse gas emissions in return for ""food security"". He says the public must come to understand that ""agriculture on drained peatlands is much more costly for society"" than the radical alternative he proposes: rewetting these areas wherever possible to restore their capacity to capture carbon. Stores carbon Some critics, however, have argued that peatland restoration can actually have negative climate impacts. While rewetted peat stores carbon, it also releases methane, a much more potent greenhouse gas in the short term. However, Joosten insists the evidence shows the bottom l"

"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland49","Health benefits a selling point of climate action; Pace of response to climate change will shape world health for centuries to come","December 6, 2018 Thursday","The Irish Times","This year has been filled with reports about the catastrophic effects of climate change - extreme flooding, prolonged periods of drought, record-breaking heatwaves and crop failures which threaten food supplies. And while more and more people are now alert to the global risks of runaway climate change, many still lack the incentive to change their behaviours to reduce the harmful greenhouse gas emissions that create the problem. Some experts argue that we feel disempowered when facing the doom and gloom messages of more frequent extreme weather events. And, the common response to disempowerment is disengagement. But, what if policymakers - and more importantly politicians - started to talk about how responding to climate change could in fact improve the health of our communities in ways that most of us haven't yet taken on board.So, for example, we now know that travelling by public transport instead of using diesel or petrol cars will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, but what if we also realised that it would reduce common respiratory diseases such as emphysema, asthma and bronchitis? We know that insulating our home will cut our energy bills but consider also the reduction in influenza, colds and respiratory infections with warmer, cosier homes. Switching from fossil fuel heating systems to ones fuelled by renewable energies will also mean better indoor air quality. Research collaboration Research into these so-called health co-benefits of responding to climate change has been central to the work of the Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change, a research collaboration between 27 different academic institutions, intergovernmental agencies and the United Nations. Their latest report - released in advance of COP 24, the UN Climate Change conference being held in Poland this week - points out that older people in Europe are now more vulnerable to heatwaves than those in Africa and southeast Asia. And, the warmer it is, the more easily infectious diseases spread (for example, the rise in Lyme disease in Ireland). Some 51 per cent of more than 450 cities surveyed expect climate change to seriously compromise their public health infrastructure. The commission has called climate change a medical emergency but has also said that a comprehensive response ""could be the greatest global health opportunity of the 21st century"".Prof Hugh Montgomery, director of the institute for human health and performance at University College London says climate change threatens to undermine the last 50 years of public health gains. But he also says that if more people walk to work or walk to get public transport - the levels of obesity and type 2 diabetes will fall. There will also be fewer deaths from strokes and heart disease, less peripheral vascular disease, less osteoporosis, less cancer and lower levels of dementia. Budgets Researchers working for the Lancet commission say the form and pace of the world's response to climate change will shape the health of nations for centuries to come. The latest Lancet Countdown Report states ""at a time when national health budgets and health services face a growing epidemic of lifestyle disease, continued delay in unlocking the potential health co-benefits of climate change mitigation is short-sighted and damaging to human health"". Another study, published in the Lancet in March, found that the health benefits of reducing air pollution and pollution-related diseases significantly outweigh the costs of mitigation measures across the world. In Ireland, the Environmental Protection Agency has teamed up with the Health Service Executive for the last three years to explore the health co-benefits that flow from policy action on climate change - such as better air quality, water protection, sustainable consumption and production. Put bluntly, the vast bulk of research concludes that responding to climate change is quite simply also good for our health. Now is the time for policymakers and politicians to start talking about the health co-benefits of responding to climate change and for the rest of us to start changing our behaviour.

"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland51","Agribusiness finds it's not easy going green; FARMING ; Action needed as Ireland faces threat of huge EU fines for missing emission targets, writes Ailish O'Hor....","December 9, 2018","Sunday Independent","THE Government is facing a number of challenges as we enter 2019. And while Brexit is one of the biggest, another is how to square the circle of protecting and growing our agribusiness sector while meeting EU environment commitments and targets that we have already signed up to.While protecting the environment is a global issue, Ireland has committed to ambitious 2030 climate and energy targets, where all sectors, including agriculture, have to make a contribution. These EU targets include a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 40pc by 2030, based on 1990 levels; to have 32pc renewables in our energy mix and to improve energy efficiency by 32.5pc The Commission also plans to adopt a longterm EU strategy to achieve zero-emissions by 2050. In addition, failure to meet targets set for 2020 would mean hundreds of millions of euro in fines. Unfortunately, it is the Irish economy's focus on beef and dairy that is one of the key components of our emissions problems.Ruminants, such as cattle, produce carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), livestock are responsible for 14.5pc of global greenhouse gas emissions.Some experts put the livestock sector up there with transport in relation to emissions. For example, the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says the transport sector is responsible for 14pc of emissions.And while scientists across the globe are working on ways to reduce those emissions including the breeding animals that burp less by adjusting their diets, given our current Government policy it would seem that we are on a collision course with the EU as we struggle to meet these targets.A key plank of Government agriculture policy is Food Wise 2025 under the subtitle Local Roots, Global Reach, reflecting the emphasis on export.According to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Food Wise 2025 identifies ambitious and challenging growth projections for the industry over the next 10 years including an 85pc increase in exports to (EURO)19bn as well as a 65pc hike in primary production to (EURO)10bn, plus the creation of 23,000 jobs along the supply chain.But increasing exports means increasing the size of herds - and that means more emissions, while the removal of milk quotas here has also resulted in big increases in the size of dairy herds.""Food Wise 2025 recognises that a significant increase in food production cannot be considered in isolation from its environmental impact, particularly in relation to the depletion of natural resources and the potential impact on climate change,"" Hogan told the Sunday Independent.""But there is a gulf between this welcome rhetoric and the operational reality. The Environmental Protection Agency has warned that Ireland needs to adopt a much greater sense of urgency about reducing its dependence on fossil fuels after official figures showed a 3.5pc increase in greenhouse gas emissions in 2016.""Ireland is one of only four countries in the European area where greenhouse gas emissions are still above 1990 levels. A failure to tackle the issue could cost the country large sums of money in relation to carbon credits by 2020,"" he said.There is no question that the agribusiness sector is a significant contributor to our economy and it needs to be respected as we navigate these choppy climate commitments.For example, agri-food exports in 2017 were (EURO)13.6bn, an increase of 11pc over 2016 including beef access to China and the opening of the Qatari market to beef, lamb and poultry. There are 300,000 people employed in the agriculture industry. In addition, our reputation as a quality food producer with high standards of food safety and traceability needs to be maintained - there's a reason why Kerrygold is a household name in other countries and our rolling green fields with happily grazing cows are used to sell Ireland.But it seems there is a Government policy malfunction in relation to marrying environmental commitments and the development of the agriculture industry.""Farmers need government support to be there and that support hasn't been there - you need farmer and community participation when it comes to policy,"" said Joe Healy, president of the Irish Farmers Association.""We need the various links in the chain to be joined up. We've requested the Taoiseach to provide the climate leadership required by coordinating a 'whole of government' approach to the delivery of climate abatement potential of the Teagasc climate roadmap which is a scientific report that contains 27 measures that the agri-sector can implement with the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by nine megatonnes of Co2 equivalents by 2030.""It can be very frustrating for farmers when they hear European officials pontificate on climate change and the need for farmers to get real at the same time as the European Commission for Trade, Cecilia Malmstrom, is doing all in her power to negotiate a trade deal with Mercosur countries of South America where, for example, in Brazil they are four times less carbon efficient than Europe in the production of beef.""Climate change is a global issue, we are the most carbon-efficient producers of dairy product in Europe and the top five in beef and if we don't produce those products to satisfy the growing demand from an increasing world population, less efficient countries will produce it,"" he added.He believes that sometimes it seems that farming is an easy target when it comes to environmental issues, as there are other contributors like the energy and transport sectors.The agriculture sector is already facing challenges in relation to farm incomes and the potential impact of Brexit on food prices but according to environmental scientist Dr Cara Augustenborg, many farmers are willing to make changes but need help in relation to diversification planning, and other areas.""Many of the farmers I talk to are eager to do something and are looking for ways to diversify out of intensified beef and dairy,"" she said. ""But we do need to change the model. It isn't working. We should be looking more at renewables and biogas too."" While at an early stage and small scale, there are plans to use cattle slurry to produce enough gas to power 56,000 homes in Mitchelstown, Co Cork. Gas Networks Ireland (GNI) has confirmed its multi-million plan to pump the renewable gas into the national grid near the north Cork town. Its large number of cattle as well as access to the national grid made Mitchelstown the choice for the plant.The IFA's Healy also pointed out that there are other programmes in place and being developed to make the agriculture industry more environmentally friendly. Its Smart Farming Programme is run in association with the EPA, and involves farmers participating in carbon monitoring while Bord Bia's has its Origin Programme and forestry is also used as a way to mitigate emissions.""We cannot ignore climate change, the farming community saw that with the fodder crises in the past and it is a global problem,"" said Augustenborg. ""As long as we keep increasing herd sizes we keep increasing absolute emissions but no matter how efficient we make agri production it will make no difference. That's been the problem with the narrative from the agribusiness side for a long time,"" she added.So it seems there's recognition from all sides that we need a joined-up plan in order to address the problems facing the agriculture industry if it is to meet EU targets.Finding a palatable way for taxpayers to address the climate change issue and pay the price might need to involve a carrot approach, for example, carbon credits as is the Canada plan.The momentum is growing for changes worldwide and, earlier this month, environmentalist David Attenborough urged world leaders to tackle ""our greatest threat in thousands of years"" at the COP24 summit in Poland.In the meantime, Hogan said that the European Commission Common Agriculture Programme reform proposal for 2021 to 2027 can be a help for Ireland. ""The proposal aims to increase the environmental performance of the Cap in relation to three clear objectives: contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as sustainable energy; fostering sustainable development and efficient management of natural resources such as water, soil and air; and contributing to the protection of biodiversity, enhanced ecosystem services and preservation of our habitats and landscapes,"" he said.""A new delivery model fundamentally redesigns not only the tools to achieve better climate and environment outcomes, but also, crucially, the designation of responsibility.""The goal is to increase flexibility and enhance effectiveness by ensuring that problems are addressed at a level where they are best understood. ""So instead of complying with a standard list of requirements from Brussels, Irish farmers and other key stakeholders will have the opportunity to be involved in the process of identifying local climate and environment challenges and outlining the best way to take action in a national 'Cap Strategic Plan'.""6.9 million ; ; hectares in Ireland ; ; 4.5 million ; ; hectares dedicated ; ; to agriculture ; ; 730,000 ; ; hectares of forestry ; ; (EURO)13.6bn ; ; agri-food exports in ; ; 2017 ; ; AGRI-BUSINESS BY THE NUMBERS ;\l"
"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland52","Climate change is fundamentally a moral issue","December 14, 2018 Friday","The Irish Times","Sir, - The Minister for Climate Action and the Environment Richard Bruton has said that we require a ""revolution in how we live"" in order to combat climate change. We welcome this acknowledgement and the recent steps he has taken. We hope that his resolve to take meaningful action will be strengthened as the COP 24 climate conference comes to a close in Katowice, Poland.We write from a faith perspective. Inspired by the leadership of Pope Francis expressed in his ecological encyclical Laudato Si, which he addressed to all the peoples of the world, we believe that all are stewards of the Earth with a duty of care. Many of our religious congregations are working in countries where climate change has already caused destruction through droughts, typhoons and rising seas. The situation will get worse if the average global temperature rises above 1.5 degrees Celsius of pre-industrial levels. At present we are hurtling towards 3 or 4 degrees of warming. This will be catastrophic and Ireland, at present, is one of the worst contributors. Ireland emits the same amount of greenhouse gases as the 400 million poorest people on Earth. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is fundamentally a moral issue.Ireland is failing to meet its obligation to take action on climate change: according the Climate Change Performance Index, published on December 10th, Ireland ranks worst in the EU, and without radical change we will fail to meet both our 2020 and 2030 targets. At the summit in Poland, renowned naturalist and broadcaster David Attenborough called on leaders to take action: ""The continuation of our civilisations, and the natural world upon which we depend, is in your hands."" We too believe that real political leadership is needed to get our country's efforts back on track.People will remember that over the past decade the Irish Government insisted on our obligation to repay irresponsible bank debts, no matter the level of austerity required. The responsibilities arising from Government commitments to safeguard and protect the earth, our common home, must be treated just as seriously. If we could do what was needed to protect the banking system, surely we can do what is needed to protect the environment and our eco-systems.In signing the 2015 Paris Agreement, Ireland committed to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions to specified levels by 2020 and 2030. Our target for 2020 is to achieve a 20 per cent reduction of non-ETS (Emissions Trading Scheme) emissions. However, the Environmental Protection Agency reported that Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions were actually 300 million tonnes over the limit in 2017. According to the Department of Climate Action and Environment itself, we will fall short of our targets unless we take decisive action: ""It is clear that further policies and measures beyond those that are already in place will be necessary to address compliance with Ireland's obligations"".Irish people recognise the need for effective action on climate change, and we understand that the costs will be much higher if we delay. The Citizens' Assembly expressed this concern, and laid out 13 recommendations that would aid the State in achieving its targets. These recommendations stressed the need to place climate change considerations at the centre of policy-making, to address energy policy, transport policy, and agricultural and land use policy. We urge the Government to implement the recommendations immediately.Paying for climate change is unavoidable: penalties and fines are inevitable. The cost to Ireland of missing our targets is estimated at EUR 600 million per annum from 2021 to 2030, as stated by Joseph Curtin of UCC at an Oireachtas Committee hearing on May 16th. However, spending tax-money to pay fines instead of tackling the problem is totally unacceptable. We believe that, if necessary, green bonds, newly announced by the NTMA, should be used to borrow the funding required to implement the appropriate measures to meet our targets. This is infinitely preferable to the alternative of missing our agreed targets, facing the environmental consequences, and paying the penalties.As Mr Bruton assumes stewardship of his new department, he has the opportunity to refocus the Government's efforts; to constantly press Cabinet to put our common home front and centre of all Government policy; to make up for our shortfalls; and to meet our national target to reduce our carbon emissions and achieve a carbon neutral economy by 2050. As the summit in Katowice comes to a close, our work is only beginning. We sincerely wish Mr Bruton well, and offer him our full support in the urgent work that needs to be done. - Yours, etc,Sr KATHLEEN McGARVEY, Provincial Leader, Sisters of Our Lady of Apostles;Fr MAURICE HENRY, JPIC Coordinator, Society of African Missions;Justice Coordinator, Association of Leaders of Missionaries and Religious of Ireland;Sr TR\'cdONA O'DRISCOLL, Brigidine Sisters;Fr RAYMOND HUSBAND, Regional Director, Columban Missionaries;Fr RUBEN PADILLA, Community Superior, Sr ANNETTE BYRNE, Provincial, Congregation of Our Lady of the Cenacle; Fr DAN BARAGRY, Provincial, Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer (Redemptorists);Sr JOAN RODDY, Regional Team Member, Daughters of Mary and Joseph;Sr KATHLEEN MURPHY, Country Leader, Franciscan Missionaries of the Divine Motherhood;Abbot BRENDAN COFFEY, Glenstal Abbey (Order of St Benedict);Fr MARTIN KELLY, Provincial, Holy Spirit Congregation (Spiritans);and 28 others.

Given the scope of the recent reports on climate change from the UN, dealing with the fast-changing demands on how the world produces its food, environmental sustainability will be the real nut to crack for Irish farmers as they plan ahead, writes Richard Halleron. Worryingly, the UN is calling for a move away from animal-based food production systems. This is a policy shift that does not fit in with the agribusiness models followed in Ireland, given farmers' strong reliance on beef, dairy and sheep production systems.At the same time, it's far from bad news, given Ireland's reliance on grass-based production systems. In fact, it could be argued that Ireland has always hidden its light under a bushel, where this is concerned. The reality is that long-term pasture represents a 'carbon sink' of immense proportions.However, it's now certain that Irish farmers and their representatives will have to tell the world just how good our grass-based production model really is, from a climate change perspective, that's if we want to continue as is in regard to farming.The other reality, of course, is that Irish farmers do not have an alternative to grass. It is the country's greatest asset and one that must be developed sustainably over the coming years. All the research carried out over recent decades confirms just how much Irish farmers can add to the value of the country's farming output simply by making better use of grass and silage.This can be achieved in ways that do not in any way compromise the targets set within the latest climate change recommendations from the UN, but, again, unless Ireland tell the world this is actually the case, the country's cause could be lost amid the general clamour that will surely follow to put further pressure on animal-based production systems.Production agriculture employs many thousands of people in those areas of the country where jobs are needed most. Moreover, the sector underpins the entire food processing sector, another key component of the Irish economy. There is too much to risk by not actively participating in the climate change debate. The time to start arguing these points is now, not in a decade's time when the real decisions on how the world reacts to global warming have already been taken.Adding to the concerns of Irish farmers will be the recent report from the EAT-Lancet Commission, which has put international pressure on red meat consumption levels. Specifically, it cites red meat as being unhealthy and recommends that consumption of beef should be reduced drastically both as a means of improving human health and countering the challenge of global warming. Eating one steak a month or one hamburger per week are cited as acceptable levels of red meat consumption for the future.The Commission convenes leading global researchers from diverse scientific discipl"

The blunt sales message boldly adorns the wall of Norman Crowley's second floor office, between two sash windows overlooking the pristine gardens of Powerscourt Estate in Co Wicklow. The mantra is fitting of the man, a tech entrepreneur whose focus has shifted to the environment in the past decade. So is its juxtaposition with such a landmark Irish vista.Crowley's persona is that of a no-nonsense sweary ass-kicker from Cork, mischievously irreverent to the business establishment. Yet Crowley is also endearingly pleasant and polite. Unnoticed by the tourists perusing the impressive gardens, Crowley's environmental empire is run from the second floor of the historic house. For the last nine years the serial entrepreneur has set his sights on saving the planet, and making a healthy profit along the way. The tone of his office maxim is perhaps a reflection of his impatience, which chimes with another message on the walls of Crowley Carbon, this time from the far less profane, but equally impatient 16-year-old Swede Greta Thunberg. ""We have not come here to beg the world leaders to care for our future. They have ignored us in the past and they will ignore us again. We have come here to let them know that change is coming whether they like it or not.""Thunberg, the teenage environmental activist who has shot to fame over the past six months, delivered this message to world leaders at the COP24 conference in Poland last December. Despite his evident admiration for Thunberg, he has no time for the recent Extinction Rebellion protests.""It's more of the same st that hasn't worked. I'm slightly conflicted by it because I greatly admire Greta Thunberg's work, and I'm a big fan of her efforts, it's stunning to watch, but I think the extinction plan is flawed.""Political will Does it not at least draw attention to the crisis at hand? ""I think in solving climate change we have a lack of technology and a lack of engineering, we don't have a lack of complaints. And the political will isn't going to change, so the willingness of politicians is not going to fix this problem in time. What will fix this problem in time are inventions, and that is what we deeply lack. We are now starting to get there but we need to move so much faster. So having a march - I admire those people - but it's not solving the problem.""Yes, government can do more than it is doing, but technology can do 50 times more to achieve this, so our tendency is to blame government, but actually it is in our own hands to solve this and it will be solved by our own hands, it won't be solved by government, certainly not in Ireland.""Born on a farm in west Cork and trained as a welder, Crowley's entrepreneurial roots are in tech. Having started and sold his internet business, Trinity Commerce, for EUR 18 million at 29 years of age, he went on to set up Inspired Gaming Group in 2001. It was eventually floated on the London Stock Exchange in 2006 with revenues of $500 million and profits of $100 million. By then he had also met UK investor George Polk and created The Cloud, which went on to become Europe's largest wifi hotspot provider, which was bought by Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB for $80 million in 2011. He points to Polk's interest in environmental issues, along with watching Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth at the time, as the turning point. Crowley Carbon was born in 2011, with Polk as chairman. Its business is to help companies dramatically cut their energy usage. With a client list of global multinationals from every sector of business and the energy waste issue centre stage, he says it's a hectic time for his company right now. ""China is insane, as is India. Australia, which we thought would be a slow burner, has become an absolute monster for us.""Crowley Carbon is a machine at this point and it's just about how fast we can expand. This business now has a different set of problems to the start-ups. The issues for the company today are getting the people in fast enough: the right locations and the right people."" That morning the head of the company's Dubai office phoned him with news they had just finished a project with food giant BRF at its plant in Abu Dhabi. It had taken three of his team working 11 days to save the plant 174 megawatts an hour. ""That's the equivalent of a small power plant,"" says Crowley. That day BRF posted on its Facebook page that by adopting the new energy system at the Abu Dhabi plant it was saving enough power to supply more than 4,500 mid-size homes. Crowley says at this stage he is less concerned with companies choosing his rivals - of which he says there are surprisingly few - and more with businesses that don't make the effort to change. ""Doing nothing is really not appropriate now. Financially, it's irresponsible and morally it's irresponsible."" The basis for Crowley Carbon is to make financial sense for the client at the same time as making environmental sense for the climate. ""Our job is to make better products so that these changes, they can become more obvious to them."" Crowley believes the same principles apply to consumers these days.""The example we always use is a fictional family in Leixlip: she works in Intel and he works in Pfizer. Combined they earn about EUR 110,000 between them, so they are the Irish middle class. What is it that they can do? Well, 15 years ago they really couldn't do that much that was practical about climate change, unless you wanted to be a raving hippie. Now, they probably buy one electric car, they can put solar on the roof of their house and they can get a financial return for that, they can probably go vegetarian a couple of days a week and not suffer too much hardship.""Lifestyle change The Leixlip family's lifestyle change touches on two of Crowley's latest projects. In recent weeks he announced plans for his new electric car start-up, Electrifi, to build a factory on the Powerscourt site that will initially retrofit classic cars to run on electric power. It will employ 150 staff but that's just the start. He foresees a future where Electrifi will develop its own high-end models, low volume but with very high margins, the business modelled on the McLaren sports car set-up in the UK. As part of its entry to the market, Crowley took a 30 per cent stake in an established player in the market, the Electric Classic Cars (ECC) in Wales. Part of the EUR 50 million investment in the start-up was to deliver a new factory to ECC. So why does Electrifi need another factory here? ""Because we are an Irish company and we see our responsibilities to Ireland. We take that seriously. So we are going to do something in Powerscourt, but over the next three years we are probably going to do another car factory in a lower cost Irish location, if there is a low-cost Irish location - we don't know where that is yet.""

"COP24","Ireland","COP24_Ireland55","Swedish teen Greta inspiring a real climate for change","March 15, 2019 Friday 11:03 PM GMT","RTE News","""You say you love your children above all else. Yet you are stealing their future in front of their very eyes. Until you start focusing on what needs to be done rather than on what is politically possible there is no hope.""Those are the words of the now 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg addressing world leaders at the COP 24 climate negotiations at Katowice in Poland just three months ago.Greta is a Swedish girl from Stockholm. She speaks truth to power about the climate crisis with stunning clarity, devastating frankness and remarkable intelligence. Her words and her actions alone since last August have sparked a global movement and inspired young people and old people in every corner of the world to take to the street demanding climate action. School children in 105 countries and 1,600 cities around the world including at multiple locations here in Ireland are taking part in today\' s Global School Strike for climate action. This is a rapidly growing international movement that flowed from Greta\' s individual decision on 20 August last year to take Friday off school to sit on the ground outside the Swedish Parliament Building in Stockholm demanding change.In her interviews Greta comes across as blunt, honest and very smart. ""I was diagnosed Asperger\' s Syndrome, OCD and selective muteism"", she said in a recent TED Talk. ""It basically means that I only speak when I think it is absolutely necessary. Now is one of those moments.""For those of us who are on the spectrum almost everything is black and white"", she added . ""We aren\' t very good at lying and we don\' t participate in the social games that the rest of you are so fond of.""About the fact that so many school children around the world are now following her lead Greta has this to say. ""I think it\' s amazing to see that hundreds of thousands of children all around the world are realising that we are facing an existential climate crisis and are fighting for their future, making their voices heard, and saying why should we go to school and study for a future that may not exist anymore.""We need to hold the older generation accountable for what they are doing to us. I think that\' s the main thing.""There is little doubt that this movement which has grown with lightening speed is making politicians and big business everywhere nervous. It is difficult for them to know how to react in the face of a younger generation who don\' t yet have the right to vote but are determined to have their say. And gosh do they have some import stuff they want to say.""For way too long the politicians and the people in power have gotten away with not doing anything to fight the climate crisis. We will make sure that they will not get away with it any longer. We will continue to school strike until they do something."" That was Greta speaking to EU politicians earlier this year.""People always tell us that they are so hopeful, they are hopeful that the young people are going to save the world. But we are not. There is simply not enough time to wait for us to grow up and become the ones in charge. Because by the year 2020 We need to have bended the (greenhouse gas) emission curve steeply downwards. That is next year. ""We know that most politicians don\' t want to talk to us. Good. We don\' t want to talk to them either. We want them to talk to the scientists instead. Listen to them. Because we are just repeating what they are saying and have been saying for decades.""We want you to follow the Paris Agreement and the IPCC reports. We don\' t have any other manifestos or demands. Just to unite behind the science that is our demand.""And it is not just the politicians that the young people striking today are taking aim it. It is the media too. That was made clear by Greta in this comment she gave to Rolling Stone magazine. ""On climate change we have to acknowledge that we have failed. All political movements in their present form have done so. And the media has failed to create broader public awareness. But Homo sapiens have not yet failed. Yes we are failing but there is still time to turn everything around we can still fix this.""We still have everything in our own hands. But unless we recognise the overall failures of our current systems then we most probably don\' t stand a chance. We are facing a disaster of unspoken sufferings for enormous amounts of people. Now is not the time for speaking politely and focusing on what we can or cannot say. Now is the time to speak clearly.""For those who feel uneasy about the sight of hundreds of thousands of children worldwide taking the day off school to throw their weight and support behind everything Greta Thunberg has articulated it might be well to bear in mind, not just that this young lady has just been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, but that she has rocked some solid answers for her detractors. ""If you think that we should be in school (rather than out on the streets protesting) then we suggest that you should take our place in the streets, striking from your work, or better yet join us so we can speed up the process. We have started to clean up your mess and we will not stop until we are done.""Perhaps even stronger was contribution she made on this issue during her TED talk referred to earlier. ""Some people say that I should be in school instead. Some people say that I should study to be a climate scientist. So that I can solve the climate crisis. But the climate crisis has already been solved. We already have all the facts and solutions.""All we have to do is to wake up and change. And why should I be studying for a future that will soon be no more, when no one is doing anything whatsoever to save the future. And what is the point of any facts in the school system when the most important facts given by the finest scientists of that school system clearly mean nothing to our politicians and our society.""I think that if a few students can get headl"

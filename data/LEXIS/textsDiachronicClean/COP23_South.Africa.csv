Some of these are ambitious, while others are contentious.Ladies and gentlemen,The Paris Agreement is not just about climate, it is about social and developmental issues and ensuring that by the end of COP23 there is at least a draft text in place in preparation for COP24 in Poland next year 2018, in which developed nations commit to further reducing their emission gaps in the pre-2020 period, and the developing world is able to access the much-needed finance to assist with adaptation to, and mitigation of, climate change in other words, the implementation of our Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).An overriding political objective of the Bonn Climate Conference is to sustain the momentum behind the multilateral approach to addressing Climate Change with the United Nations at the forefront, given that Climate Change is a global challenge that requires that no one be left behind.Adaptation is key in delivering basic developmental objectives. South Africa's Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emission reduction system framework is being implemented. Phase Two will be finalised for implementation in the post-2020 period.The National Treasury is working on the finalisation of the Carbon Tax Legislation and the carbon offset regulations, which will also contribute to South Africa's GreenHouse Gas Emission reduction outcome.With regards to the Energy front, Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (REIPPPP) have been successful in contributing to the country's emission reduction, and with the country's significant solar and wind resources will continue to grow Renewable Energy in the energy mix.In the past five years, the Industrial Energy Efficiency Project (IEE Project) has assisted industry to achieve energy savings worth over R1.54 billion. Phase 1 of the SA IEE Project has contributed to a reduction of Carbon emissions. These reductions were achieved across industrial sectors. This Programme has also trained 2600 more energy efficiency practitioners.In conclusion, I would like to express the hope of the Government, and all of you present here this evening that the Bonn Climate Talks are successful and that COP23 will lay the groundwork for a successful international climate change implementation phase to be finalised in Poland in 2018.I thank you.\l"

Hosted by Fiji, the first ""island COP"" shone a spotlight on the impacts of climate change on island states and particularly vulnerable countries.As an Ethiopian, I know intimately the pain caused by climate change. My country is in the grip of a severe drought that has put 13 million people in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia at risk of increased food insecurity.As Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama of Fiji put it, ""we are all in the same canoe"".The impacts may vary, but no country can escape the damage of climate change. This is why we came to COP23 with high expectations for a COP of action and support, with substantive outcomes to achieve the goals set by the international community in Paris.The Least Developed Countries (LDC) group welcome progress that has been made here at COP23, including the adoption of the Gender Action Plan and the Indigenous Peoples' and Local Communities' Platform.It is essential that we amplify marginalised voices and recognise the disproportionate impact of climate change on women and indigenous communities. This is crucial for achieving global climate justice and for addressing the multi-faceted threat of climate change.Progress was also made on the design of the Talanoa Dialogue to be held in 2018. The Dialogue must lead to an increase in ambition by all countries to put us on track to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5C.COP23The LDCs are committed to leading on ambitious climate action in our countries - a key example is the LDC Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Initiative, an LDC-owned and driven initiative to bring universal access to clean energy in the world's poorest countries.Tackling climate change also requires support for adaptation and loss and damage action in poor and particularly vulnerable countries. The LDC Group thanks Germany, Sweden and Belgium for the contributions to the Adaptation Fund and Least Developed Countries Fund. We hope to see other countries following suit and rapidly accelerating their finance pledges to meet the scale of support needed by developing countries to fill the ever-widening finance gap.In particular, the need to adapt to and address the irreversible loss and damage arising from climate change is a matter of urgency for LDCs. The scale of loss and damage that LDCs are experiencing is already beyond our capacity to respond and it will only get worse, with more lives lost, more destruction to infrastructure and a bigger impact on our economies. We will not be able to raise our people out of poverty if we do not address loss and damage and for that we need support.The LDCs call for a global response to climate change that is fair and equitable, that advances the interests and aspirations of poor and vulnerable countries and peoples, and fulfils our Paris vision of limiting warming to below 1.5C to ensure a safe and prosperous future for all.Chair of the Least Developed Countries (LDC) group.Load-Date:\~November 20, 2017\l"

The whole world affirmed this in Paris and Marrakech when the Paris Agreement entered into force on the 4th November last year,"" said President Zuma on Monday.The President was speaking at the Meeting of the Committee of African Heads of State and Government on Climate Change (CAHOSCC) at the United Nations (UN) Headquarters in New York.The CAHOSCC meeting is hosted by the African Union Commission (AUC) on the margins of UN General Assembly (UNGA) taking place in New York in preparation for the 23rd Conference of the Parties (COP 23) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The meeting involves 13 African member countries of the CAHOSC.President Zuma said negotiations on the Paris rule-book must remain on track and ensure that there is sufficient clarity on parties' commitments under their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) on mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation.This will ensure that Africa's key sectors are prioritised in the Implementation of NDCs, while also enhancing efforts towards poverty alleviation.President Zuma is confident that international solidarity will prevail at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) COP23, which will take place from 6 17 November in Bonn, Germany.""Developing countries should be provided with adequate support for their mitigation and adaptation actions and progress should be made on a post-2020 finance goal that should be significant more than the 2020 goal of US$100 billion per year in climate finance,"" the President said.He said the efforts of developing countries to adapt to climate change with their own resources should also be recognised as a contribution to the global effort to address climate change.The President said the continent must make progress on the Global Stocktake at the upcoming Bonn conference. The Global Stocktake, which has the objective of tracking commitments and progress in implementation, must inform parties' future NDCs.""It should, therefore, take account of all the elements of climate action, namely mitigation, adaptation and the means of implementation."" President Zuma said it is important for the Africa Group, particularly in the time of global uncertainty, to emphasise adherence to the principles of the Convention, in particular the common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities, equity and the need for developed countries to take the lead in combatting climate change.Those principles, he said, remain applicable to the Paris Agreement. ""The Africa Group should not allow any renegotiation of the Paris Agreement. It was a landmark achievement of the international community. It presents us with the best vehicle to address climate change, which is a monumental challenge of our time, in a manner that is fair and that takes into account countries' national circumstances."" President Zuma said climate change poses both a threat and opportunity to development. ""The pursuit of a low-carbon and climate resilient development opens up opportunities for not only achieving our development goals, but also achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the goals set out in Agenda 2063.""Investing in energy infrastructurePresident Zuma said infrastructure investment is also key to development, and the Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA) provides a blue print for such collaboration. The Africa group must therefore explore the appropriate blend of public, multilateral and private finance to accelerate investment. The President said renewable energy investment, as part of an energy mix, provides an investment opportunity in Africa's electricity sector. ""The African Renewable Energy Initiative and the Africa Adaptation Initiative should focus on identified synergies and funding opportunities, while encouraging best practise sharing, peer learning and tapping into technical skills available on the continent.""We should also focus on building partnerships with the aim of building capacity in low-carbon planning and improving the relevant institutions in the energy, transport and the water sectors. We should also exploit opportunities in solar and wind power as well as gas, hydro, biofuels as alternatives energy sources,"" the President said. He said Africa's continental strategies should be based on long-term adaptation scenarios so that Africa's natural resources can be optimally used in development. - SAnews.ov.za \l"

This reflects an abdication of global responsibility the US (like all countries of the world) has to reduce emissions and to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change: not just for present generations but also for future ones. Previous US administrations, states, cities, scientific organisations, civil society, businesses and citizens have made an outstanding contribution to the fight against climate change.The current position of the Trump administration is a blight on this otherwise excellent track record  and it is hoped the US government will reconsider its decision.The announcement is also contrary to the spirit of multilateralism, the rule of law and trust between nations.The Paris Agreement was the culmination of a four-year negotiation process known as the ADP (Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action) at the United Nations (COP17) which was held in Durban, South Africa, in 2011. It represents the best possible flexible and dynamic approach to keeping global temperature increases well below 2\'c2\'b0C, and is a victory for multilateralism. This historic agreement entered into force far earlier than expected due to the extraordinary speed of ratification by parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, including the US. The agreement was adopted 15 years after the withdrawal of the US from the Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gases, and reflects the scientific consensus on the severity of the climate change crisis.To date, 147 countries have ratified it, with South Africa having done so in November 2016.Trump's words at last Thursday's announcement, that the Paris Agreement disproportionately disadvantages the US, is regrettable, considering that the US has historically been a significant contributor to global emissions. It follows, therefore, that the country has a moral obligation not only to lead in reducing emissions, but also to support poorer economies in contributing to the global effort.It is scientifically established that, although the effects of climate change are widespread, they disproportionately burden the poor and most vulnerable in developing countries. There is clearly overwhelming consensus in the international community that climate change is the single biggest threat to wellbeing, health and socioeconomic development facing humanity this century. Climate change is a global problem, requiring a global solution, which can only be effectively addressed multilaterally, under the broad-based legitimacy of the UN framework convention.The convention is one of three Rio conventions to which there are 196 state signatories, and sets out obligations for all countries to reduce emissions, adapt to the unavoidable adverse effects of climate change and report on national implementation. Importantly, it contains an implicit recognition of both the vulnerability of poorer countries to the effects of climate change and the right of poorer nations to economic development.The success of the Paris Agreement hinges heavily on the extent to which developed countries, historically bear the responsibility for the majority of the world's climate change-causing emissions, are able to meet their commitment to developing countries, which have historically been low emitters.During all the international climate change negotiations, South Africa emphasised that the principles of the convention must apply throughout  in particular the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. The agreement, which will be fully operational by 2020, is premised on contributions determined by countries themselves towards collectively agreed global goals. So what Trump has said  that decisions were imposed on the US  would be inaccurate.The negotiations that led up to the adoption of the Paris Agreement were characterised by global solidarity and common purpose, and culminated in a pact that was fair, ambitious, effective and durable. This was in implicit acknowledgement that climate change is a global problem requiring a global solution that could only be reached through multilateralism.We have full confidence that the momentum of the collective effort to address climate change will only accelerate, and that the withdrawal by the US will not stop years of hard work. We congratulate some developed countries that have resisted succumbing to a call for renegotiations.

"COP23","South.Africa","COP23_South.Africa18","Morocco continues to expand its aviation industry","November 20, 2017 Monday","defenceWeb","At the start of the century, Morocco launched an ambitious programme to become a major aerospace industry manufacturing hub. Mostly spared by the troubles of the Arab Spring, the Kingdom reached agreements with some of the biggest players in the aerospace industry, including Boeing, Bombardier, Airbus, Daher, Safran, Thales, UTC Aerospace Systems, Lat\'e9co\'e8re, and others. At the end of 2016 it hosted over 110 companies, comprising over 11,500 employees and generating $1 billion in exports, with annual revenue growth at 17%. In May 2016, The Economist named Morocco ""a rising star in the west"" and cited its aerospace cluster as one reason for optimism, while the city of Casablanca ranked sixth in the top 10 aerospace cities in terms of cost-effectiveness. Yet this is not sufficient for Rabat, whose plan for 2020 is to bring 23,000 new jobs to the aerospace sector and generate over $1.6 billion in new export revenue. And indeed, major foreign companies continue to invest. While Airbus's latest Global Market Forecast 2017-2036 predicts a need for 35,000 new passenger and dedicated freighter aircraft, Kevin Michaels, from the consultancy AeroDynamic Advisory, wrote in Aviation Week & Space Technology that ""with major civil OEMs laser-focused on cost reduction, the outlook for Morocco appears to be bright"". Labour-intensive activities will continue to flow to ""best-cost"" countries"". Vice-President of Bombardier Morocco, Stephen Orr concurs, adding that companies usually demand ""ever decreasing costs, for ever-increasing quality"". Moroccan Representatives were present at Japan's Aeromart Nagoya Business Convention last month to promote their country, and if North Africa is still a grey area for Japanese investors, Yukito Ikeda, the outside production manager of Kawasaki, agrees on the fact that ""emerging countries are becoming a very important area for us, in order to win the price competition, with low-cost production"". Boeing signed a deal in September 2016 to build a new hub in the Tangier region and pledged to encourage suppliers to set up or expand there. Up to 120 Boeing suppliers from across the group's global supply chain could be expected to move in. According to what the Industry Minister told AFP at the signing ceremony, such a move would represent 8,700 new jobs and an additional $1 billion a year in export revenue. Airbus built (EURO)40 million worth of facilities creating up to 800 jobs through 2018 and Lat\'e9co\'e8re opened a 6,000 square metre (EURO)11 million factory in August 2016. Daher will inaugurate a third site in Morocco to produce composite parts and French aerostructure supplier Figeac Aero signed in July this year an agreement to invest (EURO)26 million. Also this year, French SMEs conglomerate WeAre Aerospace set up a subsidiary WeAre Aerospace Morocco (WAM) with a 2,500 square metre plant in Rabat and a 3,500 square metre plant in Tangiers. But low-cost is not all that Morocco has to offer. The country aims to develop more technology intensive industries. Thales is seeking to make of Morocco its ""African hub"", and expand both its civil and defence activities. The French firm plans to set up a cybersecurity centre of expertise and opened in September last year a 1,000 square metre 3D printing facility in Casablanca, which will be the only dedicated centre of expertise for the whole group. Scheduled to be fully operational by 2018, it will operate 10 high-tech selective laser melting printers and employ up to 20 engineers. Even though this may seem few, Thales did specify all of them would be Moroccans. Aeronautics SMEs are still few and far between, but can draw from an educated population. Chosen with 14 others amongst 20,000 applicants in the Start-up Istanbul competition, Moroccan startup ATLAN Space has developed artificial intelligence programmes for drones used to spot illegal fishing vessels off West Africa's coast, a technology that young local engineers were able to showcase during the November 2017 United Nations in Bonn. Morocco also aims to ""play a special strategic role in business aviation"", according to Minister of tourism Mohammed Sajid. Marrakech held the second Middle East Business Aviation Association (MEBAA) Morocco Show in September. With Africa expected to receive 200 business jets for $7 billion in the next decade, according to the Bombardier Business Aircraft Market Forecast, the Kingdom is expecting to form ""a hub between the continents of Europe, the Middle East and Africa"". The government has launched tenders for 10 FBO slots, five of which were awarded to Jetex Flight Support and four to Swissport Maroc SA, a unit of Swissport Executive Aviation. Jetex's FBOs are expected to be complete by the end of next year and Swissport claims that the build-out of its FBOs will be complete by October 2018. If the volume of business jet activity is ""relatively low "" for Office National Des A\'e9roports (ONDA) CEO Zouhair El Aoufir, a new business aviation airport will open in 2025, and talks are underway to lessen government restrictions on operating private aircraft.

Monsanto s approach to achieving carbon neutrality focuses on three main areas: internal operations, including seed production; breakthrough products; joint efforts with farmers and global partners.Adapting to climate changeA common denominator across Monsanto s approach is the role of crops and healthy soil in adapting to and mitigating climate change. Working with outside experts in data science on extensive modelling, Monsanto has demonstrated that certain modern agriculture practices and innovations can reduce emissions and enable crops to be grown in a way that absorbs and stores greenhouse gases in the soil in amounts equal to or greater than the total amount of gases emitted from producing those crops. Many of the practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions are quite beneficial for preserving natural resources, enhancing the efficiency of utilisation of nutrients and positively impacting water and air quality, says Debbie Reed, Executive Director of the Coalition on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases. Increasing soil health and soil carbon is one major way that we can reduce greenhouse gases, and agriculture clearly has a role to play there. It s related not only to natural resources but our ability to feed and sustain growing populations all over the world. There s an interconnectivity there that is fairly unique to the agricultural sector. More information on Monsanto s commitment to becoming carbon neutral.\l"

The Partnership for Action on the Green Economy (PAGE) is aimed at facilitating scaled up, economy-wide implementation of green, low carbon and climate resilient sustainable development interventions.""We will continue to work with the EU in the coming COP23 to ensure that we make progress on the Paris Agreement Work Programme. It is our view that we should leave COP23 with some clear elements that can be converted into negotiation text early in 2018. At COP22 in Marrakech we had set ourselves a target of completing the Paris Work Programme during COP24. We have also committed to clarifying the modalities for the 2018 Facilitative Dialogue aimed at increasing ambition in the pre-2020 and post-2020 years through the revisions on Nationally Determined Contributions where possible,"" said the Minister.With regarding the 17th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), held in Johannesburg in 2016, the Minister said it was imperative that South Africa and the EU continue to collaborate in a number of areas, including trophy hunting and the protection of species, the development of livelihood opportunities for rural communities from hunting, and the development of incentives for habitat conservation.Minister Molewa said it would be prudent for South Africa and the EU to discuss matters related to the consultation process initiated by the EU to gather information and evidence on the extent of legal and illegal trade in ivory in the EU, as well as on possible evolution of EU rules in that respect, which seem to include the import of ivory as part of hunting trophies, particularly since the Bloc and South Africa's cooperation at CITES COP17 had resulted in the adoption of a Resolution on the Trade in Hunting Trophies. South Africa is also implementing strict regulations and norms and standards to ensure the conservation and sustainable use of the African elephant.""We are concerned that further restrictions on hunting trophies could potentially have a significant impact on the conservation of the species and hold socio-economic implications,"" said the Minister emphasizing that the 2016 Great Elephant Census had shown that the South African population of African elephant is stable.The Minister had also stressed that the international trade in rhino horn for commercial purposes.""International trade in rhino horn for commercial purposes will remain prohibited and that South Africa will continue to enforce the CITES provisions in this regard. We are in the process of finalising the set of regulations that will introduce further restrictions and requirements to regulate the domestic trade in rhino horn,"" said the Minister. ""South Africa would like to assure the EU Member States that it remains committed to ensuring the effective and strict regulation of the legal, domestic trade in rhino horn.

"COP23","South.Africa","COP23_South.Africa21","ISS: Climate change is feeding armed conflict in Somalia","April 6, 2018 Friday","defenceWeb","The blast that killed over 350 people and the double car bombing in Mogadishu last October have frustrated Somalia's efforts to build stability. For almost 30 years, the country has been tackling a combination of civil war, famine, desertification, piracy, political fragmentation and terrorism. Although the conflict has many underlying causes, one factor that remains poorly understood is climate change. In a country where, alongside war, six million people face starvation, understanding the role of climate change and its impact on patterns of drought - and developing innovative responses - is urgent. Since the resilience to climate consequences by government and society is limited, the ability of around 70% of Somalis to meet their basic needs depends heavily on a regular climate pattern. However, over the past decade climate change-related desertification has expanded in Somalia, making the local population even more vulnerable. Climate change feeds armed conflict in Somalia in three ways: by exacerbating tensions between clans; boosting the ranks and role of terrorist groups, including al-Shabaab; and increasing migration. First, climate change sharpens disputes over already-scarce resources between warlords. While al-Shabaab has conquered large pieces of the country's territory, clan elders still wield considerable power, dominating the political system. In this sense, the severe droughts cause disruptions to water access, high rates of malnutrition, disease outbreaks and food insecurity. This leads to tension and even open disputes between clans. In a country facing such challenges, resources like food and water are not only a basic need, but also a source of power. Second, the relationship between the proliferation of illegal armed groups and the severe droughts in Somalia is evident in the case of al-Shabaab. The group has been successful in attracting young people who are affected by famine and food insecurity and who face no job prospects. Those youth end up joining al-Shabaab in a bid to survive, finding no other option than to get involved with the extremist group. Third, migration has become more complex due to climate change. In 2016, at least one million Somalis were internally displaced, exposed to protection risks, discrimination and gender-based violence. Making the situation even worse, around 300 000 Somali refugees living in the Dadaab refugee complex - the world's largest refugee camp, located in neighbouring Kenya - have faced heightened uncertainty since Kenya announced the compound will close. Although desertification perpetuates and expands the levels of violence in Somalia - with possible spill-overs into neighbouring states, as is already the case in Kenya - climate change has received relatively little attention when compared to anti-terrorism and security sector reform. Global and regional powers and international organisations have focused on fighting terrorism and piracy in the Horn of Africa. Most of the international community recognises the influence of human activity on the climate system and its severe consequences. These include shifts in rain patterns, increasing desertification, higher frequency and severity in tornados and hurricanes, temperature disturbance and frequent heat waves. But neither the Paris Agreement nor last November's United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany, have addressed the links between climate change and armed conflicts. They also haven't offered recommendations on how to build resilience in this area in fragile states. This is particularly worrisome because even a slight change in the global temperature is enough to provoke a set of weather calamities. Many developing and developed countries are implementing public policies to prevent, mitigate and adapt to climate change consequences. In most cases, governments and other stakeholders are able to tap into technical expertise, new technology, and relatively or highly stable societies. But conflict-affected countries, which are socially, politically and economically vulnerable, encounter considerable obstacles in addressing the effects of climate change. Instability, low state capacity and prioritising more immediate goals tend to sidel"

"COP23","South.Africa","COP23_South.Africa23","Economic Development Vs. Climate Action - Rebutting Deniers and Wafflers","November 12, 2017","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","As negotiators meet in Bonn to put together a deal to implement the Paris Agreement, John Holdren, a professor of environmental policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, stressed that economic development and climate change mitigation and adaptation are not 'either-or' but must be pursued together.Addressing science journalists a week before the Bonn climate talks, Professor Holdren said among climate change skeptics, ""wafflers' are the most dangerous, because their arguments to postpone aggressive climate action now in favor of economic progress has the potential to increasingly influence debate and government policy.""According to Professor Holdren, the wafflers claim to favor research and development on better technologies so emissions reductions can be made more cheaply in the future, and further argue for accelerating economic progress in developing countries as the best way to reduce their vulnerability as well as counting on adaptation as needed.However, it is ironic, he says, that the current US administration ""with climate deniers and wafflers occupying top positions"" are cutting support for the same approaches they propose.""Of course, the deniers and the wafflers in the top positions in the Trump administration are, with surpassing cynicism, busy cutting support for all of these approaches,"" he said, referencing the numerous reversals that the Trump administration has made even to the 'win-win' adaptation-preparedness resilience measures adopted under Obama.Apart from drastic domestic spending cuts to climate related programmes, President Trump earlier this year decided to pull the US out of the Paris Agreement--a move that has left the global community wondering what's next.Africa's DismayDespite its negligent contribution to global emissions, Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change - already suffering droughts, floods, affecting the predominantly rain-fed agricultural productivity and production. And Professor Holdren's address titled: Why the Wafflers are Wrong - Addressing Climate Change is Urgent--and a Bargain delivered to the 10th World Conference of Science Journalists (WCSJ2017) in San Francisco, California, held 26-30th October 2017, is music to the ears of the African Group of Negotiators (AGN) who have been pushing urgent climate action at the UNFCCC negotiating table.According to Professor Seth Osafo of AGN, ""The slow progress by developed country parties towards reaching the US$100 billion goal of joint annual mobilization by 2020 is not in Africa's interest."" And in the words of Emphraim Mwepya Shitima, Chief Environmental and Natural Resources Officer at Zambia's Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources, the developing country community needs financial resources now more than ever. ""We are at a critical stage where we need all the financial resources we can get to effectively implement our NDC which is off course now in sync with the recently launched Seventh National Development Plan running up to 2021,"" he told delegates at a COP23 preparatory meeting.With the US pullout meaning the loss of a major financial contributor, there are fears that the resource mobilization process might even get slower. Mithika Mwenda, Secretary General of the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA), a consortium of African civil society organisations, is also concerned and is pushing for industrialised countries to set more ambitious goals in terms of their emission cuts.""Coming from the region that suffers the most due to climate change, we have watched with utter dismay President Trump's continued efforts at dismantling the former President's Barrack Obama's climate legacy, and wish to reiterate that this is the time to classify the global community into two: those for the people and planet, and those for Trump and profit,"" says Mwenda.He questioned the presence of the official US delegation, saying it may be a bad influence on other states that are already reluctant to take serious action on climate change. ""The US withdraws from the Paris Agreement, yet they still want to show that they can negotiate the implementation framework,"" complained Mwenda, ""That's why we are calling in delegates here to sign our petition to kick Trump and his government out of these negotiations... ""Scientifically, climate change is a serious complex issue - it requires well-developed research systems especially on how it impacts different sectors of development, or at least in the spirit of the WCSJ2017 theme, to bridge science and societies. Unfortunately, as compared to the developed world, Africa's scientific research and development still lags behind such that most often than not, it relies on the developed world for data, a concern that South Africa's Minister of Science and Technology, Naledi Pandor raised during a session on Who will do Science at the WCSJ2017.Pandor believes private companies which drive scientific innovations in the developed world must stop seeing the developing world just as a mass clientele--where research and development is done just for corporate interests and not for the benefit of the people.""A number of private companies only have commercial relationships but do not have innovation relationships with the developing world; so the nature of partnerships between my continent Africa and other parts of the developing world must change,"" she said. ""If we are to do science in the 21st century... the way we perceive Africa and scientists in Africa has to fundamentally alter.""She further lamented the sidelining of women in science whom she said are doing a lot of tremendous work, and her plea is for Africa to embrace and give space to women scientists amidst the challenge of climate change in a continent that contributes less than 4 percent to global emissions. ""The next generation of scientists must be women - and black people have to be a part of that.""The High Cost of InactionAgreing that research and development are important steps in tackling climate change, Professor Holdren, who is former Assistant to President Obama for Science & Technology, argues that even if implemented, the wafflers' favoured economic approaches would be grossly inadequate because while clean energy is essential to provide options for the next stage of deep emissions reductions, the global community needs to be reducing now with the available technologies.He says climate change is already causing serious harm around the world with increases in floods, drought, wildfires, heat waves, coral bleaching, among others, all of which are ""plausibly linked to climate change by theory, models, and observed 'fingerprints'; most growing faster than projected"".The global community has three options: mitigation, adaptation - or suffering. Therefore, minimizing the amount of suffering in the mix can only be achieved by doing a lot of mitigation and a lot of adaptation.In arguing for adaptation specifically, Professor Holdren believes that many adaptation measures would make economic sense even if the climate were not changing because there have always been heat waves, floods, droughts, wildfires, powerful storms, crop pests, and outbreaks of vector-born disease, and society has always suffered from being underprepared.Additionally, he says, virtually all reputable studies suggest that the economic damages from not adequately addressing climate change would far exceed the costs of adequately addressing it.""The idea that society cannot afford to address climate change is wildly wrong,"" he said, calling for urgent climate action now and not laterCOP22 produced the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action which called for all to go further and faster in delivering climate action before 2020.

""This is a fantastic idea for us villagers who are far from formal banks, especially at a time like now when we need to save in case of crop failure, which has become common as a result of poor rainfall.""Saving just over 200 dollars, Sibukale earned over 500 dollars from a portfolio of 2,100 dollars, which the 25-member group saved in eight months.Using the farmers' club concept, up to 25 members come together and form a solidarity group. The group meets on either a weekly, bi-weekly or monthly basis to save (buying shares at a stipulated price) based on their financial capabilities. The money is banked in a box whose keys are kept by two or three people for purposes of transparency. For financial sustainability, members are encouraged to borrow and pay back at an agreed minimal interest rate.While there are several organisations championing savings for the majority unbanked rural population, Sibukale and his group are part of the World Food Programme (WFP)'s R4 rural resilience initiative.Integrated solutions for emerging climate complicationsOne African proverb states: ""If the rhythm is changing, so must the dance steps,"" implying the need to develop new strategies to deal with emerging complex challenges such as climate change, which is compromising food, nutrition and income security--three key elements at the core of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1 and 2, aimed at ending poverty and hunger.Therefore, as climate change is already complicating global food systems, development actors are also looking to integrated approaches to sustain productivity and production especially for the over 500 million smallholder farmers who produce much of the world's food.For WFP, ending hunger will not be possible without increasing smallholder farmers' productivity. Thus, according to Jennifer Bitonde, WFP Zambia Director, ""R4 is one of the pro-smallholder farmer approaches adopted where food assistance is defined not as old-style food aid handouts, but rather as a comprehensive range of instruments, activities, and platforms that together empower vulnerable and food insecure people and communities to access nutritious food.""In support of national efforts to boost productivity and strengthen farmers' food and income security amidst climate shocks, R4 deploys a set of four risk management strategies integrated through the project, which combines risk reduction (improved resource management), risk transfer (insurance), prudent risk taking (microcredit), and risk reserves (savings).According to Allan Mulando, head of Disaster Risk Management and Vulnerability Assessment at WFP Zambia, the idea is to support farmers with several layers of protection across the value chain starting from production up to market access.""In addition to conservation agriculture, insurance and microcredit, savings groups are specifically put in place to pool together financial resources which act as a buffer against short term needs, especially in times of shocks such as droughts and floods which usually lead to crop failure, ultimately affecting the normal livelihood pattern of the people,"" explains Mulando.And this is exactly what happened to farmer Sibukale. Last season, he lost one of his oxen, which negatively affected his tillage activities through reduced animal draft power. ""I am happy that I joined this group where I've earned enough to replace it,"" he said, proudly pointing at his newly acquired ox.Supporting improved productivityWhereas conservation agriculture and weather insurance are two layers of protection to support improved productivity, Sibukale believes savings are an added incentive.He told IPS how he managed to pay for his children's school fees, bought farming implements and inputs (fertilizer, seed and a ripper), helping him to increase the area under conservation agriculture, an exercise he says ""would not have been possible without the money I earned from the savings group.""And Milimo Haluma, a member of Silekwa savings group of Sikwale village, testifies to improved productivity. Haluma says before now, he found it difficult to buy inputs for himself.""But now, with savings, I am able to purchase inputs on time,"" Haluma said. ""Due to timely input purchase, my productivity has improved. Last season, I was able to produce 3.75 tons of maize on the same size of land where I've been producing an average of 1.5 tons in the past seasons.""Haluma, whose savings group is looking for external financial support to grow their portfolio, adds that with the incentive of weather insurance, farmers are finding it easy to save the little they earn. ""Insurance is providing us a peace of mind to buy shares in our savings groups for we know that we are covered in case of crop failure resulting from poor rainfall,"" he says.Global support for up scaling financial servicesCOP 23, a global partnership to provide more financial protection against climate risks--'InsuResilience' moved into higher ambition phase.The Initiative, which was launched in 2015 by the G7 group of nations under the German Presidency, aims at providing insurance to 400 more million poor and vulnerable people by 2020, and increase the resilience of developing countries against the impacts of climate change and natural disasters. It brings together G20 and V20 nations--the most vulnerable nations including Island states.""The Global Partnership is a practical response to the needs of those who suffer loss because of climate change,"" said the President and Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama.Meanwhile, Thomas Silberhorn, German's Parliamentary State Secretary to the Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development, announced support for the new global partnership of 125 million dollars as part of the launch.This follows the \£330 million commitment made by the UK Government in July 2017, via its Centre for Global Disaster Protection. The initiative supports data and risk analysis, technical assistance and capacity building according to countries' needs and priorities in terms of concrete risk finance and insurance solutions.Commenting on the initiative, Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the UN Climate Change, said: ""This new and higher ambition initiative represents one, shinning, example of what can be delivered when progressive governments, civil society and the private sector join hands with creativity and determination to provide solutions.""The most recent example of support was in September 2017, when more than 55 million dollars was paid out to ten Caribbean countries within just 14 days after hurricanes Irma and Maria had wreaked disaster on the islands.In Zambia, InsuResilience supports the NWK Agri-Services cotton company, which offers direct weather and life insurance to small contract farmers. In 2015, some 52,000 farmers decided to buy insurance. Following a major drought in 2016, more than 23,000 farmers received payments.And based on lessons from the R4 model which WFP has been piloting in Zambia since 2014, the Zambian government has this farming season incorporated weather insurance in its Farmer Input Support Programme (FISP) E-voucher programme, which has also allocated 20 percent for legume inputs aimed at encouraging crop diversification, an inbuilt resilience measure promoting improved soil fertility and income for farmers.""We are also saying let us support the farmers on the e-voucher to grow more than maize,"" said Dora Siliya, Minister of Agriculture. ""So we as government give 170 dollars, while the farmer makes a contribution of 40 dollars. And for the first time this year, from this money, 10 dollars is going to be Weather Index Insurance.""\l"

Since that December 2015, we all have seen countless pictures of utterly devastating floods, wildfires, hurricanes happening more and more frequently all over our planet mainly affecting the poorest among us.The pictures may appear remote to our own lives when we look at them in the safety of our houses on our screens. They are often a mere flash in the evening news. They may give rise to a family discussion, for others they induce anxiety, but none of the pictures can ever fully convey the utter devastation affected families are left with, the suffering of children left orphaned, the despondency of adolescents not seeing a future, the broken elderly person left without hope.Whilst in Bonn this week for COP23, which is scheduled to conclude November 17, I have two words at the forefront of my mind. One is a word from my own culture ' talanoa ', the Pacific Islands' word for dialogue. The other word is urgency. This for me is not yet another meeting, yet another travel, yet another series of talks.I grew up as an islander and my child has grown up an islander. The word urgency for us is a word full of action, doing and 'talanoa' brings people together to talk.As the representative of the UN Secretary- General for the world's poorest and most vulnerable 91 countries, which make up more than one billion people on our shared planet, I am in Bonn for the 23rd conference of the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.Whilst here I am advocating for the world's poorest and most challenged countries and above all expecting to get down to the nuts and bolts of taking urgent action. And urgent it is as commitments are already faltering and yet the times have never been more critical for the world's most vulnerable nations.These 91 diverse countries span our globe, each country faces unique challenges yet all are countries that have one feature in common - they contribute the least to climate change but feel its effects the most.

Yet, we must confront the harsh reality: we are not doing enough to deal with this immense threat,"" Graziano da Silva said. He stressed that least developed countries and small island developing states are ""particularly vulnerable"" to climate change. Noting that we should ""not be discouraged by the challenges ahead,"" the FAO director-general stressed that achieving Zero Hunger by 2030 is still possible. ""Agriculture is where the fight against hunger and climate change come together to unlock solutions."" ""It is not enough to only transform the way we produce food. Climate change mitigation and adaptation must be integrated into the entire food system: from production to transportation, from processing to food consumption, and in both rural and urban areas,"" Graziano da Silva said. Climate change, hunger and poverty can and must be tackled together FAO recently announced that the number of undernourished people has increased for the first time again in a decade with 815 million people going hungry every day. This spike is due mainly to conflict and economic downturns, but also the impact of climate change, particularly prolonged droughts in Africa. And estimates by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change show that climate change might increase the risk of hunger and malnutrition by up to 20% by 2050. Graziano da Silva pointed to the fundamental role of food systems and agriculture which are heavily affected by climate change, but at the same time are also major drivers of climate change. Adopting climate-smart agricultural practicesAt least one-fifth of total greenhouse gas emission can be attributed to the agriculture sectors, Graziano da Silva noted. Much more needs to be done to reduce these emissions and to simultaneously improve yields and build resilience, the FAO Director-General said. This means adopting approaches such as agroecology and sustainable, climate-smart intensification, among others. <!--EMBED: HYPERLINK http://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/1/358/170002.html :EMBED-->""We cannot expect that smallholders, family farmers and pastoralists... can tackle these challenges on their own,"" and they will need national and international support, he added. ""Reducing deforestation; restoring degraded lands and forests; eliminating food loss and waste; enhancing soil carbon sequestration; low-carbon livestock - these are only a few known solutions to address hunger, poverty and sustainability at the same time,"" Graziano da Silva explained.He noted, in particular, that while livestock emits more greenhouse gas than other food sources, ""low-carbon livestock is possible,"" - for example, FAO estimates that readily available improved husbandry practices can reduce emissions by 20 to 30%. FAO's work includes supporting countries in sustainably improving their agricultural sectors; in adapting and building resilience, and in mitigating global warming through agriculture. It also assists countries in monitoring their Nationally Determined Contributions in terms of climate change and that technical and financial support is needed to turn these commitments into reality. At COP23, FAO launched a new report Tracking Adaptation in Agricultural Sectors that provides a framework and methodology to support climate change adaptation measures in the agricultural sectors.{\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell\l"

We are resolute in ensuring its implementation. As Oliver Tambo said 'to go back means defeat'. We are therefore forging ahead with implementation,"" said the Minister.Addressing a high level segment of the 23rd United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of Parties (COP23) in Bonn, Germany, Minister Molewa said the recent unprecedented hurricanes in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, floods and droughts in Sierra Leone and Ethiopia and fires in California, remind the world of the dangers posed by climate change.She further added that the dangers of climate change are in the process of increasing exponentially, and that countries cannot delay action any longer to some point in the future.""Furthermore, slow onset climate change will have severe impacts on Southern Africa, with shifting rainfall patterns, more frequent droughts and flooding causing devastating health, water, food and energy security impacts,"" said the Minister.The Minister said the impacts of climate change will adversely affect the poorest South Africans the most.""Therefore, we are investing heavily in taking adaptation action. Now is the time to act for the greater global good and future of generations. All countries have to transition to an inclusive and just low-carbon and climate resilient development pathway. The faster we transition, the less damage will result at lower cost, and with maximum benefits,"" she said.She said the global transition to a low carbon and climate resilient future, is bright and full of opportunity to finally achieve equitable, inclusive and just development.The Minister stressed that South Africa's pre-2020 actions and its post-2020 Nationally Determined Contribution are designed to make a fair contribution to the global effort to tackle climate change.For example, the accelerated roll out of renewable and clean energy plans, in partnership with the private sector is among the many climate actions South Africa is implementing. This rollout is designed to coincide with the progressive reduction of coal based high-carbon emission infrastructure.""To empower South Africa to further ramp up our levels of ambition in the context of a just and equitable transition, international cooperation enabling access to climate finance and technologies will be essential.""Minister Molewa also told those attending the session that there seems to be little appetite to accelerate pre-2020 action, as exemplified by the fact that the Doha Amendment has not yet come into force and means of implementation support to developing countries is declining.""The ramping up of ambition in the pre-2020 period by all actors is a crucial signal to our people that we are serious about fulfilling our commitments,"" said the Minister who urged all developed countries to urgently implement their pre-2020 pledges and increase their ambition including the provision of additional, new and predicable support to developing countries.""We want to stress that the success of next year's Talanoa Facilitative Dialogue is essential towards raising ambition in the post-2020 period.

It was recognised under the Financing for Climate Friendly Investment category as one of 19 ""Lighthouse Activity of the Year"" projects receiving an award this year. KaXu is one of the first batch of 28 renewable energy projects unveiled by the Department of Energy in 2011. It is also the first CSP plant in SA to use parabolic trough technology. This entails the use of parabolic mirrors to reflect and concentrate the sun's rays to produce heat, which then generates steam that powers turbines and produces electricity. Energy storage allows the plant to produce firm, baseload electricity even when the sun is not shining, offering a remarkable low-carbon solution.The project was officially opened in March 2015 and supplies clean energy to the equivalent of 80,000 homes while offsetting 315,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year. SA has set a goal of generating up to 17,800MW of renewable energy by 2030 to reduce its dependence on oil and natural gas resources. The country's reliance of coal-driven power stations is the main reason why it is the 12th highest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in the world.KaXu is jointly owned by Abengoa Solar (51%), the Industrial Development Corporation (29%), and a community trust (20%). The project, which created 4,500 temporary and 80 permanent jobs, is structured on a fully commercial basis. All the power is sold to Eskom under a power purchase agreement. Its uniqueness lies in its ability to supply baseload power, something that wind farms or solar photovoltaic (PV) plants cannot do and which has a significant economic value to the grid.Each year, the Momentum for Change award recognises innovation and game-changing projects that address climate change and wider economic, social and environmental challenges.Mafalda Duarte, head of the $8bn Climate Investment Funds (CIF), highlighted what the award means for SA: ""The recognition underscores how concerted actions by a government can enable significant mobilisation of private-sector financial flows towards renewable energy technologies, including critically important base-load components of the energy systems.""Funding for KaXu was coordinated by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, which provided direct financing of R1.25bn ($143m) for two CSP projects in SA - including KaXu Solar One - and the 50MW Khi Solar One project, the first solar tower plant on the continent. The IFC also arranged $264m of parallel loans for the construction of these two projects.The lenders coordinated by IFC for the KaXu project were the CIF's Clean Technology Fund, the Development Bank of Southern Africa, FirstRand Bank, Investor Direct Capital and Nedbank.""This financial innovation was instrumental in unlocking the concentrated solar power market in SA, attracting financiers, and driving down the costs, and leading to the first operational private sector project of its kind in SA and the developing world,"" said Duarte.Other areas of focus for the convention's Lighthouse Activities are Women for Results, Momentum for Change ICT Solutions, Planetary Health, and Climate Neutral Now. The work being done by the award recipients reflects how COP23's Global Climate Action has been accelerating in the two years since the Paris Agreement was universally adopted in support of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.Source: BDpro{\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell{\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell\l"

Efforts to resolve the issue have so far been fruitless.""It would be a bad thing if this hangs over into the second week and becomes a political issue for ministers,"" said Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington DC.""It has been a pretty sterile debate that has degenerated into a finger-pointing exercise,"" he told AFP.Some 20 heads of state, including French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, are scheduled to appear at the UN climate forum next week.The European Union, Australia and the United States - which continues to participate in the talks despite President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris pact - have balked at training a spotlight on the issue, but are looking for a middle ground.""There is no disagreement about the pre-2020 urgency,"" Elina Bardram, head of the EU's delegation for COP23, told AFP.""But we must find solutions that ... do not compromise progress on the agreed negotiations programme"" for the Paris Agreement.For Teresa Ribera, director of the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations in Paris, the stand-off also reflects the negotiating process.""It is in part tactical positioning to deflect mounting pressure"" on some emerging economies - China and India, in particular - to deepen their own carbon-cutting pledges, she said.Both countries are projected to easily meet their Paris targets. But the poor nation-rich nation split that bedevilled these talks for many years has not entirely disappeared.""This is creating a trust deficit,"" said Mohamed Adow, international climate lead for Christian Aid.

""And universal access to affordable energy is the way to lift people out of poverty,"" he said.He said migration and young people drifting into militia groups were largely a product of joblessness in Africa, ""and having no electricity and therefore no industry is far more of a problem in people's lives right now than climate change.""He said more than 1.2 billion people around the world lived without power, half of them in Africa and an estimated 300 million across India.""The United States would like to see the World Bank policy on coal changed,"" he said.

It's a challenge we can only tackle together and, since the beginning, Europe has been at the forefront of this collective engagement.And there is a growing acknowledgement that there is no other way than acting together. Today, more than ever, Europe stands by this landmark agreement and leads the way on its implementation, through effective climate policies and strengthened co-operation to build strong partnerships. Also through continued support to the poorest and most vulnerable: we see more and more people on the move, or exposed to extreme poverty, due to droughts or floods linked to climate change. For Europe, dealing with climate change is a matter of political responsibility and multilateral engagement, and a matter of security, prevention of conflicts and even radicalisation.That is why the EU will not renegotiate the Paris Agreement. We have spent 20 years negotiating. Now it is time for action, the world's priority is implementation. And as we address climate change with an eye on the future, we create countless opportunities for the present, by setting up new and better ways to produce and consume, invest and trade and protect lives, assets and livelihood opportunities, for the benefit of all people as well as the planet.To accelerate the global transition to a low-emission, climate-resilient future, we have started to strengthen our existing partnerships and to seek and find new alliances, from the world's largest economies to the most vulnerable island states. Because from the Arctic to the Sahel, climate change is a reality today, not a remote concept of the future.We expect all countries to uphold the Paris Agreement and put words into action by implementing their national climate plans and strengthening their efforts over time. Plans must be turned into concrete, actionable policies and measures - now.The EU is already working towards completion of the legislative and regulatory framework necessary to deliver our Paris target, to reduce emissions by at least 40% by 2030 compared to 1990. Our legislative actions cover all sectors of the economy and we are putting energy efficiency first and boosting uptake of renewable energy across the bloc.Taking action on climate change goes hand-in-hand with economic growth. Take the EU's case: our emissions have fallen by 22% since 1990, while total EU GDP has grown by 50%.During this period, we have created new jobs, businesses and technologies. We are preparing our economies for the future and investing in making our societies more resilient to climate change, to reduce current and future risks.We have more than two decades of experience in developing and implementing ambitious climate policies and we are ready to share our experiences and lessons learnt. It's not by chance that we have established extensive climate policy co-operation with key partners across the globe.We will also continue to provide substantial funding to support climate action in partner countries. In 2015 alone, EU support totalled close to R260\'e2\€ \£fbillion.In November, countries will gather in Bonn for the next UN climate conference - COP23 - to continue to flesh out the work programme for implementing the Paris Agreement.Next year, the facilitative dialogue to be held as part of the UN climate process will be the first opportunity since Paris to look at our collective efforts to limit global warming and assess what we have done concretely to deliver on the commitments made. These are key steps for turning the political agreement reached in Paris into reality.Yet this is a challenge we can only overcome with the greatest possible involvement of civil society, businesses, local communities, cities and regions in parallel. And we are seeing an unprecedented breadth and scale of action by all of these actors.As institutions, we can plan and support the strategies needed to save our environment, but it is they that have the crucial role of turning policies into action and results on the ground.\'c2\~Our new EU Consensus on Development actively promotes this role.

"COP23","South.Africa","COP23_South.Africa36","Big Polluting Lobbyists May Be Forced to Declare Interests At UN Talks","May 25, 2017","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","Is the presence of the fossil fuel industry necessary in global climate change negotiations, or does their presence in these talks represent a conflict of interest and undermine global progress?The push from developing countries to force fossil fuel lobbyists taking part in UN climate talks to declare conflicts of interest won one significant battle during an agreement made at COP23's preliminary session earlier this month in Bonn, Germany.A recent report by the US-based non-profit Corporate Accountability International (CAI) revealed that fossil fuel representatives are extensively represented in the associations that participate in UN climate talks.While companies cannot participate in the talks themselves, membership-based business and industry non-government associations (BINGOs) can and they have been using backhanded tactics to stop key climate policies in their tracks, says the report.Policies under the UN framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC) allow organizations with 'observer status', which include the likes of the National Mining Association, FuelsEurope, the World Coal Association, and the Business Council of Australia (of which members include Shell, ExxonMobil, and BP), to sit in meetings where delegates discuss policy options to avert climate disasters.These organizations represent corporations with hefty track records of climate change denial and a portfolio that includes decades of profiting at the expense of the planet.The UNFCCC's Paris Agreement has locked in a crucial commitment to keep global temperature warming to ""well below two \'b0Celsius"", but also to ""pursue efforts"" to limit warming to 1.5 \'b0C by 2018""A transparent and clearly defined policy is essential if we are to truly protect the spirit and the goals of the Paris Agreement and if we are to have a fighting chance of limiting climate change to under 2\'b0 Celsius,"" writes Mrinalini Shine, Environmental Law Researcher at the University of Cologne, Germany.Many developing nations - collectively representing nearly 70 percent of the world's population - have been fighting to incorporate a conflict of interest policy in the convention where such groups will be legally obliged to declare any and all conflicts.For instance, in May 2016 at a meeting in Bonn, the Venezuelan delegate stated that UNFCCC's Paris agreement was an 'instrument between states' and made a 'moral request' that lobbyists declare conflicts of interest.During one panel discussion in Bonn this month, Norway's delegate stated that excluding companies based on their interests would be 'counterproductive' while Australia's delegation head said that the private sector was a key part of financing the transition to a low-carbon economy.""Some of the companies being alluded to as the polluters of policy will be the providers of the biggest and best solutions,"" said Australia's delegate.

Will our corporate sector, especially the mining and financial industries, revert to behind-closed-doors lobbying and self-interested short-termism? Or will it view this second chance as an opportunity to become better corporate citizens?BlackRock CEO Larry Fink wrote in his 2018 letter to CEOs about the increasing expectations across the globe for companies to be more than just creators of financial value: & To prosper over time, every company must not only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society.& Much of our corporate sector is not taking these expectations seriously. SA faces catastrophic environmental threats, with devastating social implications: climate change, water scarcity, lethal air pollution and large-scale destruction of our natural heritage. Unfortunately President Cyril Ramaphosa did not mention climate change once in his state of the nation address.This does not diminish the threat posed by these problems, but if they are not a priority for the government, there is a real danger that the private sector will continue to ignore them.The mining industry continues to laud itself as our best hope for the future, without taking responsibility for the environmental devastation it has always left in its wake.The industry also continues to refuse to recognise mining-affected communities as genuine stakeholders, despite a century's worth of evidence of the social upheaval associated with mining operations.But when it comes to environmental and social issues, the mining industry is not the only corporate player in SA that is hopelessly behind the times.Most of our big banks are still considering funding new privately owned coal-fired power plants, such as the proposed Thabametsi and Khanyisa plants in Limpopo and Mpumalanga. Two climate change impact assessments for the Thabametsi plant - one commissioned by the developer and one by the Department of Environmental Affairs - found that the climate change effects of the project will be severe.Thabametsi will be one of the most greenhouse gas emission-intensive plants on Earth, and will deplete water resources in an already water-scarce region for at least 40 years.But none of the proposed financiers appear to have asked any questions about climate change when the deal came to their desks. They claim they are obliged to rely on the outdated and inaccurate integrated resource plan for electricity 2010. They ignore the global move away from coal and the clear evidence that SA does not need any new coal-fired power stations. Not a single one of SA's financial institutions has made any public commitment to end financing for new coal mining or new coal-fired power.Similarly, asset managers have shown very little progress in responsible investment on environmental and social issues, despite a slew of codes and commitments to integrate environmental, social and governance factors into their investment decisions.Almost every investment portfolio in SA will include shares in fossil fuel companies such as Sasol and Exxaro, but there is no public evidence that portfolio managers are asking hard questions about these companies' contribution to climate change, or taking seriously the dangerously uncertain long-term prospects of fossil fuel companies, and the risk this poses to pension funds.Instead, the business sector is full of admiration. The National Business Initiative praises Sasol and Exxaro for being & climate change leaders& In an apparently unironic move, the Department of Environmental Affairs and the National Business Initiative hosted an exhibition at COP23 in Paris in November 2017, showcasing & the world-class climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts undertaken by South African business& The exhibition's co-sponsors were Exxaro, Sasol and Eskom.Asset managers usually blame asset owners, especially pension fund trustees, for failing to give them a proper mandate on these issues, and the accusation is not unfounded. While pension funds around the world are divesting from coal and insisting on better disclosure of environmental and social impacts, there appear to be no such moves afoot in SA.If the terms of our country's renewal are made as part of an elite pact between business and government, we will once again fail to achieve the just and equal society we claim to want.Business leaders must show the courage that many in civil society, and some in the government, have shown - courage to take the first step, to speak out, to demand better of companies that disregard people and the environment, to say no to fossil fuels, and to look further than the next set of quarterly results.Davies is an attorney at the Centre for Environmental Rights, which has established a new responsible investment NGO called Just Share.PRESIDENT CYRIL RAMAPHOSA DID NOT MENTION CLIMATE CHANGE ONCE IN HIS STATE OF THE NATION ADDRESSGame changer: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink wrote in his 2018 letter to CEOs about the increasing expectations across the globe for companies to be more than just creators of financial value.

Other countries have to be very clear that they are defending the integrity of the accord and would not accept reduced US commitments."" --Lutz Weischer""We are trying to influence the US through different channels and people, at the foreign ministry level to the EPA and even the Chancellor [Angela Merkel] has repeatedly called up President [Donald] Trump to remain in this landmark agreement,"" said German Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks at the two-day 8th Petersberg Climate Dialogue being held in Berlin.Terming the Paris Agreement a ""hard-won milestone"", the Chinese special envoy Xie Zhenhua said his country was ""true to word and resolute in deed"". Like his German counterpart, he too reiterated that all signatories should ""stick to it"" and ""not retreat"". China is resolute in its commitment, he said and added the need for transparency to ""build mutual trust and confidence"" was also paramount.At the same time, both countries gave a positive signal of what they were doing to reduce carbon emissions, with Hendricks emphasizing on the need to work on the ""ecological technologies of the future"" in the sectors of transport, infrastructure development and grids. They talked about the advances made in the renewable energy sector, the dire need for phasing out coal and the baby steps made towards electric cars.Hendricks said future climate action would require farsightedness, political courage, intelligent regulations and getting corporations on board. ""We do not have a blueprint as yet"" but countries are ready to ride the wave of enthusiasm although with some reservations but all for ""prosperity in the long term"".She also said it was prudent to mainstream climate action in all economic, fiscal even health policies. ""The ball is in the court of national governments,"" she said adding: ""Actions should speak louder than words.""Dr Ralph Bodle, a senior fellow and coordinator of Ecologic, a Berlin based think tank on environment, was recently in Bonn helping ministers and diplomats from nearly 200 countries to hammer out a ""rule book"" to say who should do what, by when, how and with what financial support, thereby putting the Paris Climate Agreement into practice.He, too, conceded that there was concern over Trump's decision during the 11-day intersessional climate talks. Bodle believed the Paris Accord ""will live or fail with political will"".It is expected the US president will announce a final decision after his return from Taormina, in Sicily, where he will attend the 43rd G7 Summit and where he will be pressured by other countries to give in.In March, Trump had threatened to pull out of the accord and roll back the widely- supported climate policies of former president Barack Obama, whose administration set a target of a 26-28 percent reduction in emissions by 2025, based in 2005 levels.

Douglas Stern, chairman of Agri EC, said: ""The solidarity shown by the KwaZulu-Natal farming community has been unbelievable. ""They have already spent huge amounts of money, time and effort to accumulate supplies like fodder for us. The problem now is the cost of transporting the fodder. Mvusiwekhaya Sicwetsha, the spokesman for the department of rural development and agrarian reform, said: ""We cannot comment on the matter of the KwaZulu-Natal farmers as we know nothing about it. ""However the department is helping the rural community and farmers. We have been giving them water, feed and rain tanks to help with softening the burden of looking after their livestock."" Stern said: ""Farmers have exhausted their funds just keeping their animals alive. This means we also have to rely on assistance for transportation costs. ""Gift of the Givers has been instrumental in helping with transport and the KZN farmers who can, have also helped with transport and fuel costs,"" said Stern. ""Around 60 to 70 truckloads of maize, bale fodder, molasses and all sorts of other foods have already been sent to the Eastern Cape. ""One truckload is made up of 50 to 55 bales and there are still about 5000 bails waiting to be transported,"" he said.

[opinion]","November 06, 2017","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","The UN Climate Change Summit in Bonn is a step further, most experts say. Fine, but towards what?On the one hand, the organisers - the UN, Fiji and Germany - express strong hopes that it will speed up the implementation of the 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement.On the other, a giant contributor to global warming - the United States - decided to desert that milestone Agreement. Meanwhile, major European powers have been, again, prodigious in unmet promises. The UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn is the next step for governments to implement the Paris Climate Change Agreement and accelerate the transformation to sustainable, resilient and climate-safe development, said Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on this major event, in the former German capital, on 6-17 November 2017.As such Convention, the Bonn-based UNFCCC is the parent treaty of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and the ultimate objective of both treaties is to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent ""dangerous human interference|"" with the climate system.The Paris Climate Change Agreement entered into force on November 2017 and the era of implementation has begun, reminds Espinosa, emphasising that the Bonn conference will further clarify the enabling frameworks that will make the agreement fully operational and the support needed for all nations to achieve their climate change goals.""It is also an excellent example of the cooperation and collaboration between nations that will truly meet the global climate change challenge... This meeting is incredibly important.""The conference -known as the signatory countries or Contracting Parties 23 session (COP 23)- is presided over by the government of Fiji with support by Germany. Prior to its opening, Espinosa encouraged governments, the private sector, and civil society organisations to be ready to work together to ""accelerate implementation and take the crucial next steps towards transformative change.""""We all have a role to play, and COP 23 will shine a light on both action underway and the many possible actions every individual and institution can take moving forward.""The Polluters Do (Not) Pay Principle This is on the one hand. On the other, the US administration announced that it would promote coal, natural gas, fossil oil and nuclear energy as an answer to the climate change challenge. And the US President Donald Trump spelled out in September this year his decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Change Agreement.In spite of this negative development, the UNFCCC executive secretary expressed optimism ahead of the last Group of the seven more industrialised powers (G 7)-The Web of Paris Cannot Be Broken by One Missing Link, she said on July 7.The point is that is it is not about the US only. In fact, other major contributors to global warming and gas emissions, such as many European highly industrialised countries, have been heralding day after day their formal commitment to reduce gas emissions, expand the use of alternative sources of energy, and a long etcetera.So far, major car-makers have been very active promoting the sale of vehicles moved by electric and, hybrid engines.For now, China as a key source of pollution seems to be addressing the need to slow down the fast process of climate change in a serious manner.The Visible DangersMeantime, the grave impacts of climate change are visible on almost all fronts. See: Floods, Hurricanes, Droughts... When Climate Sets the AgendaAt the same time, the leaders of two top UN specialised organisations, have been warning that Climate change migration is reaching crisis proportions. See: Climate Migrants Might Reach One Billion by 2050Another major UN organisation has recently explained the reasons of the massive displacement of people. See: The Roots of Exodus: Why Are People Compelled to Leave their Homes?One key cause of the growing, dangerous impact of climate change is the prevailing economic model consisting of voracious depletion of natural resources in both production and consumption patterns has proved to be one of the world's main killers due to the huge pollution it causes for air, land and soil, marine and freshwater. See: Pollution or How the 'Take-Make-Dispose' Economic Model Does KillAnd the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) has warned that pressures on global land resources are now greater than ever, as a rapidly increasing population coupled with rising levels of consumption is placing ever-larger demands on the world's land-based natural capita. See: Alert: Nature, on the Verge of Bankruptcy.On top of this and that, the United Nations weather agency announced on 30 October 2017 that the levels of carbon dioxide (C02) surged at ""record-breaking speed"" to new highs in 2016.Petteri Taalas, Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) issued this warning in Geneva, at the launch of the organisation's Greenhouse Gas Bulletin.The report indicates that carbon dioxide concentrations reached 403.3 parts per million in 2016, up from 400 ppm in 2015. ""We have never seen such big growth in one year as we have been seeing last year in carbon dioxide concentration,"" said Taalas.The WMO chief said ""We are not moving in the right direction at all... In fact we are actually moving in the wrong direction when we think about the implementation of the Paris Agreement ... ""A Common Cause, Really?The UNFCCC explains that the Paris Agreement builds upon this Convention and - for the first time - brings all nations into a common cause to undertake ambitious efforts to combat climate change and adapt to its effects, with enhanced support to assist developing countries to do so. As such, it charts a new course in the global climate effort.The Paris Agreement's central aim -it reminds- is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius.The central aim should definitely be to prevent the growing everyday human dramas such as the loss of food security and means of survival, the forced need to abandon their homes and families to face death and brutality at the hands of smugglers and human traffickers, to be exploited as ""modern"" slaves, and to prevent the world's seas and oceans from being home to more plastic than fish.Follow @ HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/Baher_Kamalhttps://twitter.com/Baher_Kamal\l"

"COP23","South.Africa","COP23_South.Africa44","On Gender Day At Climate Meet, Some Progress, Many Hurdles","November 15, 2017","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","""Five years ago, when we first started talking about including gender in the negotiations, the parties asked us, 'Why gender?' Today, they are asking, 'How do we include gender?' That's the progress we have seen since Doha,"" said Kalyani Raj.Raj is a member and co-focal point of the Women and Gender Constituency (WGC) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).Established in 2009, the WGC is an umbrella group of 27 organizations working to make women's voices and rights central to the ongoing discussions within the UNFCCC and the climate discussions known as COP23 in Bonn.On Tuesday, as the COP observed Gender Day - a day specifically dedicated to address gender issues in climate change and celebrate women's climate action - UNFCCC had just accepted the Gender Action Plan, a roadmap to integrate gender equality and women's empowerment in all its discussions and actions. For WGC and other women leaders attending the COP, this is a clear indication of progress on the gender front.""For the first time ever, we are going to adopt a Gender Action Plan. It's very good and over one year, it will be a matter of implementing it. So that's where we are,"" said Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland and former Special Envoy of the UN Secretary General for Climate Change.Gender Action Plan: The main pointsThe creation of a Gender Action Plan (GAP) was agreed upon by the countries at last year's conference (COP22) in Morocco. All over the world, women face higher climate risks and greater burdens from the impacts of climate change. Yet they are often left out of the picture when decisions on climate action are made.The aim of the GAP is to ensure that women can influence climate change decisions, and that women and men are represented equally in all aspects of the UNFCCC as a way to increase its effectiveness. The GAP is made of five key goals that are crucial for improving the quality of life for women worldwide, as well as ensuring their representation in climate policy. These range from increasing knowledge and capacities of women and men to full, equal and meaningful participation of women in national delegations, including women from grassroots organizations, local and indigenous peoples and women from Small Island Developing States.In brief, the five goals are:Gender-responsive climate policy including gender budgetingIncreased availability of sex and gender disaggregated data and analysis at all levels100% gender-responsive climate finance100% gender responsive approach in technology transfer and development.The adopted draft, however, is a much watered-down version of the draft GAP that the GEC submitted. It has omitted several of the demands, especially on including indigenous women and women human rights defenders in the climate action plan.""I would have expected a much-expressed acknowledgement of the participation, the voices and the knowledge of the indigenous and local women. We worked very hard to get that in, but it's not there as much as I would have liked,"" said Robinson, before adding that the adoption of the GAP, nonetheless, is ""definitely some progress.""Omission leads to disappointmentNot everyone, however, is taking the omissions in the GAP quietly. At Tuesday noon, representatives of over a dozen women's organizations from Latin America, Africa, the MENA region and Asia gathered at Bula zone 1 - where the negotiations are taking place and held a protest.""We are here because we want to tell the parties that women human rights defenders are legitimate and critical actors not only in SDG 5, but all the SDGs including combating climate change and all areas of 2030 agenda and Paris Agreement,"" said a protester as others nodded in silence, their mouth sealed with black tape.Prior to the protest, however, Lina Gualinga, an indigenous leader from the Kichwa tribe in Ecuador shared some details of how women environmental activists feel.""The representation of women environment and climate defenders is minimal at the COP as the UNFCCC has built a firewall around it. So, very few women can actually be here and be part of the COP,"" she said.""In the meantime, the language of the negotiations is drafted and shaped leaving no room to address our concerns. For example, what is sustainable development? For us, it's nothing but clean water, fresh air, fertile land. Is that reflected in the language of the COP?"" she asked.No access to climate financeBesides the continuous disappointment over human rights and indigenous issues, accessing finance has emerged as the biggest hurdle for women climate leaders. According to Robinson, the number of women who are getting climate finance is shockingly small.""The latest figures by OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) shows that only 2 percent of the finance is going to women in the grassroots and southern groups. Only 2 percent! Its tiny. And yet that is where an awful lot of climate work is taking place, where women are trying to make themselves resilient,"" Robinson said.There are three simple ways to solve this, she said: One, increase local funding. Two, simplify the process to access climate. And three, train women in new, green technologies.Citing the example of the Barefoot College in India - a government funded and NGO-run institution that trains women from developing countries in solar technologies before they become ""Solar Mamas"" or solar entrepreneurs - Robinson said that trainings like this are a great way to include women in climate action at the local level.""This not only builds their capacity to be more climate resilient, but also helps them become economically empowered,"" she said, before admitting that more such initiatives would require more direct funding by local institutions.Numbers still missingWhite the central debate is on mainstreaming gender in the core process of negotiations, some also want to draw attention to the low representation of women in the conference. At the 2015 Paris summit, just over 38 percent of national delegations were women, with Peru, Hungary, Lesotho, Italy and Kiribati among the most balanced delegations and Mauritius, Yemen, Afghanistan and Oman the least.This year, some countries such as Turkey, Poland and Fiji have 50 percent female delegates while three countries - Latvia, Albania and Guyana - have sent all-female delegations. But the average percentage of female negotiators at country delegations is still 38. Several countries, including Somalia, Eritrea and Uzbekistan, did not include a single women in their delegations.Noelene Nabulivou, an activist from Fiji, said that it's time to seriously fill the gender gap at the conference.""If we are asking for equal opportunity, why can't we ask for equal participation?"" asked Nabulivou.Meanwhile, Kalyani Raj thinks that quotas could limit the potential scope. ""We want a balance, but at the same time, why limit ourselves to a mere 50 percent? It could be anything!"" said Raj.The first report to evaluate the progress on the implementation of the Gender Action Plan will be presented in November 2019.\l"
"COP23","South.Africa","COP23_South.Africa45","Addressing climate risk is an opportunity todrivevalue MAKING ACOMMITMENT","November 15, 2017 Wednesday","Pretoria News (South Africa)","FOR ANY major global company - in our case as the world's leading logistics provider - the commitment to go emissions-free by 2050 tends to trigger one of two reactions. Some regard it as a public relations ploy, others think setting such a goal is overly optimistic.I think both reactions are wrong. Making such a commitment is simply inevitable. Climate change is a clear risk to the value of all companies anywhere.At the same time, the true potential to combat climate change will only be achieved once human ingenuity and the resource efficiency of the market are fully tapped.For that reason, business leaders increasingly understand that addressing the climate risk is not just a cost imposed on them. It is also an opportunity to drive value through new business models and investment in new technologies.The goal of COP 23First, the commitment to go emissions-free requires a fundamental rethink of many business activities. For us, re-evaluating everything through the prism of sustainability has given a new quality to our relationship with suppliers and customers.For example, our aerodynamically designed Teardrop trailers, used for long-haul road transport, reduce fuel consumption as well as carbon emissions. Beyond our own company's needs, we work with our customers to create tailor-made versions for them.Second, precisely because there is no silver bullet, one must launch many concrete steps rapidly and systematically. These efforts start with such little steps as switching to LED lighting in our facilities worldwide and rediscovering the benefits of relying on bicycles for urban delivery to the maximum extent possible.Third, success depends at least as much on solutions flowing bottom-up inside each company as top-down. Start-up labs, which capture promising ideas from rank-and-file employees, play an important role in that regard.As for us, we have become e-entrepreneurs. Operating a total fleet of 92000 delivery vehicles, a central task on our 2050 agenda is to move beyond our reliance on diesel-powered delivery vehicles and shift to electric vehicles.Such e-vehicles have to be as robust as diesel vehicles in handling heavy loads, able to sustain the stresses of constant stop-and-go traffic on urban delivery routes, and reliable enough to be used up to 300 days a year.When we could not find a suitable provider in the market place, we linked up with a university-based start-up, StreetScooter, which we subsequently acquired. We are now building out its initial product to a full range of electric vehicles and expanding its production capacity from 10000 vehicles this year to 20000 in 2018.An important motivation for us is to demonstrate that e-mobility can become standard practice in the global logistics industry and beyond. That is why, after scaling up in Germany, we are now beginning to roll out this solution globally. In addition, since StreetScooters can be adapted to the sector-specific delivery needs of other industries, they can provide urban mobility solutions on a much broader basis.To reduce our company's emissions and noise profile further, we also put great emphasis on e-bikes and e-tricycles. We currently use them in 58 cities in 12 different European countries, including France, Italy, the UK and the Netherlands.For us, the full-scale implementation of these various measures is key to reaching an important milestone for 2025 - that 70percent of our first-mile pick-up and final-mile delivery services will be emissions-free.As I have learnt first hand, green initiatives lead to new forms of productivity and over time the creation of entirely new markets with increasing demand for sustainable solutions.Bold aspirations are necessary, however, to catalyse this process. This is the way in which business can - and must - lead the transformation that's required globally.Frank Appel is the chief executive of Deutsche Post DHL Group, Bonn, Germany.\l"

The latest estimates indicate that 795 million people were undernourished globally in 2014-2016, with insufficient food for an active and healthy life.Bio-fuel production with its rising pressure on land and natural resources as well as climate change, are adding to the volatility of food prices and the urgency to find solutions for food insecurity. and for achieving Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) on Ending Hunger, Achieving Food Security, Improving Nutrition and Promoting Sustainable Agriculture.Food security and gender equality and women's empowerment are concomitant and inextricably interlinked.Women are pivotal to addressing hunger, malnutrition and poverty especially in developing countries. They comprise an average of 43 per cent of the agricultural labour force across the developing world making up the backbone of the agricultural sector and food production systems and the bulk of the agricultural labourers.

"COP23","South.Africa","COP23_South.Africa47","Parliament schedule for 19 to 21 Feb","February 19, 2018 Monday","South African Official News","A joint sitting of the National Assembly and National Council of Provinces will on Monday debate President Cyril Ramaphosa's State of the Nation Address, which received a standing ovation last Friday from the members of both Houses. The joint sitting starts in the morning at 10h00 and ends at around 20h00 in the evening.On Tuesday, President Ramaphosa will reply to the debate on his address, at another joint sitting of the National Assembly and National Council of Provinces starting at 14h00.On Wednesday, the Minister of Finance will deliver the Budget Speech to a plenary sitting of the National Assembly starting at 14h00 and also introduce the Appropriation Bill and table the Division of Revenue Bill. Close scrutiny of government spending and revenue collection is key to Parliament fulfilling its constitutional mandate of maintaining oversight over executive action and policy implementation.The Money Bills Amendment Procedure and Related Matters Act of 2009, based on the Constitution's provision that: ""An Act of Parliament must provide for a procedure to amend money Bills before Parliament"", has empowered Parliament to make adjustments to the budget as a whole, as well as to the budgets of specific national government departments and entities. Before the Act, Parliament could approve or reject the budget, but not make adjustments to it. The Act places great responsibility on Parliament and has begun to reframe the nature of the relationship between Parliament and the executive as the custodian of service delivery. Parliamentary oversight over the budget has become a continuous exercise.Thursday's plenary sitting of the National Assembly includes condolences for Mr Laloo Chiba. Mr Chiba was elected as a Member of Parliament in South Africa's first non-racial democratic election in 1994 and again in our 1999 election.The 28 parliamentary committee meetings scheduled for this week feature a briefing from the Minister of Finance on the 2018 Budget, a public hearing on the National Research Foundation Bill and briefings and consideration of another 10 Bills.

"COP23","South.Africa","COP23_South.Africa48","No more poisoning the planet; Joint action is under way to fight devastating climate change, writes Desmond D'Sa","September 21, 2017 Thursday","Daily News (South Africa)","THE United Nations meets this week and it is a great tragedy that, in the wake of extreme evidence of climate change, world rulers are unable to deal with US President Donald Trump.The last time President Jacob Zuma had a meeting with Trump, in Germany, we see (from Trump's Twitter feed) who the ""winner"" was.Instead of Making America Great Again, we think Zuma and all other world leaders should impose climate sanctions on Trump and his closely allied corporations such as ExxonMobil and Goldman Sachs.Organisations from Umlazi, KwaMakutha, Glebelands, Folweni, Inanda, Enduduzweni, Phoenix, Sydenham, central Durban, Wentworth, uMkomaas, Fuleni, Ntuzuma and KwaMashu gathered at St Paul's Church on August 30 to discuss issues of environmental justice and human rights.The representatives who attended this gathering empathise with the loss of life, of animals and in some cases of entire households in South Asia and the US South.The representatives stated that they were shocked by what they had seen on television and the internet.World leaders who are coming together at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of the Parties () in Germany were urged to speed up the commitments to reduce CO2 emissions, to make these binding (not voluntary), to include ""climate debt"" owed to victims (instead of prohibiting our legal claims), to apply their minds to shipping, air transport and the military, and to wait no longer, as more tragedies continued to happen.The climate crisis has been witnessed close to home, with drought conditions prevailing in eastern and southern Africa (continuing in Cape Town). But our hearts go out to those in the path of a series of Caribbean and Atlantic Ocean hurricanes, and those unable to escape extreme flooding in South Africa as well as in China.In Asia, more than 40million people were forced to evacuate their homes and more than 1000 died, due to these severe climatic conditions. This is a timely warning to Trump that withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement is a travesty of justice and truth.Texans should push Trump to reverse his maniacal carbon addiction. Houston is the world hub of petro-chemical refining, bellowing out millions of tons of highly toxic chemicals that have contributed to the climate change crisis.The refusal of the Trump administration to admit that the world is at a tipping point, and that urgent steps need to be taken to avoid further devastation, makes clear that big brother America needs to be punished. They will not listen despite the suffering witnessed in the midst of despair, destruction and death in their own large cities of Houston, Miami and Tampa.It is obvious that we need to phase out the extraction and consumption of fossil fuel energy and move to a just transition. Oil corporations like ExxonMobil and Chevron, forced to close in Texas, prove that in spite of the huge climate denialist strategy they embarked on, you can never hide the truth.The spread of denialist propaganda by ExxonMobil has come full circle, resulting in the operations of the company being shut in Texas.We need to do the same, through protest and civil disobedience, to resist the attempts to drill for oil offshore from Durban (they are still in the exploration stage, in alliance with the Norwegian state company Statoil).The oil companies have played a major role in misleading world leaders and ordinary citizens. They will have to come clean. Those responsible belong with despots brought before the International Criminal Court in the Hague, and the same degree of punishment should apply to the climate crimes that men like US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson committed.We hold them responsible for wreaking havoc and destroying health, homes and families in the rush to profit from their oil production.They should be charged and brought before a similar court for their actions.ExxonMobil must know that we stand ready to fight any destruction of or damage to our coastl"

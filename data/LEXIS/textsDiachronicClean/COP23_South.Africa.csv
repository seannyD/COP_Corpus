"COP23","South.Africa","COP23_South.Africa3","SA looks for loss security at CoP23","November 13, 2017 Monday","The Times (South Africa)","Limit Developing nations push for compensation in Belgium SA looks for loss security at CoP23 By Rich countries must do more than just compensate developing countries for loss and damage incurred by climate change. Speaking from the 23rd UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of Parties ( CoP23 ) in Belgium, South Africa chief negotiator Maesela Kekana said loss and damage were not just about reparations. ""It is about protecting what we have now and how are we going to do it,"" he said. Developing countries affected by climate change have been calling for negotiations at the conference to talk about compensation. But the discussion has been heated, with the EU and Australia saying that not every natural disaster is caused by climate change. Said Kekana: ""The real issue with loss and damage is that with these weather events there are economic losses and it ultimately diminishes your quality of life. ""If you have a farm destroyed and you lose everything, what will happen then? Damage is really important to the ordinary person in South Africa. So what we are trying to discuss and agree to are things like risk assessment, risk reduction, financial risks and transformation approaches. ""All these are just as important as reparations,"" said Kekana. He and his team are also negotiating guidelines to implement the UN Paris Agreement to limit climate change to below 2C. Said Nicole Loser, attorney at the Centre for Environmental Rights: ""South Africa's current commitments under the Paris Agreement have been criticised as being inadequate to reach the 2C target. ""Yet government continues to authorise new developments with significant climate, as well as health effects, such as coal-fired power stations."" \"
"COP23","South.Africa","COP23_South.Africa4","A Cop Out At Cop23? [opinion]","November 23, 2017","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","Despite a few victories, the UN's annual climate change conference ended without achieving its goals or injecting a sense of much needed urgency. Over 20,000 people from around the world descended on Bonn, Germany at the beginning of November for the 23rd Conference of the Parties ( COP23 ). Timoci Naulusala, a 12-year-old from Fiji, made a passionate call for action at the opening of the COP23 , stating: ""The sea is swallowing villages, eating away at shorelines, withering crops. Relocation of people... cries over lost loved ones, dying of hunger and thirst... you may think it will only affect small nations... you are wrong."" French President Emmanuel Macron echoed similar sentiments, noting that the effects of climate change have multiplied and are becoming increasingly intense. ""The point of no return has been crossed,"" he said. The conference set out to develop a rule book for implementing the landmark Paris Agreement. Though the deadline for its completion is next year's COP in Poland, many noted that not enough was achieved this year. Among the most contentious issues at COP23 was about finance. Of the 100 billion dollars that was promised each year in climate finance for developing countries by 2020, developed countries have so far only pledged a little over 10 billion. Clare Shakya from the International Institute for Environment and Development also expressed concern to IPS that climate finance often does not reach the frontline poorest countries and people. ""They get a far lower share than is their fair share,"" she said. Less than 10 percent of an already limited amount of climate finance reaches poor communities. This impacts countries such as Ethiopia where drought is drastically affecting livelihoods. The East African nation, which needs approximately 7.5 billion dollars a year to switch to clean energy and adapt to climate change, is so far receiving between 100 million and 200 million per year. As part of the Paris Agreement, donors must give a future estimate of how much and what kind of climate finance is going to be committed in order for countries to plan and prepare. However, developed countries pushed back on the demands, further delaying discussion and action on the issue. ""You didn't see the developed countries coming here prepared to engage seriously on ramping up finance... parties knew there weren't major political decisions that were going to have to be made as they were facing when they went into Paris,"" Union of Concerned Scientist's Director of Strategy and Policy Alden Meyer told IPS. While over 150 heads of state attended COP21 when the Paris Agreement was negotiated, a little over 25 heads of state attended this year's conference. Both Meyer and Shakya expressed frustration on the lack of urgency over the discussion and implementation of the climate accord. ""It was pretty disappointing for vulnerable countries... that want to see more urgency in terms of mobilizing resources to help them in the wake of devastating hurricanes and typhoons that we have seen this year,"" Meyer told IPS. This can be seen through countries' pledges made under the Paris Agreement which are only one-third of what is required to keep emissions under two degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level by 2030. Though countries agreed to examine ways to close that gap next year, the apathy at COP23 does not bode well for the next year of climate discussions. Shakya noted that the negotiations that did happen during the conference also lacked a holistic approach as the words 'gender' were blocked in discussions about technology transfer while 'finance' was neglected in the gender action plan. ""There's some really frustrating elements within the negotiations now that are trying to derail the connections that need to be there,"" she told IPS. No Clear Leadership As the U.S. has stepped back, even hosting a side event on ""cleaner and more efficient fossil fuels"" which sparked international outrage, many are now looking to both French President Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to take on a leadership role on climate action. ""They both really have personal commitment to the Paris Agreement and at the moment, we are kind of short on leaders--they are our hope,"" said Shakya. In August, the U.S. announced that it will withdraw all funding to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a UN body tasked with researching climate change science. Macron called on Europe and promised to fill in the gap. ""I hope Europe can replace the US as a climate leader and I can tell you that France is ready for that,"" he told delegates. In fact, the European Union (EU) will not be able to reach its goal of reducing emissions by at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 unless policies are changed and more pledges are made. Though countries made a political commitment to ramp up negotiations, Meyer expressed concern that progress may continue to be slow, especially as Poland is hosting COP in 2018. Poland is a heavily coal-dependent economy, with approximately 80 percent of its electricity generation coming from coal. The Climate Change Performance Index gave the Eastern European country a ranking of 40 and noted that it continues to fight climate legislation. In an effort to move away from coal as an energy source, the United Kingdom and Canada created an international ""powering past coal"" alliance. Another 25 national and subnational governments joined the alliance including France, Ethiopia, Mexico, and the U.S. states of Washington and Oregon. However, the alliance does not commit signatories to a specific phase-out date. Several big coal countries also did not join the alliance including Germany, Poland, Australia, China, and India. Small Steps But Big Wins Despite slow progress, COP23 did not end without small victories. Countries agreed to review progress on reducing emissions in 2018 and 2019, as well as conduct assessments on climate finance in 2018 and 2020. The meeting also expanded its representation, formally including women and indigenous communities for the first time. Shakya noted that the inclusion of women and indigenous groups in the decision-making process will help bring more focus on frontline poorest communities. ""It is a really significant first step, but it is a first step only. We need to see this being the building blocks for them to be included in the process of policy development and investment,"" she told IPS. Shakya called for more transparency in climate finance and proposed that donors form a leadership group outside of formal negotiations in order to identify and collaborate on solutions to improve the quality of finance and reporting. Meyer expressed hope that there will be further progress in meetings to happen between now and the next COP, particularly pointing to the One Planet Summit hosted by France in December which aims to bring together political leaders as well as those working in public and private finance to discuss how they can support and accelerate global efforts to fight climate change. ""There is a lot more work to do... if there is political will, there will be a pretty decent outcome. If not, we are not going to see much improvement,"" he said.

""The sculpture highlights IFAD's restoration efforts which focuses on planting trees on degraded lands to stop soil erosion, form a barrier to desertification and provide shelter to crops,"" added Birtwistle. In the Sahel region of Africa, IFAD has already rehabilitated almost 300,000 hectares. For example, in Niger IFAD regenerated 100,000 hectares by protecting land from overgrazing and deforestation and replanting trees. Once barren land now has approximately 50 trees per hectare. In total IFAD's agroforestry and related activities have contributed to the removal of over 58,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The beauty and crucial role of sustainable climate-resilient agriculture ""We wanted negotiators at UNFCCC COP23 to see for themselves the beauty of sustainable climate-resilient agriculture and the crucial role this plays in the wellbeing of rural communities,"" said Birtwistle. ""Farmers have to work with nature to create a truly sustainable food secure future,"" said Astralaga. ""Working with Silas, exhibiting this amazing Biomimic Tree, we show the very real challenge of climate change and environmental sustainability for smallholder farmers in developing countries."" IFAD's investments, including the Adaptation for Smallholder Agriculture Programme (ASAP), help farmers in a variety of ways, from installing weather forecast systems, to introducing new drought-resistant crop varieties, as well as setting up farmer field schools where knowledge and new climate-smart agriculture techniques can be demonstrated and disseminated. \"

Some of these are ambitious, while others are contentious.Ladies and gentlemen,The Paris Agreement is not just about climate, it is about social and developmental issues and ensuring that by the end of COP23 there is at least a draft text in place in preparation for COP24 in Poland next year 2018, in which developed nations commit to further reducing their emission gaps in the pre-2020 period, and the developing world is able to access the much-needed finance to assist with adaptation to, and mitigation of, climate change in other words, the implementation of our Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). An overriding political objective of the Bonn Climate Conference is to sustain the momentum behind the multilateral approach to addressing Climate Change with the United Nations at the forefront, given that Climate Change is a global challenge that requires that no one be left behind.Adaptation is key in delivering basic developmental objectives. South Africa's Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emission reduction system framework is being implemented. Phase Two will be finalised for implementation in the post-2020 period. The National Treasury is working on the finalisation of the Carbon Tax Legislation and the carbon offset regulations, which will also contribute to South Africa's GreenHouse Gas Emission reduction outcome.With regards to the Energy front, Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (REIPPPP) have been successful in contributing to the country's emission reduction, and with the country's significant solar and wind resources will continue to grow Renewable Energy in the energy mix. In the past five years, the Industrial Energy Efficiency Project (IEE Project) has assisted industry to achieve energy savings worth over R1.54 billion. Phase 1 of the SA IEE Project has contributed to a reduction of Carbon emissions. These reductions were achieved across industrial sectors. This Programme has also trained 2600 more energy efficiency practitioners. In conclusion, I would like to express the hope of the Government, and all of you present here this evening that the Bonn Climate Talks are successful and that COP23 will lay the groundwork for a successful international climate change implementation phase to be finalised in Poland in 2018.I thank you. \"
"COP23","South.Africa","COP23_South.Africa7","Lobbying & Sponsorships At COP23 Corrupted Climate Talks [opinion]","November 20, 2017","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","The world's nations got together in Bonn, Germany, for the 23rd annual Conference of the Parties (COP) under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), where nearly 200 countries and some 23, 000 delegates met to discuss and influence the negotiations over the rulebook of the Paris Agreement. The agreement, reached at the COP21 in Paris, brought 195 countries together to adopt the first-ever legally binding global agreement to deal with climate changes through mitigations and financial policies starting in the year 2020. This is why, COP23 Both nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and industry representatives lobbied at COP but not for the same things - businesses have become ever more involved in the UN climate process and this has led to some uncomfortable interactions between the two groups. A recently published report by Corporate Accountability International (CAI) found that energy industries are, in fact, some of the most powerful lobbyists at climate talks such as COP. ""Big Polluters like oil, gas, coal, and agricultural transnational corporations (TNCs) are not only the largest emitters; their climate denial, lobbying, and policy interference make these industries one of the primary obstacles to sound climate policy at the local, national, and international levels,"" states the CAI report, Polluting Paris. For almost as long as the UNFCCC has existed, the same industries whose profits depend on the burning of oil, coal, and gas have been permitted to bankroll the UN climate talks, it elaborated. This has long been a contentious issue because it allows some of the corporations to write checks to bolster the COP Presidency's budget, provide services such as cars for delegates, or even build the negotiating halls where world leaders gather to address climate change. For instance, during COP17 in Durban, corporations were given a choice by the South African government to fund entertaining jazz concerts, fancy gala dinners, or a lounge. The British-South African mining giant, Anglo American, sponsored a number of keynote events, including the official opening ceremony and also co-hosted a cocktail rception hand in hand with the South African government, during which its chief executive warned that an energy future without coal is not an option. The football-stadium-turned-conference-center where the talks took place during COP19 in Warsaw was covered in corporate logos, including PGE and LOTOS, both majority state-owned coal and oil companies. Not only did the Polish government co-organize the ""International Coal and Climate Summit"" alongside the industry-funded World Coal Association, they also used their official COP19 website to push for oil drilling in the Arctic (which LOTOS is involved in). Poland will also host COP24 in 2018, when the guidelines and procedures for implementation of the Paris Agreement will be agreed upon. However, after years of pressure from advocates and civil society, a call for a conflict of interest policy that ensures that participants with interests at odds with the objectives of the UNFCCC to not be invited to participate was finally culminated at the climate change conference held ahead of this year's COP in Bonn in May. Yet when, Fiji, the first small-island developing country to preside over these climate talks, understandably so established a trust fund to raise US 26 million to help to finance this COP23 and was actively requesting financial support, numerous fossil fuel based corporations and developed countries wrote cheques. These include Fiji Airways, which then also sported the COP23 logo on one of its planes as well as Australia, Japan, the EU and even the US that has infamously decided to pull out of the Paris agreement and had reneged on its financial contributions to the UNFCCC or the Green Climate Fund, which aims to help countries like Fiji respond to climate change. ""The dirtiest polluters have long used their sponsorship of climate talks as part of a PR strategy to pretend they are part of the solution,"" says Pascoe Sabido, Corporate Europe Observatory. ""By sponsoring these talks, a Big Polluter can prop itself up as a legitimate actor, which in turn makes politicians more receptive to its deceptive lobbying"" This, he adds, swings the door open even wider for Big Polluters to expand their influence over climate policy. Exxon Mobil, BP, and Chevron, for example, have all previously pledged their support for the Paris accord and even released statements to show their disagreement with Trump's decision to default from the agreement. But the fossil fuel industry has, in fact, known for decades that its products and practices were a danger to the planet - only 25 fossil fuel producers are responsible for over half of global emissions, according to a Carbon Majors Report. But the industry giants have secured a seat at the head of the international climate policymaking table, elaborates the CAI report. Since corporations are able to effectively buy their way into high-level events attended by world climate leaders, sponsorship itself often directly provides them with the lobbying prospects they need to undermine climate policy. At UNFCCC, these fossil fuel TNCs then exploit the climate crisis by hijacking the talks, stifling ambition, pushing false solutions, and blocking the financing (and therefore withholding the availability) of real solutions, according to the report. During COP23 The Ukrainian presenter of the proposal stated that ""the Committee for the Future functions in between the global UNFCCC and national [climate plans and] allows direct participation of the corporates. US energy majors and other non-state actors will be brought to the UN table."" In the lead-up to COP23 , the US Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, had struck an $80 million dollar deal to ship 700,000 tons of thermal coal to Ukraine by the end of the year. In fact, the Trump administration in the US is, perhaps, the most relevant example of how this industry -puppet-show plays out. ""Who can doubt, for example, that the failure of the United States to secure domestic climate legislation, or ratify the Kyoto Protocol or the Paris Agreement, is largely the result of industry interference?"" asks the CAI report. And it is not just the US, many of these UNFCCC-accredited organizations publicly declare support for the Paris Agreement and climate policy more broadly but an in-depth look at who constitute their board of directors and where their money goes shows otherwise. For example, the Business Council of Australia (BCA) member base is made up of 127 CEOs from Australia's largest and wealthiest corporations and BusinessEurope's membership and leadership also includes many polluting corporations yet both have aggressively obstructed climate policy initiatives for years. This in no way, undermines the role of the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement - according to Corporate Accountability, without UNFCC, these Global North governments are left free to do what they want while the rest of the world, especially Global South countries, low-income communities, people of colour, women, and children continue to pay the price. World governments are again slated to take up the issue of conflicts of interest at the climate talks in May 2018. ""Fossil fuels must be left in the ground and Big Polluters must be delinked from the climate talks. To do this, we must end the corporate capture of the UNFCCC,"" says Nnimmo Bassey, from Health of Mother Earth Foundation. The only way Parties to the UNFCCC, it seems, can develop and implement real solutions to climate change is if those working on behalf of Big Oil, Coal, Gas and other Big Polluters aren't allowed to weaken the guidelines world governments are currently developing for implementation of the Paris Agreement, \"

""Countries now have the opportunity to transform their agricultural sectors to achieve food security for all through sustainable agriculture and strategies that boost resource-use efficiency, conserve and restore biodiversity and natural resources, and combat the impacts of climate change,"" said Ren\'e9 Castro, assistant director-general of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). In the livestock sector, for example, FAO estimates that emissions could be readily reduced by about 30% with the adoption of best practices. FAO released a new Sourcebook on Climate-Smart Agriculture. It recommends scaling up public and private climate finance flows to agriculture; spurring public-private partnerships; strengthening a multi-sector and multi-stakeholder dialogue; investing in knowledge and information; and building capacity to address barriers to implement climate action. Managing healthy water supplies ""Sustainable use of water for multiple purposes must remain a way of life and needs to be at the center of building resilient cities and human settlements and ensuring food security in a climate change context,"" said Mariet Verhoef-Cohen, president of the Women for Water Partnership. The international water community co-signed on Friday what it called a ""nature based solution declaration"" to encourage the use of natural systems in managing healthy water supplies. Around 40% of the world's population will face water shortages by 2050, accelerating migration and triggering conflict, while some regions could lose up to 6% of their economic output, unless it is better managed. ""Involving both women and men in decision making and integrated water resources initiatives leads to better sustainability, governance and efficiency"", said Verhoef-Cohen. \"

By promoting the adoption of closing-the-loop production patterns within an economic system a Circular Economy aims to increase the efficiency of resource use, with special focus on urban and industrial waste, to achieve a better balance and harmony between the economy, environment and society.Research has shown that Circular Economy origins are mainly rooted in ecological and environmental economics and industrial ecology. The concept of the circular economy has been widely used in recent years. The definitions of circular economy are many but most of them are centred on restoration and regeneration. Some defined circular economy as a regenerative system in which the resource inputs, waste, emissions are reduced.This can be done through reuse, design, repair, re-purposing and recycling. In essence, the circular economy avoids wastage of resources, it actually brings back the materials that would have been disposed of. It is important to note that circular economy is referred to as the sustainable development model. It is said that the idea behind the Circular Economy is a simple one, it keeps resources at their highest possible level of value at all times within the loop for as long as possible. The idea is to limit or totally eliminate waste and to extend the lifespan of a product as well as to maximize the utilization of products and assets in the value chain. But with the right business model, products could stay in the economy many times longer than today, and utilization rates of everything from cars to consumer goods could increase up to ten times through the use of innovative sharing models. Circular economy encourages companies to re-think about how goods can be designed, produced and marketed with reuse in mind. Africa alliance on circular economyThe discussion on taking forward the cooperation with the European Union on the South Africa-EU Dialogue that had a Seminar on Circular Economy in May this year, a side event to the World Economic Forum that was held in South Africa, Durban. Subsequent communication took place with the WEF on the hosting of a Seminar on the Launch of the Africa Alliance on Circular Economy. This Alliance is not just for few countries but for all countries who will be interested in participating.The objectives of the African Circular Economy Alliance will be set and discussed by all of us in here and those who are not with us today. However, primarily we are looking at linking up the various projects and programmes on the continent and stimulating momentum towards the transformation to a circular economy. This will happen by the creation of a continent wide leaders' network, ""The Alliance"", to advocate and implement Circular Economy strategies, programmes and projects across the continent and in turn to catalyse projects by aiding and creating coalitions to implement on the ground projects. At the WEF there was agreement on a follow up meeting and we have identified the UNFCCC COP 23 as a perfect time as it also involves Minister Biruta of Rwanda and Minister Jibril of Nigeria and they will be present.On the 17th June 2017, in Rwanda, Kigali, I together with Minister Biruta signed a Letter of Intent for a Memorandum of Understanding between the two countries to be developed to enhance mutual cooperation in the field of environment on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. The Africa Alliance on Circular Economy presents us with an opportunity to look at a collaboration with Rwanda that includes other countries in the continent.Circular economy in South AfricaSouth Africa fully embraces the circular economy approach and has been mainstreamed in our green economy strategy as well as our initiatives within the waste-recycling economy. South Africa has committed to the implementation of its Green Economy Strategy. The Working for Waste Programme is an Expanded Public Works infrastructure initiative focusing on waste recycling and beneficiation while creating much needed jobs and includes amongst others, the following:Buy back CentresLandfill Weigh bridge installation and remediationMaterial Recovery FacilitiesIn addition, we have initiated a Recycling Enterprise Support Programme for promoting the establishment of SMMEs, cooperatives and new entrants in the waste sector. We have commenced with the implementation of Industry Waste Management Plans for 4 priority waste streams, namely tyre, paper and packaging, lighting and electronic waste which fully encapsulate the circular economy principles.There is huge potential in South Africa to create circular economies that generate wealth from waste. When this is achieved, it will have a particular value for poor and marginalised communities, who will benefit enormously from the jobs created and the businesses established from waste recycling. However, the creation of successful circular economies requires the following policy steps:We recently launched the Chemicals and Waste Economy Phakisa Lab with the following objectivesrow the secondary resources economy by increasing local utilization and beneficiation of waste resources by 50%-75% through creation of an enabling regulatory environment,Generation of opportunities from chemical and waste resources for the creation of jobs/ opportunities in newexisting markets specifically through enabling SMMEs,Investment in research, development and innovation (RandDI), to enhance the utilization of local waste resources for new products, substances and services that will create jobs, and enhance the production of environmentally friendly chemicals, andReduce waste to landfill by 75% of industrial waste and 50% of municipal waste through education and awareness, a more compliant society and application of cleaner technologies. The Phakisa outcomes pointed us to a number of opportunities relating to waste recycling and circular economy includingRecycling and beneficiation of Bulk industrial waste for construction ash, gypsum, slag, and sludge and municipal biomass,Establishment of Refuse Derived Fuel plants using waste as fuel,Separation of waste at source regulations to maximise waste recycling,Development of standards for waste minimisation and product design, andRecognition and Incentive programmes for best practice.Furthermore we have launched several large scale commercial business ventures jointly between government, the private sector and micro-collectors. (Mpact, Extrupet)Opportunities for job creation exist in moving waste away from landfilling towards alternative waste treatment across the entire waste hierarchy are as follows:Cleaner production, industrial efficiency, design for environment,Dismantling, refurbishment, reuse,Collection, sorting, reprocessing, manufacturing, andWaste-to-energy operation.In conclusionIn conclusion, ladies and gentleman South Africa is committed to its 2030 vision through the National Development Plan of a ""transition to an environmentally sustainable, climate change resilient, low-carbon economy and just society"" and from this, to enhance South Africa's implementation of the Circular economy. The conversation among African countries and other role-players in waste management should be clearly and mostly about the economics of the circular economy. It would be silly to forget that resource use is strongly connected to environmental and social issues. More especially for us as Africa and for the Africa Alliance on Circular Economy.There is also a great potential for reducing environmental harm in applying the circularity concept and many proponents of circularity see this as an important argument in favour of the concept. The Alliance will also help us in providing more opportunities for the Africa Continent.As leaders in African Governments we want to support the circular economy. We believe that relevant policies are needed to achieve both economic growth and reduced negative environmental impacts. Important results have been achieved in some activity sectors such as in waste management, where large waste recycling rates can be achieved. To achieve circular economy, all role players of all sectors must be involved including the society. There is also a need for an economic return on investment, in order to provide suitable motivation to companies and investors. It is mainly through our commitment and continued participation by all role players that we can achieve what we want to achieve through the adoption of Circular Economy and the establishment of the Africa Alliance on Circular Economy. \"

So said Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa, who leads the South African delegation to the 23rd UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of Parties ( CoP23 ). The convention is expected to advance work on the implementation guidelines for the Paris Agreement, discuss loss and damage owing to climate change, finance, technology and capacity building for developing countries. ""In determining the climate action during the pre-2020 period, COP23 is crucial in determining what is required of all parties to continue the good work that we have been doing to ensure that clear elements of action are agreed to that can be converted into text early in 2018,"" Molewa said. It was important there was agreement this year on the contents of, and accounting for, Nationally Determined Contributions submitted by Parties to the UNFCCC and how parties should communicate and report on action related to their adaptation efforts and needs. ""We are hopeful that all issues of importance to developing countries, such as adaptation and means of implementation, will be addressed in the rule book to be adopted before 2020,"" Molewa said. The South African team also worked in collaboration with the National Business Initiative (NBI), in hosting a series of dialogue at pavilions to focus on collective efforts between the government, business and civil society at a country level, in both adaptation and mitigation. Environmental Affairs Deputy Minister Barbara Thomson welcomed delegates to the South African pavilion. ""The Paris Agreement is not just about climate, it is about social and developmental issues and ensuring that by the end of COP23 there is at least a draft text in preparation for COP24 in Poland next year and which developed nations commit to further reducing their emission gaps in the pre-2020 period. ""Also that the developing world can access the finance to assist with adaptation to, and mitigation of, climate change... in other words, the implementation of our Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs),"" Thomson said. The Treasury is working on finalising the carbon tax legislation and the carbon offset regulations, which will also contribute to South Africa's greenhouse gas emission reduction outcome, she added. The Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme had been successful in contributing to the country's emission reduction, and with the country's significant solar and wind resources will continue to grow renewable energy in the energy mix. In the past five years, the Industrial Energy Efficiency Project has assisted industry to achieve energy savings worth over R1.54billion,"" Thomson said. \"

Hosted by Fiji, the first ""island COP"" shone a spotlight on the impacts of climate change on island states and particularly vulnerable countries. As an Ethiopian, I know intimately the pain caused by climate change. My country is in the grip of a severe drought that has put 13 million people in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia at risk of increased food insecurity. As Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama of Fiji put it, ""we are all in the same canoe"". The impacts may vary, but no country can escape the damage of climate change. This is why we came to COP23 with high expectations for a COP of action and support, with substantive outcomes to achieve the goals set by the international community in Paris. The Least Developed Countries (LDC) group welcome progress that has been made here at COP23 , including the adoption of the Gender Action Plan and the Indigenous Peoples' and Local Communities' Platform. It is essential that we amplify marginalised voices and recognise the disproportionate impact of climate change on women and indigenous communities. This is crucial for achieving global climate justice and for addressing the multi-faceted threat of climate change. Progress was also made on the design of the Talanoa Dialogue to be held in 2018. The Dialogue must lead to an increase in ambition by all countries to put us on track to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5C. COP23 The LDCs are committed to leading on ambitious climate action in our countries - a key example is the LDC Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Initiative, an LDC-owned and driven initiative to bring universal access to clean energy in the world's poorest countries. Tackling climate change also requires support for adaptation and loss and damage action in poor and particularly vulnerable countries. The LDC Group thanks Germany, Sweden and Belgium for the contributions to the Adaptation Fund and Least Developed Countries Fund. We hope to see other countries following suit and rapidly accelerating their finance pledges to meet the scale of support needed by developing countries to fill the ever-widening finance gap. In particular, the need to adapt to and address the irreversible loss and damage arising from climate change is a matter of urgency for LDCs. The scale of loss and damage that LDCs are experiencing is already beyond our capacity to respond and it will only get worse, with more lives lost, more destruction to infrastructure and a bigger impact on our economies. We will not be able to raise our people out of poverty if we do not address loss and damage and for that we need support. The LDCs call for a global response to climate change that is fair and equitable, that advances the interests and aspirations of poor and vulnerable countries and peoples, and fulfils our Paris vision of limiting warming to below 1.5C to ensure a safe and prosperous future for all.

The whole world affirmed this in Paris and Marrakech when the Paris Agreement entered into force on the 4th November last year,"" said President Zuma on Monday.The President was speaking at the Meeting of the Committee of African Heads of State and Government on Climate Change (CAHOSCC) at the United Nations (UN) Headquarters in New York. The CAHOSCC meeting is hosted by the African Union Commission (AUC) on the margins of UN General Assembly (UNGA) taking place in New York in preparation for the 23rd Conference of the Parties ( COP 23 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The meeting involves 13 African member countries of the CAHOSC. President Zuma said negotiations on the Paris rule-book must remain on track and ensure that there is sufficient clarity on parties' commitments under their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) on mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation.This will ensure that Africa's key sectors are prioritised in the Implementation of NDCs, while also enhancing efforts towards poverty alleviation. President Zuma is confident that international solidarity will prevail at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) COP23 , which will take place from 6 17 November in Bonn, Germany.""Developing countries should be provided with adequate support for their mitigation and adaptation actions and progress should be made on a post-2020 finance goal that should be significant more than the 2020 goal of US$100 billion per year in climate finance,"" the President said. He said the efforts of developing countries to adapt to climate change with their own resources should also be recognised as a contribution to the global effort to address climate change.The President said the continent must make progress on the Global Stocktake at the upcoming Bonn conference. The Global Stocktake, which has the objective of tracking commitments and progress in implementation, must inform parties' future NDCs.""It should, therefore, take account of all the elements of climate action, namely mitigation, adaptation and the means of implementation. "" President Zuma said it is important for the Africa Group, particularly in the time of global uncertainty, to emphasise adherence to the principles of the Convention, in particular the common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities, equity and the need for developed countries to take the lead in combatting climate change.Those principles, he said, remain applicable to the Paris Agreement. ""The Africa Group should not allow any renegotiation of the Paris Agreement. It was a landmark achievement of the international community. It presents us with the best vehicle to address climate change, which is a monumental challenge of our time, in a manner that is fair and that takes into account countries' national circumstances."" President Zuma said climate change poses both a threat and opportunity to development. ""The pursuit of a low-carbon and climate resilient development opens up opportunities for not only achieving our development goals, but also achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the goals set out in Agenda 2063.""Investing in energy infrastructurePresident Zuma said infrastructure investment is also key to development, and the Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA) provides a blue print for such collaboration. The Africa group must therefore explore the appropriate blend of public, multilateral and private finance to accelerate investment. The President said renewable energy investment, as part of an energy mix, provides an investment opportunity in Africa's electricity sector. ""The African Renewable Energy Initiative and the Africa Adaptation Initiative should focus on identified synergies and funding opportunities, while encouraging best practise sharing, peer learning and tapping into technical skills available on the continent. ""We should also focus on building partnerships with the aim of building capacity in low-carbon planning and improving the relevant institutions in the energy, transport and the water sectors. We should also exploit opportunities in solar and wind power as well as gas, hydro, biofuels as alternatives energy sources,"" the President said.

"COP23","South.Africa","COP23_South.Africa16","Bring women farmers to the food security table","September 20, 2017","Mail & Guardian","On a lovely spring day this month, I was surprised by what I witnessed at South Africa's first urban agricultural summit.Usually when I attend such meetings, I sit in a room full of professional food security experts, many of whom have never set foot on a farm and many of whom are men. Instead, at this convening, I sat with farmers who own and run thriving urban farming enterprises in Johannesburg. What's more, the majority of people there were successful urban women farmers. During the course of conversation, I quickly learnt that these women farmers are at the frontline of achieving the food security and nutrition needs of the rising populations of South African cities. Indeed, the government supports them and ensures they are at important national and international meetings so that their voices are heard. Even though women comprise about 43% of the global agricultural force and produce as much as 90% of the food in African countries, it is uncommon that farmers, especially women farmers, are represented in boardrooms and at conferences.I am a food security expert and a woman who grew up on a small farm along the Kenyan coast. As an agricultural scientist and a passionate food security and sustainable agricultural development advocate, over the course of the past 10 years I have attended dozens of national and international food security and agricultural development conferences and I have observed over and over the absence of real farmers and women and minorities at these gatherings. Their absence is wrong and shameful, especially when so many conferences focus on demographics such as low-income farmers, minorities and women, and yet representatives of those demographics are rarely present to speak for themselves. Often the discourse in conferences and meetings about development problems helps to shape ideas and drive policy, public opinion and resources. Thus it is crucial that every stakeholder, including women farmers, is represented.Many advantages can come from including them. First, they can tell it as it is. These farmers face the difficulties we try to solve so they are better placed to describe the problems accurately. Getting to hear firsthand issues as told by the farmers themselves rather than assuming or describing their issues allows development experts to design effective and effective solutions. Second, they can offer ideas and new ways of thinking to solve problems. Failing to include these important clients means we are missing the brainpower and potentially novel ideas that could be game-changing. Think of what could be accomplished if their ideas were included and valued? Third, including farmers sends a strong message that their ideas matter. And because they see that their ideas matter, they are more likely to implement the proposed solutions and these could result in sustainable practices. Accurately representing and listening to people doing on-the-ground work for food security should be the norm at conferences and should be replicated in Africa and around the world if we truly want to solve our difficulties in a sustainable manner. Of course, some places are already doing this. The World Food Prize, for example, for the past few years has invited women farmers to participate in its annual prize-giving. The United Nations Climate Change conference invited a Kenyan farmer, Kisilu Muasya, to speak at the COP21 climate change conference. But more than one or a handful of farmers need to be included.This does not have to be a big task. The government and extension officers could identify farmers in their countries and these farmers could then be supported to travel to conferences  and to participate in local, national and international gatherings.We also need to gather and publish data about the representation of women farmers in agriculture and food security conferences so we know and show how inclusive we are. As the primary food producers, women occupy a unique place in the food and agriculture system. Their voices need to be heard. If we truly want to solve food security issues sustainably, then we must bring women farmers to the table.Esther Ngumbi is a postdoctoral researcher at Auburn University, a food security fellow with Aspen Institute New Voices and a commitment mentor for agriculture with Clinton Global University Initiative \"
"COP23","South.Africa","COP23_South.Africa17","Trump won't scupper Paris agreement on climate change","June 7, 2017","Mail & Guardian","ENVIRONMENTThe announcement by United States President Donald Trump last Thursday that the US will be withdrawing from the historic Paris Agreement to combat climate change is regrettable. This reflects an abdication of global responsibility the US (like all countries of the world) has to reduce emissions and to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change: not just for present generations but also for future ones. Previous US administrations, states, cities, scientific organisations, civil society, businesses and citizens have made an outstanding contribution to the fight against climate change.The current position of the Trump administration is a blight on this otherwise excellent track record  and it is hoped the US government will reconsider its decision.The announcement is also contrary to the spirit of multilateralism, the rule of law and trust between nations.The Paris Agreement was the culmination of a four-year negotiation process known as the ADP (Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action) at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP17) which was held in Durban, South Africa, in 2011. It represents the best possible flexible and dynamic approach to keeping global temperature increases well below 2\'c2\'b0C, and is a victory for multilateralism. This historic agreement entered into force far earlier than expected due to the extraordinary speed of ratification by parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, including the US. The agreement was adopted 15 years after the withdrawal of the US from the Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gases, and reflects the scientific consensus on the severity of the climate change crisis.To date, 147 countries have ratified it, with South Africa having done so in November 2016.Trump's words at last Thursday's announcement, that the Paris Agreement disproportionately disadvantages the US, is regrettable, considering that the US has historically been a significant contributor to global emissions. It follows, therefore, that the country has a moral obligation not only to lead in reducing emissions, but also to support poorer economies in contributing to the global effort.It is scientifically established that, although the effects of climate change are widespread, they disproportionately burden the poor and most vulnerable in developing countries. There is clearly overwhelming consensus in the international community that climate change is the single biggest threat to wellbeing, health and socioeconomic development facing humanity this century. Climate change is a global problem, requiring a global solution, which can only be effectively addressed multilaterally, under the broad-based legitimacy of the UN framework convention.The convention is one of three Rio conventions to which there are 196 state signatories, and sets out obligations for all countries to reduce emissions, adapt to the unavoidable adverse effects of climate change and report on national implementation. Importantly, it contains an implicit recognition of both the vulnerability of poorer countries to the effects of climate change and the right of poorer nations to economic development.The success of the Paris Agreement hinges heavily on the extent to which developed countries, historically bear the responsibility for the majority of the world's climate change-causing emissions, are able to meet their commitment to developing countries, which have historically been low emitters.During all the international climate change negotiations, South Africa emphasised that the principles of the convention must apply throughout  in particular the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. The agreement, which will be fully operational by 2020, is premised on contributions determined by countries themselves towards collectively agreed global goals. So what Trump has said  that decisions were imposed on the US  would be inaccurate.The negotiations that led up to the adoption of the Paris Agreement were characterised by global solidarity and common purpose, and culminated in a pact that was fair, ambitious, effective and durable. This was in implicit acknowledgement that climate change is a global problem requiring a global solution that could only be reached through multilateralism.We have full confidence that the momentum of the collective effort to address climate change will only accelerate, and that the withdrawal by the US will not stop years of hard work. We congratulate some developed countries that have resisted succumbing to a call for renegotiations. South Africa reiterates its un-wavering commitment to the realisation of the goals set out in the convention and the Paris Agreement. The global effort to curb climate change and address its effect cannot be postponed. There is an urgent need for action, and there is no space for renegotiation.Edna Molewa is the minister of environmental affairs \"

Mostly spared by the troubles of the Arab Spring, the Kingdom reached agreements with some of the biggest players in the aerospace industry, including Boeing, Bombardier, Airbus, Daher, Safran, Thales, UTC Aerospace Systems, Lat\'e9co\'e8re, and others. At the end of 2016 it hosted over 110 companies, comprising over 11,500 employees and generating $1 billion in exports, with annual revenue growth at 17%. In May 2016, The Economist named Morocco ""a rising star in the west"" and cited its aerospace cluster as one reason for optimism, while the city of Casablanca ranked sixth in the top 10 aerospace cities in terms of cost-effectiveness. Yet this is not sufficient for Rabat, whose plan for 2020 is to bring 23,000 new jobs to the aerospace sector and generate over $1.6 billion in new export revenue. And indeed, major foreign companies continue to invest. While Airbus's latest Global Market Forecast 2017-2036 predicts a need for 35,000 new passenger and dedicated freighter aircraft, Kevin Michaels, from the consultancy AeroDynamic Advisory, wrote in Aviation Week & Space Technology that ""with major civil OEMs laser-focused on cost reduction, the outlook for Morocco appears to be bright"". Labour-intensive activities will continue to flow to ""best-cost"" countries"". Vice-President of Bombardier Morocco, Stephen Orr concurs, adding that companies usually demand ""ever decreasing costs, for ever-increasing quality"". Moroccan Representatives were present at Japan's Aeromart Nagoya Business Convention last month to promote their country, and if North Africa is still a grey area for Japanese investors, Yukito Ikeda, the outside production manager of Kawasaki, agrees on the fact that ""emerging countries are becoming a very important area for us, in order to win the price competition, with low-cost production"". Boeing signed a deal in September 2016 to build a new hub in the Tangier region and pledged to encourage suppliers to set up or expand there. Up to 120 Boeing suppliers from across the group's global supply chain could be expected to move in. According to what the Industry Minister told AFP at the signing ceremony, such a move would represent 8,700 new jobs and an additional $1 billion a year in export revenue. Airbus built (EURO)40 million worth of facilities creating up to 800 jobs through 2018 and Lat\'e9co\'e8re opened a 6,000 square metre (EURO)11 million factory in August 2016. Daher will inaugurate a third site in Morocco to produce composite parts and French aerostructure supplier Figeac Aero signed in July this year an agreement to invest (EURO)26 million. Also this year, French SMEs conglomerate WeAre Aerospace set up a subsidiary WeAre Aerospace Morocco (WAM) with a 2,500 square metre plant in Rabat and a 3,500 square metre plant in Tangiers. But low-cost is not all that Morocco has to offer. The country aims to develop more technology intensive industries. Thales is seeking to make of Morocco its ""African hub"", and expand both its civil and defence activities. The French firm plans to set up a cybersecurity centre of expertise and opened in September last year a 1,000 square metre 3D printing facility in Casablanca, which will be the only dedicated centre of expertise for the whole group. Scheduled to be fully operational by 2018, it will operate 10 high-tech selective laser melting printers and employ up to 20 engineers. Even though this may seem few, Thales did specify all of them would be Moroccans. Aeronautics SMEs are still few and far between, but can draw from an educated population. Chosen with 14 others amongst 20,000 applicants in the Start-up Istanbul competition, Moroccan startup ATLAN Space has developed artificial intelligence programmes for drones used to spot illegal fishing vessels off West Africa's coast, a technology that young local engineers were able to showcase during the November 2017 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bonn. Morocco also aims to ""play a special strategic role in business aviation"", according to Minister of tourism Mohammed Sajid. Marrakech held the second Middle East Business Aviation Association (MEBAA) Morocco Show in September. With Africa expected to receive 200 business jets for $7 billion in the next decade, according to the Bombardier Business Aircraft Market Forecast, the Kingdom is expecting to form ""a hub between the continents of Europe, the Middle East and Africa"". The government has launched tenders for 10 FBO slots, five of which were awarded to Jetex Flight Support and four to Swissport Maroc SA, a unit of Swissport Executive Aviation. Jetex's FBOs are expected to be complete by the end of next year and Swissport claims that the build-out of its FBOs will be complete by October 2018. If the volume of business jet activity is ""relatively low "" for Office National Des A\'e9roports (ONDA) CEO Zouhair El Aoufir, a new business aviation airport will open in 2025, and talks are underway to lessen government restrictions on operating private aircraft.

"COP23","South.Africa","COP23_South.Africa19","Monsanto to become carbon neutral by 2021","November 22, 2017 Wednesday","Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Other industries)","Monsanto Company recently announced at COP23 that they have made significant progress toward getting its operations carbon neutral by 2021... Monsanto has already reduced its carbon footprint by more than 200,000 metric tonnes, a reduction that is roughly equal to burning 200 million pounds less coal. The company expects the rate of these reductions to accelerate over the next several years and is collaborating with farmers, NGOs and global partners to encourage the adoption of climate-smart practices across the agriculture industry. Monsanto s approach to achieving carbon neutrality focuses on three main areas: internal operations, including seed production; breakthrough products; joint efforts with farmers and global partners. Adapting to climate change A common denominator across Monsanto s approach is the role of crops and healthy soil in adapting to and mitigating climate change. Working with outside experts in data science on extensive modelling, Monsanto has demonstrated that certain modern agriculture practices and innovations can reduce emissions and enable crops to be grown in a way that absorbs and stores greenhouse gases in the soil in amounts equal to or greater than the total amount of gases emitted from producing those crops. Many of the practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions are quite beneficial for preserving natural resources, enhancing the efficiency of utilisation of nutrients and positively impacting water and air quality, says Debbie Reed, Executive Director of the Coalition on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases. Increasing soil health and soil carbon is one major way that we can reduce greenhouse gases, and agriculture clearly has a role to play there. It s related not only to natural resources but our ability to feed and sustain growing populations all over the world. There s an interconnectivity there that is fairly unique to the agricultural sector. More information on Monsanto s commitment to becoming carbon neutral. \"

""The EU and South Africa are strategic partners and engage on a number of issues bilaterally, as well as in multilateral fora,"" said Minister Molewa.The Minister and EU Commission member for the Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, Mr Karmenu Vella, in 2016 signed a revised Terms of Reference for the Forum on Environment, Climate Change, Sustainable Development and Water. The first meeting of the dialogue took place in May this year and a number of key issues including Climate Change, Marine Litter, the Circular Economy, and the outcomes of 17th Conference of Parties (CoP) to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the illegal wildlife trade, were discussed.A Circular Economy mission took place on the margins of the World Economic Forum for Africa (WEF Africa) in Durban in May 2017 providing an opportunity for both South African and European business, and other stakeholders, to engage on opportunities presented by the Circular Economy. Minister Molewa acknowledged the invitation from the EU to participate in a side event during the Third United Nations Environmental Assembly (UNEA-3) on the Circular Economy in Kenya in December.The participation in UNEA-3 follows the development during the Chemicals and Waste Economy Phakisa in September 2017 of more than 20 business plans for the sector in order to grow the contribution to the economy, job creation and the waste diversion targets set by government. ""South Africa has been involved in beneficiation of waste for many years the scaling up of these initiatives has always been a challenge,"" said Minister Molewa.Referring to preparations for the upcoming 23rd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Bonn, Germany, in November, Dr Molewa emphasized that climate change action has to be integrated into development initiatives. The Partnership for Action on the Green Economy (PAGE) is aimed at facilitating scaled up, economy-wide implementation of green, low carbon and climate resilient sustainable development interventions.""We will continue to work with the EU in the coming COP23 to ensure that we make progress on the Paris Agreement Work Programme. It is our view that we should leave COP23 with some clear elements that can be converted into negotiation text early in 2018. At COP22 in Marrakech we had set ourselves a target of completing the Paris Work Programme during COP24. We have also committed to clarifying the modalities for the 2018 Facilitative Dialogue aimed at increasing ambition in the pre-2020 and post-2020 years through the revisions on Nationally Determined Contributions where possible,"" said the Minister.With regarding the 17th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), held in Johannesburg in 2016, the Minister said it was imperative that South Africa and the EU continue to collaborate in a number of areas, including trophy hunting and the protection of species, the development of livelihood opportunities for rural communities from hunting, and the development of incentives for habitat conservation. Minister Molewa said it would be prudent for South Africa and the EU to discuss matters related to the consultation process initiated by the EU to gather information and evidence on the extent of legal and illegal trade in ivory in the EU, as well as on possible evolution of EU rules in that respect, which seem to include the import of ivory as part of hunting trophies, particularly since the Bloc and South Africa's cooperation at CITES COP17 had resulted in the adoption of a Resolution on the Trade in Hunting Trophies. South Africa is also implementing strict regulations and norms and standards to ensure the conservation and sustainable use of the African elephant. ""We are concerned that further restrictions on hunting trophies could potentially have a significant impact on the conservation of the species and hold socio-economic implications,"" said the Minister emphasizing that the 2016 Great Elephant Census had shown that the South African population of African elephant is stable.The Minister had also stressed that the international trade in rhino horn for commercial purposes. ""International trade in rhino horn for commercial purposes will remain prohibited and that South Africa will continue to enforce the CITES provisions in this regard. We are in the process of finalising the set of regulations that will introduce further restrictions and requirements to regulate the domestic trade in rhino horn,"" said the Minister. ""South Africa would like to assure the EU Member States that it remains committed to ensuring the effective and strict regulation of the legal, domestic trade in rhino horn. The implementation of the integrated strategic approach to address poaching of rhino and the illegal trade in rhino horn remains a priority for all government departments and entities involved.

"COP23","South.Africa","COP23_South.Africa21","ISS: Climate change is feeding armed conflict in Somalia","April 6, 2018 Friday","defenceWeb","The blast that killed over 350 people and the double car bombing in Mogadishu last October have frustrated Somalia's efforts to build stability. For almost 30 years, the country has been tackling a combination of civil war, famine, desertification, piracy, political fragmentation and terrorism. Although the conflict has many underlying causes, one factor that remains poorly understood is climate change. In a country where, alongside war, six million people face starvation, understanding the role of climate change and its impact on patterns of drought - and developing innovative responses - is urgent. Since the resilience to climate consequences by government and society is limited, the ability of around 70% of Somalis to meet their basic needs depends heavily on a regular climate pattern. However, over the past decade climate change-related desertification has expanded in Somalia, making the local population even more vulnerable. Climate change feeds armed conflict in Somalia in three ways: by exacerbating tensions between clans; boosting the ranks and role of terrorist groups, including al-Shabaab; and increasing migration. First, climate change sharpens disputes over already-scarce resources between warlords. While al-Shabaab has conquered large pieces of the country's territory, clan elders still wield considerable power, dominating the political system. In this sense, the severe droughts cause disruptions to water access, high rates of malnutrition, disease outbreaks and food insecurity. This leads to tension and even open disputes between clans. In a country facing such challenges, resources like food and water are not only a basic need, but also a source of power. Second, the relationship between the proliferation of illegal armed groups and the severe droughts in Somalia is evident in the case of al-Shabaab. The group has been successful in attracting young people who are affected by famine and food insecurity and who face no job prospects. Those youth end up joining al-Shabaab in a bid to survive, finding no other option than to get involved with the extremist group. Third, migration has become more complex due to climate change. In 2016, at least one million Somalis were internally displaced, exposed to protection risks, discrimination and gender-based violence. Making the situation even worse, around 300 000 Somali refugees living in the Dadaab refugee complex - the world's largest refugee camp, located in neighbouring Kenya - have faced heightened uncertainty since Kenya announced the compound will close. Although desertification perpetuates and expands the levels of violence in Somalia - with possible spill-overs into neighbouring states, as is already the case in Kenya - climate change has received relatively little attention when compared to anti-terrorism and security sector reform. Global and regional powers and international organisations have focused on fighting terrorism and piracy in the Horn of Africa. Most of the international community recognises the influence of human activity on the climate system and its severe consequences. These include shifts in rain patterns, increasing desertification, higher frequency and severity in tornados and hurricanes, temperature disturbance and frequent heat waves. But neither the Paris Agreement nor last November's United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany, have addressed the links between climate change and armed conflicts. They also haven't offered recommendations on how to build resilience in this area in fragile states. This is particularly worrisome because even a slight change in the global temperature is enough to provoke a set of weather calamities. Many developing and developed countries are implementing public policies to prevent, mitigate and adapt to climate change consequences. In most cases, governments and other stakeholders are able to tap into technical expertise, new technology, and relatively or highly stable societies. But conflict-affected countries, which are socially, politically and economically vulnerable, encounter considerable obstacles in addressing the effects of climate change. Instability, low state capacity and prioritising more immediate goals tend to sideline climate change issues. This is despite the fact that climate change exacerbates existing problems and intensifies violence, as in Somalia's case. Given these obstacles, initiatives to adapt and mitigate consequences of climate change in fragile countries must be incorporated into approaches to prevent armed conflicts. These include the G7+ group of 'fragile states' and its effort to promote the United Nations' Agenda 2030 in conflict-affected states, including through implementing the UN Sustainable Development Goal 16. This goal is dedicated to promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, providing access to justice for all, and building accountable and effective institutions at all levels. A partnership between Somalia's government, the UN Development Programme and the Global Environment Facility represents a promising yet somewhat isolated example. The goal of this partnership - the Enhancing Climate Resilience of the Vulnerable Communities and Ecosystems in Somalia initiative (2014-2019) - is to implement ecosystem-based drought and flood preparedness to adapt to extreme climate events. For example the project currently works with small-scale farmers in parts of Somalia, such as Puntland. Although the initiative is local, if it succeeds, efforts to scale up the response should be considered. International actors should also consider responses such as the transfer of agricultural technology capacity, whether through aid or south-south cooperation, to help farmers avoid losing their crops and livestock. Microcredit should be offered in order to help farmers keep productive land. Most African countries don't have strong measures in place to adapt to climate change. Environmental initiatives must be taken into account in conflict prevention in Africa, as such initiatives could help decrease violence, as well as promote food security and development. While climate change requires a global response, local efforts are also needed in order to build resilience and improve living conditions in conflict-affected states.

But as South Africa's chief negotiator at the Bonn climate change talks, he knows he's going to be drinking a lot of it. ""Man, we work long hours,"" he said, speaking by phone from Germany yesterday. ""Sometimes, you work three days non-stop. There are no weekends, it's just work. And lots of coffee. I don't like coffee but I have to drink it."" Still, Kekana would not be anywhere else. ""I love my job, representing my country and my people and making sure we have a fair outcome at the talks. ""What I don't like is people who say something, but mean something different."" As South Africa's lead negotiator at the 23rd UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of Parties ( COP23 ), which kicked off this week, Kekana and his colleagues know they have their work cut out. ""We've had five days of intense preparations in Bonn before (this week's) sessions started. We have to transition now to text-based negotiations and we're hoping by the end we'll have actual text."" Last week, the UN stated that countries ""were not doing enough to save hundreds of millions from a miserable future"" with a temperature increase of 3C looking ""very likely"" by 2100. National pledges, it said, only brought a third of the reduction in emissions required by 2030 to meet climate targets, with private sector and sub-national action ""not increasing at a rate that would help close this worrying gap"", and pledges needed to be stronger when revised in 2020. Kekana explained that the annual talks were expected to advance work on the implementation guidelines for the Paris Agreement. ""The real difference with this COP is, having agreed on the political consensus in Paris in 2015, we now have to move towards implementation, and this COP is tasked with these implementation guidelines - what should be done, when and by whom, and who will be supported by whom, so this is the real stuff. It will frame what our next set of contributions will look like."" The talks are expected to discuss loss and damage from climate change, finance, technology and capacity-building for developing countries. ""It's difficult for developing countries to do meaningful implementation of climate change actions without support,"" says Kekana. ""As South Africa, we still have some room to develop and we want to develop in a cleaner way. That's where we're trying to find each other, so we don't repeat the mistakes that have been made. ""We want to secure support so we can do more, and that's in essence what these talks are about."" \"
"COP23","South.Africa","COP23_South.Africa23","Economic Development Vs. Climate Action - Rebutting Deniers and Wafflers","November 12, 2017","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","As negotiators meet in Bonn to put together a deal to implement the Paris Agreement, John Holdren, a professor of environmental policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, stressed that economic development and climate change mitigation and adaptation are not 'either-or' but must be pursued together. Addressing science journalists a week before the Bonn climate talks, Professor Holdren said among climate change skeptics, ""wafflers' are the most dangerous, because their arguments to postpone aggressive climate action now in favor of economic progress has the potential to increasingly influence debate and government policy."" According to Professor Holdren, the wafflers claim to favor research and development on better technologies so emissions reductions can be made more cheaply in the future, and further argue for accelerating economic progress in developing countries as the best way to reduce their vulnerability as well as counting on adaptation as needed. However, it is ironic, he says, that the current US administration ""with climate deniers and wafflers occupying top positions"" are cutting support for the same approaches they propose. ""Of course, the deniers and the wafflers in the top positions in the Trump administration are, with surpassing cynicism, busy cutting support for all of these approaches,"" he said, referencing the numerous reversals that the Trump administration has made even to the 'win-win' adaptation-preparedness resilience measures adopted under Obama. Apart from drastic domestic spending cuts to climate related programmes, President Trump earlier this year decided to pull the US out of the Paris Agreement--a move that has left the global community wondering what's next. Africa's Dismay Despite its negligent contribution to global emissions, Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change - already suffering droughts, floods, affecting the predominantly rain-fed agricultural productivity and production. And Professor Holdren's address titled: Why the Wafflers are Wrong - Addressing Climate Change is Urgent--and a Bargain delivered to the 10th World Conference of Science Journalists (WCSJ2017) in San Francisco, California, held 26-30th October 2017, is music to the ears of the African Group of Negotiators (AGN) who have been pushing urgent climate action at the UNFCCC negotiating table. According to Professor Seth Osafo of AGN, ""The slow progress by developed country parties towards reaching the US$100 billion goal of joint annual mobilization by 2020 is not in Africa's interest."" And in the words of Emphraim Mwepya Shitima, Chief Environmental and Natural Resources Officer at Zambia's Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources, the developing country community needs financial resources now more than ever. ""We are at a critical stage where we need all the financial resources we can get to effectively implement our NDC which is off course now in sync with the recently launched Seventh National Development Plan running up to 2021,"" he told delegates at a COP23 preparatory meeting. With the US pullout meaning the loss of a major financial contributor, there are fears that the resource mobilization process might even get slower. Mithika Mwenda, Secretary General of the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA), a consortium of African civil society organisations, is also concerned and is pushing for industrialised countries to set more ambitious goals in terms of their emission cuts. ""Coming from the region that suffers the most due to climate change, we have watched with utter dismay President Trump's continued efforts at dismantling the former President's Barrack Obama's climate legacy, and wish to reiterate that this is the time to classify the global community into two: those for the people and planet, and those for Trump and profit,"" says Mwenda. He questioned the presence of the official US delegation, saying it may be a bad influence on other states that are already reluctant to take serious action on climate change. ""The US withdraws from the Paris Agreement, yet they still want to show that they can negotiate the implementation framework,"" complained Mwenda, ""That's why we are calling in delegates here to sign our petition to kick Trump and his government out of these negotiations... "" Scientifically, climate change is a serious complex issue - it requires well-developed research systems especially on how it impacts different sectors of development, or at least in the spirit of the WCSJ2017 theme, to bridge science and societies. Unfortunately, as compared to the developed world, Africa's scientific research and development still lags behind such that most often than not, it relies on the developed world for data, a concern that South Africa's Minister of Science and Technology, Naledi Pandor raised during a session on Who will do Science at the WCSJ2017. Pandor believes private companies which drive scientific innovations in the developed world must stop seeing the developing world just as a mass clientele--where research and development is done just for corporate interests and not for the benefit of the people. ""A number of private companies only have commercial relationships but do not have innovation relationships with the developing world; so the nature of partnerships between my continent Africa and other parts of the developing world must change,"" she said. ""If we are to do science in the 21st century... the way we perceive Africa and scientists in Africa has to fundamentally alter."" She further lamented the sidelining of women in science whom she said are doing a lot of tremendous work, and her plea is for Africa to embrace and give space to women scientists amidst the challenge of climate change in a continent that contributes less than 4 percent to global emissions. ""The next generation of scientists must be women - and black people have to be a part of that."" The High Cost of Inaction Agreing that research and development are important steps in tackling climate change, Professor Holdren, who is former Assistant to President Obama for Science & Technology, argues that even if implemented, the wafflers' favoured economic approaches would be grossly inadequate because while clean energy is essential to provide options for the next stage of deep emissions reductions, the global community needs to be reducing now with the available technologies. He says climate change is already causing serious harm around the world with increases in floods, drought, wildfires, heat waves, coral bleaching, among others, all of which are ""plausibly linked to climate change by theory, models, and observed 'fingerprints'; most growing faster than projected"". The global community has three options: mitigation, adaptation - or suffering. Therefore, minimizing the amount of suffering in the mix can only be achieved by doing a lot of mitigation and a lot of adaptation. In arguing for adaptation specifically, Professor Holdren believes that many adaptation measures would make economic sense even if the climate were not changing because there have always been heat waves, floods, droughts, wildfires, powerful storms, crop pests, and outbreaks of vector-born disease, and society has always suffered from being underprepared. Additionally, he says, virtually all reputable studies suggest that the economic damages from not adequately addressing climate change would far exceed the costs of adequately addressing it. ""The idea that society cannot afford to address climate change is wildly wrong,"" he said, calling for urgent climate action now and not later COP22 produced the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action which called for all to go further and faster in delivering climate action before 2020. The global community now eagerly awaits COP23 Bonn declaration. \"
"COP23","South.Africa","COP23_South.Africa24","Village Savings - Helping Small Farmers Weather Climate Shocks [analysis]","February 14, 2018","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","In the past, Lameck Sibukale only knew savings in the form of rearing chickens, goats and more importantly, cattle--a long cherished cultural heritage of the Tonga-speaking people of southern Zambia. But thanks to a village savings scheme, the 78-year-old from Nachibanga village in Pemba district is now part of this growing financial inclusion crusade, bringing some fresh air to the functionality of the village economy. ""How I wish I was introduced to this concept earlier,"" Sibukale told IPS. ""This is a fantastic idea for us villagers who are far from formal banks, especially at a time like now when we need to save in case of crop failure, which has become common as a result of poor rainfall."" Saving just over 200 dollars, Sibukale earned over 500 dollars from a portfolio of 2,100 dollars, which the 25-member group saved in eight months. Using the farmers' club concept, up to 25 members come together and form a solidarity group. The group meets on either a weekly, bi-weekly or monthly basis to save (buying shares at a stipulated price) based on their financial capabilities. The money is banked in a box whose keys are kept by two or three people for purposes of transparency. For financial sustainability, members are encouraged to borrow and pay back at an agreed minimal interest rate. While there are several organisations championing savings for the majority unbanked rural population, Sibukale and his group are part of the World Food Programme (WFP)'s R4 rural resilience initiative. Integrated solutions for emerging climate complications One African proverb states: ""If the rhythm is changing, so must the dance steps,"" implying the need to develop new strategies to deal with emerging complex challenges such as climate change, which is compromising food, nutrition and income security--three key elements at the core of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1 and 2, aimed at ending poverty and hunger. Therefore, as climate change is already complicating global food systems, development actors are also looking to integrated approaches to sustain productivity and production especially for the over 500 million smallholder farmers who produce much of the world's food. For WFP, ending hunger will not be possible without increasing smallholder farmers' productivity. Thus, according to Jennifer Bitonde, WFP Zambia Director, ""R4 is one of the pro-smallholder farmer approaches adopted where food assistance is defined not as old-style food aid handouts, but rather as a comprehensive range of instruments, activities, and platforms that together empower vulnerable and food insecure people and communities to access nutritious food."" In support of national efforts to boost productivity and strengthen farmers' food and income security amidst climate shocks, R4 deploys a set of four risk management strategies integrated through the project, which combines risk reduction (improved resource management), risk transfer (insurance), prudent risk taking (microcredit), and risk reserves (savings). According to Allan Mulando, head of Disaster Risk Management and Vulnerability Assessment at WFP Zambia, the idea is to support farmers with several layers of protection across the value chain starting from production up to market access. ""In addition to conservation agriculture, insurance and microcredit, savings groups are specifically put in place to pool together financial resources which act as a buffer against short term needs, especially in times of shocks such as droughts and floods which usually lead to crop failure, ultimately affecting the normal livelihood pattern of the people,"" explains Mulando. And this is exactly what happened to farmer Sibukale. Last season, he lost one of his oxen, which negatively affected his tillage activities through reduced animal draft power. ""I am happy that I joined this group where I've earned enough to replace it,"" he said, proudly pointing at his newly acquired ox. Supporting improved productivity Whereas conservation agriculture and weather insurance are two layers of protection to support improved productivity, Sibukale believes savings are an added incentive. He told IPS how he managed to pay for his children's school fees, bought farming implements and inputs (fertilizer, seed and a ripper), helping him to increase the area under conservation agriculture, an exercise he says ""would not have been possible without the money I earned from the savings group."" And Milimo Haluma, a member of Silekwa savings group of Sikwale village, testifies to improved productivity. Haluma says before now, he found it difficult to buy inputs for himself. ""But now, with savings, I am able to purchase inputs on time,"" Haluma said. ""Due to timely input purchase, my productivity has improved. Last season, I was able to produce 3.75 tons of maize on the same size of land where I've been producing an average of 1.5 tons in the past seasons."" Haluma, whose savings group is looking for external financial support to grow their portfolio, adds that with the incentive of weather insurance, farmers are finding it easy to save the little they earn. ""Insurance is providing us a peace of mind to buy shares in our savings groups for we know that we are covered in case of crop failure resulting from poor rainfall,"" he says. Global support for up scaling financial services COP 23 , a global partnership to provide more financial protection against climate risks--'InsuResilience' moved into higher ambition phase. The Initiative, which was launched in 2015 by the G7 group of nations under the German Presidency, aims at providing insurance to 400 more million poor and vulnerable people by 2020, and increase the resilience of developing countries against the impacts of climate change and natural disasters. It brings together G20 and V20 nations--the most vulnerable nations including Island states. ""The Global Partnership is a practical response to the needs of those who suffer loss because of climate change,"" said the COP23 President and Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama. Meanwhile, Thomas Silberhorn, German's Parliamentary State Secretary to the Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development, announced support for the new global partnership of 125 million dollars as part of the launch. This follows the \£330 million commitment made by the UK Government in July 2017, via its Centre for Global Disaster Protection. The initiative supports data and risk analysis, technical assistance and capacity building according to countries' needs and priorities in terms of concrete risk finance and insurance solutions. Commenting on the initiative, Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the UN Climate Change, said: ""This new and higher ambition initiative represents one, shinning, example of what can be delivered when progressive governments, civil society and the private sector join hands with creativity and determination to provide solutions."" The most recent example of support was in September 2017, when more than 55 million dollars was paid out to ten Caribbean countries within just 14 days after hurricanes Irma and Maria had wreaked disaster on the islands. In Zambia, InsuResilience supports the NWK Agri-Services cotton company, which offers direct weather and life insurance to small contract farmers. In 2015, some 52,000 farmers decided to buy insurance. Following a major drought in 2016, more than 23,000 farmers received payments. And based on lessons from the R4 model which WFP has been piloting in Zambia since 2014, the Zambian government has this farming season incorporated weather insurance in its Farmer Input Support Programme (FISP) E-voucher programme, which has also allocated 20 percent for legume inputs aimed at encouraging crop diversification, an inbuilt resilience measure promoting improved soil fertility and income for farmers. ""We are also saying let us support the farmers on the e-voucher to grow more than maize,"" said Dora Siliya, Minister of Agriculture. ""So we as government give 170 dollars, while the farmer makes a contribution of 40 dollars. And for the first time this year, from this money, 10 dollars is going to be Weather Index Insurance."" \"

The word urgency for us is a word full of action, doing and 'talanoa' brings people together to talk. As the representative of the UN Secretary- General for the world's poorest and most vulnerable 91 countries, which make up more than one billion people on our shared planet, I am in Bonn for the 23rd conference of the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Whilst here I am advocating for the world's poorest and most challenged countries and above all expecting to get down to the nuts and bolts of taking urgent action. And urgent it is as commitments are already faltering and yet the times have never been more critical for the world's most vulnerable nations. These 91 diverse countries span our globe, each country faces unique challenges yet all are countries that have one feature in common - they contribute the least to climate change but feel its effects the most. They range from beautiful small islands in remote areas, with fragile ecosystems and rich cultural heritage, to landlocked states in the world's mountain ranges and countries which span the length of Africa's deserts, cities and forests. Who has not marvelled at the picture perfect images of the South Seas, the beautiful mountains of the Himalayas, the imposing gold coloured sandy seas of the world's deserts? It is these countries and their peoples most in need of action , immediate, urgent action. Can we really just continue to marvel on the one hand at the beauty of their nature and then forget how our shared planet's poorest and most vulnerable increasingly suffer the life-threatening effects of climate change? Are we prepared to leave them behind? We live in times where the short-term, the 'obvious' almost appear to be the diktat of action. We live in times where the extremes draw attention. I must though caution you that many of the climate change effects on human lives and our very existence are not always as obvious as they may seem. Yes, extreme weather events make our news headlines. But what about the affects of slow onset events such as sea level rise concerning all of the island nations, the glacial retreats, advancing desertification and biodiversity loss ? These are slow events but affecting the lives and livelihoods of communities. The island nation of Fiji is the COP23 president in Bonn. This is the very first time an island nation has presided over the UN's annual climate conference. Fiji's presidency is not merely symbolic but represents a critical juncture in which some of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, the small island developing States, will be centre stage. Island countries have been at the forefront of the strong push for greater ambition in global climate action. At the Paris climate conference in 2015, islanders were among those that led the charge for greater ambition through the aptly named 'High Ambition Coalition.' There is a very simple, existential reason for this. Island countries are well aware that the difference between a 1.5 degrees and 2 degrees goal of warming potentially means the loss of their islands and displacement of their people. It simply means a continued rise in sea levels and more destructive storms. Sea level rises coupled with the warming of oceans means more than just submerging islands, this deeply impacts overall extreme weather event occurrence. Fiji knows first hand what climate change means. Fiji suffered from the destruction of Cyclone Winston in 2016, the most severe cyclone to ever make landfall in the Pacific and which left more than USD1 billion in damages. And yet, progress in achieving the individual pledges which were made towards achieving the Paris Agreement are not on track to halt, let alone reverse climate change. It is highly alarming that the nationally determined contributions by countries currently amount to only a third of the emissions cuts needed by 2030. Our window for reversing greenhouse gas emissions to avoid exceeding the 2 degrees Celsius upper limit which leaders agreed to in Paris is closing rapidly. Studies indicate that we have until 2020, a mere three years, to implement mitigation action to limit greenhouse gas emissions. If we continue as we do right now, we may miss this opportunity to radically reduce global emissions in the next couple of years. This has a very serious bearing on how we go about achieving the UN's wider 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Yet, there also are signs for hope. After all, Paris managed to bring together 197 parties to adopt the Paris Agreement. Importantly, it is the most vulnerable countries themselves working urgently to make a stand. Bhutan, for example, implements an initiative linking climate data with public health for greater resilience to climate change and more advanced warning systems for climate sensitive diseases. Mali, where climate change has led to more and ever more severe droughts, works with women's cooperatives in agricultural communities to clear plots for food gardens, helping to access clean water and solar power in an effort to ease the social and economic consequences of climate change, which can often also lead to conflict. The time is now to 'walk the talk' and be consistent with our noble ambitions commitments is now. We must scale up support to the world's most vulnerable countries. The world's poorest will judge us by action. For the world's most vulnerable countries, urgency is not a buzzword but an active state of mind and reality. Real lives and whole countries are at stake. The situation cannot get more urgent than this. Let us together walk the talk. \"
"COP23","South.Africa","COP23_South.Africa26","Agriculture and food systems will play a fundamental role in mitigating climate change","November 15, 2017 Wednesday","Bizcommunity.com (Africa: Marketing and Media)","Unless sustainable, climate-smart ways of producing, transporting, processing and consuming food are adopted globally, emissions from agriculture sectors are set to increase, further contributing to climate change... <blockquote>Climate change mitigation and adaptation must be integrated into the entire food system...</blockquote> ""Climate change puts millions of people in a vicious cycle of food insecurity, malnutrition and poverty. Yet, we must confront the harsh reality: we are not doing enough to deal with this immense threat,"" Graziano da Silva said. He stressed that least developed countries and small island developing states are ""particularly vulnerable"" to climate change. Noting that we should ""not be discouraged by the challenges ahead,"" the FAO director-general stressed that achieving Zero Hunger by 2030 is still possible. ""Agriculture is where the fight against hunger and climate change come together to unlock solutions."" ""It is not enough to only transform the way we produce food. Climate change mitigation and adaptation must be integrated into the entire food system: from production to transportation, from processing to food consumption, and in both rural and urban areas,"" Graziano da Silva said. Climate change, hunger and poverty can and must be tackled together FAO recently announced that the number of undernourished people has increased for the first time again in a decade with 815 million people going hungry every day. This spike is due mainly to conflict and economic downturns, but also the impact of climate change, particularly prolonged droughts in Africa. And estimates by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change show that climate change might increase the risk of hunger and malnutrition by up to 20% by 2050. Graziano da Silva pointed to the fundamental role of food systems and agriculture which are heavily affected by climate change, but at the same time are also major drivers of climate change. Adopting climate-smart agricultural practices At least one-fifth of total greenhouse gas emission can be attributed to the agriculture sectors, Graziano da Silva noted. Much more needs to be done to reduce these emissions and to simultaneously improve yields and build resilience, the FAO Director-General said. This means adopting approaches such as agroecology and sustainable, climate-smart intensification, among others. <!--EMBED: HYPERLINK http://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/1/358/170002.html :EMBED--> ""We cannot expect that smallholders, family farmers and pastoralists... can tackle these challenges on their own,"" and they will need national and international support, he added. ""Reducing deforestation; restoring degraded lands and forests; eliminating food loss and waste; enhancing soil carbon sequestration; low-carbon livestock - these are only a few known solutions to address hunger, poverty and sustainability at the same time,"" Graziano da Silva explained. He noted, in particular, that while livestock emits more greenhouse gas than other food sources, ""low-carbon livestock is possible,"" - for example, FAO estimates that readily available improved husbandry practices can reduce emissions by 20 to 30%. FAO's work includes supporting countries in sustainably improving their agricultural sectors; in adapting and building resilience, and in mitigating global warming through agriculture. It also assists countries in monitoring their Nationally Determined Contributions in terms of climate change and that technical and financial support is needed to turn these commitments into reality. At COP23 , FAO launched a new report Tracking Adaptation in Agricultural Sectors that provides a framework and methodology to support climate change adaptation measures in the agricultural sectors. {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell \"

We are resolute in ensuring its implementation. As Oliver Tambo said 'to go back means defeat'. We are therefore forging ahead with implementation,"" said the Minister.Addressing a high level segment of the 23rd United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of Parties ( COP23 ) in Bonn, Germany, Minister Molewa said the recent unprecedented hurricanes in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, floods and droughts in Sierra Leone and Ethiopia and fires in California, remind the world of the dangers posed by climate change. She further added that the dangers of climate change are in the process of increasing exponentially, and that countries cannot delay action any longer to some point in the future.""Furthermore, slow onset climate change will have severe impacts on Southern Africa, with shifting rainfall patterns, more frequent droughts and flooding causing devastating health, water, food and energy security impacts,"" said the Minister. The Minister said the impacts of climate change will adversely affect the poorest South Africans the most.""Therefore, we are investing heavily in taking adaptation action. Now is the time to act for the greater global good and future of generations. All countries have to transition to an inclusive and just low-carbon and climate resilient development pathway. The faster we transition, the less damage will result at lower cost, and with maximum benefits,"" she said.She said the global transition to a low carbon and climate resilient future, is bright and full of opportunity to finally achieve equitable, inclusive and just development. The Minister stressed that South Africa's pre-2020 actions and its post-2020 Nationally Determined Contribution are designed to make a fair contribution to the global effort to tackle climate change.For example, the accelerated roll out of renewable and clean energy plans, in partnership with the private sector is among the many climate actions South Africa is implementing. This rollout is designed to coincide with the progressive reduction of coal based high-carbon emission infrastructure.""To empower South Africa to further ramp up our levels of ambition in the context of a just and equitable transition, international cooperation enabling access to climate finance and technologies will be essential. ""Minister Molewa also told those attending the session that there seems to be little appetite to accelerate pre-2020 action, as exemplified by the fact that the Doha Amendment has not yet come into force and means of implementation support to developing countries is declining.""The ramping up of ambition in the pre-2020 period by all actors is a crucial signal to our people that we are serious about fulfilling our commitments,"" said the Minister who urged all developed countries to urgently implement their pre-2020 pledges and increase their ambition including the provision of additional, new and predicable support to developing countries. ""We want to stress that the success of next year's Talanoa Facilitative Dialogue is essential towards raising ambition in the post-2020 period. It is also essential for developed countries to honour their pre-2020 commitments,"" she said.

"COP23","South.Africa","COP23_South.Africa28","Joint statement on Climate Change","November 14, 2017 Tuesday","South African Official News","Joint statement issued at the conclusion of the 25th Basic Ministerial Meeting on Climate Change at the Headquarters of the UNFCCC, Bonn, Germany1. The 25th BASIC Ministerial Meeting on Climate Change was held in Bonn, Germany, the Headquarters of the UNFCCC, on 13 November 2017. The meeting was attended by H.E. Mr. Jose Sarney Filho, Minister of Environment of Brazil, H. E. Mr. Xie Zhenhua, Special Representative for Climate Change of China, H.E. Ms. Barbara Thomson, Deputy Minister of Environmental Affairs of South Africa, and H. E. Mr. C.K. Mishra, Secretary and Vice-Minister, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change of India.2. BASIC Ministers welcomed the large number of ratifications of the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) achieved to date (169) and requested remaining parties to the UNFCCC to ratify the Agreement at an early date. Ministers reaffirmed that the Paris Agreement is a hard-won achievement by the international community which enhances the implementation of the Convention in the post-2020 period and strengthens the global response to climate change in the context of poverty eradication and sustainable development, reflecting equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances.3. Ministers reiterated that the global effort against climate change is an irreversible process that cannot be postponed. It offers valuable opportunities to promote sustainable development. In this regard, Ministers underlined BASIC's highest political commitment to the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention, its Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement in all their aspects. Ministers urged all signatories to stay the course and maintain their support to the Paris Agreement for the good of all humankind and our future generations. Ministers highlighted BASIC's willingness to work together with all Parties and stakeholders to promote global low greenhouse gas emissions, climate-resilient and sustainable development.4. Ministers pledged BASIC's full support to the Fijian Presidency of COP 23 . They underlined the importance of COP 23 to prepare the ground towards the completion of the work related to the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Ministers reiterated that the work on both the pre-2020 and post-2020 should be in full accordance with the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. They also emphasised the importance of openness, transparency, inclusiveness and the Party-driven nature of the negotiations. 5. The Ministers recalled BASIC's request captured in the COP 22 report for pre-2020 issues to be given equal treatment at COP-23 . Ministers further underlined that COP 23 should accelerate the implementation of pre-2020 commitments and actions, including addressing this issue under a dedicated COP Agenda Item. 6. Ministers expressed BASIC's willingness to continue working constructively with other Parties to adopt balanced and meaningful outcomes, in 2018, related to the implementation of the Paris Agreement in the post-2020 period. With the aim of accomplishing this task, they underscored the need for advancing textual negotiation in order to produce a comprehensive, party-driven negotiating text covering all the matters related to the implementation of the Paris Agreement at COP 23 that can serve as the basis for negotiations in 2018, reflecting all Parties' views and inputs in a balanced manner. It is important to ensure that the COP-23 outcome captures the range of views as a set of alternatives and that the draft guidance operationalizes equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC), while not reinterpreting the Paris Agreement. 7. Ministers affirmed that the outcomes in 2018 of the work related to the implementation of the Paris Agreement should be comprehensive and balanced, reflect differentiation, the nationally determined nature of Parties' contributions, and flexibility for developing countries.8. Ministers reiterated that, as nationally determined contributions to the global response to climate change, Parties' efforts should cover mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation, taking into account differentiated responsibilities and obligations of developed and developing country Parties under the Convention and Paris Agreement. The guidance being developed under the Paris Work Program should assist Parties with the preparation and communication of their NDCs, while respecting the nationally determined nature of Parties' contributions.9. Ministers emphasised that adaptation is an issue that requires an urgent global response, and reiterated the importance of both the global adaptation goal and of the adaptation communication as a component of Parties' NDCs in achieving the purpose of the Paris Agreement. Ministers emphasised the importance making progress to define the information and methodologies and approaches to generate such information. They urged developed countries to provide adequate support to developing countries in meeting the cost of their adaptation actions. 10. Ministers noted the extent to which developed countries will provide sustained, predictable and adequate finance, technology development and transfer and capacity-building support to developing countries will determine the extent to which developing countries are able to contribute their highest possible ambition towards addressing the global challenge of climate change.11. Ministers expressed their deepest concern over attempts by some developed countries to unilaterally apply new eligibility criteria for developing countries' access to funding under the Global Environmental Facility and the Green Climate Fund. They recalled that such criteria are not compatible with guidance from the Conference of the Parties and are a departure from the letter and the spirit of the Convention and its Paris Agreement. Furthermore, they indicated that such attempts violate the terms of the Instrument for the Establishment of the Restructured Global Environmental Facility, as well as the Governing Instrument of the Green Climate Fund, falling outside the mandate of the GEF Council and of the GCF Board on eligibility criteria. They stressed the view that such attempts are tantamount to renegotiating the Paris Agreement and potentially undermine the level of ambition of developing countries in the global effort against climate change.12. Ministers emphasised the need for further clarity and robust methodologies to track and account for the provision of finance by developed countries. They further highlighted the importance of discussing modalities for communicating indicative information on the support to be provided to developing countries. Ministers emphasized that effective implementation of developed countries' legal obligations regarding support will be paramount for trust building among parties in order to create a international enabling environment for a successful implementation of the Paris Agreement. 13. Ministers further urged developed countries to honor their commitments and increase climate finance towards at least USD 100 billion per annum goal by 2020, to be scaledup significantly thereafter. In the post-2020 period, Ministers called upon developed countries to provide financial resources to assist developing countries with respect to both mitigation and adaptation in continuation of their existing obligations under the Convention. Furthermore, Ministers called for collaboration among the various mechanisms on adaptation, finance, technology and capacity-building, as well as the WIM on loss and damage.14. Ministers underscored the importance of operationalising the long-term vision on technology development and transfer, as set out in the Paris Agreement. They called for accelerating the work on elaborating the new Technology Framework, including its guidance to the Technology Mechanism. They also emphasised the role of joint innovation and international cooperation on climate related technology in enhancing global actions. 15. Ministers welcomed the adoption of the terms of reference for the Paris Committee on Capacity-Building at COP 22. Ministers called for collaboration between the mechanism on capacity-building and those institutional arrangements on adaptation, finance and technology. They also highlighted the importance of guidance to be provided by the Paris Committee on Capacity-Building to the Capacity-Building Initiative for Transparency, and urged developed country Parties to provide additional, continuous and adequate support to developing countries for enhancing their capabilities on transparency of action and support received. 16. Ministers noted with concern that pre-2020 gaps exist not only in mitigation, but also in adaptation and support to developing countries. They stressed the urgency of accelerated implementation of pre-2020 commitments and increasing pre-2020 ambition. In this regard, on the historical occasion of the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol, Ministers underscored the importance that the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol enters into force without further delay. To date, 83 Parties have accepted the Doha Amendment, while acceptance by 144 Parties is required to bring it into force. They stressed further that developed country Parties should revisit and increase their economy-wide quantified emission reduction targets. Ministers emphasized that enhanced and urgent implementation of pre-2020 commitments is a prerequisite for mutual trust among Parties and for building a solid foundation for post-2020 implementation and ambition, in order to ensure that subsequent NDCs do not become unduly burdensome on developing countries. 17. Ministers look forward to to an outcome in COP-23 that gives clarity in the design of the Facilitative Dialogue (FD) in 2018. This will be an opportunity to consider collectively the overall progress made on the implementation of all pillars of the Convention in the global effort to address climate change. They emphasised the importance of outcomes that lead to the identification of challenges and opportunities to accelerate climate action and support, in the context of sustainable development, sustainable lifestyles, climate justice and poverty eradication as the overriding priorities of developing countries. Developed countries must take the lead towards closing the ambition gap so as to avoid transferring the burden to developing countries and from the pre-2020 to the post-2020 period.18. In this context, Ministers highlighted the efforts and substantial achievements of BASIC countries and other developing countries in tackling climate change, both pre- and post2020, and emphasised that these represent far more ambitious efforts compared to their respective responsibilities and capabilities. BASIC countries have made notable progress towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development. They are committed to sharing experiences and supporting each other as they further develop their domestic climate policies and actions. 19. Ministers welcomed the adoption by the Green Climate Fund of a pilot programme for REDD+ results based payments, noting the need for adequate and predictable support for the implementation of all REDD-plus activities. Ministers underlined the imperative that REDD-plus ensures environmental integrity and, in this regard, reiterated that results-based payments shall not be used to offset mitigation commitments by developed countries. 20. Ministers reiterated that the UNFCCC is the primary international forum to coordinate the global response to climate change. In this regard, they reiterated that measures and outcomes under other multilateral fora addressing issues related to climate change, such as the United Nations General Assembly, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, the International Maritime Organisation and the Montreal Protocol, as well as the G20, must be consistent with the UNFCCC and in line with the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. Ministers further underlined that measures under ICAO and IMO must not place undue burdens on developing countries and not create distortions to international trade.21. BASIC Ministers reiterated their unequivocal commitment to support Ecuador, as the Chair of the Group of 77 this year, with a view to strengthening the unity and advancing the common interests of developing countries in the multilateral process. 22. Ministers welcomed the offer of South Africa to host the 26th BASIC Ministerial meeting in the first half of 2018. \"

KaXu is a 100MW plant constructed on a 1,100ha site near Pofadder. It was recognised under the Financing for Climate Friendly Investment category as one of 19 ""Lighthouse Activity of the Year"" projects receiving an award this year. KaXu is one of the first batch of 28 renewable energy projects unveiled by the Department of Energy in 2011. It is also the first CSP plant in SA to use parabolic trough technology. This entails the use of parabolic mirrors to reflect and concentrate the sun's rays to produce heat, which then generates steam that powers turbines and produces electricity. Energy storage allows the plant to produce firm, baseload electricity even when the sun is not shining, offering a remarkable low-carbon solution.The project was officially opened in March 2015 and supplies clean energy to the equivalent of 80,000 homes while offsetting 315,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year. SA has set a goal of generating up to 17,800MW of renewable energy by 2030 to reduce its dependence on oil and natural gas resources. The country's reliance of coal-driven power stations is the main reason why it is the 12th highest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in the world.KaXu is jointly owned by Abengoa Solar (51%), the Industrial Development Corporation (29%), and a community trust (20%). The project, which created 4,500 temporary and 80 permanent jobs, is structured on a fully commercial basis. All the power is sold to Eskom under a power purchase agreement. Its uniqueness lies in its ability to supply baseload power, something that wind farms or solar photovoltaic (PV) plants cannot do and which has a significant economic value to the grid.Each year, the Momentum for Change award recognises innovation and game-changing projects that address climate change and wider economic, social and environmental challenges.Mafalda Duarte, head of the $8bn Climate Investment Funds (CIF), highlighted what the award means for SA: ""The recognition underscores how concerted actions by a government can enable significant mobilisation of private-sector financial flows towards renewable energy technologies, including critically important base-load components of the energy systems."" Funding for KaXu was coordinated by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, which provided direct financing of R1.25bn ($143m) for two CSP projects in SA - including KaXu Solar One - and the 50MW Khi Solar One project, the first solar tower plant on the continent. The IFC also arranged $264m of parallel loans for the construction of these two projects. The lenders coordinated by IFC for the KaXu project were the CIF's Clean Technology Fund, the Development Bank of Southern Africa, FirstRand Bank, Investor Direct Capital and Nedbank. ""This financial innovation was instrumental in unlocking the concentrated solar power market in SA, attracting financiers, and driving down the costs, and leading to the first operational private sector project of its kind in SA and the developing world,"" said Duarte. Other areas of focus for the convention's Lighthouse Activities are Women for Results, Momentum for Change ICT Solutions, Planetary Health, and Climate Neutral Now. The work being done by the award recipients reflects how COP23 's Global Climate Action has been accelerating in the two years since the Paris Agreement was universally adopted in support of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.

"COP23","South.Africa","COP23_South.Africa30","Developing world says rich nations shirking on climate pledges","November 13, 2017 Monday","Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Other industries)","The failure of wealthy nations to deliver on short-term climate commitments could hinder the rollout of a landmark treaty... ""If we do not respect decisions that we have made, then how can we build trust among the parties?"" said Chen Zhihua, China's senior negotiator, referring to long-standing pledges by rich nations to enhance financial support and ""revisit"" targets for curbing greenhouse gas emissions before 2020. ""And how can we lay a good foundation for the implementation of the Paris Agreement?"" he added at a press conference Thursday, 9 November, flanked by diplomats from India, Iran, Nicaragua and Ecuador. The treaty, inked outside the French capital in 2015, calls on the world to cap global warming at ""well below"" 2\'b0C, and even 1.5\'b0C if possible. With one degree of warming so far, the planet has already seen an increase in drought, deadly heatwaves and superstorms engorged by rising seas. The pact rests on voluntary carbon-cutting pledges from virtually every country in the world. But those pledges are not enough to keep Earth in the safe zone, and would still see global temperatures rise a devastating 3\'b0C by century's end. Moreover, they don't kick in until 2020, and developing nations say that's too long to wait to ramp up action. ""The science is clear: if we don't get our act together before 2020, you can forget about the 2\'b0C and 1.5\'b0C targets,"" said Paul Oquist, Nicaragua's chief negotiator at the talks. ""There has been a failure to comply with existing commitments,"" he added. Under the terms of the UN's core climate convention, the burden for action before 2020 falls mainly on wealthy countries historically responsible for the rapid rise of greenhouse gases. China is the world's top carbon polluter, followed by the United States, the European Union, India and Russia. Developing countries sought to have a ""pre-2020 agenda"" formally added to the negotiating process, but the move was shelved at the start of the 12-day talks. Efforts to resolve the issue have so far been fruitless. ""It would be a bad thing if this hangs over into the second week and becomes a political issue for ministers,"" said Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington DC. ""It has been a pretty sterile debate that has degenerated into a finger-pointing exercise,"" he told AFP. Some 20 heads of state, including French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, are scheduled to appear at the UN climate forum next week. The European Union, Australia and the United States - which continues to participate in the talks despite President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris pact - have balked at training a spotlight on the issue, but are looking for a middle ground. ""There is no disagreement about the pre-2020 urgency,"" Elina Bardram, head of the EU's delegation for COP23 , told AFP. ""But we must find solutions that ... do not compromise progress on the agreed negotiations programme"" for the Paris Agreement. For Teresa Ribera, director of the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations in Paris, the stand-off also reflects the negotiating process. ""It is in part tactical positioning to deflect mounting pressure"" on some emerging economies - China and India, in particular - to deepen their own carbon-cutting pledges, she said. Both countries are projected to easily meet their Paris targets. But the poor nation-rich nation split that bedevilled these talks for many years has not entirely disappeared. ""This is creating a trust deficit,"" said Mohamed Adow, international climate lead for Christian Aid. ""How can developing countries trust these very same countries that haven't taken seriously their previous commitments?"" Source: AFP \"
"COP23","South.Africa","COP23_South.Africa31","UN climate talks resume with wary eyes on Trump","November 7, 2017 Tuesday","Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Other industries)","Nations that adopted the Paris Agreement with champagne two years ago regroup this week amid grim omens of climate peril and with an anxious eye on Donald Trump's America... The November 6-17 meeting in Bonn, Germany, is the first for UN climate envoys since the US president announced he will extricate Washington from the deal, carefully crafted over many years and helped over the finish line by Trump's predecessor Barack Obama. In a year marked by severe flooding in Asia, drought in Africa and an exceptional North American hurricane season, Washington's position ""remains unchanged"", a state department official said. ""The United States intends to withdraw from the Paris Agreement as soon as it is eligible to do so"". This can officially happen no sooner than November 4, 2020. In the meantime, the world's biggest historical greenhouse gas polluter will send a delegation ""to represent US interests"" at the 23rd round of annual UN talks, with Fiji as president, in the former German capital. According to Fiji's top negotiator Nazhat Shameem Khan, veteran US envoys have expressed the intention to continue to ""take part constructively"". ""We should not entertain the US as a destructive force in Bonn,"" warned Mohamed Adow of Christian Aid, which lobbies for poor country interests at the two-decades old UN process. ""Since they have already announced their decision to withdraw, they shouldn't be actively influencing an agreement they don't intend to be party to,"" he told AFP. A total of 195 nations agreed in the French capital in 2015 to limit average global warming caused by greenhouse gases from fossil-fuel burning to under 2\'b0C over pre-industrial levels, and to 1.5\'b0C if possible. The 1\'b0C mark has already been passed. Countries, including the United States, made non-binding pledges of emissions cuts in support of the goal, though scientists say the shortfall is still far too great. The talks open days after the UN's environment organ, UNEP, warned that current pledges sentence the world to a 3\'b0C-warmer future, fuelling heatwaves, superstorms, drought, and sea level rise. Warned UNEP head Eric Solheim, ""we are not doing nearly enough to save hundreds of millions of people from a miserable future."" Costa Rica's environment minister Edgar Gutierrez-Espeleta, president of the UN Environment Assembly, said the Paris Agreement may have boosted climate action, but ""momentum is clearly faltering"". ""We face a stark choice: up our ambition or suffer the consequences,"" he said this week. Some 20,000 people are due to attend the 23rd UN ""Conference of Parties"" or COP23 , with UN chief Antonio Guterres, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, California governor Jerry Brown, former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, and actor-turned governor Arnold Schwarzenegger expected among them. This year's conference is the first with a small island developing state as president. The gathering is expected to be quite technical in nature. It is meant to design common rules for countries to weigh the adequacy of their individual and common greenhouse gas pledges, and to ramp these up to get closer to the 2\'b0C target. ""Given the American decision,"" the conference will also ""be an important political moment for countries to reaffirm their commitment to the Paris Agreement,"" said former French negotiator Laurence Toubiana who now heads the Europe Climate Foundation, an NGO. ""It will be important to listen to the statements of governments... to see that countries are still committed, that there is no rowing back,"" she told AFP.

COP 23 - the 23rd United Nations ""conference of parties"" to the Paris Accord on global warming - took place in Bonn, one-time capital of Germany, with close on 20 000 delegates from governments along with NGOs and journalists.US chief representative at the meeting, David Banks, who serves as an advisor on energy to the White House said there was no going back on his country pulling out of the deal on climate change.""President Trump still intends to withdraw from the Paris agreement, but in good faith we will continue to work with parties to the accord,"" he said. ""There are 1 600 new coal plants being built around the world, and demand for coal and gas is growing. It's in the global interest that, if these fuels are going to be used anyway, it must be done as cleanly as possible.""America, he said, wanted to remain a ""global player"" on energy, citing plans for a ""clean coal alliance"" that would share the best technology to lower emissions.The US delegation named Australia, India and Japan as possible ""partner countries"" along with Tanzania, Nigeria, South Africa, Bangladesh and the Philippines.""Keeping gas and coal in the ground robs poor countries of their natural wealth,"" Mr Banks said. ""And universal access to affordable energy is the way to lift people out of poverty,"" he said.He said migration and young people drifting into militia groups were largely a product of joblessness in Africa, ""and having no electricity and therefore no industry is far more of a problem in people's lives right now than climate change.""He said more than 1.2 billion people around the world lived without power, half of them in Africa and an estimated 300 million across India.""The United States would like to see the World Bank policy on coal changed,"" he said. The bank will not lend for projects that generate electricity from coal, a ban criticised by Nigeria, India and South Africa.A spokesperson for Eskom at COP 23 said South Africa would ""be using fossil fuels for a very long time to come.""A rival US group that called itself ""We're Sill In"" held a reception for delegates, opposing Mr Trump's stand on global warming and on leaving the Paris Accord.And most of the other exhibits, set across halls, tents and walkways along the banks of the Rhine River that flows through Bonn, dealt with wind and solar power.Anti-coal protestors disrupted the only public event staged by the US, singing songs and drowning out speakers.Discussions between countries took place in closed session, and while negotiators -- including the USA and South Africa -- were happy to provide background to journalists, they had collectively agreed not to speak on the record.A member of the Indian team said the meeting reminded him of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries or OPEC.""The oil sellers come together every now and then and agree how much they will produce to keep (the oil price) stable, then they cheat on each other. This might be the same protocol. Nations talk here about greenhouse (gas) and cutting emission and they pledge this and that but I wonder how many will stick to it.""In the South African delegation, deputy energy minister Thembisile Majola - a qualified engineer - said it was ""important to get past the sounds bites when it comes to issues like fracking or fossil fuel. I think you need to get on the ground and speak with communities,"" she said.David Banks said the White House was ""still formulating its global energy policy,"" but that Washington was determined to ""remain engaged with other coal-dependent economies."" \"

""Developing countries should be provided with adequate support for their mitigation, and adaptation actions and progress should be made on a post-2020 finance goal that should be more significant than the 2020 goal of $100 billion (R1.3trillion) per year in climate finance,"" the president said, adding: ""The efforts of developing countries to adapt to climate change with their own resources should also be recognised as a contribution to the global effort to address climate change."" Speaking about the Bonn Climate Change Conference in Germany, Zuma said: ""We should make progress on the Global Stocktake at the upcoming Bonn Climate Change Conference. ""The Global Stocktake, which has the objective of tracking commitments and progress in implementation, must inform parties' future Nationally Determined Contributions.

"COP23","South.Africa","COP23_South.Africa35","Time to act on climate change","June 26, 2017 Monday","Pretoria News (South Africa)","With the\'c2\~Paris Agreement, the world\'c2\~decided to take responsibility for its present and future by committing to preserve the very source of life: our planet and its environment. The climate change deal is an unprecedented multilateral partnership between nearly 200 countries, supported by companies and communities across the world, to address a problem facing all of us. It's a challenge we can only tackle together and, since the beginning, Europe has been at the forefront of this collective engagement. And there is a growing acknowledgement that there is no other way than acting together. Today, more than ever, Europe stands by this landmark agreement and leads the way on its implementation, through effective climate policies and strengthened co-operation to build strong partnerships. Also through continued support to the poorest and most vulnerable: we see more and more people on the move, or exposed to extreme poverty, due to droughts or floods linked to climate change. For Europe, dealing with climate change is a matter of political responsibility and multilateral engagement, and a matter of security, prevention of conflicts and even radicalisation. That is why the EU will not renegotiate the Paris Agreement. We have spent 20 years negotiating. Now it is time for action, the world's priority is implementation. And as we address climate change with an eye on the future, we create countless opportunities for the present, by setting up new and better ways to produce and consume, invest and trade and protect lives, assets and livelihood opportunities, for the benefit of all people as well as the planet. To accelerate the global transition to a low-emission, climate-resilient future, we have started to strengthen our existing partnerships and to seek and find new alliances, from the world's largest economies to the most vulnerable island states. Because from the Arctic to the Sahel, climate change is a reality today, not a remote concept of the future. We expect all countries to uphold the Paris Agreement and put words into action by implementing their national climate plans and strengthening their efforts over time. Plans must be turned into concrete, actionable policies and measures - now. The EU is already working towards completion of the legislative and regulatory framework necessary to deliver our Paris target, to reduce emissions by at least 40% by 2030 compared to 1990. Our legislative actions cover all sectors of the economy and we are putting energy efficiency first and boosting uptake of renewable energy across the bloc. Taking action on climate change goes hand-in-hand with economic growth. Take the EU's case: our emissions have fallen by 22% since 1990, while total EU GDP has grown by 50%. During this period, we have created new jobs, businesses and technologies. We are preparing our economies for the future and investing in making our societies more resilient to climate change, to reduce current and future risks. We have more than two decades of experience in developing and implementing ambitious climate policies and we are ready to share our experiences and lessons learnt. It's not by chance that we have established extensive climate policy co-operation with key partners across the globe. We will also continue to provide substantial funding to support climate action in partner countries. In 2015 alone, EU support totalled close to R260\'e2\€ \£fbillion. In November, countries will gather in Bonn for the next UN climate conference - COP23 - to continue to flesh out the work programme for implementing the Paris Agreement. Next year, the facilitative dialogue to be held as part of the UN climate process will be the first opportunity since Paris to look at our collective efforts to limit global warming and assess what we have done concretely to deliver on the commitments made. These are key steps for turning the political agreement reached in Paris into reality. Yet this is a challenge we can only overcome with the greatest possible involvement of civil society, businesses, local communities, cities and regions in parallel. And we are seeing an unprecedented breadth and scale of action by all of these actors. As institutions, we can plan and support the strategies needed to save our environment, but it is they that have the crucial role of turning policies into action and results on the ground.\'c2\~Our new EU Consensus on Development actively promotes this role. Enhanced co-operation and co-ordination among all stakeholders are key - we would say the key. The world, the planet, can count on the EU.

"COP23","South.Africa","COP23_South.Africa36","Big Polluting Lobbyists May Be Forced to Declare Interests At UN Talks","May 25, 2017","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","Is the presence of the fossil fuel industry necessary in global climate change negotiations, or does their presence in these talks represent a conflict of interest and undermine global progress? The push from developing countries to force fossil fuel lobbyists taking part in UN climate talks to declare conflicts of interest won one significant battle during an agreement made at COP23 's preliminary session earlier this month in Bonn, Germany. A recent report by the US-based non-profit Corporate Accountability International (CAI) revealed that fossil fuel representatives are extensively represented in the associations that participate in UN climate talks. While companies cannot participate in the talks themselves, membership-based business and industry non-government associations (BINGOs) can and they have been using backhanded tactics to stop key climate policies in their tracks, says the report. Policies under the UN framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC) allow organizations with 'observer status', which include the likes of the National Mining Association, FuelsEurope, the World Coal Association, and the Business Council of Australia (of which members include Shell, ExxonMobil, and BP), to sit in meetings where delegates discuss policy options to avert climate disasters. These organizations represent corporations with hefty track records of climate change denial and a portfolio that includes decades of profiting at the expense of the planet. The UNFCCC's Paris Agreement has locked in a crucial commitment to keep global temperature warming to ""well below two \'b0Celsius"", but also to ""pursue efforts"" to limit warming to 1.5 \'b0C by 2018 ""A transparent and clearly defined policy is essential if we are to truly protect the spirit and the goals of the Paris Agreement and if we are to have a fighting chance of limiting climate change to under 2\'b0 Celsius,"" writes Mrinalini Shine, Environmental Law Researcher at the University of Cologne, Germany. Many developing nations - collectively representing nearly 70 percent of the world's population - have been fighting to incorporate a conflict of interest policy in the convention where such groups will be legally obliged to declare any and all conflicts. For instance, in May 2016 at a meeting in Bonn, the Venezuelan delegate stated that UNFCCC's Paris agreement was an 'instrument between states' and made a 'moral request' that lobbyists declare conflicts of interest. During one panel discussion in Bonn this month, Norway's delegate stated that excluding companies based on their interests would be 'counterproductive' while Australia's delegation head said that the private sector was a key part of financing the transition to a low-carbon economy. ""Some of the companies being alluded to as the polluters of policy will be the providers of the biggest and best solutions,"" said Australia's delegate. ""And you could look at some of the statements coming out of ExxonMobil and Shell recently to underline that point."" An investigation conducted in 2015 by Inside Climate News, a non-profit environmental news organization, exposed that ExxonMobil knew of climate change from as early as 1981 but only to spend millions of dollars in the years that followed to promote climate denial. CIA's report, in addition, revealed that the US Chamber of Commerce has been receiving millions of dollars from ExxonMobil for 'public information campaigns'. To top it off, the Trump administration in the US, in its full-scale attack on the US environmental policy that includes dismantling the Clean Power Plan, also recently installed Exxon Mobil's former CEO, Rex Tillerson, as secretary of state. ""With so many arsonists in the fire department, it's no wonder we've failed to put the fire out,"" said Tamar Lawrence-Samuels, CAI's international policy director, in a statement. This, however, does not imply that there is no role at all for the fossil fuels industry to play in slowing global warming, states CAI's report. The report elaborated that the industry must transform its business practices to align with the commitments made by the global community to rein in the crisis, embrace the solutions created by the scientific community to minimize further devastation, and strive to meet global social and economic progress. UNFCCC's newly negotiated agreement commits to enhancing 'openness, transparency and inclusiveness' and calls for stakeholders - any person or group affected by climate change or policy to submitt their views on how that could be achieved. ""As a global community, we have an unprecedented opportunity to solve the climate crisis head-on at the precise moment when everything people, justice, and the planet hangs in the balance,"" said a sppokesperson for CAI in a statement. Activists, pressure groups, and even government bodies from developing countries that are now actively seeking justice for the planet and its people must keep pushing towards the solutions the convention has agreed to seek. The convention is accepting suggestions on how to address the issue from member nations, and aims to take them up next year. \"

But what kind of business are they talking about? Will our corporate sector, especially the mining and financial industries, revert to behind-closed-doors lobbying and self-interested short-termism? Or will it view this second chance as an opportunity to become better corporate citizens? BlackRock CEO Larry Fink wrote in his 2018 letter to CEOs about the increasing expectations across the globe for companies to be more than just creators of financial value: & To prosper over time, every company must not only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society.& Much of our corporate sector is not taking these expectations seriously. SA faces catastrophic environmental threats, with devastating social implications: climate change, water scarcity, lethal air pollution and large-scale destruction of our natural heritage. Unfortunately President Cyril Ramaphosa did not mention climate change once in his state of the nation address. This does not diminish the threat posed by these problems, but if they are not a priority for the government, there is a real danger that the private sector will continue to ignore them. The mining industry continues to laud itself as our best hope for the future, without taking responsibility for the environmental devastation it has always left in its wake. The industry also continues to refuse to recognise mining-affected communities as genuine stakeholders, despite a century's worth of evidence of the social upheaval associated with mining operations. But when it comes to environmental and social issues, the mining industry is not the only corporate player in SA that is hopelessly behind the times. Most of our big banks are still considering funding new privately owned coal-fired power plants, such as the proposed Thabametsi and Khanyisa plants in Limpopo and Mpumalanga. Two climate change impact assessments for the Thabametsi plant - one commissioned by the developer and one by the Department of Environmental Affairs - found that the climate change effects of the project will be severe. Thabametsi will be one of the most greenhouse gas emission-intensive plants on Earth, and will deplete water resources in an already water-scarce region for at least 40 years. But none of the proposed financiers appear to have asked any questions about climate change when the deal came to their desks. They claim they are obliged to rely on the outdated and inaccurate integrated resource plan for electricity 2010. They ignore the global move away from coal and the clear evidence that SA does not need any new coal-fired power stations. Not a single one of SA's financial institutions has made any public commitment to end financing for new coal mining or new coal-fired power. Similarly, asset managers have shown very little progress in responsible investment on environmental and social issues, despite a slew of codes and commitments to integrate environmental, social and governance factors into their investment decisions. Almost every investment portfolio in SA will include shares in fossil fuel companies such as Sasol and Exxaro, but there is no public evidence that portfolio managers are asking hard questions about these companies' contribution to climate change, or taking seriously the dangerously uncertain long-term prospects of fossil fuel companies, and the risk this poses to pension funds. Instead, the business sector is full of admiration. The National Business Initiative praises Sasol and Exxaro for being & climate change leaders& In an apparently unironic move, the Department of Environmental Affairs and the National Business Initiative hosted an exhibition at COP23 in Paris in November 2017, showcasing & the world-class climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts undertaken by South African business& The exhibition's co-sponsors were Exxaro, Sasol and Eskom. Asset managers usually blame asset owners, especially pension fund trustees, for failing to give them a proper mandate on these issues, and the accusation is not unfounded. While pension funds around the world are divesting from coal and insisting on better disclosure of environmental and social impacts, there appear to be no such moves afoot in SA. If the terms of our country's renewal are made as part of an elite pact between business and government, we will once again fail to achieve the just and equal society we claim to want. Business leaders must show the courage that many in civil society, and some in the government, have shown - courage to take the first step, to speak out, to demand better of companies that disregard people and the environment, to say no to fossil fuels, and to look further than the next set of quarterly results. Davies is an attorney at the Centre for Environmental Rights, which has established a new responsible investment NGO called Just Share.

"COP23","South.Africa","COP23_South.Africa38","INDUSTRY NEWS. Council commits to hydrogen future","November 16, 2017 Thursday","Business Day (South Africa)","INDUSTRY NEWS Council commits to hydrogen future As global leaders gathered at COP 23 in Bonn this week, 18 key industry leaders that form the Hydrogen Council coalition launched the first globally quantified vision of the role of hydrogen. In addition to being a key pillar of the energy transition, hydrogen has the potential to develop $2.5-trillion of business, creating more than 30-million jobs by 2050. This is according to a study entitled Hydrogen, Scaling Up, which outlines a comprehensive and quantified roadmap to scale deployment and its enabling impact on the energy transition. Deployed at scale, hydrogen could account for almost one-fifth of total final energy consumed by 2050, says the council. This would reduce annual CO2 emissions by about six gigatons compared with today's levels and contribute about 20% of the abatement required to limit global warming to 2C\'b0. The council sees the potential for hydrogen to power 10- million to 15-million cars and 500,000 trucks by 2030, with many uses in other sectors as well, such as industry processes and feedstocks, building heating and power, power generation and storage. Overall, the study predicts that the annual demand for hydrogen could increase tenfold by 2050 meeting 18% of total final energy demand. At a time when global populations are expected to grow by 2-billion people by 2050, hydrogen technologies have the potential to create opportunities for sustainable growth. & The world in the 21st century must transition to widespread low carbon energy use,& says Takeshi Uchiyamada, chairman of Toyota Motor and co-chair of the council. & Hydrogen is an indispensable resource to achieve this transition because it can be used to store and transport wind, solar and other renewable electricity to power transportation and many other things. The council has identified seven roles for hydrogen, which is why we are encouraging governments and investors to give it a prominent role in their energy plans. The sooner we get the hydrogen economy going, the better, and we are all committed to making this a reality.& But achieving such scale would require investments of about $20bn to $25bn annually until 2030. \"
"COP23","South.Africa","COP23_South.Africa39","World to Cut Emissions With or Without Trump","May 22, 2017","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","In a last-ditch effort, Germany and China are trying to influence the United States not to walk away from the Paris climate change accord it signed along with 194 nations. In December 2015, nearly every country committed to take action to reduce planet-warming emissions. ""The US may try to renegotiate the terms of the agreement. Other countries have to be very clear that they are defending the integrity of the accord and would not accept reduced US commitments."" --Lutz Weischer ""We are trying to influence the US through different channels and people, at the foreign ministry level to the EPA and even the Chancellor [Angela Merkel] has repeatedly called up President [Donald] Trump to remain in this landmark agreement,"" said German Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks at the two-day 8th Petersberg Climate Dialogue being held in Berlin. Terming the Paris Agreement a ""hard-won milestone"", the Chinese special envoy Xie Zhenhua said his country was ""true to word and resolute in deed"". Like his German counterpart, he too reiterated that all signatories should ""stick to it"" and ""not retreat"". China is resolute in its commitment, he said and added the need for transparency to ""build mutual trust and confidence"" was also paramount. At the same time, both countries gave a positive signal of what they were doing to reduce carbon emissions, with Hendricks emphasizing on the need to work on the ""ecological technologies of the future"" in the sectors of transport, infrastructure development and grids. They talked about the advances made in the renewable energy sector, the dire need for phasing out coal and the baby steps made towards electric cars. Hendricks said future climate action would require farsightedness, political courage, intelligent regulations and getting corporations on board. ""We do not have a blueprint as yet"" but countries are ready to ride the wave of enthusiasm although with some reservations but all for ""prosperity in the long term"". She also said it was prudent to mainstream climate action in all economic, fiscal even health policies. ""The ball is in the court of national governments,"" she said adding: ""Actions should speak louder than words."" Dr Ralph Bodle, a senior fellow and coordinator of Ecologic, a Berlin based think tank on environment, was recently in Bonn helping ministers and diplomats from nearly 200 countries to hammer out a ""rule book"" to say who should do what, by when, how and with what financial support, thereby putting the Paris Climate Agreement into practice. He, too, conceded that there was concern over Trump's decision during the 11-day intersessional climate talks. Bodle believed the Paris Accord ""will live or fail with political will"". It is expected the US president will announce a final decision after his return from Taormina, in Sicily, where he will attend the 43rd G7 Summit and where he will be pressured by other countries to give in. In March, Trump had threatened to pull out of the accord and roll back the widely- supported climate policies of former president Barack Obama, whose administration set a target of a 26-28 percent reduction in emissions by 2025, based in 2005 levels. He had declared an end to the ""war on coal"", signed an executive order that removed several restrictions on fossil fuel production and removed barriers to the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. Before leaving office, Obama had transferred one billion dollars to the U.N.'s Green Climate Fund and pledged billions more to the fund through the Paris deal, which has not been taken well by Trump. He has said the US was ""paying disproportionately"" and that they ""got taken to the cleaners financially"". It is unclear whether Trump will honour those financial commitments. In addition, he has gathered around him climate deniers. Take Scott Pruitt, the environment chief, for instance, who has gone on record saying global warming is not caused by emissions from fossil fuels. Not everyone is sure whether it's better to have Trump in or out. ""If Trump poses conditions for the US staying in the Paris Agreement, depending on the conditions, they could cause damage to the accord,"" said Lutz Weischer from Germanwatch. He suspects the ""US may try to renegotiate the terms of the agreement. Other countries have to be very clear that they are defending the integrity of the accord and would not accept reduced US commitments."" There are others who also say that the withdrawal may have implications for the US-China relationship. President Xi Jinping has publicly hinted at his desire for the US to remain in it despite a tweet by Trump saying climate change was a Chinese conspiracy. During the campaign, he claimed on Twitter that the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. According to Weischer, there are three important gaps that China is looking at -- climate diplomacy, emissions and financing.""It knows it cannot fill the void all by itself and without the US on its side."" But if things take a turn for the worse, China will forge alliances with the EU and Canada. As for the financing gap, Weischer said ""even that loss can be assuaged if all other countries stick to their commitments, at least for the next four years."" But even if the US decides to pull out there are other countries who have reaffirmed their commitment which could, in fact be, a ""reaction to the US"", said Weischer, who heads international climate policy at Germanwatch. He said it was more important to keep that momentum with actions being taken on the ground. Even within the US, there are several states and even big corporations who want the US to have the seat at the table. ""And even within the White House there are various camps on the issue,"" he noted. The next Conference of Parties to the climate framework ( COP23 ), to be held this November, will be organized by Fiji, but hosted by Bonn. \"

Speaking to cheering military personnel at Yokota Air Base just west of Tokyo minutes after landing, Trump donned a bomber jacket and said ""no one, no dictator, no regime and no nation should underestimate American resolve"". ""We will never yield, never waver and never falter in defence of our people, our freedom and our great American flag."" Trump's marathon trip comes with the North Korea crisis at fever pitch, as US bombers fly sorties over the Korean peninsula and fears mount of another Pyongyang missile test. According to the Washington Post, Pentagon officials have warned that the only way to locate and secure North Korea's nuclear weapons sites would be via a ground invasion. North Korea itself welcomed Trump to the region with a rhetorical volley via the ruling party newspaper Rodong Sinmun, warning a ""spiritually unstable"" president against making reckless remarks. The president's first stops are Japan and South Korea -- frontline US allies in the effort to force Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear programme, and the two countries with most to fear should a full-scale conflict break out. Trump touched down under clear blue Tokyo skies and stepped out with his wife, Melania, in bright sunshine to greet the crowds. Speaking on the plane, he said he would likely be meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin during the tour, as the international community scrambles for a solution to the North Korean crisis. ""I think it's expected we'll meet with Putin, yeah. We want Putin's help on North Korea, and we'll be meeting a lot of different leaders,"" Trump said. He said North Korea was a ""big problem for our country and for the world, and we want to get it solved"" but had kind words for its people. ""They're great people. They're industrious. They're warm, much warmer than the world knows,"" he said. The next stop was a golfing date with his ""friend"" Shinzo Abe, prime minister of Japan. - AFP CLIMATE ALERT: A protester wearing a mask of US President Donald Trump stands with other protesters dressed as polar bears during a demonstration under the banner 'Protect the climate - stop coal' two days before the start of the COP 23 UN Climate Change Conference hosted by Fiji but held in Bonn, Germany, at the weekend Picture: REUTERS/WOLFGANG RATTAY \"

Douglas Stern, chairman of Agri EC, said: ""The solidarity shown by the KwaZulu-Natal farming community has been unbelievable. ""They have already spent huge amounts of money, time and effort to accumulate supplies like fodder for us. The problem now is the cost of transporting the fodder. Mvusiwekhaya Sicwetsha, the spokesman for the department of rural development and agrarian reform, said: ""We cannot comment on the matter of the KwaZulu-Natal farmers as we know nothing about it. ""However the department is helping the rural community and farmers. We have been giving them water, feed and rain tanks to help with softening the burden of looking after their livestock."" Stern said: ""Farmers have exhausted their funds just keeping their animals alive. This means we also have to rely on assistance for transportation costs. ""Gift of the Givers has been instrumental in helping with transport and the KZN farmers who can, have also helped with transport and fuel costs,"" said Stern. ""Around 60 to 70 truckloads of maize, bale fodder, molasses and all sorts of other foods have already been sent to the Eastern Cape. ""One truckload is made up of 50 to 55 bales and there are still about 5000 bails waiting to be transported,"" he said. ""It is meant to be the government's responsibility to help us but they don't have the capacity or political will to do so,"" said Stern. Stern yesterday said he was visiting farmers in the western region of the province to let them know that they were receiving help from their counterparts in KZN and should therefore not give up in the face of worsening drought conditions. ""What is scary is that there is no sign of immediate relief from this crippling drought in the near future. We can't afford to lose any more farmers,"" he said. The harsh reality of climate change and the terrible droughts of recent years were topics addressed by Dr Edna Molewa, Minister of Environmental Affairs yesterday when she released a statement ahead of the international COP 23 climate change talks in Germany in November. She said: ""[South Africa would] express its concern about the increasing devastating events associated with the adverse effects of climate change on the African continent.""

"COP23","South.Africa","COP23_South.Africa42","Climate Change Summit a Step Further, Yes... but Where To? [opinion]","November 06, 2017","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","The UN Climate Change Summit in Bonn is a step further, most experts say. Fine, but towards what? On the one hand, the organisers - the UN, Fiji and Germany - express strong hopes that it will speed up the implementation of the 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement. On the other, a giant contributor to global warming - the United States - decided to desert that milestone Agreement. Meanwhile, major European powers have been, again, prodigious in unmet promises. The UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn is the next step for governments to implement the Paris Climate Change Agreement and accelerate the transformation to sustainable, resilient and climate-safe development, said Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on this major event, in the former German capital, on 6-17 November 2017. As such Convention, the Bonn-based UNFCCC is the parent treaty of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and the ultimate objective of both treaties is to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent ""dangerous human interference|"" with the climate system. The Paris Climate Change Agreement entered into force on November 2017 and the era of implementation has begun, reminds Espinosa, emphasising that the Bonn conference will further clarify the enabling frameworks that will make the agreement fully operational and the support needed for all nations to achieve their climate change goals. ""It is also an excellent example of the cooperation and collaboration between nations that will truly meet the global climate change challenge... This meeting is incredibly important."" The conference -known as the signatory countries or Contracting Parties 23 session ( COP 23 )- is presided over by the government of Fiji with support by Germany. Prior to its opening, Espinosa encouraged governments, the private sector, and civil society organisations to be ready to work together to ""accelerate implementation and take the crucial next steps towards transformative change."" ""We all have a role to play, and COP 23 will shine a light on both action underway and the many possible actions every individual and institution can take moving forward."" The Polluters Do (Not) Pay Principle This is on the one hand. On the other, the US administration announced that it would promote coal, natural gas, fossil oil and nuclear energy as an answer to the climate change challenge. And the US President Donald Trump spelled out in September this year his decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Change Agreement. In spite of this negative development, the UNFCCC executive secretary expressed optimism ahead of the last Group of the seven more industrialised powers (G 7)-The Web of Paris Cannot Be Broken by One Missing Link, she said on July 7. The point is that is it is not about the US only. In fact, other major contributors to global warming and gas emissions, such as many European highly industrialised countries, have been heralding day after day their formal commitment to reduce gas emissions, expand the use of alternative sources of energy, and a long etcetera. So far, major car-makers have been very active promoting the sale of vehicles moved by electric and, hybrid engines. For now, China as a key source of pollution seems to be addressing the need to slow down the fast process of climate change in a serious manner. The Visible Dangers Meantime, the grave impacts of climate change are visible on almost all fronts. See: Floods, Hurricanes, Droughts... When Climate Sets the Agenda At the same time, the leaders of two top UN specialised organisations, have been warning that Climate change migration is reaching crisis proportions. See: Climate Migrants Might Reach One Billion by 2050 Another major UN organisation has recently explained the reasons of the massive displacement of people. See: The Roots of Exodus: Why Are People Compelled to Leave their Homes? One key cause of the growing, dangerous impact of climate change is the prevailing economic model consisting of voracious depletion of natural resources in both production and consumption patterns has proved to be one of the world's main killers due to the huge pollution it causes for air, land and soil, marine and freshwater. See: Pollution or How the 'Take-Make-Dispose' Economic Model Does Kill And the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) has warned that pressures on global land resources are now greater than ever, as a rapidly increasing population coupled with rising levels of consumption is placing ever-larger demands on the world's land-based natural capita. See: Alert: Nature, on the Verge of Bankruptcy. On top of this and that, the United Nations weather agency announced on 30 October 2017 that the levels of carbon dioxide (C02) surged at ""record-breaking speed"" to new highs in 2016. Petteri Taalas, Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) issued this warning in Geneva, at the launch of the organisation's Greenhouse Gas Bulletin. The report indicates that carbon dioxide concentrations reached 403.3 parts per million in 2016, up from 400 ppm in 2015. ""We have never seen such big growth in one year as we have been seeing last year in carbon dioxide concentration,"" said Taalas. The WMO chief said ""We are not moving in the right direction at all... In fact we are actually moving in the wrong direction when we think about the implementation of the Paris Agreement ... "" A Common Cause, Really? The UNFCCC explains that the Paris Agreement builds upon this Convention and - for the first time - brings all nations into a common cause to undertake ambitious efforts to combat climate change and adapt to its effects, with enhanced support to assist developing countries to do so. As such, it charts a new course in the global climate effort. The Paris Agreement's central aim -it reminds- is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The central aim should definitely be to prevent the growing everyday human dramas such as the loss of food security and means of survival, the forced need to abandon their homes and families to face death and brutality at the hands of smugglers and human traffickers, to be exploited as ""modern"" slaves, and to prevent the world's seas and oceans from being home to more plastic than fish.

"COP23","South.Africa","COP23_South.Africa43","Combating Climate Change? Combat Land Degradation, Says UNCCD Chief","November 24, 2017","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","Land restoration is not a ""glamorous subject even when you give all the numbers,"" admits Monique Barbut, the Executive Secretary of United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification UNCCD). But she also stresses that by 2050, the world population will reach 10 billion. To feed that extra 2.4 billion, current food production would need to be increased by 75 percent. By 2045, there will be 130 million people who migrated because of desertification, and out of them, 60 million will come from south of the Sahel and Africa. ""To do that, we will have to add, from now to 2050, 4 million acres of new land every year. So unless urgent action is taken to restore degraded land, the world is looking at an acute food-insecure future,"" she told IPS in a special interview on the sidelines of the recently concluded UN Climate Conference - COP23 in Bonn. Land vs energy: a popularity game? At the conference where ideas, actions, innovations and resources were brought in the open to design a roadmap to tackle climate change, the discussions were dominated by ending coal, producing renewable energy and making green technologies more accessible. Land was an issue largely ignored, except by some indigenous peoples' groups who stressed the need to maintain soil fertility. But Barbut asserts that land is indeed integral to climate actions and policies taken both at the UN and at the national level. ""In the INDCs [Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, or what countries will do to cut carbon emissions] they have submitted, more than 140 countries have said that land was part of their solution or their problem in terms of climate change,"" she points out. One of the countries is India, where an estimated 30 percent of total land is already degraded. According to a 2016 report by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) titled ""World Day to Combat Desertification"", the degrading area has increased over 0.5 per cent to 29.3 million hectares in the past decade. Desertification also increased by 1.16 million hectares (m ha) and stood at 82.64 m ha during 2011-13, says the report. As a signatory to the UNCCD, India has committed to combat desertification and land degradation and become land degradation neutral by 2030. In simple terms, this means having a balanced proportion of land loss and land gain. However, though an ambitious goal, this is seldom talked about by the officials. In sharp contrast, India's other environmental actions, especially the Solar Mission which aims to produce 175 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2022, is widely lauded. Anand Kumar, the secretary of India's Ministry for New and Renewable Energy, is quick to point out that the International Solar Alliance - a group of 44 countries committed to produce 1,000 gigawatts of solar energy - has promised investments of 1 trillion dollars by 2030. No land restoration initiatives are likely to garner that kind of private investment, admits Barbut, as the job is more labor intensive. ""Even the most degraded land can be restored with a small investment of 300 dollars per hectare. So, what is needed is not a large sum of money, but lots of manual labour. So perhaps there is not a lot of scope for huge investment and large profits,"" she says. However, at the same time, she shared some good news: the UNCCD, in collaboration with Mirova, the governments of France, Luxembourg, Norway, and the Rockefeller Foundation, has launched a special fund for restoring degraded land and fighting desertification. Named the Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) Fund, this new finance vehicle was launched on September 12 this year, during the 13th Conference of the Parties (COP13) of the UNCCD in Ordos, China. ""We have launched the biggest land impact fund. It is managed by Matistix. It is a public-private fund. By the beginning of next year, we hope to have about 300 million dollars of capitalization of the fund,"" Barbut says. Land and Women's Rights The connection between the environment and women's rights is an integral one, says Barbut. ""Whether it's drought, land degradation or desertification, women suffer more than others. In fact, they not only suffer from the consequences of drought or desertification, but also from the fact that in most cases women do not have rights to land,"" she says, before sharing some experiences from Africa where plots of degraded land were restored, but because women did not have rights to the land, they could not stake their claim. One such example is in the Mboula region of Senegal, where the regional government allocated tracts of land to women's groups for collective farming. The initiative has been a big success as the women's collective managed to grow more food than expected. As a result, the women now have received training to venture into growing crops for market, besides their own consumption. Similarly, in Eastern Uganda, the government started a new initiative with women who had no ownership over their land. They have been trained in marketing, managing a collective that cultivates arable land that was once degraded, but is now restored. Besides supporting these local initiatives at the country level, UNCCD is also mainstreaming gender equality in its own policies and actions. ""We now have a Gender Policy Framework and it's the most advanced framework all the UN Conventions and which we will apply in particular to all the transformative projects,"" Barbut explains. Land and Climate Change According to Barbut, climate change's effects on land are becoming more and more of a global problem, with major social and political consequences. She mentions the recent droughts witnessed by France, Canada and successive droughts in the US, and also points out the recent exodus of people from drought and desertification in the global south. ""If you see all the migrants coming to Europe, 100 percent of them - not 90 percent but 100 percent - are coming from drylands. There are also migration and radicalism linked to land degradation and desertification. For example, in the drylands of Africa, where desertification is happening, we are seeing food riots and then we are seeing Al Qaeda,"" she says, pointing to a study published by UNCCD that explores these links. Citing another study by the British Government's Defence Ministry, Barbut says that ""by 2045, there will be 130 million people who migrated because of desertification, and out of them, 60 million will come from south of the Sahel and Africa."" But all is not hopeless. Barbut shared her vision of a food-secure future and a clear way to achieve that goal: ""By 2050, we will need millions of hectares of new lands to grow 75 percent extra food. Today we are taking new land from forests and wetlands. At the same time, on this planet, you have 2 billion hectares of degraded land. Among this, 500 million are abandoned agricultural land. If we restored 300 million of these 2 billion hectares of land, we can ensure food security for all by 2050."" \"
"COP23","South.Africa","COP23_South.Africa44","On Gender Day At Climate Meet, Some Progress, Many Hurdles","November 15, 2017","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","""Five years ago, when we first started talking about including gender in the negotiations, the parties asked us, 'Why gender?' Today, they are asking, 'How do we include gender?' That's the progress we have seen since Doha,"" said Kalyani Raj. Raj is a member and co-focal point of the Women and Gender Constituency (WGC) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Established in 2009, the WGC is an umbrella group of 27 organizations working to make women's voices and rights central to the ongoing discussions within the UNFCCC and the climate discussions known as COP23 in Bonn. On Tuesday, as the COP observed Gender Day - a day specifically dedicated to address gender issues in climate change and celebrate women's climate action - UNFCCC had just accepted the Gender Action Plan, a roadmap to integrate gender equality and women's empowerment in all its discussions and actions. For WGC and other women leaders attending the COP, this is a clear indication of progress on the gender front. ""For the first time ever, we are going to adopt a Gender Action Plan. It's very good and over one year, it will be a matter of implementing it. So that's where we are,"" said Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland and former Special Envoy of the UN Secretary General for Climate Change. Gender Action Plan: The main points The creation of a Gender Action Plan (GAP) was agreed upon by the countries at last year's conference (COP22) in Morocco. All over the world, women face higher climate risks and greater burdens from the impacts of climate change. Yet they are often left out of the picture when decisions on climate action are made. The aim of the GAP is to ensure that women can influence climate change decisions, and that women and men are represented equally in all aspects of the UNFCCC as a way to increase its effectiveness. The GAP is made of five key goals that are crucial for improving the quality of life for women worldwide, as well as ensuring their representation in climate policy. These range from increasing knowledge and capacities of women and men to full, equal and meaningful participation of women in national delegations, including women from grassroots organizations, local and indigenous peoples and women from Small Island Developing States. In brief, the five goals are: Gender-responsive climate policy including gender budgeting Increased availability of sex and gender disaggregated data and analysis at all levels 100% gender-responsive climate finance 100% gender responsive approach in technology transfer and development. The adopted draft, however, is a much watered-down version of the draft GAP that the GEC submitted. It has omitted several of the demands, especially on including indigenous women and women human rights defenders in the climate action plan. ""I would have expected a much-expressed acknowledgement of the participation, the voices and the knowledge of the indigenous and local women. We worked very hard to get that in, but it's not there as much as I would have liked,"" said Robinson, before adding that the adoption of the GAP, nonetheless, is ""definitely some progress."" Omission leads to disappointment Not everyone, however, is taking the omissions in the GAP quietly. At Tuesday noon, representatives of over a dozen women's organizations from Latin America, Africa, the MENA region and Asia gathered at Bula zone 1 - where the negotiations are taking place and held a protest. ""We are here because we want to tell the parties that women human rights defenders are legitimate and critical actors not only in SDG 5, but all the SDGs including combating climate change and all areas of 2030 agenda and Paris Agreement,"" said a protester as others nodded in silence, their mouth sealed with black tape. Prior to the protest, however, Lina Gualinga, an indigenous leader from the Kichwa tribe in Ecuador shared some details of how women environmental activists feel. ""The representation of women environment and climate defenders is minimal at the COP as the UNFCCC has built a firewall around it. So, very few women can actually be here and be part of the COP,"" she said. ""In the meantime, the language of the negotiations is drafted and shaped leaving no room to address our concerns. For example, what is sustainable development? For us, it's nothing but clean water, fresh air, fertile land. Is that reflected in the language of the COP?"" she asked. No access to climate finance Besides the continuous disappointment over human rights and indigenous issues, accessing finance has emerged as the biggest hurdle for women climate leaders. According to Robinson, the number of women who are getting climate finance is shockingly small. ""The latest figures by OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) shows that only 2 percent of the finance is going to women in the grassroots and southern groups. Only 2 percent! Its tiny. And yet that is where an awful lot of climate work is taking place, where women are trying to make themselves resilient,"" Robinson said. There are three simple ways to solve this, she said: One, increase local funding. Two, simplify the process to access climate. And three, train women in new, green technologies. Citing the example of the Barefoot College in India - a government funded and NGO-run institution that trains women from developing countries in solar technologies before they become ""Solar Mamas"" or solar entrepreneurs - Robinson said that trainings like this are a great way to include women in climate action at the local level. ""This not only builds their capacity to be more climate resilient, but also helps them become economically empowered,"" she said, before admitting that more such initiatives would require more direct funding by local institutions. Numbers still missing White the central debate is on mainstreaming gender in the core process of negotiations, some also want to draw attention to the low representation of women in the conference. At the 2015 Paris summit, just over 38 percent of national delegations were women, with Peru, Hungary, Lesotho, Italy and Kiribati among the most balanced delegations and Mauritius, Yemen, Afghanistan and Oman the least. This year, some countries such as Turkey, Poland and Fiji have 50 percent female delegates while three countries - Latvia, Albania and Guyana - have sent all-female delegations. But the average percentage of female negotiators at country delegations is still 38. Several countries, including Somalia, Eritrea and Uzbekistan, did not include a single women in their delegations. Noelene Nabulivou, an activist from Fiji, said that it's time to seriously fill the gender gap at the conference. ""If we are asking for equal opportunity, why can't we ask for equal participation?"" asked Nabulivou. Meanwhile, Kalyani Raj thinks that quotas could limit the potential scope. ""We want a balance, but at the same time, why limit ourselves to a mere 50 percent? It could be anything!"" said Raj. The first report to evaluate the progress on the implementation of the Gender Action Plan will be presented in November 2019. \"
"COP23","South.Africa","COP23_South.Africa45","Addressing climate risk is an opportunity todrivevalue MAKING ACOMMITMENT","November 15, 2017 Wednesday","Pretoria News (South Africa)","FOR ANY major global company - in our case as the world's leading logistics provider - the commitment to go emissions-free by 2050 tends to trigger one of two reactions. Some regard it as a public relations ploy, others think setting such a goal is overly optimistic. I think both reactions are wrong. Making such a commitment is simply inevitable. Climate change is a clear risk to the value of all companies anywhere. At the same time, the true potential to combat climate change will only be achieved once human ingenuity and the resource efficiency of the market are fully tapped. For that reason, business leaders increasingly understand that addressing the climate risk is not just a cost imposed on them. It is also an opportunity to drive value through new business models and investment in new technologies. The goal of COP 23 First, the commitment to go emissions-free requires a fundamental rethink of many business activities. For us, re-evaluating everything through the prism of sustainability has given a new quality to our relationship with suppliers and customers. For example, our aerodynamically designed Teardrop trailers, used for long-haul road transport, reduce fuel consumption as well as carbon emissions. Beyond our own company's needs, we work with our customers to create tailor-made versions for them. Second, precisely because there is no silver bullet, one must launch many concrete steps rapidly and systematically. These efforts start with such little steps as switching to LED lighting in our facilities worldwide and rediscovering the benefits of relying on bicycles for urban delivery to the maximum extent possible. Third, success depends at least as much on solutions flowing bottom-up inside each company as top-down. Start-up labs, which capture promising ideas from rank-and-file employees, play an important role in that regard. As for us, we have become e-entrepreneurs. Operating a total fleet of 92000 delivery vehicles, a central task on our 2050 agenda is to move beyond our reliance on diesel-powered delivery vehicles and shift to electric vehicles. Such e-vehicles have to be as robust as diesel vehicles in handling heavy loads, able to sustain the stresses of constant stop-and-go traffic on urban delivery routes, and reliable enough to be used up to 300 days a year. When we could not find a suitable provider in the market place, we linked up with a university-based start-up, StreetScooter, which we subsequently acquired. We are now building out its initial product to a full range of electric vehicles and expanding its production capacity from 10000 vehicles this year to 20000 in 2018. An important motivation for us is to demonstrate that e-mobility can become standard practice in the global logistics industry and beyond. That is why, after scaling up in Germany, we are now beginning to roll out this solution globally. In addition, since StreetScooters can be adapted to the sector-specific delivery needs of other industries, they can provide urban mobility solutions on a much broader basis. To reduce our company's emissions and noise profile further, we also put great emphasis on e-bikes and e-tricycles. We currently use them in 58 cities in 12 different European countries, including France, Italy, the UK and the Netherlands. For us, the full-scale implementation of these various measures is key to reaching an important milestone for 2025 - that 70percent of our first-mile pick-up and final-mile delivery services will be emissions-free. As I have learnt first hand, green initiatives lead to new forms of productivity and over time the creation of entirely new markets with increasing demand for sustainable solutions. Bold aspirations are necessary, however, to catalyse this process. This is the way in which business can - and must - lead the transformation that's required globally.

"COP23","South.Africa","COP23_South.Africa46","Women Are Pivotal to Addressing Hunger, Malnutrition and Poverty","October 13, 2017","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","The 16th of October marks World Food Day, a reminder to the international community of the criticality of treating food security as a 21st Century priority if sustainable development, peace and security and the realisation of human rights are to be achieved. When we think and act on food security we must think and act on gender equality and women's empowerment as women are not only the ones most affected by food insecurity but are charged with the food and nutrition responsibilities for families and communities in the entire food value chain from growing the crops to bringing food to the table. Rapid population growth, the slowdown of the global economy, commodity price volatility, the speculative aspects of the trade in food commodity futures, and distortive agricultural and trade policies are compounding factors for continuing food insecurity and hunger. The latest estimates indicate that 795 million people were undernourished globally in 2014-2016, with insufficient food for an active and healthy life. Bio-fuel production with its rising pressure on land and natural resources as well as climate change, are adding to the volatility of food prices and the urgency to find solutions for food insecurity. and for achieving Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) on Ending Hunger, Achieving Food Security, Improving Nutrition and Promoting Sustainable Agriculture. Food security and gender equality and women's empowerment are concomitant and inextricably interlinked. Women are pivotal to addressing hunger, malnutrition and poverty especially in developing countries. They comprise an average of 43 per cent of the agricultural labour force across the developing world making up the backbone of the agricultural sector and food production systems and the bulk of the agricultural labourers. Eight out of ten agricultural workers in Africa are women and in Asia six out of ten are women. Rural women often represent approximately two thirds of the 400 million poor livestock keepers. Furthermore, women are on the front line of nutrition as care givers in the family - producing, storing, cleaning, cooking food for consumption - and ensuring that food, when available, reaches children first. Women have a crucial role in ensuring the health of children. Eight out of ten agricultural workers in Africa are women and in Asia six out of ten are women. Rural women often represent approximately two thirds of the 400 million poor livestock keepers. Nearly half of all deaths of children under the age of five are attributable to undernutrition. Anemia, caused by poor nutrition and deficiencies of iron and other micronutrients, affects 42 per cent of all pregnant women globally and contributes to maternal mortality and low birth weight. It is therefore even more inexcusable that women continue to face many barriers and constraints including limited access to assets and resources necessary for food security as well as disproportionately bear the impact of food insecurity. It is estimated that 60 percent of the world's chronically hungry people are women and girls. Rural ringing women and girls have been found to be impacted disproportionately from food insecurity and experience the triple burden of malnutrition (undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, and overweight and obesity). Women tend to face higher barriers than men to productive resources, economic opportunities, and decision-making, that would help alleviate food insecurity. For farming women, the lack of access to agricultural inputs, services, credit, and markets constrain agricultural productivity growth and agricultural production, making the arduous pathway out of poverty especially difficult. In sub-Saharan Africa, the productivity levels of female workers in agriculture are between 20 and 30 per cent lower than those of male workers, purely because of the gender gap in access to resources. Moreover, food preferences, taboos and consumption patterns give rise to differential gender outcomes on food security, as men and boys get preferential food access in some contexts. In time of food scarcity, women tend to eat last and least. Women's participation in decision making processes and in the leadership of rural institutions remains low - which has led to women's rights, contributions and priorities to be largely overlooked by mainstream policies and institutions on agriculture, food security and nutrition. Also, gender inequalities in the distribution of unpaid care work burden both in developed and in developing countries continue to deprive women from opportunities for paid work, education, and political participation, all of which have a bearing on their food security and nutrition. It is therefore clear that achieving sustainable development and peace and security will continue to challenge humanity if gender disparities in agriculture, food security and nutrition remain unaddressed. This year's World Food Day should therefore be a reminder that empowering women and unleashing their untapped potential to increase agricultural production is critical to the achievement of food and nutrition security, in improving rural livelihoods and in generating income and overall well-being of their households and communities. The inextricable links between gender equality and food security have gained enormous momentum in the international agenda. In 1995 the Beijing Platform for Action recognized that women were key to reducing poverty and ensuring food security. The Platform for Action called upon Member States and all stakeholders to formulate and implement policies and programmes that enhance women's access to financial, technical, extension and marketing services. It also highlighted the need to improve women's access to and control over land and appropriate financing, infrastructure and technology. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable (the 2030) recognized both as sustainable development goals (Goal 2 for food security and ending hunger, and Goal 5 for gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls), and stressed that both goals are mutually reinforcing and enabling factors in the overall achievement of sustainable development. Many crosscutting targets in terms of both gender equality and food security include ending hunger and addressing the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women (SDG 2.2), eliminating discrimination against women in laws, policy and practice (SDG 5.1). Furthermore, the 2030 Agenda recognizes that women's empowerment and control over resources reinforces nutritional health of their children (SDG 2.1). One specific group of women whose rights to economic resources must be enhanced (SDG 5.a.) is small-scale women food producers. Ensuring women's rights and improving their access to land, resources and incomes (SDGs 2.3 and 1.4) will be critical to achieving a number of goals. The Agreed Conclusions of the 61st Session of Commission on the Status of Women (March 2017) recognized the crucial role that rural women in particular have in food security, particularly in poor and vulnerable households and how it is important to achieve rural women's empowerment as well as their full, equal and effective participation at all levels of decision making. Interventions on the ground aimed at enhancing agricultural productivity must focus on the protagonists of agriculture, who are mainly women in many rural contexts. The international community is increasingly recognizing not only that women are on the front lines of food security, but that their needs and rights must be placed at the forefront of trade and agricultural policies and investments if sustainable development and peace and security are to be realized. Today it is more evident than ever that closing the gender gap in agricultural productivity could potentially lift hundreds of thousands of people out of poverty and hunger and address losses in economic growth opportunities. Bold and decisive action is critical to end the discrimination faced by women not only as a matter of justice and equality; but also to tackle the factors that are holding back agricultural production. Stability in the food market depends on increased investment in agriculture, particularly in developing countries, where 98 percent of the hungry live and where food production needs to double by 2050 to feed growing populations. Strengthening support and investment in the agricultural sector, should go in hand with acknowledging women's contributions to food security and ensuring their equal rights and equal access to resources, assets and opportunities. Measures to advance towards this aim include supporting the contributions of rural women and women farmers and ensuring that they have equal access to agricultural technologies, through investments, innovation in small-scale agricultural production and distribution. This in turn must be supported through policies that improve productive capacity and strengthen their resilience, addressing the existing gaps in and barriers to trading their agricultural products in local, regional and international markets. Better disaggregated data that shows where in the food systems women are, as well as their situation in terms of food security and nutrition is also urgently needed. Gender differences in land tenure and access to productive resources are particularly relevant as rural women are significant contributors to global food production. We must ensure rural women's full and equal rights to land and inheritance, land tenure security, common property and common resources and equal access to justice and legal support, by designing, reforming and enforcing relevant laws and policies. Control over and ownership of assets can provide women with greater protection and stronger fallback positions, enhancing their bargaining power within the household and their capacity for economic independence. We must also promote women's involvement in climate-resilient agriculture as farmers, workers, and agriculture and food entrepreneurs. All these efforts require transformative financing and investment, both targeted and mainstreamed also in terms of advocacy and support from all multistakeholders. Member States, UN agencies, civil society and the private sector should to take new and concrete actions for the full and accelerated implementation of the gender equality international commitments. It is equally as crucial to engage with grassroots women organisations and rural women organisations in the implementation of these commitments. It is critical to ensuring equal access to and control over productive resources, provision of quality basic services and infrastructure, and support to women smallholder farmers to improve productivity and resilience of food supplies, so that women are able to reach their potential as key game changers to ensure global food and nutrition security. At the current 72nd session of the UN General Assembly these issues will be addressed by the international community and the global norms, standards and policy commitments to gender equality and the empowerment of women as a precondition and objective of food security for all will be strengthened. The report of the Secretary-General on Improvement of the situation of women and girls in rural areas (A/72/207) highlights the efforts of Member States, the United Nations system and other actors to address challenges faced by women and girls in rural areas, especially the poorest and most marginalized. The report's recommendations cover in particular economic and social policies, ending violence against women and girls, education, health, land, inheritance and property rights, decent work and social protection, labour-saving infrastructure and technology. On the battle against climate change, we must recognize and support the potential of women as agents of change for climate mitigation and adaptation, which remains relatively untapped. The upcoming 23rd Session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 23 ) to the UN Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will recognise the vital role women play in sustainable development and in the implementation of climate policies, including through its Gender Action Plan which is being pushed for finalization at COP 23 . The forthcoming 62nd Session of the Commission on the Status of Women with its priority theme of 'challenges and opportunities in achieving gender equality and the empowerment of rural women and girls,' will also signal the determination to make the universe of food, nutrition and agriculture one that is powered by and is empowering for women and girls. This article is part of a series of stories and op-eds launched by IPS on the occasion of this year's World Food Day on October 16. \"

The joint sitting starts in the morning at 10h00 and ends at around 20h00 in the evening. On Tuesday, President Ramaphosa will reply to the debate on his address, at another joint sitting of the National Assembly and National Council of Provinces starting at 14h00.On Wednesday, the Minister of Finance will deliver the Budget Speech to a plenary sitting of the National Assembly starting at 14h00 and also introduce the Appropriation Bill and table the Division of Revenue Bill. Close scrutiny of government spending and revenue collection is key to Parliament fulfilling its constitutional mandate of maintaining oversight over executive action and policy implementation. The Money Bills Amendment Procedure and Related Matters Act of 2009, based on the Constitution's provision that: ""An Act of Parliament must provide for a procedure to amend money Bills before Parliament"", has empowered Parliament to make adjustments to the budget as a whole, as well as to the budgets of specific national government departments and entities. Before the Act, Parliament could approve or reject the budget, but not make adjustments to it. The Act places great responsibility on Parliament and has begun to reframe the nature of the relationship between Parliament and the executive as the custodian of service delivery. Parliamentary oversight over the budget has become a continuous exercise. Thursday's plenary sitting of the National Assembly includes condolences for Mr Laloo Chiba. Mr Chiba was elected as a Member of Parliament in South Africa's first non-racial democratic election in 1994 and again in our 1999 election. The 28 parliamentary committee meetings scheduled for this week feature a briefing from the Minister of Finance on the 2018 Budget, a public hearing on the National Research Foundation Bill and briefings and consideration of another 10 Bills.

"COP23","South.Africa","COP23_South.Africa48","No more poisoning the planet; Joint action is under way to fight devastating climate change, writes Desmond D'Sa","September 21, 2017 Thursday","Daily News (South Africa)","THE United Nations meets this week and it is a great tragedy that, in the wake of extreme evidence of climate change, world rulers are unable to deal with US President Donald Trump. The last time President Jacob Zuma had a meeting with Trump, in Germany, we see (from Trump's Twitter feed) who the ""winner"" was. Instead of Making America Great Again, we think Zuma and all other world leaders should impose climate sanctions on Trump and his closely allied corporations such as ExxonMobil and Goldman Sachs. Organisations from Umlazi, KwaMakutha, Glebelands, Folweni, Inanda, Enduduzweni, Phoenix, Sydenham, central Durban, Wentworth, uMkomaas, Fuleni, Ntuzuma and KwaMashu gathered at St Paul's Church on August 30 to discuss issues of environmental justice and human rights. The representatives who attended this gathering empathise with the loss of life, of animals and in some cases of entire households in South Asia and the US South. The representatives stated that they were shocked by what they had seen on television and the internet. World leaders who are coming together at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP 23 ) in Germany were urged to speed up the commitments to reduce CO2 emissions, to make these binding (not voluntary), to include ""climate debt"" owed to victims (instead of prohibiting our legal claims), to apply their minds to shipping, air transport and the military, and to wait no longer, as more tragedies continued to happen. The climate crisis has been witnessed close to home, with drought conditions prevailing in eastern and southern Africa (continuing in Cape Town). But our hearts go out to those in the path of a series of Caribbean and Atlantic Ocean hurricanes, and those unable to escape extreme flooding in South Africa as well as in China. In Asia, more than 40million people were forced to evacuate their homes and more than 1000 died, due to these severe climatic conditions. This is a timely warning to Trump that withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement is a travesty of justice and truth. Texans should push Trump to reverse his maniacal carbon addiction. Houston is the world hub of petro-chemical refining, bellowing out millions of tons of highly toxic chemicals that have contributed to the climate change crisis. The refusal of the Trump administration to admit that the world is at a tipping point, and that urgent steps need to be taken to avoid further devastation, makes clear that big brother America needs to be punished. They will not listen despite the suffering witnessed in the midst of despair, destruction and death in their own large cities of Houston, Miami and Tampa. It is obvious that we need to phase out the extraction and consumption of fossil fuel energy and move to a just transition. Oil corporations like ExxonMobil and Chevron, forced to close in Texas, prove that in spite of the huge climate denialist strategy they embarked on, you can never hide the truth. The spread of denialist propaganda by ExxonMobil has come full circle, resulting in the operations of the company being shut in Texas. We need to do the same, through protest and civil disobedience, to resist the attempts to drill for oil offshore from Durban (they are still in the exploration stage, in alliance with the Norwegian state company Statoil). The oil companies have played a major role in misleading world leaders and ordinary citizens. They will have to come clean. Those responsible belong with despots brought before the International Criminal Court in the Hague, and the same degree of punishment should apply to the climate crimes that men like US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson committed. We hold them responsible for wreaking havoc and destroying health, homes and families in the rush to profit from their oil production. They should be charged and brought before a similar court for their actions. ExxonMobil must know that we stand ready to fight any destruction of or damage to our coastline, its jobs and people. Fighting climate-destroying coal mines in Fuleni and Somkhele on the border of the iMfolozi natural reserve, community leader Billy Mqondo said: ""We witnessed the devastation of mining within our community and it has only been to the detriment of our people. ""Their crops are dying, water is becoming scarce and the mining companies are affecting the health of people."" He confirmed that the local communities would continue to push back and did not want mining in the area. Likewise, South Africans have fought Bell Pottinger, KPMG and McKinsey - three Western corporations enabling the Zupta criminal enterprise - and punished London pedlars at Bell Pottinger to the point of imposing on them a corporate death sentence. KPMG and McKinsey must also voetsek. We remember when, in the early 2000s, our Aids activists pushed big pharmaceutical companies out of anti-retroviral profiteering, instead bringing in local generic firms - with the result that life expectancy has been raised from 52 to 64. And an earlier generation fought from the 1950s to the early 1990s to kick Western corporations out of South Africa because they supported apartheid. Our sanctions campaign drew millions of international supporters. The KZN Environmental Network joins all our provincial allies fighting for human rights, decent housing and service delivery. We stand in solidarity with the people evicted in Howell Road, Sydenham and the shack dwellers who have had their homes demolished and are being evacuated from the land. Despite unending promises from the government to provide a better life for our poor majority, instead we are greeted by the Red Ants who do their masters' bidding with evictions, violence and homelessness. The police are, in theory, tasked to protect every citizen, but instead they have taken sides in protecting politicians. We stand as one; we will provide solidarity and join the fight against any cleansing and evictions of the poor no matter where they live in Durban, either by local or provincial government. The voices of the people of KZN will not be silenced. l Desmond D'Sa is chairperson of the South Durban Community Environmental Alliance and the Wentworth Development Forum. \"
"COP23","South.Africa","COP23_South.Africa49","Climate Change Is Already Upon Us & Will Only Worsen in Short Term [opinion]","November 15, 2017","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","It is fitting that this year's conference of parties (on climate change, COP 23 ) is led by Fiji, a nation on the frontlines. Last month I visited other small islands facing the impacts of a warming world: Antigua and Barbuda and Dominica. The hurricane damage was beyond belief. The catastrophic effects of climate change are upon us. Floods, fires, extreme storms and drought are growing in intensity and frequency. Atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide are higher than they have been for 800,000 years. Climate change is the defining threat of our time. Our duty -- to each other and to future generations - is to raise ambition. First, reducing emissions. The latest UN Environment Programme Emissions Gap Report shows that current pledges will only deliver a third of what is needed to stay in the safety zones of the Paris Agreement. The Global Carbon Project reported earlier this week that 2017 will see the first increase in CO2 emissions in three years. The window of opportunity to meet the 2-degree target may close in 20 years or less. And we may have only five years to bend the emissions curve towards 1.5 degrees. We need at least a further 25 per cent cut in emissions by 2020. Yet there are also encouraging signs of progress. For years, many insisted that lowering emissions would stifle growth, and that high emissions were the unavoidable cost of progress. Today that dogma is dead. We are beginning to de-couple emissions from economic growth. Massive economies such as China and India are on track to surpass their Paris pledges. Carbon markets are growing and merging. The Green Bond market is expanding. It is crucial for all countries to follow through on their Paris commitments. The agreement itself calls for raising ambition -- and so I urge you to use the 2020 revision of the Nationally Determined Contributions to close the 2030 emissions gap. The second area for greater ambition is: Adaptation. Mitigation is essential, but climate change is already upon us, and will only worsen in the short-term. It is essential that we adapt and that we strengthen resilience. The Green Climate Fund can play a catalytic role on this, and I appeal to its members, especially donor nations, to bring this mechanism fully to life. I have also asked the UN system to promote adaptation and resilience efforts at the country level. I commend the 2015 pledge by G7 nations to provide insurance against extreme weather events for 400 million more vulnerable people by 2020. And I welcome the announcement here in Bonn, led by the Government of Germany, to fast forward this ambition. The insurance industry itself has long sounded the alarm about climate change. The industry is keen to promote coverage for people at risk - and it is pressing business and governments alike to figure climate shocks into their planning, policies and operations. I will facilitate these efforts. Third, finance. Greater ambition on emissions, adaptation and resilience is inextricably linked to funding. We need to mobilize the agreed 100-billion-dollars annually for developing countries. Upholding this promise is essential for building confidence and trust. It is crucial for enabling all countries, but especially the most vulnerable, to face inevitable climate impacts and grow their economies cleanly. In addition, markets can and must play a central role in financing a low-carbon, climate-resilient future. Yet markets need to be re-oriented away from the counter-productive and the short-term. In 2016, an estimated 825 billion dollars were invested in fossil fuels and high-emissions sectors. We must stop making bets on an unsustainable future that will place savings and societies at risk. Earlier this year, a report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) showed that bringing together the growth and climate agendas could add 1 per cent to average economic output in the G20 countries by 2021. If we add the economic benefits of avoiding the devastation of climate change impacts, gross domestic product in 2050 would soar by 5 per cent. Infrastructure investment will be crucial. The world should adopt a simple rule: If big infrastructure projects aren't green, they shouldn't be given the green light. Otherwise we will be locked into bad choices for decades to come. Investing in climate-friendly development is where the smart money is headed. I welcome the initiative of President Macron to convene the ""One Planet summit"" next month to focus on financing. I will be working to scale up international financing in renewable and energy efficiency projects to reduce at least 1 gigaton or more of carbon emissions by 2020. The formation of a clean energy investment coalition, as proposed by Denmark, is an idea worth pursuing. We should also work with greater determination towards carbon pricing. This is a key instrument for driving down greenhouse gas emissions. More than half of the nationally determined contributions to the Paris Agreement cite the need for carbon pricing. Last year, carbon pricing initiatives generated 22 billion dollars. Growing carbon markets in Europe and North America, and China's expected announcement of one of the world's largest emissions trading systems, are a good sign. But to meet the Paris goals we need at least 50 per cent global coverage and a higher price on carbon to drive large-scale climate action. I urge G20 countries to set a strong example. The fourth ambition action area is partnerships. In particular, the only way to keep below 2 degrees and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees is to mobilize the private sector to move on an energy transformation. With government incentives, such as clean energy and transport policies, business can move the markets to promote the green economy we need. We need to engage global technology giants, the oil and gas sector and the automotive industry so their business plans are consistent with the Paris goals. And we need to engage the agricultural and forestry sectors to ensure climate friendly land use. But we must engage all actors - national, regional and local governments, philanthropists and investors and consumers - in the transformation to a low-emission economy. Next year, the Governor of California and my special envoy Michael Bloomberg, together with Anand Mahindra, will bring together cities, states, businesses and citizens' groups to encourage further commitments from these vital actors. One can see action everywhere, at all scales, at all levels, involving an ever-wider landscape of actors and institutions. Let us build on this momentum. Fifth, we need heights of political leadership. Solutions to climate change will enable us to meet many of the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. I encourage you to be bold in your deliberations and decisions here in Bonn - and at home. By embracing low-carbon climate-resilient policy making you can set the world on the right path. And where you lead, business and civil society will follow. In September 2019, I will convene a Climate Summit to mobilize political and economic energy at the highest levels. More immediately - in this 20th anniversary year of the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol and the 25th anniversary of the adoption of the Climate Change Convention - I call on all nations that have not yet done so to ratify the Doha Amendment. I also call on world leaders to ratify and implement the Kigali Amendment to phase down the use of hydrofluorocarbons, which destroy the ozone layer and contribute significantly to temperature rise. I can think of no greater way to show your people that you care for the well-being of your citizens than to claim the mantle of climate leadership. Show courage in combatting entrenched interests. Show wisdom in investing in the opportunities of the future. Show compassion in caring what kind of world we build for our children. As a former politician myself, I have no doubt that in today's world, this is the path to progress today and a meaningful legacy for tomorrow. Ultimately, there is only one ambition that matters - to build a secure world of peace, prosperity, dignity and opportunity for all people on a healthy planet. The world counts on your wisdom and foresight. \"

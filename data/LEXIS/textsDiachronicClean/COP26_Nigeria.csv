"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria1","UK injects Pound 10m financial aid to support Nigeria's COP26 commitments","Business Day"," ","The UK Authorities on Monday announced that it is providing up to Pound 10 million of concessional aid to reduce the risk for pension and insurance funds to invest in energy access projects, and support Nigeria's Conference of the Parties (COP26) commitment to reach net zero by 2060.According to a statement from the British High Commission in Abuja, the financing will help Nigerian investors focus on low carbon energy, supporting offgrid, low-carbon energy projects.It added that the financing will be blended to de-risk transactions and therefore mobilise domestic institutional investment from local pension funds, insurance firms and other local institutional investors.This, the commission notes, will help scale up domestic financing for eligible off-grid clean energy infrastructure, such as solar mini-grid and home systems, clean cooking infrastructure and SME cold storage infrastructure in Nigeria.The statement quoted Vicky Ford, the UK Minister for Africa, as saying ""The UK is committed to increasing both renewable energy and energy access in Nigeria, driving clean, sustainable and resilient growth.""As the world looks to transition to clean growth, we are witnessing an era-defining opportunity for the private sector. This transaction is particularly exciting as it brings together UK government support with the institutional capital which is essential to grow the sector at scale.""Ford explains that the innovative blended finance initiative will provide affordable long-term financing from local investors for the low carbon energy sector to support scaling up of off-grid low carbon energy projects in unserved and underserved communities.This initiative will support the implementation of Nigeria's Nationally Determined Contributions plan, which Nigeria submitted to the UNFCCC before COP26, its Energy Transition Plan, which was presented by the Nigerian government at COP26, and Nigeria's plans to increase energy access including the Solar Naija programme,"" he further said.Read also:AfDB commits $164m to promote renewable energy in Nigeria, othersUche Orji, MD/CEO of the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA), and Chairman of InfraCredit, was also quoted as saying ""InfraCredit is pleased to be working with FCDO to mobilise private investment from domestic pension funds and other institutional investors into such an important developmental area as low carbon energy access.This programme is aligned with NSIA's other clean energy initiatives which aims to deliver up to 250-500MW of renewable energy capacity in Nigeria that will reduce annual CO2 emissions, alleviate poverty, create jobs and support local economic growth.""The UK hosted the UN Conference of the Parties (COP) event in November 2021, which aimed to reduce the rise in temperature from climate change and help mitigate the impacts of climate change. President Buhari attended and Nigeria submitted enhanced promises (Nationally Determined Contributions) around reducing carbon emissions by 20percent (or 45percent with support) and reaching net zero by 2060.These promises included the use of increased renewable energy.The UK government reiterates that Nigeria needs energy to grow and industrialise but its consumption is low India and Indonesia use 7 times as much, and 87 million Nigerians are without energy at all. It added that renewable energy is the way forward as it has low carbon emissions and can create many jobs in Nigeria potentially a lot more jobs than oil and gas.Between 2014 and 2022, the UK has provided more than Pound 80m into the renewable energy sector in Nigeria, including both grants, technical assistance and lending and is continuing to support the sector through advisory programmes such as UK Nigeria Infrastructure Advisory Facility. The UK also provided more than $50m to set up InfraCredit in 2016.Meanwhile, the Federal Government of Nigeria and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on Monday signed a Memorandum of Understanding in a joint commitment to continue the fight against corruption.The Memorandum of Understanding, which was signed by Vicky Ford, Minister for Africa, and Abubakar Malami, the Attorney General for Nigeria, sets out the terms and understanding between the Government of the United Kingdom and the Federal Government of Nigeria to make this compensation payment.The agreement will enable a compensation payment to be made to Nigeria of Pound 210,610, following a successful investigation by the UK's Serious Fraud Office relating to the use of corrupt agents in the oil and gas sector.\l"

It has been considered as a fight-back from nature, the harm and evils of human activities and damages done to mother earth.The effects range from wildfire, volcano eruptions, landslides, earthquakes, flooding, erosion, excessive heat from ozone layer depletion amongst others. There was an urgent need for world leaders to converge in Glasgow, Scotland UK, to discuss and chart sustainable and innovative solutions to issues on climate change.The acronym COP26 Ambitions are meant to be plans and promises turned into workable actions.One of the World leaders who was in attendance was President Muhammadu Buhari, to inform the other global leaders in different spheres of life, Nigeria's strategic plans to tackle climate change challenges and achieve net zero economy. clear lesson to be learnt from Buhari's address is simple; finance is a necessary condition to tackle climate change challenges in NigeriaExtracts from President Muhammadu Buhari's speech at COP26 clearly highlights some of the challenges of climate change currently faced in Nigeria. Climate change has affected economic growth, particularly for sectors of the economy that are dependent on climatic conditions like agriculture, hydro power energy and public health.Excessive rain and drought as a result of climate change have caused food shortage, low crop yield, reduction in life stock and heavy loss of income for farmers in an economy that has a high composition of its population as farmers. This, according to some scholars, will lead to food crisis, hunger, starvation and full blown shortage of local grown food supply.There are also challenges of climate change effect on hydroelectric dams, most notably, the Kainji dam and other smaller dams, which is a major and vital source of electric energy in Nigeria. The irregular and unpredictable rainfall needed to run these sources of power supply are inconsistent and inadequate as a result of climate change.in, climate change has shown to impact negatively on public health illnesses like malaria, respiratory illness caused by soot as a result of deforestation, excessive burning and petroleum exploration in the Niger delta.Desertification in the north, flooding, erosion and pollution are a great concern to environmental and health experts. Nigeria is not interested in the uncertainties of the future but the climate change impact of today and now.Read also:After # Glasgow, what next?President Buhari explained from his speech that Nigeria was making genuine efforts in addressing the challenges of climate change. He requested for financial support and investment in energy transition from fossil fuel to gas, solar and wind sources of energy to reduce the emission of carbon monoxide responsible for ozone layer depletion.There is also a need for investment in renewable energy infrastructure and his administration's planned project of electrifying 5 million households and 25 million people through a decentralized solar energy provider. He described the project as a novel strategy to close the energy deficit in Nigeria by 2030.Buhari said that Nigeria was committed to achieving net zero by 2060 for economic transformation, but will require funding and financial assistance from more developed economies to developing economies to invest in critical infrastructure and meet their National Determined Contributions (NDCs) of their respective countries.There are plans according to Mr. President for an energy transition to gas and other ""earth friendly"" alternative sources of energy even as the 2022 proposed budget is believed to be a climate responsive budget, the first in the country's history.The Climate Change Bill has been passed by the national assembly to encourage green growth, low emission and sustainable development. clear lesson to be learnt from Buhari's address is simple; finance is a necessary condition to tackle climate change challenges in Nigeria. While some might disagree or criticize the president's speech, for more words and less action in practical realities, it is yet to be seen if Nigeria can generate funds, attract investment and financial support in addressing the challenges of climate change.The economic impact of covid-19 on global economies remains a threat to raising enough global funds to address the common enemy that must be confronted. While we hope successive governments beyond 2023 will translate this global commitment on climate change to reality, they remain a source of concern and worry to experts, Nigerians and the international community, as time is running out in saving mother earth from self-inflicted man-made destruction.\l"

In this context, we agreed that the United Kingdom and Egypt would strengthen bilateral cooperation to fight climate change and to maintain and build on the current momentum for global climate action.We will work together in 2022 and beyond to drive ambitious implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement, and to deliver on the outcomes of the Glasgow Climate Pact to keep 1.5 degrees in reach and support developing countries in adapting to the impacts of climate change. The UK will give its full support to Egypt in delivering ambitious outcomes at COP27, including ensuring that it delivers for those most vulnerable to climate change.We emphasize the urgency of action required to address the gaps in ambition across mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage, and finance, and the importance of responding to the best available science in this respect. We recognize that significant progress was made at COP26, but there is much more to be done \- particularly to implement commitments made. We aim to pursue a lasting legacy that ensures the UNFCCC process continues to drive ambitious action to address climate change and its impacts.Through our partnership, we will drive and support key processes, activities, and initiatives to increase ambition and implementation to achieve the goals of the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement. We will work together to encourage all Parties to meet their commitments across mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage and finance; requesting that by the end of 2022 parties revisit and strengthen their 2030 emissions target to align with Paris temperature goals, including enhancing NDCs long term strategies and stepping up ambition therein, ensuring accelerated delivery of the $100bn and to make progress towards doubling of adaptation finance on 2019 levels, as envisaged in the Glasgow Climate Pact.We also recognize the importance of our own domestic climate action, to demonstrate leadership globally. We further recognize the opportunity our partnership offers to enhance our shared prosperity through green trade and investment opportunities.To achieve our aims, we will share experience and expertise and work closely with key partners, including the UNFCCC Secretariat and the Chairs of the Subsidiary Bodies. We will pursue inclusive leadership and engagement that leaves no issue and no one behind, and enables the voices of all Parties, civil society, and vulnerable groups, including youth and indigenous peoples, to be heard.To this end, we agree to continue close consultations in the months ahead, both on the ministerial and technical levels.Distributed by APO Group on behalf of Government of UK.\l"

This will culminate in a meeting between Egypt, UAE and UK in Abu Dhabi, the first of a series of engagements between the countries ahead of COP27 and COP28.Whilst in Cairo, Mr Sharma met a wide range of Government Ministers, including Prime Minister Madbouly and Egypt's COP President-Designate, Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry. Together they issued a UK-Egypt Joint Statement which affirms their joint commitment to accelerating the fight against climate change during this critical decade.They also agreed to continue building a partnership in 2022 that aligns priorities and plans, secures the legacy of the Glasgow Climate Pact and delivers impact and progress on the Paris Agreement goals, in Sharm el Sheikh at COP27. This means ensuring all parties meet their commitments across mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage, and finance.The COP President also announced the expansion of the UK Government's 'Climate Finance Accelerator' Programme to Egypt. Already successfully operating in six countries, the initiative will provide capacity-building support to promising climate projects in Egypt so that they become more bankable and appealing to investors, and can secure funding more readily.On his final day in Egypt, Mr Sharma discussed the role of the private sector in building on COP26 to achieve success at COP27, meeting with business leaders pursuing green initiatives in Egypt.COP President Alok Sharma said: was a historic, collective achievement. We kept the goal of limiting average global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees in reach and made progress on finance for climate action, adaptation and loss and damage, which will benefit countries across both Africa and the MENA region.I look forward to working with Egypt and UAE as hosts of COP27 and COP28 respectively on the climate agenda. The UK will give its full support to Egypt in delivering an ambitious COP this November which ensures urgently delivering for those most vulnerable to climate change.We all need to make further progress in 2022 and especially on delivering the $100 billion of finance and addressing investment needs in the most climate vulnerable countries. This will build on the Glasgow Climate Pact and secure a better future for us all.An important focus for COP27 and COP28 will be the completion of the first Global Stocktake. This will be a key part of assessing progress made by nations in implementing the Paris Agreement and setting out a clear roadmap towards achieving it. This formally began at COP26 and will conclude at COP28The UK is keen to share experiences of hosting a large international summit with Egypt and the UAE and the COP President has highlighted the COVID-19 testing procedures for providing a safe experience for all delegates at the recent COP26 gathering and collaboration with civil society.The COP President will now travel to the United Arab Emirates to see preparations for COP28 that will be staged in 2023 and will meet key government ministers, including the recently appointed Minister of Climate Change and Environment, HE Mariam Al Mheiri and UAE's Special Envoy for Climate Change HE Dr. Sultan Al Jaber.Mr Sharma has been invited to take part in Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week, which gets underway tomorrow (Monday 17 January). The COP President will be involved in helping the UAE to illustrate its intentions for hosting COP28 and delivering on their climate commitments made over the last 12 months.Hosting the next two COPs in the Middle East and North Africa will enable the region to showcase to the world their innovative and profitable solutions which include renewable and low carbon energy, zero emissions transport, the role of nature based solutions and the role of smart agriculture.For example, the UAE continues to break records by reducing the costs of solar energy year after year and is delivering energy security through nuclear energy, all of which makes clean energy a more affordable option than fossil fuels.British Ambassador to Egypt, Gareth Bayley said:COP26. The strong bilateral relationship between the UK and Egypt will help sustain global momentum on climate change. I am particularly pleased that Mr Sharma launched our 'Climate Finance Accelerator' programme, which I hope will generate a series of inspiring low carbon investment opportunities in Egypt. It is this combination of public and private sector action which will help us avert a climate disaster.Local delivery is central to the CFA approach and the Embassy team is looking forward to working with the local delivery partners once they have been appointed.British Ambassador to the UAE, Patrick Moody said:The visit of COP26Together, we are already delivering solutions to achieve 'net zero' through bilateral trade and investment in clean growth and technology.

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria6","Was COP26 The 'Most Exclusive' Climate Negotiations Since Paris Agreement?","Nigerian Tribune"," ","THE much talked about and anticipated has come and gone. However, civil society and grassroots organisations from Africa have described the Climate negotiations in Glasgow as the 'most exclusive' COP since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2016.They insist that the lofty promises and glowing speeches made by world leaders including United States president, Joe Biden, and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, among a host of others, has given way to bewilderment among civil society in Africa that expected concrete commitments that will save the continent from climate-induced extinction. They bemoaned how the rich Global North countries again shunned their responsibility of committing to financing adaptation and mitigation measures for countries in the Global South most affected by climate change, and how false solutions and distractions such as carbon markets net zero took center stage during the negotiations.COP26 was the 26th annual summit of the 'Conference of the Parties' to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It held from October 31 to November 13, 2021.The build-up to COP26In 2015, at COP21, nations agreed to work together to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees and aim for 1.5 degrees, to adapt to the impacts of a changing climate and to make money available to deliver on these aims, giving rise to The Paris Agreement.The Paris Agreement set out that every five years countries must set out increasingly ambitious climate action. This meant that, by 2020, countries needed to submit or update their plans for reducing emissions, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs).This made the run up to this year's summit in Glasgow (due to take place in 2020, but delayed by a year due to the pandemic) a critical moment in the bid to keep the hope of limiting global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees Celsius alive.At the end of COP26, on 13 November 2021, countries agreed on the Glasgow Climate Pact to keep 1.5C alive and finalise the outstanding elements of the Paris Agreement.COP26 President's remarksAt the end of the talks, President Alok Sharma said: 'We can now say with credibility that we have kept 1.5 degrees alive. But, its pulse is weak and it will only survive if we keep our promises and translate commitments into rapid action. I am grateful to the UNFCCC for working with us to deliver a successful COP26.'It is up to all of us to sustain our lodestar of keeping 1.5 degrees within reach and to continue our efforts to get finance flowing and boost adaptation.'After the collective dedication which has delivered the Glasgow Climate Pact, our work here cannot be wasted.'What activists have saidHowever, activists are unhappy about the outcome of COP26. They said they expected greater commitment to curb global warming. They said fossil fuel companies had the major influence at the talks leading to statements from the summit which contain what they call 'meaningless language'.Aderonke Ige, Associate Director, Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa said: 'COP26Nnimmo Bassey, Director of Health of Mother Earth Foundation said: 'Disappointment is an understatement for the outcomes of .

Climate change is one of the greatest threats facing this generation, with 1 billion children at extremely high risk. Yet, while the outlook is dire, world leaders at COP26 have a significant, time-sensitive opportunity to redirect the terrible path we are on.""They can do so by committing to strengthening the resilience of services that children depend upon, and by cutting emissions faster and deeper. The futures of billions of children depend on it."" The report further stated that approximately one billion children, which represents nearly half of the world's children live in 33 countries classified in the Index as ""extremely high-risk"".According to UNICEF, such children are exposed to climate and environmental shocks with a high vulnerability due to inadequate essential services, such as water and sanitation, healthcare and education.UNICEF noted that its presence at the COP26 is geared towards promoting approaches to decrease climate risk for those who are most vulnerable.Also, UNICEF noted children and young people can participate in climate-related decision-making through COP26.\l"
"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria9","Why COP26 Was A Failure - Environment Activists","Nigerian Tribune"," ","Environment activists at a media roundtable have described the recent climate change conference called COP26 as failure because participants failed to question policies about climate change affecting African countries.At the roundtable organised by Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa (CAPPA), Nnimmo Bassey, Executive Director of Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF), explained that COP26 was a failure because 'participants came with different orientation which did not make them have a good negotiation and question policies that were made about climate change affecting African countries.'On the concept of Net Zero, Bassey said Net Zero does not imply stopping emmissions.He said, 'Net Zero is not zero; it does not mean it will stop carbon emissions.'Bassey added that the huge presence of delegates from oil and gas and coal numbering 504 implied that COP was not a people's conference but was that of the fossil fuel industry.He demanded that 'African governments must challenge and reject pledges made by polluting corporations and governments to achieve Net Zero emissions, which are being used to shift additional burdens onto the African region and avoid responsibility for their role in the global share of emissions to-date.'Philip Jakpor, Director of Programmes at CAPPA, noted that 'African communities are facing climate crisis and we want the issue of mitigation and adaptation to be at the forefront of discussion.' 'These things did not happen, rather we started hearing about Net-zero which is an industry language to delay action and to push the perils further down the road.'The Nigerian government that is talking about cutting carbon emission by the year 2060 or 2070 as the case may be is still investing greatly in Fossil fuels in some states.'We are still looking for oil in the North. The government is talking about bringing nuclear power plants and that same government is talking about cutting emissions. This means we have not been able to deliver on climate.'Our verdict is that the Nigerian is very conflicting and as civil society people we are trying to put our government on the right path'.Speaking on the shortcoming of COP26, Jakpor said, 'the essence of the gathering is to look at climate change holistically and look at what each country can do to cut carbon emissions which is actually the cause of climate change.'Executive Director, CAPPA, Akinbode Oluwafemi, added that there was the need for 'civil society organisation advancing climate justice in the continent to have a regional position in the form of document that will accommodate concerns across board in Africa.'Olamide Martins, Programme Manager at CAPPA, said that 'we are not in support of the government by passing Net Zero because it is against African people'.He said, 'Governments on the continent must ensure that the NDCs of African countries are independent of false solutions and corporations' influences, but rather accommodate workable and home-grown climate real solutions on mitigation and adaptations.'\l"
"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria10","ANALYSIS: COP26 and the $100 billion Talk","November 1, 2021 Monday","Premium Times","Nigeria, Nov. 1 -- Yesterday, October 31, marked the beginning of the event of the year - COP26; it will be for the next 12 days. One of the most important decisions that will dominate the conference, being held in Scotland, is the popular talk about developed countries mobilising $100 billion to support developing countries. Analysts say the conference must rebuild confidence that global, collective action can solve humanity's greatest challenges.In her opening speech Sunday, Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of UN Climate Change, said the devastating loss of lives and livelihoods this year due to extreme weather events clarifies how important it is to convene despite the impacts of the pandemic still being felt.""We are on track for a global temperature rise of 2.7C, while we should be heading for the 1.5C goal. Clearly, we are in a climate emergency. Clearly, we need to address it. Clearly, we need to support the most vulnerable to cope. To do so successfully, greater ambition is now critical,"" she said.Also, while addressing the conference following his election, COP President Alok Sharma thanked delegates for travelling to Glasgow and outlining the urgent need for action:""As COP President I am committed to promoting transparency and inclusivity. And I will lead this conference in accordance with the draft rules of procedure, and with the utmost respect for the party-driven nature of our process. In that spirit, I believe we can resolve the outstanding issues. We can move the negotiations forward. We can launch a decade of ever-increasing ambition and action. Together, we can seize the enormous opportunities for green growth, for good green jobs, for cheaper, cleaner power. But we must hit the ground running to develop the solutions we need. And that work starts today. We will succeed, or fail, as one.""In 2009, at the Conference of the Parties (COP) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Copenhagen (COP15), developed country Parties committed, in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation, to a goal of mobilising, jointly, $100 billion a year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries. In this regard, Parties specified that the finance would come from a wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources of finance. The climate finance goal was then formally recognized by the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties at COP16 in Cancun. At COP21 in Paris, Parties extended the $100 billion goals through 2025.This long-standing commitment is key to trust and solidarity between developed and developing countries, rooted in the fact that developed nations are responsible for the majority of carbon emissions since industrialization began, and generally have a greater capacity to offer support.The OECD recently estimated that developed countries mobilised $79.6 billion in climate finance in 2019. It is likely that these nations failed to collectively meet the $100 billion goal in 2020. Last week, wealthy countries confirmed they failed to meet a 2009 promise to deliver $100 billion annually by 2020 in climate finance to help poorer nations cut their own emissions and build resilient systems to weather worsening storms, floods and other climate impacts and this has caused anger and mistrust among developing countries and undermined rich nations' requests that the developing world cut emissions faster - which would require huge investments to decarbonise everything from power plants to factories, transport and farming.COP26 will need to produce a plan to make sure the $100 billion arrives. It will also start negotiations on a new climate finance goal for 2025 - and the rules to make sure rich countries cannot avoid delivering the money.As part of the Paris Agreement, countries agreed to try to limit global warming to 2C - but ideally 1.5C - to curb climate breakdown, and to submit their own action plans as to how they will each achieve this. is more about ensuring that developing countries, in particular, are supported as they have been at the receiving end of the worst calamities that come with climate change. Across Africa, many countries are battling sea-level rise which is threatening their coastal regions, a key source of revenue. In West Africa, coastal areas host about one-third of the region's population and generate 56 per cent of its GDP but this region loses about $3.8 billion yearly due to coastal zone degradation.Several other countries are plagued by variable rainfall patterns that affect crop yield and agricultural productivity, also fuelling drought and the consequent conflict that arise as a result of resource clashes. Southern Africa witnessed extensive drought in 2019 while the Greater Horn of Africa and the Sahel, dry regions, experienced flooding in 2019 as a result of heavy rainfall.Most African countries still rely heavily on rain-fed agriculture. Disruption in rainfall patterns leading to drought or flooding, therefore, have significant impacts on agriculture and food security in respective countries. Exposure to climate shocks and their lack of adaptive ability makes African countries very vulnerable to climate change.Almost all sectors are vulnerable to climate change. Extreme heat has dire impacts on health and morbidity while rising flooding increases the risk of waterborne disease. Climate shocks often affect the economy too as well as the livelihood of the people at the grassroots who mostly suffer from these challenges.Climate change also widens the existing inequality gap between the rich and the poor and men and women. As noted in a UNFCCC report, ""Women constitute a large percentage of the world's poor, and about half of the women in the world are active in agriculture - in developing countries, this figure is 60 per cent, and in low-income, food-deficit countries, 70 per cent."" If not properly addressed, climate change may exacerbate the already existent crises of poverty and inequality across the continent.Developed countries must deliver on their promise to mobilise $100 billion every year in climate finance to support developing countries. This must include building new markets for adaptation and mitigation and improving the quantity, quality, and access to finance to support communities around the world to take action on the changing climate.The OECD estimates that $79.6 billion of climate finance was mobilized in 2019. The UK said it will be doubling its International Climate Finance commitment to help developing nations with &#163;11.6 billion over the next five years up to 2025/2026. Joe Biden, president of the United States, announced an increased U.S. contribution to climate action in developing countries at the UN general assembly on Tuesday.During a speech at the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, Mr Biden said his administration would work with Congress to double its April pledge of $5.7 billion to $11.4 billion a year by 2024 and ""make the U.S. a leader in international climate finance.""COP26 should ensure that as many countries as possible follow this and increase their commitments through to 2025.Ahead of COP26COP26 President-Designate Alok Sharma asked Jonathan Wilkinson, Canada's Minister of Environment and Climate Change, and Jochen Flasbarth, Germany's State Secretary at the Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, to work together to produce a Delivery Plan on the $100 billion commitment, to demonstrate how and when developed countries will deliver on their promise. This was published on October 25, alongside a technical report from the OECD.As COP26COP26.The opening ceremony of the World Leaders Summit will take place at 12.00 hrs. The Summit will be attended by Boris Johnson, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Ant&#243;nio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations and Patricia Cantellano, UNFCCC Executive Secretary. Statements during the opening of the World Leaders Summit will be delivered by Mario Draghi, Prime Minister of Italy; Mia Mottley, Prime Minister of Barbados; David Attenborough, and The Prince of Wales.World leaders will be discussing mitigation, adaptation and finance - which are at the heart of COP26According to analysts, four things must happen for us to call COP26 a success as it should not be another talk show but a gathering backed with intentional action to:Ensure concrete delivery plan to back emission reduction commitments. It is already bad that the world's greatest polluters like China are not seeing the urgency in the plan to reduce their emission as their recently published national plan on greenhouse gas emissions shows unimpressive progress on the previously announced ambitions of the world's biggest carbon emitter. The plan had a lot of observers disappointed. In its plan, China said its emissions would peak by 2030 and be reduced to net zero three decades later.Ed Conway, economics and data editor at Sky News, said If Russia and China are not actually there in the room, then that is a pretty big signal that they are not necessarily committed as wholeheartedly as everyone hoped they would be.""If these big multilateral plans to sort out climate change are going to work, they have to be exactly what that says - multilateral - and if every country is not involved, especially the big polluters, then you've got a bit of a problem.""He added that clarity on a global carbon price would be another way to deem COP26 a success.The Tony Blair institute noted that should chart a clear path for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to enable decarbonisation, resilience, energy access, and economic growth. The Paris Agreement committed high-income countries to provide $100 billion of support per year to help fund climate resilience and adaptation in lower-income countries - an important start, but not a true reflection of the level of assistance that will be needed. Even that original commitment has not been met. At COP26, the wealthiest countries need not only meet that target; they must set a more stretching goal to support their lower-income counterparts in establishing pathways to decarbonisation that cut emissions, enable universal energy access and strengthen economic growth.According to Reuters, a major priority for COP26 is for negotiators from the nearly 200 countries that signed the 2015 Paris Agreement to finish the rules to implement the accord. That includes thorny discussions on carbon markets, how countries will set climate targets in the future, and finance.As we enter the second day of COP26, the world is watching to see how the event will shape the future of developing countries and as the president of South Africa said, for talks on energy transition to be acknowledged, developed economies must be sincere in talk and action.""We want your more developed economies that have been responsible for the greatest emissions in the world, to be the ones who will live up to the offers they have made in the past, once they do that, we will then be able to navigate our own transition.""Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Premium Times.

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria11","The COP26 climate test","The Nation (Nigeria)"," ","The climate crisis is a code red for humanity.World leaders gathered this past week at the UN Climate Conference - known as COP26 - in Glasgow, Scotland. Their actions show their seriousness about addressing this planetary emergency.There are already early warning signs in Nigeria.Two of the past five years - 2016 and 2019 - have been the hottest ever recorded in Nigeria. The trend is clear for all to see. We can expect more hot days, warm nights and heat waves.Likewise, fluctuating patterns of rainfall have been responsible for extreme climate events like floods and droughts in many parts of the country. Nigeria's environment and ecosystems, foundational to the nation's economy, are under threat of destruction according to current climate impact projections.Climate change, therefore, poses a threat to Nigeria's hard-won economic gains and to its ambitions of meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).But solutions are at hand.If we can reduce global emissions by 45 per cent compared to 2010 levels this decade, and reach net-zero by 2050, we can do it.World leaders need to step up and deliver in Glasgow - especially those of the G20 nations.All countries need to realize that the old, carbon-burning model of development is fast becoming a relic of the past - and embrace a cleaner, greener future.UN Nigeria hopes that COP26 will rekindle hope in multilateralism by keeping its climate promise to the Global South. The developed world must urgently meet its commitment of at least $100 billion in annual climate finance for developing countries.But all countries need to contribute to humanity's greatest challenge including Nigeria.We greatly welcome President Buhari's commitment at COP26 to restore 100 million hectares of degraded land across Africa. This would be a huge step in the right direction for the Great Green Wall climate-adaptation initiative across the Sahel.The Food and Agricultural Organisation, FAO is excited to deepen its partnership with the government as it addresses desertification in the northern states for this initiative. It has already carried out 2,240 Ha of dryland restoration activities across 15 communities through the planting of native woody and herbaceous fodder species.In addition, we call on the Government of Nigeria to fulfill its obligations under the Paris Agreement which it ratified in 2017. This is the world's blueprint for climate success.The UN supports the Climate Change Bill which was passed by the Senate last month and by the House of Representatives in July. We hope President Buhari will expeditiously assent to the Bill's passage. This Bill will ensure the prompt implementation of key provisions of the Paris Agreement.Furthermore, we urge Nigeria to continue on the path outl"

But why could it be our last chance?COP26?To be concise, COP26 is the biggest and most important climate-related conference on the planet. In 1992, the UN organised a major event in Rio de Janeiro called the Earth Summit, in which the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted.In this treaty, nations agreed to ""stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere"" to prevent dangerous interference from human activity on the climate system.\\xa0Today, the treaty has 197 signatories.COP26.So, here's where COP26 gets interesting: at the conference, among other issues,\\xa0delegates were aiming to finalise the 'Paris Rulebook',\\xa0or the rules needed to implement the Agreement.

""This is our collective moment in history, this is our chance to forge a cleaner, healthier and more prosperous world, and this is our time to deliver on the high ambition set by our leaders at the start of the summit, we must rise to the occasion"", he said during an informal plenary to update delegates.He reported that ministers had worked late into the night to discuss finance and ""loss and damage"", and that it was still his ""sincere intention"" to get a final agreement over the l"
"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria13","COP26: African activists seek actions, not words from global leaders","November 6, 2021 Saturday","Premium Times","Nigeria, Nov. 6 -- As deliberations continue at the ongoing United Nations Climate Change Conference, otherwise known as COP26, young African climate activists and campaigners have called on leaders of developed countries to take action and not let this year's gathering become a mere talk show.Africa has been identified as one of the vulnerable spots of climate change and according to a recent World Bank's new Groundswell Africa report, the continent will be hit the hardest, with up to 86 million Africans migrating within their own countries by 2050.Following the evidence of vulnerabilities from the continent, the young African voices on climate change urged world leaders to listen to them and secure their future.Voices Adenike Oladosu, a Nigerian climate activist, eco-feminist, and the initiator of the Fridays For Future movement in Nigeria, said she will like to see African leaders place their people over politics or profit and speak the truth to the developed countries.She said the commitment of $100 billion climate finance to support developing countries towards cutting carbon emissions, and to minimise the impact of climate change and adapt developing economies to deal with its impact must be seen to be achieved.She said: ""It will be an injustice to us in Africa if Article 6 of the Paris agreement that has to do with counting, transparency, and accountability in order to reduce emissions (especially to the largest polluters) is not completed at the course of this conference.""Ms Adenike said any commitments taken in COP26 by leaders should not remain at the conference. Such commitments should become a reality back home post COP26 in order to close the gap between actions and words.Adding his voice, Nyombi Morris, a Ugandan climate activist, expects that this year's COP26 is seen as a do or die matter.""In August the world was attacked by climate change impacts, some saw it as news but we activists and scientists have been warning the people about this before now.""Mr Nyombi said today's destruction and human suffering has been fueled by companies from the global north who compromise African leaders with money in the name of investment and development.""Yes we know that we are underdeveloped but these people are finishing our natural resources in gold mining, coal, copper, and iron.""It's time for climate action. African leaders who have been invited to COP26 should make sure all their negotiation is in favour of their citizens who are at the receiving end of climate disasters,"" he said, adding that; ""We need to set up structures that are going to support those communities which are already struggling with climate change impacts.""Speaking on the intersection between climate change and gender and the need for prioritisation of gender issues at , Fatou Jeng, a climate activist from The Gambia, said; ""Gender is a cross-cutting issue due to how women and girls continue to be one of the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. As such, I expect our COP26 negotiations to put climate justice in the heart of our negotiations because there is no climate justice without gender justice and social justice.""Ms Jeng is the policy operations co-lead on gender and climate change of the UNFCCC Youth Constituency.Africa's sad realityAccording to Ousmane Diagana, World Bank Vice President for Western and Central Africa, the Groundswell report identifies priorities for climate action that can help countries move towards a green, resilient and inclusive development and generate opportunities for all African people.""From pastoralists traveling to the Sahel to fishermen braving the seas, the story of West Africa is a story of climate migrants. As countries are experiencing rises in temperatures, erratic rainfall, flooding, and coastal erosion, Africans will face unprecedented challenges in the coming years,"" Mr Diagana said.Across Africa, many countries are battling sea-level rise which is threatening their coastal regions, a key source of revenue.In West Africa, coastal areas host about one-third of the region's population and generate 56 per cent of its GDP but this region loses about $3.8 billion yearly due to coastal zone degradation.Several other countries are plagued by variable rainfall patterns that affect crop yield and agricultural productivity, also fuelling drought and the consequent conflict that arise as a result of resource clashes.Most African countries still rely heavily on rain-fed agriculture. Disruption in rainfall patterns leading to drought or flooding, therefore, have significant impacts on agriculture and food security in respective countries.Exposure to climate shocks and their lack of adaptive ability makes African countries very vulnerable to climate change.Almost all sectors are vulnerable to climate change. Extreme heat has dire impacts on health and morbidity while rising flooding increases the risk of waterborne disease. Climate shocks often affect the economy too as well as the livelihood of the people at the grassroots who mostly suffer from these challenges.Meanwhile, as negotiations and climate talks advance in the next couple of days, ONE Campaign has pledged to remain on ground to further escalate the voice of young people.Akintunde is a climate activist from Nigeria based in the United Kingdom.

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria19","EXPLAINER: What is COP26 and why is it on the lips of everyone?","October 29, 2021 Friday","Premium Times","Nigeria, Oct. 29 -- If you have been following the news in the past weeks, you would have come across at least one post or news item about #COP26.In June 1992, representatives from 172 countries gathered in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), commonly called the Earth Summit. The Earth Summit was an unprecedented meeting of representatives, including 108 heads of state, 2,400 representatives from various non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and nearly 10,000 journalists. An additional 17,000 NGO representatives attended a parallel NGO forum that provided recommendations to the Earth Summit.At the summit, the countries signed a treaty promising to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere and prevent dangerous changes to the climate. Almost every year since then, the parties to this agreement have met to talk about what still needs to be done. It is called a Conference of Parties, or COP. This is the 26th such meeting. So, COP26. is the next annual UN climate change conference. It stands for Conference of the Parties, and the summit will be attended by the countries that signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) - a treaty that came into force in 1994.At COP, Global leaders will lay out their plans on how to hit those 1.5 degrees Celsius targets in the Paris Agreement. is viewed as important because it will set the strategy for closing out the 2020-2030 decade. This year, there is only one basic goal - moblising efforts to deliver on pledges made at COP21 in Paris six years ago. Countries committed to cooperatively reducing greenhouse emissions to keep the earth from warming more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels under the Paris Agreement. Poorer countries have also been offered huge sums of money to assist them cope with climate change and cut their own greenhouse gas emissions.COP26 offers an opportunity for all countries to reflect on the journey so far and how well they have achieved their previous commitments and way forward on how to take forward their long-term goals.Unfortunately, previous commitments laid out in Paris did not come close to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees - meaning the years approaching 2030 will be crucial. It is expected that with COP26, countries will be more intentional in keeping the hope of holding temperature rises to 1.5 alive.This year, the UN Climate Change Conference COP 26 will be held in Glasgow, United Kingdom from October 31 to November 12, 2021.With the UK now being president of COP, it meant that one of the country's many cities would play host to the grand affair, which will see world leaders arrive in Scotland alongside tens of thousands of negotiators, government representatives, businesses, and citizens for twelve days of talks. Though London is the capital of the UK, Glasgow has long been considered one of the foremost locations for cultural events. According to Glasgow City Council, 'Glasgow was chosen by the UK to host COP26 due to its experience in hosting world-class events, commitment to sustainability, and first-rate facilities.'Also, the Scottish city was recently awarded the status of Global Green City and has a target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2030 - making it the best choice.COP is the decision-making body responsible for monitoring and reviewing the implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, whose objective is to ""stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.""COP26 is a credibility test for global efforts to address climate change and it is where Parties must make considerable progress to reach a consensus on issues they have been discussing for several years. COP26 comes against the background of widespread, rapid, and intensifying climate change impacts, which are already impacting every region on Earth. Also, COP26 comes against the background of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the urgent need to build back better for present future generations to ensure a safe future.The meeting will comprise the twenty-sixth session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 26), the sixteenth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP 16), and the third session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA 3). Most countries will set out their plans to reduce emissions before the summit starts - that way, the world is able to review the seriousness of the parties.1. Secure global net-zero by mid-century and keep 1.5 degrees within reachCountries are being asked to come forward with ambitious 2030 emissions reductions targets that align with reaching net zero by the middle of the century.To deliver on these stretching targets, countries will need to:2. Adapt to protect communities and natural habitatsThe climate is already changing and it will continue to change even as we reduce emissions, with devastating effects.At COP263. Mobilise financeTo deliver on the first two goals, developed countries must make good on their promise to mobilise at least $100 billion in climate finance per year by 2020.International financial institutions must play their part and work towards unleashing the trillions in private and public sector finance required to secure global net zero.4. Work together to deliver is a collaborative effort and all parties must rise to the challenges of the climate crisis by working together.At COP26As the day gets closer, the world is waiting to see how successful COP26 will be and this is largely dependent on the actions that will follow all statements to be made by world leaders in their commitment to net zero emissions by 2050 - as well as big reductions by 2030. Specific pledges on ending coal, petrol cars, and protecting nature are also expected. A financial package to compensate developing countries who are at the receiving end of climate change disasters will also point to a successful COP amongst other things.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Premium Times.

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria21","COP26 deal disappointing, say world leaders, activists","The Nation (Nigeria)"," ","Many world leaders and activists have expressed disappointment this weekend with the climate deal that emerged from two weeks of heated negotiations in Glasgow, Scotland.They warned that countries will have to strengthen their commitments if they want to avert disastrous consequences and help at-risk nations cope with the damage that's already occurring from climate change.Key officials in the United States and Europe vowed to work harder to help developing nations shift to cleaner energy sources, after delegates from China and India proposed a last-minute edit that weakened a provision in the text to phase out fossil fuels.The paragraph initially called for the 'phase out' of unabated coal and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, but the final agreement refers only to a 'phase-down'.European Union (EU) Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement that while some meaningful progress was made on the goals of COP26, more work remains and that the key to determining the impact of the conference will be how the commitments secured in Glasgow are actually implemented.'1.5 degrees Celsius remains within reach; but the work is far from done,' she said, referring to a long-standing global goal of limiting warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels.As part of the pact agreed upon in Glasgow, countries face pressure to reassess their targets to cut emissions by the end of next year and to provide more aid to nations bearing the brunt of climate change. But these voluntary measures do not put the world on track to limit earth's warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, a central goal of the 2015 Paris accord.'We're all well aware that, collectively, our climate ambition and action to date have fallen short on the promises made in Paris,' said Alok Sharma, the British minister of state and president of the Glasgow talks, who appeared emotional Saturday after the last-minute change to the fossil fuels provision.Also, United Nations Secretary General Ant\'f3nio Guterres, in a video after the agreement won approval from nearly 200 nations, said: 'Secretary-General said: 'The approved texts are a compromise. They reflect the interests, the conditions, the contradictions and the state of political will in the world today.'They take important steps, but unfortunately the collective political will was not enough to overcome some deep contradictions.'We must end fossil fuel subsidies, phase out coal, put a price on carbon, protect vulnerable communities from the impacts of climate change and make good on the $100 billion climate finance commitment to support developing countries.'We did not achieve these goals at this conference, but we have some building blocks for progress.'The United States, which took on a position of leadership at COP26 after four years of near-absence in the global climate conversation under President Donald Trump, celebrated the Glasgow climate pact but called for more action.'The text sets out a path to increase the commitments and actions of countries starting next year, outl"

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria25","Cultural Survival: At COP26, Global Leaders Didn't Act on the Urgency of Climate Crisis","November 24, 2021 Wednesday","News Chronicle (Nigeria)","Cultural Survival, a global group that advocates for Indigenous Peoples' rights and supports Indigenous communities' self-determination, cultures and political resilience, since 1972,\\xa0has reflected on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of Parties (COP 26)\\xa0that took place in Glasgow, Scotland from October 31 to November 12, 2021.As it reflected on the\\xa0outcomes of COP26, it didn't help but feel that despite the tremendous efforts brought forth by Indigenous Peoples and its delegations from across the world, global leaders failed to act on the urgency of the climate crisis.According to them, ''global leaders failed to empathize with what we, as Indigenous Peoples, experience on a daily basis\- the direct impacts and catastrophes of climate change.\\xa0If the climate crisis is to be abated, and if we are to reach the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 \'b0C, the global community must wake up and acknowledge climate change is an urgent matter that requires true commitment and changed behaviors now.''This year, Indigenous Peoples represented the second-largest civil society delegation in attendance at COP26, second only to oil and gas lobbyists which accounted for 500+ delegates. The general feeling towards COP26 is best captured by Cultural Survival's Lead on Brazil and COP26 delegate, Edson Krenak (Krenak), ""COP26 brought us many disappointments. As always, Indigenous Peoples, as guardians of the land did not sit at the table where negotiations and decisions were made. States continue, together with corporations, to try to save the economy, capital, the money machine that is capitalism or colonialism \- in this context, it is only these terms that are interchangeable, and they are not working to save the planet!""Nevertheless, they are resilient and adaptive peoples, and they will continue to do their part in holding their sacred responsibilities towards Mother Earth. As always, it is a pleasure to commune and gather with their Indigenous relatives from around the world and this gives them renewed hope.Again, in Edson Krenak's words, ""I realised that it is not just a colonial past and a condition of vulnerability that unites and defines us, but our ancestral pedagogy: we all learn by listening to the voice of the other species!''During this time, Indigenous Peoples from many parts of the world gathered at the\\xa0International Indigenous Peoples' Forum on Climate Change (IIPFCC) or Indigenous People's Caucus\\xa0to discuss and agree that our territories need to be protected, that our rights, the rights of fish, birds, animals, rivers, trees, and all other relatives of Mother Earth need to be respected.""This article hopes to analyse and reflect on the occurrences of COP26, its accomplishments and deficiencies, particularly where it relates to Indigenous Peoples' rights.Increased Participation of Indigenous PeoplesEven though Indigenous Peoples were not at the helm of the decision-making machine, we were successful in lobbying and engaging with governments, and partners which allowed us to voice our concerns regarding climate issues in our communities.\\xa0 This allowed us to influence policies related to issues that will have a direct impact on our communities.They also reaffirmed and strengthened their resolve to continue to make their voices in these international spaces heard and continue to push for the recognition of human rights and the protection of Indigenous Peoples'\\xa0rights. As previously noted, the IIPFCC was the second-largest delegation at COP26 next to the oil and gas lobbyists. This in and of itself is a major accomplishment for Indigenous Peoples around the world.Graeme Reed\\xa0(Anishinabee), Co-Chair of the IIPFCC spoke about the activities of the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform (LCIPP), which was established at COP24 in 2018 in Katowice, Poland, along with the creation of a newly constituted body, the Facilitated Working Group, which has seven Indigenous representatives that are self-selected from the seven UN socio-cultural regions and seven states, ""At COP26, we had the first-ever annual Knowledge Keepers Gathering. Twenty-eight knowledge keepers from around the world organized within those seven UN socio-cultural regions and we were able to actually have our own meeting that allowed us to create our own space.''This is the first time ever that we've had a meeting within the parameters of the Blue Zone, which is the UNFCCC-controlled framework that explicitly asked States to stay out. For me, that's just an indication of our ability and our growing ability to create space for Indigenous Peoples within these systems.""Graeme Reed also commented on a few achievements, the adoption of the work plan (2022-2025) of the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform and securing one seat to represent Indigenous Peoples in the Climate Technology Centre and Network Advisory Body, the ""first successful outcome was the adoption of the second three-year work plan of the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples' Platform, which was co-constructed by the Facilitative Working Group which is represented by Indigenous Peoples and States on a consensus basis.''We got acceptance of that work plan to continue for another three years and prospectively open up additional space for those sorts of annual knowledge holder gatherings. We also landed a decision on the Climate Technology Center and Networks Advisory Body. For a while, Indigenous Peoples have been advocating to have one seat, even if one seat is insufficient, one seat [is] to represent Indigenous knowledge, science, and perspective on that climate technology network.""Adoption of the Glasgow Climate Pact\\xa0Another pivotal accomplishment coming out of COP26The Paris Agreement set global warming limits ""well below 2\'b0 Celsius,"" however, the Glasgow Pact aims to set global warming limits to 1.5 degrees Celsius. It recognizes the fact that there is no safe limit for global warming.This is a fact that hopefully will resound globally and, have an impact on our carbon footprints.\\xa0 Numerous other Declarationsreached at COP26 also aimed to reduce emissions, with the hope of maintaining the target of global warming at\\xa0 1.5 \'b0C.However, the general consensus is that it is not enough. For instance, it remains to be seen what impact coal mining, petroleum, and natural gas collection and the continuation thereof will have on the proposed targets.\\xa0 Last minute in the negotiations of the Glasgow Pact, India was able to get language included in the Pact that references a ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" of coal mining.This reinforces the criticism that COP26 did not act on the urgency of the climate change crisis. This undoubtedly will have a direct impact on the global community's ability to keep 1.5 \'b0C alive.\\xa0 The chief organizer of COP26, Alok Sharma, described the Glasgow Pact as ""a fragile win,"" affirming the general feeling that not enough is being done in respect of the climate change crisis.Cultural Survival's Director of Strategic Partnerships and Communications and COP26 delegate, Daisee Francour (Oneida) shares, ""while member states at did not make the necessary commitments to truly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the Glasgow Climate Pact was the first climate deal to reduce coal, a leading contributor to climate change.''While more than 40 countries have committed to phasing out coal, in our own communities, we must leverage this small commitment to push our local and national governments to go beyond this phase-out. This means continuing to apply pressure on these governments to work towards a true, just transition, which actually addresses climate, economic, and social justice.''We cannot afford to take any steps backwards as we collectively dream and co-create a new, green economy. We must center Indigenous leadership, rights, and Free, Prior and Informed Consent as we build new systems, infrastructure, and materials to build a more sustainable future.""In addition to numerous member states committing phase out of coal, some of the leading coal-dependent countries like the United States, Australia, India, and China did not commit to the phase out. Additionally,\\xa0major international banks also committed to effectively end all international public financing of new unabated coal power by the end of 2021.Member states such as Denmark, Canada, Italy, and the United States along with other public finance institutions created a joint statement that commits to ending international public support for the unabated fossil fuel energy sector by the end of 2022.Inclusion of Human Rights Language in Article 6 was Article 6 of the Paris Agreement as it was one of the unresolved issues at\\xa0\\xa0COP21 held in Paris in 2015\\xa0when the Paris Agreement was signed. Therefore, the decision reached at COP26 in respect of Article 6 has been six years in the making.Article 6 serves as the rulebook on CO2 emissions, it is an accounting mechanism on how CO2 emissions are going to be calculated or accounted for. It sets out the rules for the use of Carbon Markets, Emissions Reduction, and National Climate Action Plans. Article 6 refers to a system of carbon trading that will allow big polluters to continue polluting.""Cultural Survival's stance on Article 6 is that we do not believe in carbon market mechanisms as a climate change solution. We think they should be scrapped altogether. In the context of COP26 negotiations, these market mechanisms were disguised as nature-based solutions. Nevertheless, the IIPFCC decided to act within the proposed framework and push for the inclusion of references to human rights and Indigenous Peoples' rights throughout the text of Article 6. The final text mentions the need to respect Indigenous Peoples' rights but does not mention the need to obtain our Free, Prior and Informed Consent"", says Galina Angarova (Buryat), Cultural Survival Executive Director.While the lobbying efforts of the IIPFCC resulted in getting language for the recognition of human rights and Indigenous rights in several provisions of this Article 6, as now evidenced in the\\xa0Glasgow Climate Pact, the inclusive language could best be described as vague or general, lacking the vigor we hoped for. Unfortunately, other proposals made by the IIPFCC were not included.The\\xa0International Indigenous Peoples' Forum on Climate Change described their consternation, ""[w]e welcome the inclusion of the rights of Indigenous Peoples in some provisions of Article 6. However, we wanted to see an independent grievance mechanism, not a process in Article 6.4. We are also dismayed at the exclusion of our rights in activity design and implementation.In particular, the consultation provision in 6.4 is inadequate. It needs to include applicable international standards and ensure compliance with the rights of Indigenous Peoples to Free, Prior and Informed Consent.""Another area of concern to many at COP26, including Indigenous Peoples and developing countries, is in the area of loss and damage caused by climate change effects.\\xa0 What came out of the Paris Agreement was the creation of a finance facility that would provide assistance to developing countries facing environmental degradation resulting from climate change effects, i.e. loss and damage.Therefore, the expansion of this loss and damage finance facility was a major agenda for developing countries at . They pushed hard and hoped for a decision, in the new Glasgow Pact, seeking the expansion of the loss and damage finance facility. Unfortunately, their efforts were unsuccessful, as developed countries vetoed their attempts at expansion.Nonetheless, the Glasgow Pact acknowledges existing loss and damage already caused by the impact of climate change and that this will only increase and pose greater threats to societies, economies, and the environment. Also notable is paragraph 62 of the Glasgow Pact, which\\xa0 ""acknowledges the important role of a broad range of stakeholders at the local, national and regional level, including Indigenous Peoples and local communities, in averting, minimizing and addressing loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change.""However, major criticisms regarding the decision in the area of loss and damage are that it failed to set aside new funding for developing countries much less to Indigenous communities, despite the fact that they face more direct negative effects of climate change. As previously noted, there was major push back from developed countries related to the expansion of funding from entering the Glasgow Pact.For many, this is disappointing as developed countries seem to continually skirt their pledges and obligations, particularly, in light of the fact that their promise to provide $100 billion per year to fight climate change still has not been fulfilled. ""It is a well known fact that the carbon footprints of Indigenous Peoples and some small developing countries are minimal in comparison to those of developed countries.\\xa0 Developed countries are the worst polluters of Mother Nature, however, they get to skirt their obligations, while Indigenous Peoples get to bear the brunt of these bad decisions. This is unfair to say the least"", says Monica Magnusson (Q'eqchi Maya), Director of Advocacy and Policy at Cultural Survival.Funding and access to it were at the heart of COP26 discussions.\\xa0 For instance, a pledge of $19.2 billion was endorsed by world leaders at COP26 for the protection of forests and to end deforestation. Additionally,\\xa0recognizing the invaluable role that Indigenous Peoples play in climate change solutions and mitigation, several philanthropic organisations pledged funding in the amount of $1.7 billion dollars, to fund the efforts of Indigenous Peoples in their fight against climate change.Of this, the IIPFCC said, ''we appreciate the commitment of $1.7 billion to protect forests and land led by Indigenous Peoples and look forward to designing our own inclusive mechanisms that will benefit all socio-cultural regions It is essential that Indigenous Peoples have direct access to finance, rather than systems that route funding through intermediary organizations that are completely inaccessible and unreliable.''Dedicated climate financing for Indigenous Peoples could provide support for us to maintain, restore and enhance our knowledge and practices that care for the Earth, to promote Indigenous food sovereignty, create an appropriate structure for loss and damage to compensate Indigenous Peoples, and advance the rights of Indigenous women and persons with disabilities within the climate agenda.""Indigenous Peoples welcome these funding pledges, and support from partners who see and recognize the invaluable role that Indigenous Peoples play in safeguarding our planet.\\xa0 It is, however, our hope that they will create or refine existing funding mechanisms that are directly accessible to Indigenous Peoples and will directly reach local communities at the forefront of climate change so that they can continue to sustainably manage forests, lands, and territories for the benefit of all.Adoption of the Just Transition DeclarationPerhaps recognizing that the decision reached in the Glasgow Pact about limiting emissions, is nowhere close to meeting proposed targets, several declarations came out of aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.One of particular interest is the\\xa0Just Transition Declaration, which recognizes the need to include everyone, especially the vulnerable, in the transition to net zero emissions and environmentally sustainable economy. The preamble to the Declaration, acknowledges that vulnerable groups are most affected by climate change effects including those living in poverty, workers in carbon intensive industry and production.It also notes that climate change mitigation and adaptation must be inclusive and must benefit the most vulnerable by distributing resources equitably and ensuring economic and political empowerment, among other things.\\xa0 The Declaration stated,\\xa0"" a commitment to gender equality,\\xa0racial equality\\xa0and\\xa0social cohesion;\\xa0protection of the rights of Indigenous Peoples;\\xa0disability inclusion;\\xa0intergenerational equity\\xa0and young people;\\xa0the promotion of\\xa0\\xa0women\\xa0and\\xa0girls;\\xa0marginalised\\xa0persons'\\xa0leadership and\\xa0involvement in\\xa0decision-making;\\xa0and recognition of the value\\xa0of\\xa0their knowledge and leadership;\\xa0and\\xa0support\\xa0for\\xa0the collective climate action of diverse social groups.\\xa0Social dialogue as well as rights at work are indispensable building blocks of sustainable development and must be at the centre of policies for strong,\\xa0sustainable,\\xa0and inclusive growth and development.""The Declaration also acknowledges the need for safeguards in existing and new supply chains, and the importance of creating decent work for all, such as the most vulnerable. It recognizes the need to respect human rights and the need to promote social dialogue and engagement between all those who will be affected by the transition to green economies, such as governments, employers, and workers.

The President had at the summit announced that Nigeria was targeting the provision of solar power to 5 million homes in Nigeria by 2030.While commending the idea, PUTTRU's founder and chief executive officer, Monica Maduekwe however said the fast-growing population of the country would make the commendable projections insignificant. Citing forecasts based on World Bank data, Maduekwe said Nigeria's population in 2030 will be around 260 million. ""While grid electricity provides a more cost-effective option for electrification, in some cases, decentralised energy solutions are the best options to reach remote communities, especially those communities with low population density and other factors that could make grid extension a more costly electrification option in the short term.\~ However, this target from the Nigerian government if reached by 2030, as the government has set, will not change the energy access situation in Nigeria by 2030. This is mainly due to the population growth in Nigeria.\~ Using World Bank's data, by 2030 Nigeria's population will grow to approximately 260 million people from 206 million today.

The proposal was killed by Russia, Australia, and Saudi Arabia, the countries mounting a full-throated defence for oil at the conference.Hosted by the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), ADIPEC is the world's most influential meeting place where oil, gas and energy companies and professionals engage and identify the opportunities that will unlock new value in the energy landscape.Unlike in Glasgow, at ADIPEC, the industry's largest gathering has no place for climate campaigners and anti-fossil fuel advocates. It was a gathering where some of the biggest oil producers announced big plans for new oil fields.Sultan al-Jaber, CEO, Abu Dhabi National Oil Co, in his opening address said some $600 billion would need to be spent by the oil industry every year through 2030 just to keep up with expected consumption levels.Read Also: ""post-titleOil price falls after petrol stocks drop more than expected""After almost a decade of under-investment in our industry, the world has sleep-walked into a supply crunch. It is time to wake up,"" Jaber said. ""Yes, renewable energy is the fastest growing segment of the energy mix, but oil and gas is still the biggest and will be for decades to come. In short, the future is coming, but it is not here yet.""Al-Jaber also represented the UAE at the COP26 talks as the country's special envoy for climate change. The UAE will also host the 28th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP28) to the UNFCCC.On his part, Hardeep Singh Puri, the Indian oil minister, said his country, one of the world's major drivers for demand, was in great need of affordable energy, largely in the form of fossil fuels.t COP26 They ended up with 'Phase down' of coal.Mele Kyari, NNPC group managing director, in an interview at ADIPEC, was full of praise for Nigeria's new regulation that had brought fiscal and regulatory clarity and which was now driving financing towards new oil and gas investments in the deep-water space.""Our partners are coming in to invest particularly in the deep water, and efforts are going on to bring out all the production we have lost,"" said Kyari.On energy transition, he said the challenge was raising financing to improve gas production and consumption. Nigeria considers gas as its transition fuel and has released a swath of new policies designed to encourage investment into gas.At , Nigeria committed to reaching net-zero emissions by 2016 partly based on the condition that rich countries will meet their requirement to contribute $100 billion yearly to help vulnerable countries including Nigeria, finance the mitigation of climate change impacts.Rich nations agreed to ramp up financial support for developing nations but failed to create an adaptation fund for this purpose contrary to the expectation of developing nations.""The transition will have to be managed in a pragmatic way,"" Puri said in his remarks to ADIPEC. ""The transition will need to take into account the precise requirements on how it affects the larger consuming countries.""India has pledged to bring its carbon emissions down to net zero by 2070, while Saudi Arabia says it would do the same by 2060 and the UAE by 2050, even as both oil producers are spending billions on expanding their crude output capacity.Oil producers at COP events are quick to rehash their climate commitments and pledges to invest more in renewables but when the rubber hits the road, they queue behind fossil fuels.The same is true of international oil companies who were denied the opportunity to make speeches at COP26. Their acknowledgement that climate change presents existential threat to humanity has done little to dent their thirst for crude.Nicolas Terraz, president of oil major TotalEnergies, said that due to natural reservoir depletion, the industry has to find some 4 million per day of new production capacity annually just to serve a 100 million per day market that is expected to rise along with the world population.Estimates of peak oil demand vary from the 2030s to the 2050s and beyond, but no matter the scenario, ""we need a lot of investment to meet that demand because of that [natural production] decl"

The Call to Action encourages governments to deploy a range of policies such as product standards, labels and incentives to raise the efficiency of high-energy consuming products.It focuses in particular on four key products lighting, refrigerators, air conditioners and industrial motor systems which together account for over 40 percent of global electricity demand and over 5 billion tonnes of global CO2 emissions per year.

Like the citizens of most developing countries, Ghanaians are increasingly affected by climate change, despite bearing little responsibility for the emissions that are causing it.At the COP26The wealthiest countries that have polluted the most should hold the primary responsibility for tackling climate change, both in cutting their emissions first and fastest, and in providing climate finance and support to countries like Ghana. Ghana's President Nana Akufo-Addo emphasised this responsibility during COP26 when he called for a fair and equitable solution that ""recognises the historical imbalances between the high emitters and low emitters.""To date, however, wealthy countries have under-promised and underdelivered. They have yet to reduce emissions to the extent necessary to avoid warming beyond 2degC, let alone 1.5degC.

Nigeria is committed to net zero by 2060.''While making a case for the gas-based energy transition in Nigeria, President Buhari requested international partners to finance projects using transition fuels such as gas in Nigeria.''Parties to the Paris Agreement are expected to transit from fossil fuel to clean energy and reach a Net Zero ambition for greenhouse gases emission.''Nigeria is actually more of a gas than an oil-producing country.''Consequently, I am requesting for the financing of projects using transition fuels, such as gas.''Nigeria has energy challenges for which, we believe, gas can be used to balance a renewable energy-based system, be it wind or sun.''This would enable us to launch the long-term renewable energy infrastructure procurements and investments needed to have a sustainable energy supply,' he added.Stanbic AdvertWhile acknowledging that net-zero ambition can lead to economic transformation across all sectors, the Nigerian leader said it would require critical infrastructure to be in place.President Buhari also told the COP26 Leaders' Summit that Nigeria has developed a detailed energy transition plan and roadmap based on data and evidence.He explained that the plan had highlighted some key facts that forces the difficult conversations.''Our transition plan also highlights the key role that gas will play in transitioning our economy across sectors, and the data and evidence shows that Nigeria can continue to use gas until 2040 without detracting from the goals of the Paris Agreement.''Gas will be key for addressing the clean cooking challenge, which is also a challenge of deforestation, and for giving our electric grid the stability and flexibility to integrate renewables at scale.'Nigeria will need to integrate an unprecedented 7GW additional renewable capacity each year to achieve net-zero,'' he said.On energy access, President Buhari declared that Nigeria's commitment to a just transition is reflected in ''our ambitious Energy Compact, which includes the Government's flagship project to electrify five million households and 25 million people using decentralized solar energy solutions.''He described the project as a major first step towards closing the energy access deficit in the country by 2030.On green projects in the county, the president declared that Federal Government agencies had been directed to ensure the inclusion of projects with Climate Change credentials in the budget.''I am happy to state that the 2022 budget, which I recently submitted to our National Assembly, is the first cross-sectoral, gender and climate-responsive budget ever prepared in the annals of our history,' he further maintained.The President announced that the National Assembly had also passed the Climate Change Bill.According to him, the bill provides a framework for achieving low greenhouse gas emissions, inclusive green growth and sustainable economic development.President Buhari concluded his address with a note of caution, saying:''The outcome of this Conference must result in quick resolution of all outstanding issues pertaining to the finalisation of the Paris Agreement Rulebook, Adaptation, Mitigation, Finance, Article 6 and Loss and Damage.''

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria47","COP26 - Racing Against Time!","November 02, 2021","This Day (Lagos)","Emmanuel Addeh writes that as nations of the world converge on Glasgow, United Kingdom, to discuss the future of the planet, a lot is at stake.From last Sunday, world leaders began to troop into Glasgow to find solutions to the damage inflicted by the impact of carbon emissions on the atmosphere.The conference, an annual meeting to discuss how to tackle climate change, first took place in 1994, but with the very popular Paris Agreement made at COP21 where 196 countries agreed to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius or 1.5 degrees, compared to pre-industrial levels.In basic terms, pre-industrial levels means the state of the earth before the industrial revolution, which led to the birth of factories and mechanisation, starting in Britain in the mid-1700s. At the COP26, the 26th in the series, nations will review the progress made and share their plans for cutting emissions as they make commitments in a race against time, to rescue the earth from being consumed by man's indiscretion.COP stands for Conference of Parties and is a meeting of all the countries that are signatories to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which came into force in 1994. Experts say that some impacts of climate change are already upon the world in the form of extreme weather events, but how to protect and restore ecosystems, build defences, put warning systems in place and make infrastructure and agriculture more resilient to avoid loss of homes, livelihoods and lives would be the focus of the two-week meeting.But there is a big gap between commitment and action. Many nations, including Nigeria, have made pledges to the reduction of greenhouse gases by 2030, however the problem is that beyond the paperwork , there's little to show for it.Representatives from more than 190 countries including world leaders and tens of thousands of negotiators are expected to attend, along with observer organisations, while 30,000 experts and decision-makers will take part in panels, discussions and events.This year's edition could is even more defining as COVID-19 has refocused priorities and caused individuals and governments alike to pay closer attention to the environment, with many countries looking to rebuild their economies on 'building back better' through a green recovery.Secondly, COP26Humanity's last chance?Many experts on the environment have described COP26 as humanity's last chance against climate change. Indeed, it has been said that actual actions do not even come close to achieving the target of limiting global warming to at least below 2 degrees Celsius.At the 2015 Paris Climate deal, nations were given the freehand to embark on Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), which have been deemed to have been inadequate for the achieving the ambitious goal set thereafter.The Paris Agreement also mandated that wealthier countries would extend finance and knowhow to help poor, vulnerable countries tackle climate change as they race towards 'Net Zero' emissions, a situation where the amount of greenhouse gasses produced is the same as the amount that is removed from the atmosphere.COP26 will further give world leaders the opportunity to embark on the five-yearly review of the NDCs submitted by the countries in 2015, although a UN report published earlier this week found updated NDCs put the world on track for a dangerous global temperature rise of at least 2.7 degrees Celsius by the end of the century-even if plans were fully met.Fossil fuels as the big elephantSo, when people talk about cutting greenhouse gases, they are essentially talking about reducing consumption of hydrocarbons, which many countries still depend upon to power their economies.According to the organisers, the key element of the summit's agenda involves getting countries to ""come forward with ambitious 2030 emissions reductions targets (NDCs) that align with reaching net zero by the middle of the century"".To that end, it says, they ""will need to accelerate the phase-out of coal, encourage investment in renewables, curtail deforestation and speed up the switch to electric vehicles"".But the issues are not so straightforward. Many countries are still at different levels of development. There is no one-size-fits-all solution. The anger against the big fossil fuel companies also seem unjustified.While they played a large part in creating the climate crisis, they also helped build economies and boosted industrialisation.In fact, the disdain is so palpable this year that unlike at previous climate summits, the organisers of COP26 in Glasgow didn't give fossil fuel companies a formal role in the talks, a move that climate activists have interpreted as a reprimand for the companies' lack of clear action to end their planet-warming emissions.But the oil industry will continue to wield huge influence as far as the world needs to be powered, as scientists believe burning fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and gas, remain the chief driver of the climate emergency.Coal, however, is the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel in terms of emissions and therefore the most important target for replacement in the pivot to renewable alternatives.Today, China remains the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, but has pledged to peak emissions before 2030, reduce carbon intensity by 65 per cent below 2005 levels, increase installed capacity of wind and solar energy by 1,200 GW, and increase forest stock by 6 million cubic meters.India, the third-largest emitter, has also made three promises: To reduce emissions intensity economy-wide by 33 to 35 per cent below 2005 levels, to generate 40 per cent of electricity from renewable energy sources, and to create a carbon sink capable of absorbing 2.5 to 3 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide.Contentious areasMajor areas of contention will include climate finance and net zero emissions targets. Eleven years ago, at the 15th COP, it was decided that developed countries would deliver $100 billion to developing countries by 2020 to help manage climate mitigation and adaptation since lower-income countries will likely face the brunt of climate change.However, developed countries have so far failed to live up to their promises, and are unlikely to cough out the sum of $100 billion before 2023-three years after the original deadl"

Nigeria was represented by the Minister of State for the Environment, Ms Sharon Ikeazor, and the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Dr Mahmood Abubakar.Alongside the events marking Nature and Land Use Day, Saturday marked the end of week one of COP26, with negotiations gathering pace and work focussing on week two. Twenty-six nations set out new commitments to change their agricultural policies to become more sustainable and less polluting, and to invest in the science needed for sustainable agriculture and for protecting food supplies against climate change, laid out in two 'Action Agendas'. All continents were represented, with countries including Nigeria, India, Colombia, Vietnam, Germany, Ghana, and Australia.Examples of national commitments aligned with this agenda include:Germany's plans to lower emissions from land use by 25m tonnes by 2030.The UK aims to engage 75% of farmers in low carbon practices by 2030.The UK also announced funding of \£3500m to support the implementation of the Forest, Agriculture and Commodity Trade (FACT) Roadmap that was launched during the World Leaders Summit earlier this week, in which 28 countries, including Nigeria, are working together to protect forests while promoting development and trade. A further \£365 million will support a 'Just Rural Transition' to help developing countries shift policies and practices to more sustainable agriculture and food production. Commitments made by countries will help to implement the Glasgow Leaders' Declaration on Forests and Land Use which is now endorsed by 134 countries, including Nigeria, covering 91% of the world's forests. The declaration aims to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030.

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria49","COP26: Can we avert climate catastrophe?","October 27, 2021 Wednesday","The Punch","Greg Odogwu Published 28 October 2021It is known as a two-in-one COP because the COVID-19 pandemic did not allow it to take place last year. The same venue, Glasgow, in Scotland. The stakes have never been higher. Trust between the Global North and Global South is near the bottom, after the hoarding of global COVID-19 vaccine supplies by rich countries this year. More so, as the vaccine inequity has compounded anger over the failure of wealthy countries to fulfil their green pledge of raising $100 billion in climate finance for poorer countries each year by 2020.But let us start at the beginning. What is COP26 and why is it happening? The world is warming because of fossil fuel emissions caused by humans. Extreme weather events linked to climate change \- including heat waves, floods and forest fires \- are intensifying. The past ten years are the warmest on record, hence governments agree urgent collective action is needed to avert disaster. Keeping the rise in global average temperature below 1.5celsius compared with the pre-industrial level will avoid the worst impacts of climate change, scientists under the umbrella of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said.The global effort started in 1995 when the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was agreed, hence stands for the 26th Conference of Parties to this agreement. In 2015, during COP21, the world signed the Paris Climate Accord, which for the first time, united all the world's nations in a single agreement on tackling global warming and cutting greenhouse-gas emissions. Known as the Paris Agreement, it means countries have to keep making bigger emissions cuts until reaching net-zero in 2050.They pledged to make changes to keep global warming ""well below"" 2C above pre-industrial levels, and to try to aim for 1.5C so that we avoid a climate catastrophe. These individual efforts in tangible, scalable emissions cuts and energy efficiency protocols are known as Nationally Determined Contributions. Now the die is cast. For the Glasgow COP, which kicks off on November 1 next week, 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030.What will be decided at COP26? Many are expected to be very technical, including rules still needed to implement the Paris Agreement, for example. But some other announcements could include: making a faster switch to electric cars; speeding up the phasing out of coal power; cutting down fewer trees; protecting more people from the impacts of climate change, such as funding coastal-defence systems. Up to 25,000 people are expected in Glasgow, including world leaders, negotiators and journalists. Thousands of activists and businesses will also be there to hold events, network, and stage protests. At the end of the conference, some form of a binding declaration is expected, and it could include specific commitments, and every country is required to sign up.But I am worried about the effect the present global political atmosphere could bring to bear on this all-important COP, which many commentators have already seen as a make-or-mar international event. There is also the tricky issue of climate justice, especially when the topic of money is brought up. Developing countries tend to pollute less per capita and were not responsible for most emissions in the past, yet they suffer the most impact of climate change because of obvious existential vulnerabilities. The question then is whether the world has learned to do away with the usual intense politics that dog climate negotiations at the COPs.The developing world, Nigeria inclusive, needs money to help reduce their emissions and to cope with climate change. In past COPs, there has been a battle over compensation for developing countries affected by climate change. Climate justice also means more solar panels in countries that depend on energy from coal and flood defence systems. In 2009, wealthy countries pledged $100bn a year to help poorer nations by 2020, however, this goal has still not been met. Ironically, China is of the developing world \- and is now the world's biggest polluter, and has investments in coal stations all over the world. Therefore, China's commitments \- and other major fossil fuel producers, like Russia \- at COP26 will be very important, though the Chinese leader has pledged to shut coal investments outside its shores.It is instructive to note that America's president, Joe Biden, is more disposed to working with other world leaders to fight climate change, unlike former President Donald Trump who declared that climate change was a hoax, and tore up his country's Paris Accord commitments. This is expected to thaw the frosty tables on which China and US shall sit to discuss their net-zero carbon plans.There is no doubt that some commitments to be made in Glasgow would directly affect our daily lives. It could change whether we could dump our petrol cars, continue heating our homes with gas boilers, or be taking as many flights as we are used to. It could turn the table on our attitude to conservation and tree planting initiatives. And, for countries like Nigeria whose major source of income is crude oil, it could mean an end to prosperity.So, we will know whether the COP a success by the strong commitments that come at the end of the day. Will the world recommit to net zero emissions by 2050 as well as big reductions by 2030? Will we see specific pledges on ending coal, petrol cars and protecting nature? Will the developing countries get significant financial packages over the next five years, to help them adapt to rising temperatures? These posers shall be answered in a fortnight.Nevertheless, we must be reminded that some scientists believe that no matter what world leaders do now, it is too late in the day to turn the hand of time \- the 1.5c goal cannot be achieved. The United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, said the present indicators ""show a pathway of at least 2.7c heating above pre-industrial levels, and that's obviously a one-way ticket for disaster.""But I am an optimist. I believe that if we pick up the gauntlet right now, we can push back worst-case scenarios. The onus liees with the global political leadership. We must avoid failure at all costs. The carry-over from COP25 must not be allowed to make COP26 a failed effort. Article 6 must be resolved, and this Glasgow conference must change the course of climate action and ambition. The nations that signed onto the Paris Accord must submit their Nationally Determined Contributions with scaled-up ambitions.The news that the leaders of many of the major carbon emitters are showing hesitation should not be enough to deter the global community. The UN chief Guterres must continue speaking the truth to the big economies; they owe humanity their unwavering commitments to ending global warming because it all escalated when the factories that made them great began to run at full throttle. Perhaps, it is high time more powers were given to the UN and climate change should become a security matter. They can put a bite behind the words of Guterres, who said:""The carbon pollution of a handful of countries has brought humanity to its knees and they bear the greatest responsibility. I hope we are still on time to avoid a failure in Glasgow, but time is running short, and things are getting more difficult and that is why I'm very very worried. I'm afraid things might get wrong. The G20 leaders will meet in Rome and they know their economies are responsible for four-fifths of planet carbon pollution. If they do not stand up we are headed for terrible human sufferings . China and the United States must do more than what they have announced so far.""[email protected] 08063601665\l"

He stated that given the rate of fiscal responsibility and allocations in addressing climate events in Europe and America and the robust response to the Covid-19 pandemic, there is an undeniable dichotomy between the rich and poor countries that betray the lack of equity and fairness in addressing these issues in the developing countries.Reiterating this point, he said,""According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, climate change impact will continue to be on the rise and with growing intensity hence the need for urgency. Firstly, the pledge to mobilizing US$100 billion annually by 2020-2025 as funds to addressing climate change actions stands at about 30% and is nowhere near its mark. Therefore, the Earth Summit meeting of the Conference of Parties (CoP26) in Glasgow should be a rallying moment for rich counties to step up their commitments and show solidarity by walking the talk and putting their money where their mouth is.""Secondly, CoP26""CoP26""While the future ban or elimination of combustion engines production and use in some European countries from 2025 onwards is commendable, it should be clear how these obsolete technologies, cars and combustion engines will be disposed of or recycled. Africa should not be the dumping ground or receptacle for such technologies that could be shipped to it as Greek gifts or forms of development aid. In the words of an activist, 'you cannot set fire in my house and sell fire extinguisher to me.'""Thirdly, there is the need for African governments and delegates to demand loudly that greenhouse gas emissions is a financial debt and be resolute in the demand for the immediate payment of the Carbon Debt from the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere by rich countries. This debt is part of the transitional justice demands for fairness, compensation and reparation for the monumental harm done to the environment some of which are irreversible.""African delegates should ensure to speak with one voice to demand transitional justice in the payment of carbon debts currently put at 334 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. According to a recent study, the world's leading polluters have racked up a US$10 trillion carbon debt for carbon dioxide emissions since 1990. This demand for carbon debt payment is sacrosanct and does not deflect from the US$100 billion commitment for climate actions.""Ojo maintained, ""According to scientific evidence, rich countries contribution of carbon dioxide emissions released into the atmosphere account for 70% inclusive of 20% from the USA, while Africa contributes only 4% of the carbon dioxide. Further, the impact of climate change and Covid-19 pandemic and their impacts on escalating the debt service burden on African states is horrendous. This necessitates the call for debt cancellation for developing countries. Africa should be united to restate that she has been shortchanged and has no debt to pay because on the balance, it owes no debt.""ERA/FoEN commended the United Kingdom (UK) government as host, for taking the decision to end support for fossil fuels sector overseas hence the government will no longer support the development of fossil fuel sector overseas including end to export finance and credits, funding for new crude oil, natural gas and coal projects overseas.\l"

It detailed actions required including cutting CO2 emissions, curbing methane, and setting up new rules to hold countries accountable for the progress they make -- or fail to make.The final agreement was worded to water down the demand for phasing out coal. The phrase ""phase down unabated coal,"" was a compromise to accommodate India's objection because the earlier draft had read to ""phase out"" coal. Negotiators from India insisted on the text to the consternation of others. The compromise was reached to avoid the fragile agreement from collapsing.""The approved texts are a compromise.

They will be hosted by Boris Johnson, British prime minister, who is hoping for a successful conference. Yet, despite warnings that the climate summit must deliver significant results to mitigate the devastating impacts of climate change, Prime Minister Johnson himself described the prospects of a successful summit as ""touch and go"", hanging in the balance. But why?Well, the first problem is that everyone who should be in Glasgow for the summit will not be there. President Xi Jinping of China and President Vladimir Putin of Russia, whose countries are, respectively, the world's first and fourth biggest polluters will not physically attend the conference. In a summit, where face-to-face negotiations can make a difference, their absence puts a damper on the event. Symbolically, the fact that Her Majesty the Queen, aged 95, has to pull out of the conference after medical advice to rest also takes the shine off the summit.But not all the big polluters will be physically absent. President Joe Biden of the United States, whose country is the world's second biggest polluter, and who makes tackling climate change a key policy agenda, will be in Glasgow. So will Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, whose country is the third biggest polluter in the world. Well, Nigeria is the 27th biggest polluter out of 193 countries globally, and our president will personally be in Glasgow. Indeed, according to media reports, President Buhari is attending the COP26 summit with a large delegation of state governors, ministers and select government officials.Trad Also: ""post-titleCOP26: Success for Africa is holding rich nations to their climate finance pledgesNow, so far, I have focused on in-person attendance. But while that is important from the point of view of personal interactions, which are relevant in summitry, the most important thing is whether a leader makes ambitious or shallow climate pledges. A leader may not personally attend the conference but commit his or her country to strong pledges, while a leader may attend but make weak pledges. At the end of the day, it is the willingness of each country to commit itself to strong climate action that would determine whether the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels can be achieved. On that count, it is good and bad news!The good news is that the science of climate change is now widely accepted. John Kerry, US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate and former Secretary of State, said at the London School of Economics last week: ""Let us be clear: the time for debating the cause of climate change is long over. The time for action is also long overdue. Needless to say, the stakes could not be higher"". Truth is, the science of climate change could not be clearer; climate change is real.Another piece of good news is that more countries now accept the urgency of action to mitigate the impacts of climate change. For instance, just about three years ago, less than 30% of global GDP was signed up to net zero or carbon neutrality targets. Today, that figure is now over 80% and rising. So, some countries are taking commitments to climate action, more specifically, to net zero, a key test of tackling climate change, seriously. Indeed, last week, Saudi Arabia, the world's 14th biggest emitter, pledged to cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2060. And last month, the UK, which commits itself to net zero legally, published its Net Zero Strategy, which sets out the action it would take, first, to cut emissions by at least 68% by 2030 and, then, to reach net zero by 2050.But here's the bad news: not every county is taking climate action seriously enough. For instance, the coal-dependent countries are simply not prioritising cutting emissions. Recently, the Financial Times published a report titled ""China and India cast all over climate ambition ahead of COP26"". According to the report, the world's first and third polluters ""rejected calls to set new climate targets"". Although China committed itself to reach net zero by 2060, it really has no plans to wean itself off coal. Similarly, India is not in a hurry to reduce its dependence on coal. While some countries like the UK are closing down their coal and gas plants and increasing the renewable's contribution to their energy mix, many others remain hooked on fossil fuels.t the Paris climate conference in 2015, it was agreed that, in order to achieve the goal of limiting global temperature to 1.5 degrees, countries should set out their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), that is, their plans to reduce emissions across their entire economy. Every country is expected to update its NDC every five years. Last year, 2020, marked the end of the first of the five-year cycles, so every country should submit a revised NDC this year, ahead of COP 26.Unfortunately, while some countries, such as the UK, have submitted ambitious revised NDCs, others have, more or less, stuck with their original 2015 NDC, unwilling to set ambitious new targets. For instance, Nigeria's revised NDC, submitted to the UN on July 30 this year, simply repeats its 2015 commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% (unconditionally) and 47% (conditionally) by 2030, compared to BAU (Business as Usual), even though Nigeria's GHG emissions grow by nearly 6% annually!Unfortunately, while some countries, such as the UK, have submitted ambitious revised NDCs, others have, more or less, stuck with their original 2015 NDC, unwilling to set ambitious new targetsIn a recent editorial, the Financial Times described this month's climate summit in Glasgow as ""a pivotal moment for the planet"". That is true because this is the decade of action. In order to limit temperatures to 1.5 degrees, net emissions must be halved by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050. Given that there are two five-year cycles between now and 2030 and given that the NDCs submitted this year will last for the next five years, this month's summit is the first hard-stop deadl"
"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria55","Climate Issues At COP26 - Key Issues for Africa [opinion]","November 11, 2021","This Day (Lagos)","The UN's COP26, where critical decisions that will shape the future of climate governance will be made, is currently ongoing in Glasgow. As the continent least responsible for, and yet most vulnerable to climate change, African governments cannot afford to be complacent on the need for strong negotiating positions and astute diplomacy in order to get good outcomes from the UN meeting. Of the many negotiation issues that concern Africa, climate finance is of top priority.We are aware that several months of pressure from climate advocates yielded significant climate finance pledges from world leaders at the recently concluded 76th UN General Assembly (UNGA) in New York. The US President Joe Biden doubled the US government climate finance pledge from $5.7bn to $11.4bn per year by 2024 and promised ""a new era of relentless diplomacy"" of using the power of America's development aid to lift people up around the world. Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom (UK) touted his country's pledge of 11.1 billion pounds made at the UN General Assembly (UNGA) last year and indicated that the UK would be open to increasing its climate finance commitment at COP26. On his part, President Xi Jinping of China promised to end coal finance abroad and indicated that China will instead increase its funding of clean energy around the world.But while these new financial pledges are commendable, it is important that African leaders are not na\'efve or ignorant about a host of outstanding issues on climate finance in COP26, the outcome of which can either accelerate or hinder the climate-resilient and sustainable development of Africa.Here are some of the critical ones:1. The Issue of AdequacyFor a long time, rich countries have treated the $100billion climate finance commitment to developing countries as a high mark target, the fulfilment of which will absolve them of their climate justice responsibilities. The reality, however, is that the $100 billion pledged by rich countries is actually a tiny drop compared to what climate change is costing and will cost developing countries. A study conducted by the UK Department for International Development (DFID), now part of Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office (FCDO), indicates that the cost of climate change to Nigeria was about $100 billion by 2020 and could hit as high as $460 billion per year by 2050.According to official figures, the 2012 flooding in Nigeria cost the country about $16 billion in direct and indirect damages. The cost of much bigger subsequent incidents since 2013 have not been calculated. The World Bank calculates that the cost of Cyclone Idai which devastated Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe in 2019 was $2billion. These are just a few examples. So, while rich countries are still far away from meeting the $100 billion per year goal even with the new pledges, the truth is that the cost of climate change for Africa alone runs into trillions of dollars per year and several times over if one includes the cost of climate change on the rest of the developing countries of the world. So, while the euphoria that greeted the new climate change pledges is understandable, African governments must set their sights on getting rich countries that are responsible for climate change to increase their pledges in COP26. Furthermore, African leaders must press to see a vast increase in adaptation finance which currently constitutes less than 25% of total climate finance. They should urge other countries to emulate Denmark which has pledged to devote an equal amount of its climate pledge to climate adaptation and mitigation.2. The Issue of AdditionalityIn the first major text of the United Nations agreement on climate change, signed in 1992, it was agreed that the climate finance which rich countries will provide to Africa and other developing countries around the world should be new and additional to existing Overseas Development Assistance (ODA). The reason for this decision was that climate change impact and adaptation measures pose incremental costs on the existing burden of development. As such, the UN Convention makes climate action in developing countries conditional on the ""adequacy and predictability in the flow of funds"" from rich to poor countries. However, despite the clarity of the rules, rich countries have long been repackaging their traditional ODA money as climate finance. There are several instances where funding that would ordinarily support energy, transportation, education, and agricultural development are now rebranded as climate finance and counted as part of rich countries' steps to meeting their climate finance obligations. This is simply akin to cheating and it is, in fact, a travesty especially given that developed countries have for a very long time been failing to meet the 0.7% of the GDP transfer. It is therefore possible that the whole funding flowing to Africa can actually be far less than the continent could have received in the absence of climate finance. Current accounting and reporting measures are simply so opaque that it is actually hard for anyone to verify exactly how much rich countries are giving as climate finance.3. The Energy Security IssueAfrica is energy impoverished. The total installed electricity capacity in Africa is 147 GW equivalent to what China installs in one or two years. The whole of Nigeria has an installed capacity equal to that of London Heathrow Airport. Africa needs to increase its capacity by at least 6% per year to stand a chance of meeting universal access by 2050. Unless this gap is closed, Africa will remain a dark and poor continent. The question that arises is whether these new promises of climate finance from rich countries will help to fund energy security in Africa especially when they are most likely to come with tough conditionalities including the defunding of coal, oil and gas investments. It is instructive that while many rich countries are pledging to stop investment in gas in Africa, many still retain gas as a part of their long-term energy portfolio. It is also telling that China's pledge to end coal production does not cover domestic coal which accounts for well over 55% of its domestic energy consumption. African leaders must therefore focus on how to unlock the scale of finance and investment needed to ensure energy security for Africa now and the years to come.Unless there is a radical change, over 40% of the African population will still be cooking with dirty wood fuel, charcoal and animal dung by 2050. Making finance flows consistent with pathways towards low GHG emissions and climate-resilient development is critical to meeting commitment of the Paris Agreement and the developmental needs of Africa.4. External and Internal TransparencyA landscape of loosely defined, fragmented, unpredictable and opaque climate finance will not foster the end of climate insolvency in Africa but would rather impose new risks on all. Africa must not only ask for an increase in the overall amount of climate finance but also that a stipulated percentage be devoted specifically to Africa. At the ongoing COP26, Africa should ask for greater transparency and accountability to ensure that rich countries are not robbing traditional ODA to pay their climate finance bills.Beyond the COP, African leaders must vigorously reject climate finance conditionalities that seek to compromise the energy security of their countries while at the same time showing demonstrable commitment to embrace renewables as the energy of the future. Africa must also invest its resources to develop capabilities in the manufacture and deployment of renewable energy technologies to meet their growing energy demands. They must know that switching from dependence on the importation of fossil fuel from Europe to dependence on Chinese imported solar panels is not a good definition of sustainable green transition for Africa.Prof Chukwumerije Okereke is the Director Center for Climate Change and Development, Alex-Ekwueme Federal University, Ndufu-Alike, Nigeria\l"

Section Two, defines and discusses the inherent constraints of energy systems, namely technical feasibility and stability of the grid, environmental concerns, security of energy supply, and energy costs.In Section Three, the paper presents the implications of these inherent constraints on Africa's evolving energy system, while Section Four offers recommendations and conditions for a decarbonised energy system pathway for the African continent.Former Managing Director of Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas, NLNG, Godswill Ihetu in the paper's foreword writes: ""The Discussion Paper is comprehensive and well-written. It captures elements of the tangible and intangible costs to Africa in joining the net zero emissions targets proposed mainly by the G20 and other wealthy countries.""To be sure, those who have been responsible for pollution must clean up, especially given the fact that the developed world has burned vast amounts of fossil fuels since the last one hundred years as it powered the industrial revolution that has led to its socioeconomic development.Read also:NLNG: 17 years after, more nods for Nigeria's creative sector""With Africa having largely been left out of this industrialisation process, the continent must insist on Climate Justice. Africa must be allowed to generate its own electricity with fossil fuels; hence the embargo on funding new fossil fuel development should apply to only the wealthy, developed countries. It should be noted, however, that certain Western countries have been discouraging foreign investors from investing in oil and gas assets in Africa, claiming that they might end up with stranded assets in the future. This mindset must be addressed robustly by African countries.""While I agree that Africa should not ignore renewables, the continent must not pursue development of alternative energy sources to the detriment of its fossil fuel assets. In any case, immediate cessation of fossil fuel usage is not possible for Africa at this point, as countries' needs differ in many ways. Therefore, adaptation and mitigation must be a continuous process, especially for Africa's vulnerable economies.""PUTTRU, founded by energy specialist, Monica Maduekwe is at the forefront of bridging energy gaps in Africa by leveraging technology which enables African energy businesses and financiers to connect within Africa and beyond.\l"

The financing according to the UK will help Nigerian investors focus on low carbon energy, supporting off-grid, low-carbon energy projects. The \£310 million will be blended to de-risk transactions and therefore mobilise domestic institutional investment from local pension funds, insurance firms and other local institutional investors.This will help scale up domestic financing for eligible off-grid clean energy infrastructure, such as solar mini-grid and home systems, clean cooking infrastructure and SME cold storage infrastructure in Nigeria.Nigeria, she noted, has about 85 million people without access to reliable energy and these efforts will address those people's needs.She stressed that this is a strong demonstration of partnerships between both countries and consistent UK commitment to supporting Nigeria especially on low carbon energy sector.This innovative blended finance initiative will provide affordable long-term financing from local investors for the low carbon energy sector to support scaling up of off-grid low carbon energy projects in unserved and underserved communities.This initiative will support the implementation of Nigeria's Nationally Determined Contributions plan, which Nigeria submitted to the UNFCCC before COP26, its Energy Transition Plan, which was presented by the Nigerian government at COP26, and Nigeria's plans to increase energy access including the Solar Naija programme.Jedy Agba in his remarks said that Nigeria kick started its clean energy transition as far back as 2014 with the first Solar Hybrid Projects executed across Lagos, Kaduna, and Borno states.""Since then, we have continued to raise ambition by putting requisite regulations and policies in place, developing investor-grade data for project development, and securing the $550 million NEP facility from the World Bank and the African Continental Bank- this is currently the largest clean energy access programme across the continent,"" he said.\l"

""We are looking at the involvement of the private sector and we have seen good signs at COP 26, where unmanaged fund was committed to sustainable investment planning,'' she said.COP26 was the 26th UN Climate Change conference held in Glasgow, Scotland, from Oct. 31 to Nov. 13 202.It brought parties together to accelerate action towards the goals of the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.""We have looked at commitments made at COP26 and there were lots of commitments.According to her, attention is on multilateralism to get different ways to get financing to achieve the goals.The deputy secretary-general, however, expressed dissatisfaction at the level of institutional and corporate support for the SDGs in developing countries.""We are not satisfied with what we have seen so far.""We didn't see that commitment in COVID-19 response,'' she lamented.Mohammed urged leaders in developing countries to deliver on their commitments in achieving the SDGs. Earlier, Mohammed said without immediate policy action, the window for delivering the SDGs by 2030 would close.She noted that the majority of developing countries would need active and urgent support to get back on track to achieve the SDGs.She said an estimated 77 million more people were still living in extreme poverty globally, a worse situation when compared with the pre-COVID-19 era.According to her, UN analysis indicates that 1.7 billion people are facing exposure to spiking food prices, energy and fertiliser costs as a result of the on-going war in Ukraine.The UN deputy chief assured that the recommendations from the reports pointed on the way forward to revert the threat posed by the COVID-19 and other challenges.""First, the international community must urgently address financing gaps and rising debt risks and it would be a tragedy if developing countries continue to default at the expense of investments in social services and climate resilience,'' she noted.Mohammed also said that policy makers must ensure that financing is aligned with the SDGs and climate actions.""This includes public budgets, tax systems, regulatory frameworks, and corporate reporting requirements.""Climate-related risks should also be integrated into debt contracts and financial frameworks,'' she stressed.She also said developing countries should improve on information ecosystems, as it would help policymakers to improve on planning; to manage risks better and to combat illicit financial flows.""It will also help markets to better evaluate sovereign risks, including the impact of credit ratings.""Across the board, we must also take steps to improve our global financial system to ensure that it reduces inequality while increasing resilience.""As things stand now, those member states that have the power of the global financial system appear to be moving in the opposite direction,'' the top UN official said.

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria68","Climate finance at COP26 and key issues for Africa","Business Day"," ","We are now a couple of weeks away from the UN's COP26 in Glasgow where critical decisions that will shape the future of climate governance will be made. As the continent least responsible for, and yet most vulnerable to climate change, African governments cannot afford to be complacent on the need for strong negotiating positions and astute diplomacy in order to get good outcomes from the UN meeting.Of the many negotiation issues that concern Africa, climate finance has to be among the priorities. We are aware that several months of pressure from climate advocates yielded significant climate finance pledges from world leaders at the recently concluded 76th UN General Assembly (UNGA) in New York.The US President Joe Biden doubled the US Government climate finance pledge from $5.7bn to $11.4bn per year by 2024 and promised ""a new era of relentless diplomacy"" of using the power of America's development aid to lift people up around the world.""Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom touted his country pledge of 11.1 billion pounds made at UNGA last year and indicated that the UK would be open to increasing its climate finance commitment at COP26 in Glasgow next month. On his part, President Xi Jinping of China promised to end coal finance abroad and indicated that China will instead increase its funding of clean energy around the world.Read Also: ""post-titleNigeria, 22 others endorse Forest, FACT dialogue to address deforestationBut while these new financial pledges are commendable, it is important that African leaders are not naave or ignorant about a host of outstanding issues on climate finance in COP26 the outcome of which can either accelerate or hinder the climate-resilient and sustainable development of Africa. Here are some of the critical ones:The issue of adequacy: For a long time, rich countries have treated the $100billion as a high mark target the fulfilment of which will absolve them of their climate justice responsibilities. The reality, however is that the $100 billion pledged by rich countries is actually a tiny drop compared to what climate change is costing and will cost developing countries. study conducted by the UK Department for International Development, now part of Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office indicates that the cost of climate change to Nigeria is about $100 billion by 2020 and $460 billion per year by 2050. According to official figures, the 2012 flooding event in Nigeria cost the country about $16 billion in direct and indirect damages.The cost of much bigger subsequent events since 2013 has not been calculated. The World Bank calculates that the cost of cyclone Idai which devastated Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbawe in 2019 at $2billion.These are just a few examples. So, while rich countries are still far away from meeting the $100 billion per year goal even with the new pledges the truth is that the cost of climate change for Africa alone runs into trillions of dollars per year and several times over if one includes the cost of climate change on the rest of the developing countries of the world.So, while the euphoria that greeted the new climate change pledges is understandable, the African government must set their sights on getting rich countries that are responsible for climate change to increase their pledges in COP26.Furthermore, African leaders must press to see a vast increase in adaptation finance which currently constitutes less than 25% of total climate finance. They should urge other countries to emulate Denmark which has pledged to devote an equal amount of its climate pledge to climate adaptation and mitigation.The issue of additionality: In the first major text of the United Nations agreement on climate change, signed in 1992, it was agreed that the climate finance which rich countries will provide to Africa and other developing countries around the world should be new and additional to existing Overseas Development Assistance.The reason for this decision was that climate change impact and adaptation measures pose incremental costs on existing burden of development. As such the UN Convention makes climate action in developing countries conditional on the ""adequacy and predictability in the flow of funds"" from rich to poor countries. However, despite the clarity of the rules, rich countries have long been repackaging their traditional ODA money as climate finance.There are several instances where funding that would ordinarily support energy, transportation, education, and agricultural development are now rebranded as climate finance and counted as part of the rich countries steps to meeting their climate finance obligations. This is simply akin to cheating. This is, in fact, a travesty especially given that developed countries have for a very long time been failing to meet the 0.7% of the GDP transfer.It is therefore possible that the whole funding flowing to Africa can actually be far less than they could have received in the absence of climate finance. Current accounting and reporting measures are simply so opaque that it is actually hard for anyone to verify exactly how much rich countries are giving as climate finance.The energy security issue: Africa is energy impoverished. The total installed electricity capacity in Africa is 147 GW equivalents to what China installs in one or two years. The whole of Nigeria has an installed capacity equal to that of London Heathrow Airport.frica's needs to increase its capacity at least 6% per year to stand a chance of meeting universal access by 2050. Unless this gap is closed Africa will remain a dark and poor continent. The question that arises is whether these new promises of climate finance from rich countries will help to fund energy security in Africa especially when they are most likely to come with tough conditions including the defunding of coal, oil and gas investments?It is instructive that while many rich countries are pledging to stop investment in gas in Africa, many still retain gas as a part of their long-term energy portfolio. It is also telling that China's pledge to end coal production does not cover domestic coal which accounts for well over 55% of its domestic energy consumption.African leaders must therefore focus on how to unlock the scale of finance and investment needed to secure energy security for Africa now and the years to come. Unless there is a radical change, over 40% of African population will still be cooking with dirty wood fuel, charcoal and animal dung by 2050.Making finance flows consistent with pathway towards low GHG emissions and climate-resilient development is critical to meeting commitment of the Paris Agreement and the developmental needs of Africa.External and Internal Transparency. A landscape of loosely defined, fragmented, unpredictable and opaque climate finance will not foster the end of climate insolvency in Africa but would rather impose new risks on all. Africa must ask for an increase in the overall amount of climate finance but also that a specific percentage be devoted specifically to Africa.t COP26frica must also invest its resources to develop capabilities in manufacture and deployment of renewable energy technologies to meet their growing energy demands. They must know that switching from dependence on the importation of fossil fuel from Europe to dependence on Chinese imported solar panels is not a good definition of sustainable green transition for Africa.Okereke is the director, Center for Climate Change and Development, Alex-Ekwueme Federal University Ndufu-Alike, Nigeria\l"

He explained that the industry was facing critical challenges and with discussions going on in Glasgow (COP26), it was understood that the outcome of the deliberations there will equally impact the industry due to the fact that they (stakeholders) are setting the global warming standard at 1.5 degrees Celsius as they target at impacting financing in the energy transition regime.His words, ""I want to assure your members (IPPG) that we will not because of energy transition abandon our hydrocarbon and so we really need to think outside the box and also we want to get feed-back from our stakeholders to see how we can get a structural financing group to commit on financing critical projects in our upstream sector. I know that financing is a critical issue posed by energy transition and I know that if we sit down to think together, there will be results.The PIA had not only made the commission a technical regulator but a commercial regulator. We will upgrade to being a business enabler and other different regulatory culture and this is the prescription of the law and the law has made the commission a technical and commercial regulator and so in that wise, we will be concerned equally as to how we will facilitate financing for stakeholders in the industry and we will not do that in isolation of the members"".The CCE added that if initiatives will be spearheaded by the regulator in terms of attracting financing for IPPG members, it will empower the members to be able to leverage on the divestment day by day, IOCs for them to enhance their capacity in the onshore and shallow water aspect of the investment in the upstream.""We can look at ways to optimise production in the upstream and thereby enhancing federation's revenue"", the NUPRC boss added.In his presentation, Chairman, IPPG, Abdulrazaq Isa, noted that the FG's support for indigeneous E&P companies' participation in the ongoing IOC divestment was critical as it will provide a solid avenue for securing the country's energy future.He also expressed concerns that IPPG members who had a proven track record and demonstrated operational and financial capacity to manage marginal field assets were not given consideration in the last marginal round and added that significant upfront costs for marginal field assets may impede the ability of investors to attain production in a timely manner.Responding to the concerns raised by IPPG, Komolafe said the presentation will serve as a working document for policy formulation as the commission commences the implementation of the PIA and added that the FG will make improvements in challenges included in the presentation.""We understand that part of the challenges you are having is bureaucracies, cost of operations, crude oil theft and so on but we promise a different culture completely and we intend to leave a legacy of 21st century upstream regulatory commission. We enjoin you to reciprocate by being very compliant with the provisions of the Act. Pay your royalties as at when due and on our part we will ensure a very good efficient and partnership between the NUPRC and other oil and gas stakeholders,"" he said.\l"

Many environmental activists are discontent at the slow pace of action, and they are expected to initiate loud and creative protests during the summit.In 1992, His Majesty King Mohammed VI, who was Crown Prince at the time, delivered a speech during the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro and provided the foundations for the construction of a new society dedicated to sustainable development.The speech drew a roadmap that has enabled Morocco to implement successive reforms over the past three decades with the ultimate aim of adhering to environmental laws while preserving social conditions.According to the government, Morocco possesses a powerful legal arsenal designed to support the implementation of its climate ambitions, including laws related to water, renewable energies, energy efficiency, and the 2002 charter for conservation and sustainable development.In addition, the Kingdom has implemented a number of ambitious sustainability projects, including solar and wind power plants, a waste recovery program, a household waste program, and liquid sanitation plans.Several countries and international forums have praised Morocco's sustainability efforts, describing the country as an established regional leader and an aspiring global leader in the fight against climate change.Morocco will participate in COP26 with a delegation composed of representatives from the public and private sectors, research organizations, and nongovernmental organizations.During a recent meeting in Rabat, Ms. Leila Benali, Minister of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development, noted that Morocco's objectives during this COP will be ""to consolidate its leadership as a nation very committed to the international community in the fight against climate change.""She indicated that ""the Kingdom is fully supportive of the initiatives of the African group, the Arab group, and the G77; it will also focus on identifying methodologies in order to finalize the implementation of the Paris Agreement.""Distributed by APO Group on behalf of Embassy of Morocco in South Africa.\l"

Such pledges, the statement says, mask climate inaction and provide cover for business-as-usual fossil fuel production that spells planetary destruction.Proponents of the demands insist that the so-called solution that enable Big Polluters to buy more room to continue to emit only binds people, especially in the poor regions like Africa, into decades of more devastation.Hellen Neima, Corporate Accountability, Director of Climate Campaign for Africa said:'After weakening the Paris Agreement, polluting governments and corporations are burying real solutions that stop emissions at source in favour of empty promises disguised by the catchy 'net zero' slogan. 'Fortunately, this big con has been exposed for the scam that it is. Governments at COP26, especially Global North governments, need to stop condemning the world and heed the demands of the people by committing to real solutions and Real Zero right now.'The CSOs' joint statement notes that Africa contributed and still contributes insignificantly to the current climate crisis yet is the most adversely affected by its consequences.'It will only be strategic for the governments of the continent to project a harmonized position and engage the discussions with a 'common language' premised on uniform climate actions that won't compromise each nation's peculiarities.They urge African governments attending the COP to: 'Challenge and reject pledges made by polluting corporations and governments to achieve 'net zero' emissions, which are being used to shift additional burdens onto the African region and avoid responsibility for their role in the global share of emissions to-date.'Commit to achieving Real Zero emissions reductions, embracing the concept of equity where each country does their fair share.'Reject industry-driven attempts to ram through rules enshrining market mechanisms into the centre of Paris Agreement implementation, via the guidel"
"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria84","Climate finance in COP26: Key Issues for Africa, By Chukwumerije Okereke","October 12, 2021 Tuesday","Premium Times","Nigeria, Oct. 12 -- We are now a couple of weeks away from the United Nations' Conference of the Parties 26 (COP26) in Glasgow, where critical decisions that will shape the future of climate governance will be made. As the continent least responsible for, and yet most vulnerable to climate change, African governments cannot afford to be complacent on the need for strong negotiating positions and astute diplomacy in order to get good outcomes from the UN meeting. Of the many issues of negotiation that concern Africa, climate finance has to be among the priorities.We are aware that several months of pressure from climate advocates yielded significant climate finance pledges from world leaders at the recently concluded 76th UN General Assembly (UNGA) in New York. America's President Joe Biden doubled the U.S. government's climate finance pledge from $5.7 billion to $11.4 billion per year by 2024, and promised ""a new era of relentless diplomacy of using the power of America's development aid to lift people up around the world."" Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom touted his country's pledge of &#163;11.1 billion made at UNGA last year and indicated that the U.K. would be open to increasing its climate finance commitment at COP26 in Glasgow next month. On his part, President Xi Jinping of China promised to end coal finance abroad and indicated that China will instead increase its funding of clean energy around the world.But while these new financial pledges are commendable, it is important that African leaders are not naive or ignorant about a host of outstanding issues on climate finance in COP26, the outcome of which can either accelerate or hinder the climate-resilient and sustainable development of Africa. Here are some of the critical ones:The Issue of Adequacy. For a long time, rich countries have treated the $100 billion commitment as a high mark target, the fulfilment of which will absolve them of their climate justice responsibilities. The reality, however, is that the $100 billion pledged by rich countries is actually a tiny drop in comparison to what climate change is costing and will further cost developing countries. A study conducted by the U.K. Department for International Development, now part of the Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office, indicated that the cost of climate change to Nigeria reached about $100 billion in 2020 and would rise to $460 billion per year by 2050. According to official figures, the 2012 flooding in Nigeria cost the country about $16 billion in direct and indirect damages. The cost of much bigger and subsequent occurrences, since 2013, have not been calculated. The World Bank calculated that the cost of Cyclone Idai, which devastated Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbawe in 2019, was $2 billion. These are just a few examples. So, while rich countries are still far away from meeting the $100 billion per year goal set, even with the new pledges, the truth is that the cost of climate change to Africa alone runs into trillions of dollars per year and several times over, if one includes the cost of climate change to the rest of the developing countries of the world. So, while the euphoria that greeted the new climate change pledges is understandable, African governments must set their sight on getting rich countries that are responsible for climate change to increase their pledges in COP26. Furthermore, African leaders must press to see a vast increase in adaptation finance, which currently constitutes less than 25 per cent of the total climate finance. They should urge other countries to emulate Denmark, which has pledged to devote the equal amount of its climate pledge, to climate adaptation and mitigation.The Issue of Additionality: In the first major text of the United Nations agreement on climate change, signed in 1992, it was agreed that the climate finance which rich countries need to provide to Africa and other developing countries around the world, should be new and additional to existing Overseas Development Assistance (ODA). The reason for this decision was that the climate change impact and adaptation measures pose incremental costs on the existing burden of development. As such, the UN Convention makes climate action in developing countries conditional on the ""adequacy and predictability in the flow of funds"" from rich to poor countries. However, despite the clarity of the rules, rich countries have long been repackaging their traditional ODA money as climate finance. There are several instances where funding that would ordinarily support energy, transportation, education, and agricultural development are now rebranded as climate finance and counted as part of the steps taken by rich countries to meet their climate finance obligations. This is simply akin to cheating. It is, in fact, a travesty, especially given that developed countries have for a very long time been failing to meet the 0.7 per cent of the GDP transfer. It is therefore possible that the whole funding flowing to Africa can actually be far less than they could have received in the absence of climate finance. Current accounting and reporting measures are simply so opaque that it is actually hard for anyone to verify exactly how much rich countries are giving as climate finance.The Energy Security Issue: Africa is energy impoverished. The total installed electricity capacity in Africa is 147 GW, equivalent to what China installs in one or two years. The whole of Nigeria has an installed capacity equal to that of London's Heathrow Airport. Africa needs to increase its capacity by at least 6 per cent per year to stand a chance of meeting universal access by 2050. Unless this gap is closed, Africa will remain a dark and poor continent. The question that arises is whether these new promises of climate finance from rich countries will help to fund energy security in Africa, especially when they are most likely to come with tough conditionalities, including the defunding of coal, oil and gas investments? It is instructive that while many rich countries are pledging to stop investment in gas in Africa, many still retain gas as a part of their long-term energy portfolio. It is also telling that China's pledge to end coal production does not cover domestic coal, which accounts for well over 55 per cent of its domestic energy consumption. African leaders must therefore focus on how to unlock the scale of finance and investment needed to secure energy security for Africa now and in the years to come. Unless there is a radical change, over 40 per cent of e thAfrican population will still be cooking with dirty wood fuel, charcoal and animal dung by 2050. Making finance flows consistent with pathway towards low GHG emissions and climate-resilient development, is critical to meeting commitment of the Paris Agreement and the developmental needs of Africa.External and Internal Transparency. A landscape of loosely defined, fragmented, unpredictable and opaque climate finance will not foster the end of climate insolvency in Africa but could rather impose new risks on all. Africa must ask for an increase in the overall amount of climate finance but also that a specific percentage devoted specifically to the continent. At COP26, Africa should ask for greater transparency and accountability to ensure that rich countries are not robbing traditional ODA to pay their climate finance bills. Beyond the COP, African leaders must vigorously reject climate finance conditionalities that seek to compromise the energy security of their countries, while at the same time showing demonstratable commitment to embrace renewables as the energy of the future. Africa must also invest its resources to develop capabilities in the manufacturing and deployment of renewable energy technologies to meet their growing energy demands. They must know that switching from dependence on the importation of fossil fuel from Europe to dependence on Chinese imported solar panels is not a good definition of sustainable green transition for Africa.Chukwumerije Okereke is the Director, Centre for Climate Change and Development, Alex-Ekwueme Federal University Ndufu-Alike, Nigeria.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Premium Times.

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria85","COP26: Earth is burning, people are talking","October 27, 2021 Wednesday","The Punch","Olamide Francis Published 28 October 2021Climate change has become a global challenge with far-reaching catastrophic consequences. Not just in sub-Saharan Africa and countries in South Asia or the Antarctic, but in cities in America like New York, in Germany and in London, where 2021 summer was marred by flash flooding and various consequences of heatwaves. It should now be clear to those who have persistently denied the realness of climate change that it is not just real but proliferates as a result of human activities a.k.a industrialisation. The fight against any agent of environmental destruction must be taken seriously as COVID-19 since both are rooted in the same abusive economic behaviour and have proven to be deadly for humans.I will not be exploring the nexus between COVID-19 and climate change in this essay but many have argued that this same process (human activity) is also responsible for COVID-19 and other disease outbreaks. I couldn't agree more because the need for more natural resources has forced humans to encroach on various natural habitats and expose themselves to yet unknown pathogens.The Conference of Parties (COP) summit and the G20COP26) is in Glasgow, Scotland.The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change adopted by 196 Parties at COP21 in Paris on December 12, 2015 and entered into force on November 4, 2016. Keep this treaty in mind as it shall form the basis of this essay.Has anything changed since the start of the COP? Are treaties adhered to? What tangible results have been recorded as a result of the meetings? Maybe we should ask members of the G20.One of the world's most comprehensive reviews of G20 climate action, the climate Transparency Report 2019, said, G20 countries are together responsible for approximately 80% (some reports put it at 85%) of global GHG emissions. A 2021 research by World Resources Institute and Climate Analytics finds that if G20 countries set ambitious, 1.5\'b0C-aligned emission reduction targets for 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by 2050, global temperature rise at the end of the century could be limited to 1.7\'b0C.Clearly, the responsibility rests on developed countries, who are also major stakeholders at COP, to do more to address climate change. Simon Stiell, climate and environment minister of Grenada, echoes what's on my mind when he spoke to the UK Guardian newspaper: ""All eyes are now on the G20. They must step up. There is a significant gap between what has been pledged [on cutting emissions] and what is needed \- the big question is how we treat that gap.""The Paris AgreementAlthough the Paris Agreement is a five-year cycle, environmental problems and their corresponding solutions are accumulative. You can't ignore environmental problems in the first two cycles with an intent to catch up in the next three. Every long-term goal requires a short-term goal.The goal of the Paris Agreement was simple: To limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels. It also aims to reach global net-zero emissions, where the amount of greenhouse gases emitted equals the amount removed from the atmosphere, in the second half of the century. (This is also known as being climate neutral or carbon neutral.) The agreement also provides a support framework for poor countries in terms of finance, technology and capacity development.One of the major flaws with this agreement is that countries are allowed to set their own targets with no enforcement mechanisms to ensure they meet them. The United States, the world's second-largest emitter, even withdrew from the accord without repercussions in a 2020 move by former President Donald Trump, before President Joe Biden re-entered the United States into the agreement during his first months in office. Also, there is no carbon tax (a financial incentive for countries to stop using cheap fossil fuels and transition to more sustainable sources.)The UN described the progress so far by saying that, ""By 2030, zero-carbon solutions could be competitive in sectors representing over 70% of global emissions."" However, when we consider this on a holistic level, GHGs have not stopped increasing since 2015 and we know those that are responsible.Solutions and ReviewWe can draw some conclusions from the compliance rate with the Paris Agreement. Either the developed countries responsible for a lion share of GHG emissions are obsessed with industrialisation and growing the economy instead of the planet or the treaty failed from the start. Albeit, even without such a treaty, countries must still acknowledge that we have a problem at hand and rise up to the challenge.COP26 must not be business as usual. If we still have to stick with the Paris Agreement, then it requires revision. Issues like carbon tax, penalties for erring nations, incentives for sustainability investment, stoppage of fossil fuel subsidy, regulatory bodies to hold countries accountable and a review of BECCS (bioenergy with carbon capture and storage) technology on which the Paris Agreement is based. You may not agree to these things but you will agree that much 'climatic' progress has not been made from 2015 till now.Olamide Francis is a writer, freelance journalist and M.A student at the University of East London.

While in Nigeria, Ford will meet with the Federal Government of Nigeria, State Governors, as well as faith leaders, civil society and business leaders.Onyeama who expressed gratitude to the Government of the United Kingdom for the extensive and significant support in diverse areas, stated that the West African sub-region is facing huge security challenges, including governance challenges.He noted that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a big hit on the economies of the world and also expressed profound gratitude to the United Kingdom for support during the period, particularly vaccines and other support in the area of health.Onyeama added that the United Kingdom has been involved in the security of the West African sub-region, saying that a lot is going on in the sub-region, particularly in Mali, Guinea and Burkina Faso with the support of the United Nations.""So, we look forward to continuing to cooperate with you in this area because we feel that it is not something that we can do alone in the sub-region.""We need the United Nations' support and also the support of European countries. We have been engaged and in the framework of the G5 Sahel and other initiatives,"" Onyeama said.On her part, Ford recalled the detailed defence and security meetings which took place in London two weeks ago between security advisers of both countries.Ford said the meetings were to really see how the United Kingdom can help in the partnership to strengthen some of the challenges Nigeria faced in terms of security.""So, I am looking forward to helping to build on that and continue to see that work during my time here,"" Ford said.Speaking further on the specific assistance the United Kingdom plans to render Nigeria, Ford said the United Kingdom will be discussing with the Nigerian Government, how to help in community policing, training and improving the police because the police can help the community feel safer.Ford however emphasised that the move is a partnership and not the United Kingdom telling Nigeria what to do.""This was us listening, sharing experiences, especially from the national security areas which we may have seen and experienced both in our country, but also, from what we are seeing across the world and bringing our experiences together,"" Ford also said.In the area of corruption, Ford said the United Kingdom and Nigeria will be signing a Memorandum of Understanding, a commitment on corruption that includes returning of payments that the United Kingdom has been helping to tackle.The Memorandum of Understanding which will be signed by the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, will witness the return of \£3210,000 pounds illegal payment to secure a contract.The UK is providing up to \£310 million of concessional aid to reduce the risk for pension and insurance funds to invest in energy access projects, and support Nigeria's COP26 commitmentsThe financing will help Nigerian investors focus on low carbon energy, supporting off-grid, low-carbon energy projects. The \£310 million will be blended to de-risk transactions and therefore mobilise domestic institutional investment from local pension funds, insurance firms and other local institutional investors. This will help scale up domestic financing for eligible off-grid clean energy infrastructure, such as solar mini-grid and home systems, clean cooking infrastructure and SME cold storage infrastructure in Nigeria.""The UK is committed to increasing both renewable energy and energy access in Nigeria, driving clean, sustainable and resilient growth. As the world looks to transition to clean growth, we are witnessing an era-defining opportunity for the private sector. This transaction is particularly exciting as it brings together UK government support with the institutional capital which is essential to grow the sector at scale,"" Ford said.He explained that the finance initiative will provide affordable long-term financing from local investors for the low carbon energy sector to support scaling up of off-grid low carbon energy projects in unserved and underserved communities.It will also support the implementation of Nigeria's Nationally Determined Contributions plan, which Nigeria submitted to the UNFCCC before COP26, its Energy Transition Plan, which was presented by the Nigerian government at COP26, and Nigeria's plans to increase energy access including the Solar Naija programme.\l"

Demand is also likely to be up 6% year-on-year.Last year's surge in new coal plants of about 25.2 GW in China, the world's top climate polluter, nearly offset coal plant closures in the rest of the world of 25.6 GW, the GEM report said.Although China pledged to bring greenhouse gas emissions to a peak ""before 2030"" and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, however, its focus recently shifted towards energy security. Countries like Germany have also been reconsidering using more coal to replace Russian natural gas.""China's influence on coal markets is difficult to overstate,"" the IEA said in a statement.""China's power generation, including district heating, accounts for one-third of global coal consumption. China's overall coal use is more than half of the global total.

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria95","ANALYSIS: COP26: Nigeria's plan to cut carbon emission to net-zero by 2060 is short on details","November 3, 2021 Wednesday","Premium Times","Nigeria, Nov. 3 -- On the second day of the world leaders summit of the ongoing United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP26, in Glasgow, UK, President Muhammad Buhari made a commitment that Nigeria will cut its carbon emission to net-zero by 2060.While acknowledging the importance of COP26 in the midst of obvious changes in the climate, Mr Buhari said that climate change is not about the problem of the future but about what is already happening.""Desertification in the north, drought in the centre, pollution in the coast are enough evidence for all to see, Nigeria is committed to net-zero by 2060,"" he said on Tuesday.While addressing world leaders, Mr Buhari said Nigeria has developed a detailed energy transition plan and roadmap based on data and evidence and that with Nigeria's transition plan, gas will play a key role in transitioning the country's economy across sectors and the data and evidence show Nigeria can continue to use gas until 2040 without detracting from the goals of the Paris agreement.Earlier on Monday, Mr Buhari joined French President Emmanuel Macron, Prince Charles, and the Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Ghazouani at a COP 26 side event entitled ""Accelerating land restoration in Africa, the case of the Great Green Wall (GGW) initiative.""The Nigerian leader used the occasion of his address to appeal to fellow leaders to continue to make concerted efforts at land restoration.''I am optimistic that Africa's ambition of restoring over 100 million hectares of degraded landscape for productive agriculture is achievable,'' he said.President Buhari also pledged Nigeria's unalloyed commitment to expanding the achievements of the GGW programme in Africa from the enviable status attained under the leadership of President Mohamed Ould Ghazouani of Mauritania.''Together we commit to the transformative process of restoring the African degraded landscape and ultimately the continent's environment,'' he said.But while the president's statement and commitments at COP26 have attracted commendation from different quarters including American billionaire Jeff Bezos, who heaped praises on the president for his leadership role in restoring degraded lands in the country and commitment to restore 4 million hectares, climate experts and activists have raised questions on how realistic Nigeria's commitment is.In an interview with PREMIUM TIMES, the Director of Centre for Climate Change and Development at the Alex Ekwueme Federal University, Ebonyi State, Chuks Okereke, said it is good news that the president pledged a plan to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2060 but the question is where the numbers came from. He said the details are not in the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) submitted by the Nigerian government.""I think on the positive side we could appreciate the bold announcement and the president's intent to ensure that Nigeria joins the global green transition. However on the other hand we should question the intention to implement and the source of the data given that this ambition is not in the NDC and the long term vision document recently prepared by the government.""The president had informed the audience that Nigeria's revised nationally determined contribution has additional priority sectors, water and waste, nature-based solution, adaptation and resilience, vulnerability assessment, clean cooking, gender and green job assessment, as well as a bottom-up renewable energy transition pathway to 2030.According to the NDC submitted in July 2021, Nigeria committed to an unconditional contribution of reducing carbon emissions by 20 per cent below business-as-usual by 2030, while it increased its conditional target to 47 per cent as against the 45 per cent captured in the 2015 NDC.The updated NDC also includes an enhanced contribution by the waste sector, which was not included in the 2015 NDC due to a lack of reliable data.Mr Okereke said that the president's announcement is in contrast to what is in NDC, which raises many questions. The professor said he will be looking forward to the detailed plans available to achieve the goal.Reacting further to the president's speech, Edwin Ikhuoria, ONE Campaign's Africa Executive Director said the Nigerian government's commitment contained the needed language but was loaded with ambition that requires strategic shifts from the current development model.""Substantial emphasis on the need for international cooperation, support, and technology transfer almost portends a hazardous reliance on partners to achieve results. If the world ever needed solidarity, now is the time to make it happen. Otherwise, these words are just mere statements that were loaded with potential excuses,"" he said.Apart from experts' opinions, an article by climate scorecard in August 2021 concluded that if Nigeria were to achieve a goal like becoming carbon neutral, what would be an obstacle, apart from government incompetence, is the nature of the developing economy and the country's overdependence on fossil fuels.""The country's economy is closely tied to oil and gas exports. Profits from petroleum exports currently account for 86% of Nigeria's total export revenue"" (Carbon Brief) Additionally, Oil and Gas collectively provide 70% of Nigeria's revenue. Thus, as a developing economy, Nigeria relies heavily on the production of non-renewable resources. The economy needs all the support it can get so it is very unlikely that Nigeria will slow down any of its oil production. This will make it very hard for the country to become carbon neutral by 2050."" the article concluded.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Premium Times.

In his presentation, Okereke pointed out that at Nigeria has shown a determination to deliver ambitious climate commitments, pronouncements, and pledges in an era of austerity, but noted that concerted effort was now needed to translate the pledges into concrete policies and actions that will help Nigeria build resilience to climate change and achieve sustainable green economic growth.Okereke cited the revised NDC, which has 20 percent unconditional and 47 percent condition emission reduction pledges, the 2050 Long-Term Vision for Nigeria (LTV-2050), the Nigeria Energy Transition Plan, the 2060 net zero pledge by President Buhari at COP26 in Glasgow, the Nigeria Climate Change Act and the ongoing Nigeria Deep Decarbonation Project (DDP- Nigeria), as some examples of the credible and ambitious climate efforts made by the government.Okereke highlighted several concrete steps that Nigeria can take to move beyond policy pronouncements into implementation state, noting that Nigeria has not yet developed full GHG inventory (GHGI) and prescribed the key next steps on this to include the establishment of institution for the oversight and coordination of data; establishing data collection, documentation and management system; building a full MRV capacity and improving MRV system over time.On policy and science, Okereke urged for designing and review of the current mitigation policy landscape,the development of a detailed appraisal of priority actions for key sectors, and open access to financing of mitigation actions. He said several climate actions such as clean cooking, climate smart agriculture, distributed renewable energy, green transportation and energy efficiency have the potential to deliver climate objectives as well as wider sustainable development goals such as green jobs, clean air, better health, food and energy security. He said more modelling work and economic analysis were required to quantify net benefits and aid science-based policy. big area of opportunity for climate action in Nigeria is to mainstream climate change into other sectors of the economy, including transportation, water and irrigation, energy, etc, Okereke said. He said, according to the Federal Ministry of Finance, Nigeria's core infrastructure stock is currently estimated at 30 percent of GDP and falls short of the international benchmark of 70 percent.He observed that Nigeria's aspiration and infrastructure target for 30 years is estimated to need no less than USD3 trillion infrastructure investment. He also cited the IFC figure saying that the Paris Agreement has opened up nearly $23 trillion in opportunities for climate-smart investments in emerging markets between now and 2030.Investing in green infrastructures is the only way for Nigeria to scale up climate implementation and achieve long term low carbon and climate resilient development, he said.While making reference to the estimated cost of implementing Nigeria NDCs valued at $177 billion he decried the paltry climate finance status of Nigeria and recommended that Nigeria establishes an institutional arrangement for the oversight and coordination of Climate finance activities, identifies funding gaps and needs, assesses public and private financing options and develops a country climate investment plan among other financial recommendations.He expressed hope that the new Nigeria Climate Change Act as signed by President Buhari provides a robust legal framework needed to improve Nigeria's readiness and drive a full-scale implementation of climate change action that will put Nigeria on the path to a just and green economy.boyega Olorunfemi and Ethelbert E.

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria99","Can COP26 catch up with climate change?","September 7, 2021 Tuesday","The Punch","Greg Odogwu Published 27 August 2020When I saw the news on Tuesday, it eclipsed the uplifting World Health Organisation announcement that Nigeria, and indeed the whole of Africa, has been declared polio-free. Yet, I did not panic. I could only begin a mental journey into the past years when such news came to Nigerians. It is an annual ritual, which always has a way of leading to what is known as ""caution fatigue"". When people wait for the disaster to come upon them without preparation, because they are tired of staying on the alert mode.The news is that the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency warned that Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Nasarawa, Kogi, Anambra, Delta, Edo, Rivers and Bayelsa states, which are contiguous to River Niger, will likely experience severe flooding next month, September. The agency said that the red alert was based on the information received from the regional Niger Basin Authority headquartered in Niamey, to the effect that the flood level of River Niger, monitored in Niamey on Sunday, August 23, was 6.60m.Interestingly, the Director General of NIHSA, Clement Nze, made it clear that we should be worried because Nigeria is located at the lowest portion of the Niger Basin. He said that the flood magnitude sighted in Niamey is expected to arrive Nigeria through Kebbi State around September 6, 2020.I must say that the NIHSA warning did not get me anxious. Rather, it got me angry. I am angry at the type of political leadership we have in our country because such warnings always seem to fall on deaf ears. In a best case scenario, the government will prepare for knee-jerk emergency response.Yet, such periodic monitoring of the River Niger Basin is meant to take long-term decisions. When a scientific study and forecast are made, the government ignores them at its own peril. That is why Nigeria, a country that is in a safe zone, meteorologically speaking, will always experience over-flooded water bodies. It happened in the case of River Benue; now it is River Niger. As climate change gets even worse, it may happen in Abuja's Jabi Lake! I will dwell on this next week.Today, I want to throw light on the fact that the global platform for tackling climate change is going to lose a whole year of ""climate diplomacy"" action. Still, within this year, extreme weather events are not relenting. It fact, it seems 2020 is experiencing intense climate crisis, despite the fact that COVID-19 helped us clean some carbon off the atmosphere, sort of. Let us look at what is currently happening in India and the United States of America.As India's weather becomes more extreme, monsoon floods have presently displaced millions of citizens. In the latest incident, at least 22 people have been killed after monsoon-season floods triggered a landslide in the southern Indian state of Kerala. Houses were swept away after the torrential rain and flooding late in the night, while rescuers rummaged through the landslide. The Indian Meteorological Department had issued a red alert for Idukki, warning of extremely heavy rainfall of more than 20cm (eight inches). This is unlike what they were used to in the monsoon season. It is adjudged abnormal in scientific circles. As a result, when the intense rain struck, 20 houses of tea plantation workers and their families were buried under the debris.In America, it is the wildfire in California. Last week, California Governor Gavin Newsom reported that the state was battling 367 known fires, many sparked by intense thunderstorms on August 16-17, caused by moisture from Tropical Storm Fausto. Response and evacuations were complicated by a historic heatwave and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. He declared a state of emergency on August 18.It is important to note that the California wildfire is seasonal, typically occurs August and November when hot, dry winds are most frequent, and does not end until the first significant rainstorm of winter arrives, usually around October in Northern California, and roughly between late October and December in Southern California. But this year is different. Early in the year, there was a concern for the potential 2020 fire season to be prolonged and intense due to the unusually dry months of January and February. These months were recorded as one of the driest two months of any calendar year on record.Of course, the ecological tallies are skyrocketing as a result of climate change. And the COP is not happening this year. This is why for those who love the environment, COVID-19 hit below the belt. In light of the unprecedented pandemic, the 26th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the 16th meeting of the parties to the Kyoto Protocol, and the third meeting of the parties to the Paris Agreement, scheduled to hold in November 2020, in Glasgow, Scotland, was postponed until November 1-12, 2021.Generally known as the United Nations Climate Change Conference, or COP26, the event was highly anticipated to galvanise the world into stepping up ambition to save the environment we all live in, as climate change is now an undeniable threat to every form of life on Earth. With the worsening extreme weather events and the inability of poorer nations to adapt to emerging ecological challenges, the UN Climate Change process is central for a collective action.But, alas, COP26Some observers noted that though not directly related, the postponement will give the international community time to respond to the outcome of the United States presidential election. This is crucial because incumbent president Donald Trump has vowed to withdraw the US from the Paris Climate Agreement, but can only do this if he wins this election; while his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, has pledged to stay in the Paris Accord and increase ambition to reduce emissions.Nonetheless, it is pertinent to look with renewed hope towards the 2021 COP, especially with an eye on the rear view mirror. The past COP25 was not particularly a morale booster for any climate action enthusiast. In fact, the Secretary General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, left no one in doubt of its cold comfort, when he declared: ""I am disappointed with the result of COP25. The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaption and finance to tackle the climate crisis.""With the performance of COP25 in mind, the world can only hope that before COP26 kicks off next year, every nation would have recovered enough from COVID-19 pandemic to find the extra breath needed for one last lap towards a safe global climate governance.Meanwhile, the coming climate talks will be the biggest international summit the UK has ever hosted; bringing together over 30,000 delegates including heads of state, climate experts and campaigners to agree coordinated action to tackle climate change. The battered Earth must pray for the best, because the question on the mind of many people is, when COP26 resumes, will the negotiators be able to speed up the process in tandem with worsening climate change?\l"

Russia is home to the largest area of forests globally.""There should be unified standards, unified requirements and the key \- verification. Another issue is for the types of energy such as nuclear and hydropower to be treated as green energy.""President Vladimir Putin, who plans to address the talks via video-link, has said he wants Russia to be carbon neutral no later than by 2060.Russia's fossil-fuel rich Pacific island of Sakhalin, where Kozlov originally comes from, aims for carbon neutrality by 2025, a trial that will be used to help the rest of the country go greener.Kozlov said around half of the annual absorption capacity of Russia's forests, or some 600 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, is lost to fires and logging, so Moscow is doubling financing to 14 billion roubles ($200 million) a year to tackle the fires.Russia's annual net emissions are now 1.6 billion CO2 equivalent, around half that of the 1990s, he said, adding that Moscow was studying ways to pump the gas back into the soil.""Storage should be of a non-degradable material capable of securing safely for over 100 years,"" Kozlov said.Igor Sechin, head of oil major Rosneft, said on Thursday that Russia had the potential to store 1.7 trillion tonnes of CO2.PERMAFROSTRussia, sensitive to melting permafrost in its north where big industrial assets are located and hundreds of thousand of people still live, will set up 140 monitoring wells in the next three years to analyse soil changes 30 metres below the surface.""There are studies showing that permafrost thaw at a depth of 3-4 metres could melt Arctic swamps by 2100.

Then an interaction with the academic community at Imperial College followed by meetings of the Global Energy Alliance and presentations on the Nigeria Energy Transition Plan and Nigeria's Integrated Energy Plan.Prof. Osinbajo observed at Imperial College that Africa as a continent is home to the world's youngest fastest growing population and in order to create jobs and enable climate-smart industrialization, 'the scale and quality of electricity services must increase significantly.'Continuing, the VP noted that the scaling up in the Nigerian context is based on clean energy, a reflection of the FG's commitment to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.He said this 'means building sustainability into our economic planning, and so our Economic Sustainability Plan, includes a plan to provide 5 million homes with cleaner energy through its decentralized solar power programme. This means an estimated 25 million Nigerians would have access to solar power.'The first phase of this plan is already underway, and we think that this sort of programme will very quickly ramp up our progress towards net-zero emissions.'But he explained that the moves to defund gas projects wouldn't help the 'whole enterprise,' which 'requires gas, especially if we are putting it on the grid. We want to be able to put renewable energy on the grid, we need power for industry, and of course, we are looking at the significant cost of that.'According to him, 'limiting the development of gas projects, poses dire challenges for African nations, while making an insignificant dent in global emissions. Energy demand in Nigeria and across Africa is set to rise, as indeed it must, to deliver the industrialization, jobs and economy-wide progress people deserve.'In addition, the VP explained that 'the energy access element of the transition must be linked with the emission reduction aspect of the transition. For too long we have considered these to be parallel tracks. However, pathways to reaching net-zero by 2050 have to include first ending energy poverty by 2030.'If energy access issues are left unaddressed, we will continue to see growing energy demand being addressed with high polluting and deforesting fuels such as diesel, kerosene and firewood.'On current energy consumption patterns globally, Prof. Osinbajo noted that 'energy consumption in developing countries has doubled in the last 15 years, and is expected to grow another 30% in the next fifteen years. So making capital available to fulfil the growing energy demand in these regions of the world is central to reaching the goals of the Paris Agreement.'He highlighted the disparity in global energy investments, noting that 'while representing just 15% of the world's population, high income countries received 40% of global energy investment in 2018. Conversely, developing countries with 40% of the world's population received just 15% of global energy investments.'The VicePresident said 'Nigeria has already made a commitment to have 30 percent of our electricity supply from renewables by 2030. Also natural gas is currently used for industry, fertilizer manufacturing, and cooking - which are more difficult to transition than power generation.'He affirmed that Nigeria is 'resolutely committed to all of our national determined contributions under the Paris Agreement, and we have in fact updated our commitments in our new Energy Transition Plan.

The delegations ranged from coal- and gas-fuelled superpowers to oil producers and Pacific islands being swallowed by the rise in sea levels.The two-week conference in Glasgow, extended into an extra day of tortuous negotiations, was the 26th of its kind but the first to call for a reduction in fossil fuels, which not only power much of the world's economy but are also the main cause of manmade global warming.But there was last-minute drama as India, whose energy needs are hugely dependent on the coal it has in abundance - raised last-minute objections to this part of the agreement.The clause was hurriedly amended to accelerating 'efforts to phase down unabated coal power, and phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies', weakening what had been 'efforts to phase out'.The change was met with dismay by the rich economies of the European Union and Switzerland as well as the Marshall Islands, one of the small Pacific island states whose existence is under threat from rising sea levels.'The approved texts are a compromise. They reflect the interests, the conditions, the contradictions and the state of political will in the world today,' said U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.'They take important steps, but unfortunately the collective political will was not enough to overcome some deep contradictions.''DEEP DISAPPOINTMENT'Sharma had had the onerous task of balancing the demands of climate-vulnerable nations, big industrial powers, and those like India and China whose consumption or exports of fossil fuels are vital to their economic development.His voice broke with emotion after he heard vulnerable nations express their anger over the last-minute changes.'May I just say to all delegates I apologise for the way this process has unfolded and I am deeply sorry,' he told the assembled delegates.'I also understand the deep disappointment but I think, as you have noted, it's also vital that we protect this package.'The overarching aim that he set before the conference was one that climate campaigners and vulnerable countries had found far too modest - namely, to 'keep alive' the 2015 Paris Agreement's target to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.The agreement in effect acknowledged that commitments made so far to cut emissions of planet-heating greenhouse gases are nowhere near enough, and asked nations to set tougher climate pledges next year, rather than every five years, as they are currently required to do.Scientists say that to go beyond a rise of 1.5C would unleash extreme sea level rise and catastrophes including crippling droughts, monstrous storms and wildfires far worse than those the world is already suffering.'THE ERA OF COAL IS ENDING''They changed a word but they can't change the signal coming out of this COP, that the era of coal is ending,' she said. 'If you're a coal company executive, this COP saw a bad outcome.'Developing countries argue that rich nations, whose historical emissions are largely responsible for heating up the planet, must pay more to help them adapt to its consequences as well as reducing their carbon footprints.The deal gave the poorest nations more promises, but no guarantees, that they would finally get more of the financial help they have long been told they will get.It urged rich countries to double finance for climate adaptation by 2025 from 2019 levels, offering funding that has been a key demand of small island nations at the conference.Adaptation funds primarily go to the very poorest countries and currently take up only a small fraction of climate funding.A U.N. committee will also report next year on progress towards delivering the $100 billion per year in overall annual climate funding that rich nations had promised by 2020 but failed to deliver. And governments will be summoned to meet in 2022, 2024 and 2026 to discuss climate finance. read moreYet even $100 billion a year is far short of poorer countries' actual needs, which could hit $300 billion by 2030 in adaptation costs alone, according to the United Nations, in addition to economic losses from crop failure or climate-related disasters.\l"
"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria107","UK Injects \'c2\'a310m Into Nigeria's Energy Sector","February 22, 2022","This Day (Lagos)","The United Kingdom has injected \£310 million into Nigeria's low carbon energy project. The concessional aid is aimed at reducing the risks, for pension and insurance funds' to invest in energy access projects, and support Nigeria's COP26 commitments.UK also signed an agreement with the Nigerian government that would enable a compensation of \£3210,610 to the country following a successful investigation by the British Serious Fraud Office on the use of corrupt agents in the oil and gas sector.The governments of Nigeria, United Kingdom of Great Britain, and Northern Ireland, yesterday, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in a joint commitment to continue the fight against corruption.The MoU was signed between UK's Minister for Africa, Vicky Ford, and the Attorney General of the Federal and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, who was represented by Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Justice, Mohammed Umar. It sets out the terms and understanding between the governments of the United Kingdom and Nigeria to make the compensation payment.During the signing of the MoU, Ford said, ""The Security and Defence Dialogue held in February 2022 between our two countries reaffirmed both the UK and Nigeria's commitment to work together to tackle illicit financial flows, bribery, and corruption.""The UK has a zero tolerance policy to corruption and we hope that today's signing sends a clear statement about our commitment to this.""She noted that in a global economy where international trade was vital, it was more important than ever that companies operate with integrity and transparency.Illicit financial flows, bribery, and corruption have been identified as major hindrances to economic growth, trade, stable governance, and the security of both countries.The compensation payment from the UK to Nigeria was secured after a four-year corruption investigation led by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) in the UK. The money was obtained through a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA), which meant the prosecutor agreed to defer prosecution in exchange for the defendant agreeing to fulfil certain requirements, such as accepting criminal liability for offences and paying the appropriate compensation.In this case, the DPA was agreed with Amec Foster Wheeler (AFWEL), in relation to the use of corrupt agents in the oil and gas sector.The compensation payment demonstrated that when such crimes were identified, the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) would investigate the companies and, where evidence was found, ensure that they faced appropriate sanctions.In March 2021, the UK government returned \£34.2 million to Nigeria from funds recovered from associates of former Delta State Governor James Ibori.However, in this case, ""The Government of the United Kingdom will transfer the compensation amount in the sum of \£3210,610 (118.4 million Naira) within twenty-eight (28) days from the date of signing this MOU.""In both instances, the MoU's confirm that the Nigerian government has pledged to use the returned funds for projects that will benefit and improve the country.""The UK will remain committed to returning all illegal assets, no matter the amount, as per the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC).""UK's Director of the Serious Fraud Office, Lisa Osofsky said, ""We have a zero tolerance approach to companies who think they can bribe their way to financial success. Bribery and corruption not only stifle real economic growth and free trade, they also damage democracy and, therefore, risk the security of all our countries.""I am, of course, delighted that the tenacity of my SFO colleagues has resulted in the people of Nigeria being compensated in a way that will truly benefit them.""Malami, while thanking the UK for the gesture, promised that the repatriated fund would be expended on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Abuja to Kano road, and the Second Niger Bridge.On UK's injection of \£310 million of concessional financing alongside InfraCredit to mobilise pension and insurance investments, the statement noted that it would help to reduce the risk for pension and insurance funds to invest in energy access projects, and support Nigeria's COP26 commitments.The financing would also help Nigerian investors focus on low carbon energy, and support off-grid, low-carbon energy projects. Additionally, the \£310 million would be blended to de-risk transactions and, therefore, mobilise domestic institutional investment from local pension funds, insurance firms and other local institutional investors. This would help scale up domestic financing for eligible off-grid clean energy infrastructure, such as solar mini-grid and home systems, clean cooking infrastructure and SME cold storage infrastructure in Nigeria.UK Minister for Africa, Vicky Ford, speaking on the investment, said, ""The UK is committed to increasing both renewable energy and energy access in Nigeria, driving clean, sustainable and resilient growth.""As the world looks to transition to clean growth, we are witnessing an era-defining opportunity for the private sector. This transaction is particularly exciting as it brings together UK government support with the institutional capital, which is essential to grow the sector at scale.""This innovative blended finance initiative will provide affordable long-term financing from local investors for the low carbon energy sector to support scaling up of off-grid low carbon energy projects in unserved and underserved communities.""This initiative will support the implementation of Nigeria's Nationally Determined Contributions plan, which Nigeria submitted to the UNFCCC before COP26, its Energy Transition Plan, which was presented by the Nigerian government at COP26, and Nigeria's plans to increase energy access, including the Solar Naija programme.""On his part, the MD/CEO, Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA), and Chairman of InfraCredit, Uche Orji said:""InfraCredit is pleased to be working with FCDO to mobilise private investment from domestic pension funds and other institutional investors into such an important developmental area as low carbon energy access.""This programme is aligned with NSIA's other clean energy initiatives which aims to deliver up to 250-500MW of renewable energy capacity in Nigeria that will reduce annual CO2 emissions, alleviate poverty, create jobs and support local economic growth.""Speaking at the announcement, the Minister of State for Power, Mr. Godwin Jedy-Agba, said with the support from the UK Government's Energy Transition Council showed the pathway to an energised economy and carbon neutrality by 2060. The assistance also highlighted the need for additional investments of $410 billion above business as usual over the next 40 years.Jedy-Agba stated, ""Whereas all efforts have been geared towards unlocking private sector activity in the clean energy transition, one major challenge continues to be private sector access to local currency financing. This is where local institutions such as pension and insurance funds have a key role to play, as only these institutions possess the scale of local currency liquidity required to accelerate the transition.""The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, at a meeting with Ford said the federal government looked forward to cooperate with the United Kingdom (UK) in the security of the West African sub-region.Onyeama received, in audience, the United Kingdom Minister for Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean. He expressed gratitude to the government of the United Kingdom for its extensive and significant support in diverse areas, stating that the West African sub-region is facing huge security challenges, including governance challenges.He noted that the COVID-19 pandemic had a big hit on the economies of the world and also expressed gratitude to the United Kingdom for support during the period, particularly with vaccines and other support in the area of health.Onyeama added that the United Kingdom had been involved in the security of the West African sub-region, saying a lot is going on in the sub-region, particularly in Mali, Guinea and Burkina Faso with the support of the United Nations.The minister said, ""So, we look forward to continue to cooperate with you in this area because we feel that it is not something that we can do alone in the sub-region.""We need the United Nations' support and also the support of European countries. We have been engaged and in the framework of the G5 Sahel and other initiatives.""Speaking further on the specific assistance the United Kingdom planned to render Nigeria, Ford said the UK would be discussing with the Nigerian government how to help in community policing, training and improving the police.Ford, however, emphasised that the move was a partnership and not the United Kingdom telling Nigeria what to do.She added, ""This was us listening, sharing experiences, especially from the national security areas which we may have seen and experienced both in our country, but also, from what we are seeing across the world and bringing our experiences together.""\l"

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria119","Towards a framework for accessing climate finance in Nigeria, By Gori Olusina Daniel","March 3, 2022 Thursday","Premium Times","Nigeria, March 3 -- President Muhammadu Buhari announced Nigeria's commitment to net zero by 2060 at COP26. On the return to Nigeria, he subsequently signed the Climate Change Bill 2021, passed by the National Assembly in October of that year, which then became law.Nigeria's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) provide a high-level strategic vision for climate action in Nigeria. Despite lower-than-expected economic growth, the updated NDCs submitted in July 2021, reflect an increase in ambition from the Intended NDCs submitted in 2015. The updated NDCs reflect an unconditional contribution of 20 per cent below business-as-usual by 2030, and now proposes a 47 per cent lower contribution - around 100 MtCO2e below 2018 levels. This is more ambitious, and consistent with a global 1.5oC pathway, but conditional on international support. As such, the mobilisation of the requisite international support and private sector investment is critical to enabling Nigeria meet its commitments and initiate an irreversible downward trend in GHG emissions this decade.The implementation of climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts in developing nations continue to be constrained by a lack of financial resources. For example, access to finance in developing countries is typically hindered by a lack of bankable projects. While the global community has made a clear commitment to supporting developments in their efforts to adapt and mitigate the impacts of climate change, it is important to note that climate finance is subject to project concepts being well established and developed to be able to scale the finance providers' bankability requirements.Climate Finance Mechanisms and InstrumentsClimate finance mechanisms and instruments are evolving, growing in significance, and they continue to remain central to achieving low-carbon, climate resilient development. Target funds are projected to come from a range of sources, including financial and non-financial, public and private, national and international (see Fig 1 above). Fundamentally, access to the $100 billion per annum committed by the G8 countries at COP26 and other funding sources, will determine if Nigeria is to achieve its commitment to net zero by 2060.Developing a Climate Finance Strategy for Infrastructure DevelopmentIrrespective of the climate credentials of prospective projects, the Investment and Credit Committees of most financiers will need to establish (or work to restructure a project to ensure) that it is financially viable. Consequently, all potential projects must follow the acceptable bankability principles before climate finance can be accessed.With support from UK Nigeria Infrastructure Advisory Facility (UKNIAF), the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) funded programme, the Federal Government of Nigeria is developing a Climate Finance Strategy for Infrastructure Development. Developing a country-specific climate finance strategy is critical and must align with the NDCs implementation plan, which is represented in Nigeria by Sector Action Plans, which presumably should have been reflected in the Medium-Term National Development Plan 2021 - 25 (MTNDP 2021-25), that alongside the NDCs, have established the low-carbon transition policy agenda in Nigeria's medium term planning processes.The proposed Climate Finance Strategy for Infrastructure Development seeks to build on the government's commitment to transition to a low carbon, climate-resilient economy, and outl"

But Canavan was having none of it and was delighted by the conference's end that countries had agreed to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal burning.The communique of COP26 was, according to the Queensland Senator, a ""green light"" for Australia to keep digging and ""supply the world with more coal because that's what brings people out of poverty.""\\xa0 There had ""never been a higher demand"" for coal and a virtuous Australian fossil fuel market would be happy to feed it.With an election campaign in full swing, Canavan has again attempted to slay the net zero emissions dragon, taking the lead from LNP candidate for the seat of Flynn, Colin Boyce.\\xa0 Boyce had suggested that the commitment to net zero was flexible, permitting ""wiggle room"" and a distinct lack of fidelity.On the ABC's Afternoon Briefing program, Canavan went one further in roundly proclaiming that ""net zero is &hellip; dead.""\\xa0 With such remarks, the accord reached between the Liberals and Nationals about achieving net zero emissions by 2050 seemed, not only shaky but erased.\\xa0 ""[UK Prime Minister] Boris Johnson said he is pausing the net zero commitment, Germany is building coal and gas infrastructure, Italy's reopening coal-fired power plants.\\xa0 It's all over. \\xa0It's all over bar the shouting here.""With the election campaign in full swing, these remarks proved unwelcome to his government colleagues.\\xa0 ""This is not the party's position, that's not the Coalition's position and it's not the government's position,"" Morrison confirmed.\\xa0 ""That's his view, it's no surprise, he's held it for a long time, it's been resolved and our policy was set out very clearly.""The Nationals MP Michelle Landry was less diplomatic.\\xa0 ""Pull your head in, Matt,"" she waspishly chided, while Victorian Nationals MP Darren Chester suggested that Canavan had lost not merely the argument but a sense of perspective.\\xa0 ""Matt Canavan is becoming like the Japanese intelligence officer who refused to accept World War II was over and hid in the Philippines jungle for 30 years.""Former Nationals leader, Michael McCormack, did the media rounds suggesting that Canavan's remarks were ""not helpful"".\\xa0 The issue of emission targets had been resolved.\\xa0 ""There are enough sensible people in the National Party to ensure people know we are committed to it.""The discordance in government ranks was a boon to the Labor Party.\\xa0 ""The Liberal and National Parties are in open warfare about their net zero emissions policy, in the middle of an election campaign,"" came the assessment from Labor Senator Murray Watt.Anyone familiar with the Canavan copy book will be touched and dismayed by his entertainingly grotesque readings of climate change.\\xa0 In 2021, he tweeted photos of snow filled scenes in regional New South Wales mocking the idea that there was a rise in global temperatures.\\xa0 He has also been unsparing about the authors of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\\xa0 ""One of the IPCC authors was quoted as saying he hoped this report would scare people so it would help change their vote,"" he recalled.The senator has also become a socialist of sorts, at least when it comes to fossil fuel polluters.\\xa0 Far from being demonised, those in the industry should be coddled and cushioned from the predatory behaviour of banks refusing to fork out financing for new mines.\\xa0 ""Global banks that want to control who has a job in Australia should be locked out of our country.""\\xa0 Australians should well ""pay higher interest rates but that would be worth it to protect our independence"".In 2020, he told an Australian national program that the idea of zero emissions was never something that had been put to the electorate.\\xa0 ""The Australian people have never voted for net zero emissions&hellip; We seem to try and get bullied into these positions that the Australian people didn't vote for."" He also attacked the Paris climate agreement as ""transferring industrial wealth from the west and from Australia to China, a country that's bullying and threatening us.""\\xa0 (It must surely strike Canavan as ironic that China's demand for Australian commodities, notably iron ore, remains insatiable.)With such attitudes, Canavan is bound to win a fair share of votes. His unabashed hostility to environmental activists and his adoration of coal continues to sell well as a message in parts of his home state.\\xa0 It is proving less convincing in Australia's metropolitan centres, increasingly terrified by a planet on the boil.Dr. Binoy Kampmark was a Commonwealth Scholar at Selwyn College, Cambridge.\\xa0 He currently lectures at RMIT University.\\xa0 Email: HYPERLINK bkampmark@gmail.com \l"

Domestically it produces cocoa and palm oil but it also imports palm oil from Southeast Asia.""Forests are the largest natural carbon sink and a vital harbour of biodiversity but they are disappearing at an alarming rate. Nigeria has one of the highest deforestation rates globally, it loses approximately 350,000 - 400,000 hectares per year. Logging, agriculture and collection of fuelwood are the leading causes of forest loss in Nigeria.""Through programmes such as Investments in Forests and Sustainable Land-Use (IFSLU), the UK Government is supporting a shift to sustainable supply chains for agricultural commodities associated with deforestation, including palm oil and cocoa, and creating new investment opportunities in sustainable land use through public-private partnerships.""IFSLU has worked with Edo State - one of the major forest states in Nigeria, and a leading palm oil state. Edo State Government has committed to responsible oil palm production, becoming a member of the UK-funded Tropical Forest Alliance 2020 (TFA 2020) Africa Palm Oil Initiative (APOI) in May 2018 and the UK-led Just Rural Transition in September 2019.""The UK Government, the statement said, is keen to intensify our partnership with Nigeria to ensure an inclusive vision and effective action for sustainable agriculture, forests and land use economy, these areas have the potential to address major barriers to development around poverty, food and nutrition insecurity, unemployment, environmental degradation and instability.Nature, including protecting forests while promoting development and trade, remains one of our main ambitions for and we will use our COP Presidency to bring forest-risk commodity consumer countries, producer countries, and companies together to meet this challenge and make the most of a market transition to sustainable commodity trade.Global collaboration and an all-society approach, involving everyone from political leaders to businesses through to individual consumers, is needed to protect the planet's biodiversity and establish a sustainable future.COP26 President-Designate, Alok Sharma said: ""The FACT Dialogue has much work ahead to deliver on its objectives as we move towards COP26. But the publication of today's joint statement marks a highly important first step in laying the foundation for our work.""To have brought so many countries together, both producers and consumers, and to plan a way forward on sustainable trade is a fantastic start. I am confident that this is just the beginning as we work to protect trade and development, and our biodiversity-rich forests, in equal measure.""British High Commissioner, Catriona Laing said:""Nigeria's active engagement in the COP26 FACT Dialogue and their endorsement of the joint statement is very welcome.

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria136","COP26: Demystifying the Jargons","November 1, 2021 Monday","Premium Times","Nigeria, Nov. 1 -- As with many issues, one of the major problems of climate change is the difficulty in understanding technical terms that come with the whole conversation and as COP26 begins, PREMIUM TIMES has compiled a list of terms that will dominate global news for the next 12 days of the conference and beyond. Did you miss the previous article on what COP26 is all about? You can read it here. Also, here is an analysis of what is expected of the Nigerian government as far as climate change is concerned as we head to COP26.If we continue as we are, temperatures will carry on rising, bringing even more catastrophic flooding, bush fires, extreme weather and destruction of species.Here is a glossary of technical jargons that you will come across in the coming days.1.5CThe 1.5C scenarios require radical reductions in unabated fossil fuel use, the rapid expansion of non-fossil energy sources and planetary-scale carbon dioxide removal. To reach a 1.5-degree pathway, new cultivation approaches would need to prevail, leading to a 53 per cent reduction in the intensity of methane emissions from rice cultivation by 2050.AAUAssigned amount unit. A Kyoto Protocol unit equal to 1 metric tonne of CO2 equivalent. Each Annex I Party issues AAUs up to the level of its assigned amount, established pursuant to Article 3, paragraphs 7 and 8, of the Kyoto Protocol. Assigned amount units may be exchanged through emissions trading.ACAdaptation Committee. The Adaptation Committee was established by the Conference of the Parties as part of the Cancun Agreements to promote the implementation of enhanced action on adaptation in a coherent manner under the Convention, inter alia, through various functions.ADPAd hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action. The ADP is a subsidiary body established at COP 17 in Durban in 2011 to develop a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all Parties. The ADP is to complete its work by 2015 in order to adopt this protocol, legal instrument or agreed outcome with legal force at the twenty-first session of the COP and for it to come into effect from 2020.AOSISAlliance of Small Island States. An ad hoc coalition of low-lying and island countries. These nations are particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels and share common positions on climate change. The 43 members and observers are American Samoa, Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Cape Verde, Comoros, Cook Islands, Cuba, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Grenada, Guam, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Kiribati, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Mauritius, Nauru, Netherlands Antilles, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Sao Tome and Principe, Seychelles, Singapore, Solomon Islands, St. Kitts & Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, US Virgin Islands, and Vanuatu.Article 4.1An article of the Convention stipulating general commitments assumed by all Parties, developing or developed.Biomass fuels or biofuelsA fuel produced from dry organic matter or combustible oils produced by plants.These fuels are considered renewable as long as the vegetation producing them is maintained or replanted, such as firewood, alcohol fermented from sugar, and combustible oils extracted from soybeans. Their use in place of fossil fuels cuts greenhouse gas emissions because the plants that are the fuel sources capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.Carbon marketA popular (but misleading) term for a trading system through which countries may buy or sell units of greenhouse-gas emissions in an effort to meet their national limits on emissions, either under the Kyoto Protocol or under other agreements, such as that among member states of the European Union. The term comes from the fact that carbon dioxide is the predominant greenhouse gas, and other gases are measured in units called ""carbon-dioxide equivalents.""Cartagena DialogueA collection of around 40 countries working towards an ambitious legally binding agreement under the UNFCCC, and who are committed to becoming or remaining low carbon domestically. Participants include Antigua & Barbuda, Australia, Bangladesh, Barbados, Burundi, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ethiopia, European Union, France, Gambia, Georgia, Germany, Ghana, Grenada, Guatemala, Indonesia, Kenya, Lebanon, Malawi, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Panama, Peru, Rwanda, Samoa, Spain, Swaziland, Sweden, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Uganda, UAE, and the United Kingdom.Chair (or Chairman, Chairperson, etc.)National delegates elected by participating governments to lead the deliberations of the Convention's subsidiary bodies. Different chairs may be elected for other informal groups. The Chair is responsible for facilitating progress towards an agreement and serves during the inter-sessional period until the next COP.Clearing houseA service that facilitates and simplifies transactions among multiple parties.CMAConference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement. All States that are Parties to the Paris Agreement are represented at the CMA, while States that are not Parties participate as observers. The CMA oversees the implementation of the Paris Agreement and takes decisions to promote its effective implementation. More information here.CMSConvention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. It is also known as the Bonn Convention and is an environmental treaty of the United Nations that provides a global platform for the conservation and sustainable use of terrestrial, aquatic and avian migratory animals and their habitats.CMPConference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol. The Convention's supreme body is the COP, which serves as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol. The sessions of the COP and the CMP are held during the same period to reduce costs and improve coordination between the Convention and the Protocol. More information here.CO2/Carbon dioxideCarbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas: a heat-absorbing and radiating gas. Unlike oxygen or nitrogen, which make up the majority of our atmosphere, greenhouse gases retain heat and slowly release it, much like bricks in a fireplace after the fire has gone out. Without this natural greenhouse effect, the average annual temperature on Earth would be below freezing, rather than near 60degF. Increases in greenhouse gases, on the other hand, have thrown the Earth's energy budget off kilter, trapping more heat and rising the planet's average temperature.Committee of the WholeOften created by a COP to aid in negotiating text. It consists of the same membership as the COP. When the Committee has finished its work, it turns the text over to the COP, which finalizes and then adopts the text during a plenary session.Compliance CommitteeA committee that helps facilitate, promote and enforce compliance with the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol. It has 20 members with representation spread among various regions, small-island developing states, Annex I parties and non-Annex I parties, and functions through a plenary, a bureau, a facilitative branch and an enforcement branch.ComplianceFulfilment by countries/businesses/individuals of emission reduction and reporting commitments under the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol.COPConference of the Parties. The supreme body of the Convention. It currently meets once a year to review the Convention's progress. The word ""conference"" is not used here in the sense of ""meeting"" but rather of ""association"". The ""Conference"" meets in sessional periods, for example, the ""fourth session of the Conference of the Parties."" More information here.EITCountries with Economies in Transition. Central and East European countries and former republics of the Soviet Union in transition from state-controlled to market economies.Emission reduction unit (ERU)Emissions tradingOne of the three Kyoto mechanisms, by which an Annex I Party may transfer Kyoto Protocol units to, or acquire units from, another Annex I Party. An Annex I Party must meet specific eligibility requirements to participate in emissions trading.Financial MechanismTo facilitate the provision of climate finance, the Convention established a financial mechanism to provide funds to developing country Parties. The financial mechanism also serves the Kyoto Protocol. The Convention states that the operation of the financial mechanism can be entrusted to one or more existing international entities. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) has served as an operating entity of the financial mechanism for many years and at COP 17 in 2011, Parties also decided to designate the Green Climate Fund (GCF) as an operating entity of the financial mechanism. The financial mechanism is accountable to the COP, which decides on its policies, programme priorities and eligibility criteria for funding.Green Climate Fund (GCF)At COP16 in Cancun in 2010, Governments established a Green Climate Fund as an operating entity of the financial mechanism of the Convention under Article 11. The GCF will support projects, programmes, policies and other activities in developing Parties. The Fund will be governed by the GCF Board. More information here.Greenhouse gases (GHGs)The atmospheric gases responsible for causing global warming and climate change. The major GHGs are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N20). Less prevalent -but very powerful - greenhouse gases are hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6).Group of 77 (G-77) and ChinaA large negotiating alliance of developing countries that focuses on numerous international topics, including climate change. The G-77 was founded in 1967 under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). It seeks to harmonise the negotiating positions of its 131 member states.""Hot air""Refers to the concern that some governments will be able to meet their targets for greenhouse-gas emissions under the Kyoto Protocol with minimal effort and could then flood the market with emissions credits, reducing the incentive for other countries to cut their own domestic emissions.Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)Kyoto ProtocolIt is an international agreement standing on its own, and requiring separate ratification by governments, but linked to the UNFCCC. The Kyoto Protocol, among other things, sets binding targets for the reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions by industrialized countries.Kyoto mechanismsThree procedures established under the Kyoto Protocol to increase the flexibility and reduce the cost of making greenhouse-gas emissions cuts. They are the Clean Development Mechanism, Emissions Trading and Joint Implementation.Least Developed Countries (LDCs)The world's poorest countries. The criteria currently used by the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) for designation as an LDC include low income, human resource weakness and economic vulnerability. Currently 48 countries have been designated by the UN General Assembly as LDCs.Least Developed Countries Expert Group (LEG)A panel of 13 experts which provides advice to LDCs on the preparation and implementation of national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs) - plans for addressing the urgent and immediate needs of those countries to adapt to climate change.Least Developed Country Fund (LDCF)The LDCF is a fund established to support a work programme to assist Least Developed Country Parties to carry out, inter alia, the preparation and implementation of national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs). The Global Environment Facility, as the entity that operates the financial mechanism of the Convention, has been entrusted to operate this fund. More information here.Loss and damageAt COP 16 in Cancun in 2010, Governments established a work programme in order to consider approaches to address loss and damage associated with climate change impacts in developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change as part of the Cancun Adaptation Framework.Marrakesh AccordsThese are agreements reached at COP-7, which set various rules for ""operating"" the more complex provisions of the Kyoto Protocol. Among other things, the accords include details for establishing a greenhouse-gas emissions trading system; implementing and monitoring the Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism; and setting up and operating three funds to support efforts to adapt to climate change.MeetingA formal gathering that occurs during a ""session."" Each session of the COP, for example, is divided into a number of meetings. A meeting is generally scheduled from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. or from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.MISC documentsDenotes a Miscellaneous document. These documents are not translated and are issued on plain paper with no United Nations masthead. In the UNFCCC process, submissions by Parties are normally issued as miscellaneous documents. They generally contain views or comments published as received from a delegation without formal editing.MitigationIn the context of climate change, a human intervention to reduce the sources or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases. Examples include using fossil fuels more efficiently for industrial processes or electricity generation, switching to solar energy or wind power, improving the insulation of buildings, and expanding forests and other ""sinks"" to remove greater amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.NDC - Nationally Determined ContributionsAs part of the Paris Agreement, every country agreed to communicate or update their emissions reduction targets - their Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) - every five years to reflect their highest possible ambition and a progression over time.These targets set out how far countries plan to reduce emissions across their entire economy and/or in specific sectors. The year 2020 marked the end of the first of these five-year cycles. This means that countries were expected to update their 2030 targets before the meeting in Glasgow.According to Article 4 paragraph 2 of the Paris Agreement, each Party shall prepare, communicate and maintain successive nationally determined contributions (NDCs) that it intends to achieve. Parties shall pursue domestic mitigation measures, with the aim of achieving the objectives of such contributions.ObserversAgencies, non-governmental organizations, and Governments not Parties to the Convention which are permitted to attend, but not vote, at meetings of the COP, the CMP and the subsidiary bodies. Observers may include the United Nations and its specialised agencies; other intergovernmental organisations such as the International Atomic Energy Agency, and accredited non-governmental organizations (NGOs).ProtocolAn international agreement linked to an existing convention, but as a separate and additional agreement which must be signed and ratified by the Parties to the Convention concerned. Protocols typically strengthen a convention by adding new, more detailed commitments.RatificationFormal approval, often by a Parliament or other national legislature, of a convention, protocol, or treaty, enabling a country to become a Party. Ratification is a separate process that occurs after a country has signed an agreement. The instrument of ratification must be deposited with a ""depositary"" (in the case of the Climate Change Convention, the UN Secretary-General) to start the countdown to becoming a Party (in the case of the Convention, the countdown is 90 days).Rio ConventionsThree environmental conventions, two of which were adopted at the 1992 ""Earth Summit"" in Rio de Janeiro: the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and the Convention on Biodiversity (CBD). The third, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), was adopted in 1994. The issues addressed by the three treaties are related - in particular, climate change can have adverse effects on desertification and biodiversity - and through a Joint Liaison Group, the secretariats of the three conventions take steps to coordinate activities to achieve common progress.Rules of procedureThe parliamentary rules that govern the procedures of the COP, the CMP and the subsidiary bodies, covering such matters as decision-making and participation. The COP has not yet formally adopted rules of procedure, but all except one (on voting) are currently being ""applied."" As such, they are commonly referred to as the ""draft rules of procedure being applied"".SecretariatThe office staffed by international civil servants responsible for ""servicing"" the UNFCCC Convention and ensuring its smooth operation. The secretariat makes arrangements for meetings, compiles and prepares reports, and coordinates with other relevant international bodies. The Climate Change Secretariat, which is based in Bonn, Germany, is institutionally linked to the United Nations.""Spill-over effects"" (also referred to as ""rebound effects"" or ""take-back effects"")Reverberations in developing countries caused by actions taken by developed countries to cut greenhouse-gas emissions. For example, emissions reductions in developed countries could lower demand for oil and thus international oil prices, leading to more use of oil and greater emissions in developing nations, partially off-setting the original cuts. Current estimates are that full-scale implementation of the Kyoto Protocol may cause 5 to 20 per cent of emissions reductions in industrialised countries to ""leak"" into developing countries.VulnerabilityThe degree to which a system is susceptible to, or unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes. Vulnerability is a function of the character, magnitude, and rate of climate variation to which a system is exposed, its sensitivity, and its adaptive capacity.YOUNGOYouth non-governmental organisation. YOUNGO is the official youth constituency at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). YOUNGO is made up of organisations and individuals who identify as youth. It is not an organisation, but, rather, a collection of groups and/or individuals.Reference: The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate ChangePublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Premium Times.

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria137","Shift from fossil industry more beneficial for Nigeria's economy - Ministry, NGO","January 25, 2022 Tuesday","Naija 247 News","Abuja, Jan.21, 2022 The Ministry of Environment and the Coalition for Socio-Economic Transformation (COSET) say shift from fossil industry will benefit Nigeria more economically and help to solve climate change challenges.They made the assertion on Friday in Abuja at the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung Nigeria post 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) held in Glasgow in 2021.The post COP 26 meeting was to steer the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung Nigeria and COSET group on climate change engagement for the year.Minister of Environment, Mohammad Abubakar, said that climate change remained the greatest threat to human health in recorded history as it affected lives and livelihood.Abubakar, represented by Mrs Iniobong Abiola-Awe, Deputy Director and Head, Greenhouse Gases Inventory Division, Department of Climate Change, said that there was therefore the need to seek ways to address it.According to him, the nation is living under the unceasing threat of intensifying maximum and minimum temperatures, rising sea levels, droughts, storms, heat waves, wildfires, hurricanes and warming oceans.The minister said that these effects could directly harm life, destroy habitats and create challenges to livelihoods and communities.He said that it was within this context that the COP26 in Glasgow Climate Pact of 2021 had four overarching goals that guided the course of negotiations and key outcomes.He said that these are to secure global net-zero by mid-century and keep warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius within reach; adapt to protect communities and natural habitats; mobilise finance and work together to deliver.'The major commitments at COP26 are to curb methane emissions and reverse forest loss; align the finance sector with net-zero by 2050; accelerate the phase-down of coal and phase-out of fossil fuels.'There is no doubt that with the right investments, it aims at making production processes more environmentally friendly with less use of natural resources.'There will be millions of jobs for the youths in the green economy more than there have ever been in the fossil fuel industry.' Regardless of our heavy reliance on oil, the 'fossil' jobs that may be lost under the energy transition plan will be compensated by even more jobs as renewable create crucial benefits to the environment, society and economy,'' he said.Abubakar further said that the ministry would partner youths since it recognized the central roles they play in effecting climate actions in Nigeria.He said that the ministry was certifying youth's involvement and the integration of their innovative green strategies into the just transition implementation procedure.Rev. Fr. Edward Obi, one of the founding members of COSET said that the global community knew climate change was a reality crippling up on nations faster than they were setting up structures to counter.According to Obi, climate change is real and the effects are visible.'Countering climate change must be a regional based effort because the impact is not the same universally and each region must be empowered to take steps to counter it.'This is what we are doing at the various regions and Nigeria in particular has to walk the talk.'Our fossil fuel industry is counterproductive if we take the global scheme of things into consideration, yes, we are a mono economy and we are depending only on oil and gas.'However, in the long term, oil and gas is being faced out and we must diversify now not tomorrow,'' he said.Obi said that Nigeria needed to diversify her economy to have the capacity and resilience to be able to withstand what would come in the future.He said that unless the nation diversifies its economy, it would find itself digging further into crude oil whereas its environment was being polluted beyond redemption.He advised the nation to create a system that would gradually change from the oil and gas industry and invest in cleaner energy sources.Also, Mr Ken Henshaw, a member of COSET, urged Nigeria show expertise and find solutions to curb climate change.Henshaw said that Nigeria was facing climate change crisis in almost every region, including increased flood patterns along the coastal plates of the Niger Delta and other parts of southern Nigeria. He said that people were losing livelihood and witnessing increased salinisation.'We are seeing water sipping into farmlands and destroying livelihood, we are seeing changing patterns of rainfall, it rained in Port Harcourt in January 2020 and it rained on Dec. 25, 2021 in Calabar.'These are all changing patterns and with the patterns of rainfall changing, with the seasons effectively changing and getting altered, our farming system will also be destroyed.'Several researches have stated clearly that the foods we consume in Africa, most regularly like maize, sorghum and cereals generally will be terribly impacted on account of climate change,'' he said.Henshaw further said that apart from flooding in the coastal south and central Nigeria, there was also effect like the Boko Haram insurgency in the North East.'Why did Boko Haram start in Borno? It is attributed to climate change because of the Lake Chad drying up since it is a fishing, farming and irrigation hub.'So, as the lake shrunk, cattle rearers' can no longer herd their cattle and farmers can no longer farm so are fishermen.'So, destitution sets in and whenever destitution sets in, it is easier to radicalise people and make them take extreme ideologies,'' he saidThe COSET member advised Nigeria to see climate change as a threat and take serious action to find ways to curb its challenges, especially through tackling oil extraction.He said that this was not the time to invest more into extraction because it was detrimental to the people and environment.'That is what we are doing. What is our blueprint to stop gas flaring, what is our blueprint to stop fossil burning no way and how are we thinking of winning ourselves out of oil dependence,'' he asked.Henshaw also advised Nigeria to start thinking of creating an economy that was beyond oil and draft blueprints on how to curb climate change and shrift the economy.\l"
"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria138","Climate Change: Scientists alarmed over 'dangerously fast' spike in atmospheric methane - Report","February 9, 2022 Wednesday","Premium Times","Nigeria, Feb. 9 -- Methane concentrations in the atmosphere raced past 1,900 parts per billion last year, nearly triple preindustrial levels, according to data released in January by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).A report by Nature Briefing on Tuesday also noted how scientists believe the grim milestone underscores the importance of a pledge made at last year's COP26 climate summit to curb emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas at least 28 times as potent as CO2.The growth of methane emissions slowed around the turn of the millennium, but began a rapid and mysterious uptick around 2007, the report recalled.The spike has caused many researchers to worry that global warming is ""creating a feedback mechanism that will cause ever more methane to be released, making it even harder to rein in rising temperatures.""""Methane levels are growing dangerously fast,"" said Euan Nisbet, an Earth scientist at Royal Holloway, University of London, in Egham, UK, according to the report.The emissions, which seem to have accelerated in the past few years, are a major threat to the world's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5-2 degC over pre-industrial temperatures, he added.Nigeria recently sought to reduce short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs), by committing to slash black carbon, methane, and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), or its internationally agreed-upon commitment to mitigating climate change.The country included an SLCP section with a 60 per cent reduction in ""fugitive methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 2031, conditional on international support"".If these NDCs are fully achieved, black carbon are expected to reduce by 42 per cent, methane by 28 per cent, and HFCs by 2 per cent, all by 2030.The Nigerian government had recognised the International Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) conclusion that there is no way to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius ""without significant SLCP reductions alongside carbon cuts.""Africa has been hit with debilitating effects of climate change in recent years. Such effects include increased food insecurity, rising sea levels, floods, worsening droughts, and exacerbated conflict worsened by forced displacements.Experts believe climate change will ultimately negatively affect food production in this west African nation where agriculture accounts for 23 per cent of the country's gross domestic product and where over 40 per cent of the population is ""food insecure"".Meanwhile, the report noted that for more than a decade, researchers have deployed aircraft, taken satellite measurements and run models in an effort to understand the drivers of the increase in methane.""The causes of the methane trends have indeed proved rather enigmatic,"" said Alex Turner, an atmospheric chemist at the University of Washington in Seattle. Mr Turner, quoted in the report, said he is yet to see any conclusive answers emerge.""It's a powerful signal,"" said Xin Lan, an atmospheric scientist at NOAA's Global Monitoring Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado, adding that this suggests that human activities alone are not responsible for the increase.Experts agree that a lot can be done to reduce emissions.Despite NOAA's worrying alarm for 2021, ""scientists already have the knowledge to help governments take action"", said Riley Duren, who leads Carbon Mapper, a non-profit consortium in Pasadena, California, that uses satellites to pinpoint the source of methane emissions.Last month, for instance, Carbon Mapper and the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group in New York City, released data revealing that 30 oil and gas facilities in the southwestern United States have collectively emitted about 100,000 tonnes of methane for at least the past three years, equivalent to the annual warming impact of half a million cars.These facilities could easily halt those emissions by preventing methane from leaking out, the groups argue.At in Glasgow, UK, more than 100 countries signed the Global Methane Pledge to cut emissions by 30 per cent from 2020 levels by 2030.Mr Duren said the emphasis must now be on action, including in low- and middle-income countries across the global south.""Tackling methane is probably the best opportunity we have to buy some time,"" he said, to solve the much bigger challenge of reducing the world's CO2 emissions.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Premium Times.

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria142","African cities can do more to protect children from climate change","April 23, 2022 Saturday","Naija 247 News","Six in 10 people will be living in cities by 2030. This is concerning. Cities are responsible for over 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Yet cities can also do a lot to mitigate climate change and help people adapt to its impacts. Cities can use renewable energy sources, promote greener transport, and get industries to cut pollution and adopt cleaner production techniques. Also, they can form or use existing networks and partnerships to strengthen these efforts.Almost 1 billion children - nearly half of the world's children - live in countries that are at extremely high risk of climate change impacts. Climate change has direct and indirect impacts on children's rights to health, life, dignity and education. Also, climate change increases the risk of exposure to violence against children. Climate-induced disasters displaces people, and limits access to schools, adequate water and nutrition. UNICEF has drawn attention to the fact that 'the climate crisis is a child rights crisis'.Recently children have taken the lead in global campaigns like School Strike for Climate and Fridays for Future in over 7,500 cities. Children are calling on political leaders to see the crisis from their perspective and take action.Central governments are often criticised as too distant and detached from everyday realities. Whereas, city governments are closer to, and in a better position to deal with local challenges, needs and priorities. Cities are empowered by national and local laws to govern on issues concerning children and in climate-related areas. Thus, they can plan and deliver what's needed to address local climate challenges.In a recent study, I explored how city-level climate law and policy protects children in the context of climate change. The study used Kenya and South Africa as key examples. In many countries, and in these two countries specifically, I observed that city governments have the constitutional and legislative autonomy and obligations in climate-related functional areas such as water and sanitation. These laws and policies don't always specifically mention children, which means the concerns of children could escape attention. I argue that cities can do more to protect children from the impacts of climate change.Are children at the centre of climate action?The South African Climate Change Bill empowers municipalities to adopt climate change response plans at the local level. In particular, municipalities must coordinate climate action within their jurisdiction, including mainstream climate change responses in their development plans.The constitutions of Kenya and South Africa have explicit provisions dedicated to children's rights. Although these constitutional children's rights do not speak to climate change directly, the spectrum of rights guarantees children protection from the impacts of the climate crisis.Despite these obligations of city authorities over climate action on one hand, and children on the other hand, in reality the challenges of children do not always get attention in plans, budgets and interventions at the city level. This is a reality in many other cities in Africa, apart from the cities in Kenya and South Africa.The gains of child-led climate actionIn 2019, for the first time, children filed a legal complaint to a UN human rights treaty body - the Committee on the Rights of the Child - about the failure of their governments to take firm climate action. The children pointed out that they lived in cities such as Cape Town (South Africa), Lagos (Nigeria) and Tabarka (Tunisia) where the impacts of climate change are on the rise.The communication was considered inadmissible, meaning it could not be heard on the merits. Yet it was ground-breaking in making it clear that children are key actors in climate change action, deserving a seat at the table of decision-making.The acceptance of children as key co-decision makers in climate governance is evident in their participation in global forums such as the 2021 climate conference - COP26. This is commendable. But, without robust action and engagement of children at the local sphere of government, the commitments become empty noise.Considering the trends in urbanisation, child urban population, and the climate crisis, I would urge cities to:Expressly provide for the rights of children in climate action, particularly in law, policy and strategies. This acts as a strong legal tool to ensure the protection and participation of children in cities.Open or expand institutional spaces for children to participate and contribute to climate action at the city level. This could include sporting and fun activities, forums and other opportunities for children to be engaged on the climate discourse at community level.Invest technical and financial resources to ensure that children have access to updated climate change educational material in child-friendly versions, and in languages that they understand.Support child-led initiatives and campaigns. This could include capacity building, resource mobilisation, and guidance for children to contribute to climate action.Up-scale leadership and coordination of action and responses in a child-responsive and child-sensitive approach, including in climate-induced disasters. The best interests of children should be the guiding principle.The ConversationRongedzayi Fambasayi, Doctoral Researcher: Faculty of Law, North-West UniversityThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria143","Earth Day 2022: The Most Crucial Milestone Yet","Nigerian Tribune"," ","Over the last 150 years, we've witnessed a steady but acute destabilization of the planet's environmental health - the consequences of which have been catastrophic for humanity in all corners of the globe. Hurricanes have blasted Puerto Rico. Floods have pillaged towns in Germany and Australia. Wildfires have scorched the U.S., Greece and Turkey. Millions of people are contending with water droughts, food shortages, and displacement. Farmers are consistently dealing with crop failures and extreme weather. Frighteningly, these events are merely a snapshot of the planet's compromised integrity, all resulting from one pressing global issue: climate change.February's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report highlighted the ever-increasing threat of droughts, wildfires, heatwaves and other weather extremes if emissions are left unchecked - with around 40 percent of the world's population classed as 'highly vulnerable' to the impacts of climate change. The report also stressed that we have merely until the end of the decade to mitigate these disasters or risk irreversible damage to ecosystems and populations worldwide.As we mark Earth Day 2022, it is our duty to step back from the sweeping media narratives and look at the progress we have made since this day last year, learning from our mistakes and the actions that we could have undertaken more effectively. Through this analysis, we can set out a clear roadmap to help us urgently combat this issue.Triumphant EffortsAmid the disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic, a steady stream of beneficial strides were made last year to mitigate the effects of climate change. The COP26 conference in Glasgow saw 100 countries sign an agreement to end deforestation by 2030, in addition to pledging to cut down on methane emissions by 30 percent. Governments and major polluting companies such as Shell were legally reprimanded over their actions. These developments also coincided with an increased movement to grant legal rights to nature, a historical precedent in many countries.Additionally, several developed nations pooled billions of dollars in a partnership aimed at empowering coal-reliant nations, such as India, the Philippines and Indonesia, to transition towards green energy. This objective is being targeted through the retention and retraining of workers for the green-energy economy.Hampered ProgressDespite these commendable victories in environmental protection, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere still peaked at 419 parts per million (ppm) in 2021 - the highest level since records began 63 years ago - significantly up from 280 parts per million (ppm) before the Industrial Revolution.Countries also played witness to record-breaking climate extremes such as the warmest year for ocean heat, the warmest temperature on record in 25 countries, and the warmest northern-hemisphere summer ever. The tragedy remains that at least 85 percent of the world's population has been affected by climate change, while four-fifths of the world's land area has also been affected by climate change-induced damage. Regrettably, the most marginalized members of society who produce the least emissions, often shoulder the impact of these events.With many pressing issues such as inflation and COVID-19 to address, seemingly less immediate matters fall down the list of priorities for various governments. While there has been significant progress in the engagement and adoption of sustainable energy generation over the past 20 years, the scale of the challenge that faces our global society requires profound changes across every aspect of our society. Governments need to significantly invest in green-energy infrastructure. That said, a pragmatic approach in which renewables are deployed in tandem with traditional fossil fuel generation will likely be necessary to satisfy our energy needs, at least in the immediate term, as we transition to an entirely green economy.Fostering CollaborationAs disruptive as the previous two years have been for humanity, the effects of climate change will be catastrophic by several orders of magnitude - etching irreversible ecological and geographic damage globally. As such, governments and corporations that bear particular culpability should contribute by covering the rising costs sustained by vulnerable nations and individuals in this battle.Investment should also be redirected towards researching methods that can more drastically boost green energy production, improve sustainability and recycling and enforce environmental protections. This would be the next step in streamlining the flawed supply chains and practices found across the industry, such as the morally and environmentally questionable lithium and cobalt mining industry used to produce electric vehicles.During the initial onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the abandoned streets and waterways created by lockdowns provided a welcome relief to the ailing planet, its polluted ecosystems, and repressed wildlife. This offered a glimpse into what could be achieved by governments and the public alike if we set our minds and goals toward implementing holistic change. While Earth Day may now be an annual milestone for companies to polish off and showcase their badges of climate action, it is also a time for reflection and education. It is a day where we must remember that despite tremendous progress, our work is far from complete.As numerous academic studies have repeatedly warned, we have reached a point of no return. Much like during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries will once again need to band together to combat this impending catastrophe and protect this beautiful planet we call home. Without this united action, Earth Day is simply an event held in vain.Dr Robert Holcomb is the Co-Founder of Holcomb Scientific Research, a Research and Development company that has created the patent-protected Holcomb Energy System, a scientific breakthrough in clean energy generation.\l"

Domestically it produces cocoa and palm oil but it also imports palm oil from Southeast Asia.COP26 President-Designate, Alok Sharma said: 'The FACT Dialogue has much work ahead to deliver on its objectives as we move towards COP26. But the publication of today's joint statement marks a highly important first step in laying the foundation for our work.'To have brought so many countries together, both producers and consumers, and to plan a way forward on sustainable trade is a fantastic start. I am confident that this is just the beginning as we work to protect trade and development, and our biodiversity-rich forests, in equal measure.'British High Commissioner, Catriona Laing said: 'In Nigeria the UK is working with the Federal Government, the private sector and with local communities across the country to promote investment in climate-smart practices and business models that will help reduce emissions, increasing productivity and build climate resilience.'Nigeria's active engagement in the COP26 FACT Dialogue and their endorsement of the joint statement is very welcome. We look forward to more collaborations like this as we continue to work together towards a common goal of sustainably producing agricultural commodities.'Forests are the largest natural carbon sink and a vital harbor of biodiversity but they are disappearing at an alarming rate. Nigeria has one of the highest deforestation rates globally, it loses approximately 350,000 - 400,000 hectares per year. Logging, agriculture and collection of fuelwood are the leading causes of forest loss in Nigeria.\l"
"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria146","Climate Change: Racing against time","The Nation (Nigeria)"," ","SIR: Unless proactive measures are put in place and fully implemented, the commitment made by Nigeria at the just concluded 26th annual edition of the Conference of Parties (COP26) Summit on climate change in Glasgow, United Kingdom to end deforestation by 2030 and equally attain zero-net emission in another 30 years later, will remain a mirage!The latest source of worry is the unprecedented hikes in the price of cooking gas, diesel and kerosene. Many people will certainly resort to cutting down trees for fuel, thereby leading to increased emission, deforestation and less flora communities to absorb methane gases being released to the atmosphere occasioned by human activities.The impacts of climate change are now evident in the world, ranging from wildfires in Greece and Algeria, to flooding in London and Turkey and to drought in Australia and Northern Nigeria. There is also the crisis of extinction of land and ocean species, rising sea levels, and increased drought.For developing countries, like Nigeria, these issues lead to increased food shortage, animal migration, health risks, poverty and displacements. In 2020, the 10-highest climate change-induced disasters occurred in some of the poorest parts of the world. It cost over $130 billion, killing thousands and displacing millions. These costs are escalating every year. In 2019, the National Emergency Management Agency revealed that floods displaced approximately 1.9 million Nigerians.President Muhammad Buhari signing into law, the climate change bill is a big deal for an oil-dependent nation that is also ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change in the world. The law places climate change action in the broader context of efforts to achieve inclusive green and sustainable economic development for the most populous Black country in the world.Nigeria has long maintained that it wishes to use its climate policies as part of wider measures to achieve low-carbon, resilient, and equitable economic growth. With the climate change act, it is apt to say that Nigeria is on the right course towards averting the dangers of climate change. Nonetheless, individuals should also on their own help in projecting this campaign by abstaining from activities that cause environmental exploitation, especially illegal cutting down of trees, which ultimately trigger climate change.With the pledges made by the affluent nations and private institutions during the Glasgow COP26 to collectively provide a minimum of $100 billion annually by 2023 in order to achieve the mandates of reducing climate change, getting financial guarantees for Nigeria should not be difficult. However, it must adopt climate action as fast as possible, because scientists keep telling us that the planet is burning. Our lives literally depend on this global joint effort which COP 26 in Glasgow has represented.\l"

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria148","Africa Must Prepare For Global Food Crisis, Says Adesina","Nigerian Tribune"," ","African Development Bank Group President, Dr Akinwumi Adesina, says 'Africa must prepare for the inevitability of a global food crisis.'He was speaking about Africa's priorities, as a guest at the Atlantic Council's Africa Center last Friday.In a statement, the AfDB said fielding questions from the Council's Africa Center Chair, Ambassador Rama Yade; Senior Fellow Aubrey Hruby; and Washington/UN correspondent for Jeune Afrique and The Africa Report, Julian Pecquet, the Bank chief called for an 'increased sense of urgency amid what he described as a once-in-a-century convergence of global challenges for Africa.'According to Adesina, the continent's most vulnerable countries had been hit hardest by conflict, climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic, which had upended economic and development progress in Africa.He said Africa, with the lowest GDP growth rates, had lost as many as 30 million jobs on account of the pandemic.Speaking about the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war, Adesina expressed sympathy for the people of Ukraine, describing their suffering as unimaginable.He said the war's ramifications spread far beyond Ukraine to other parts of the world, including Africa.He explained that Russia and Ukraine supply 30 per cent of global wheat exports, the price of which has surged by almost 50 per cent globally, reaching identical levels as during the 2008 global food crisis, adding that fertilizer prices had tripled, and energy prices had increased, all fueling inflation.Adesina warned that the tripling costs of fertilizer, rising energy prices, and rising costs of food baskets, could worsen in Africa in the coming months.He noted that 90 per cent of Russia's $4 billion exports to Africa in 2020 was made up of wheat; and 48 per cent of Ukraine's near $3 billion exports to the continent was made of wheat and 31 per cent of maize.Adesina cautioned that to fend off a food crisis, Africa must rapidly expand its food production.'The African Development Bank is already active in mitigating the effects of a food crisis through the African Food Crisis Response and Emergency Facility - a dedicated facility being considered by the Bank to provide African countries with the resources needed to raise local food production and procure fertilizer,' Adesina pointed out.'My basic principle,' Adesina said, 'is that Africa should not be begging. We must solve our own challenges ourselves without depending on others...'The Bank chief spoke about early successes through the Bank's innovative flagship initiative, the Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT) Programme, a programme operating across nine food commodities in more than 30 African countries.Adesina noted that TAAT has helped to rapidly boost food production at scale on the continent, including the production of wheat, rice and other cereal crops: 'We are putting our money where our mouth is. We are producing more and more of our own food. Our Africa Emergency Food Production Plan will produce 38 million metric tons of food. TAAT has already delivered heat-tolerant varieties of wheat to 1.8 million farmers in seven countries.'According to Adesina, heat-tolerant varieties were now being planted across hundreds of thousands of hectares in Ethiopia and Sudan, with extraordinary results. In Ethiopia, where the government has put the TAAT program to work in a 200,000-hectare lowland irrigated wheat programme, farmers are reporting yields of 4.5 to five times per hectare.He said TAAT's climate-smart seeds were also thriving in Sudan, which recorded its largest wheat harvest ever - 1.1 million tons of wheat - in the 2019-2020 season.Adesina added that TAAT came to the rescue during the drought in southern Africa in 2018 and 2019, deploying heat-tolerant maize varieties which were cultivated by 5.2 million households on 841 thousand hectares.As a result, he said, farmers survived the drought in Zimbabwe, Malawi and Zambia, allowing maize production to expand by 631,000 metric tons to a value of $107 million.Adesina also spoke about the urgent and timely need for a strong replenishment of the African Development Fund - the Bank Group's concessional lending arm that supports low-income African countries. He said the Fund has connected 15.5 million people to electricity and supported 74 million people with improved agriculture; it has provided 50 million people with access to transport; built 8,700 kilometres of roads; and provided 42 million people with upgraded water and sanitation facilities.The Bank chief said there were three lessons to be learned for Africa from the challenges Africa is facing: first, that the continent could no longer leave the health security of its people to the benevolence of others; second, that it must look at health investments differently, and make the development of a health defence system a priority-investing in quality health infrastructure as a must-and third, that economies-which were already turning around-must create fiscal space to deal with debt challenges.Asked about the outcomes for Africa of the global climate summit, COP26, in Glasgow last November, and how he foresaw prospects for success at COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt in 2022, Adesina expressed optimism.He said it was important for developed countries to make good on their promise to provide Africa with the $100 billion a year required for climate adaptation. Adesina said: 'Our challenge is adaptation because we didn't cause the problem.

Any change in the weather pattern, in terms of the amount, intensity, duration, affects farmers' decisions in terms of the crops and inputs as well as other cultural operations in the value chain,"" Abubakar said.He opined that despite having a larger percentage of women in agricultural production, they are still faced with challenges, especially climate change, access to information and technologies.As you are aware, the National Gender Policy in Agriculture was approved in 2019 with the thrust hinged on gender equity and equality for optimum productivity in the agricultural sector. This, ultimately, would ensure commitment to gender mainstreaming at all levels of the agricultural sector, which is seen as a tool for achieving gender-based reforms and increasing productivity by men and women along all the value chains in the sector,"" he added.Read also:FG trains women farmers on climate change adaptation strategyPeter Aikhuomobhogbe, the permanent secretary, Edo state ministry of agriculture and natural resources, on his part, commended the Federal Government for creating a platform where women farmers can be enlightened on how to limit climate change impact with a view to improving agricultural production.ikhuomobhogbe said: Edo state has put in place strategies and a lot of interventions to support agriculture. Our focus and support are in the areas of maize, rice and sorghum for crop farming; rubber and oil palm for cash crop as well as livestock productions.In all these, we ensure there is a 60:40 ratio for men and women farmers.

This is coming as a Mexican senator is calling on government to support international crime of ecocide.Speaking from Glasgow during the COP26 climate talks, Senator Ra\'fal Paz Alonzo, asked the Mexican government to recognise ecocide as the fifth Crime against World Peace and Security.A few weeks ago, Senator Paz called on the Mexican Congress to recognise ecocide as a serious crime in the federal penal code.Now, from Glasgow and in the context of COP 26, the senator is urging the Federal Government of Mexico to be the first Latin American country to expressly support the inclusion of ecocide in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, an initiative already supported by Belgium, France, and island states such as Vanuatu and the Maldives, as well as the UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, Pope Francis, and the European Parliament.From Glasgow, Senator Paz said, ""I am meeting with the Stop Ecocide organisation in Glasgow to announce two things: that we are presenting in Mexico the proposal to include ecocide as a serious crime in the Federal Criminal Code and that we are calling on the Mexican State to support the international initiative to make ecocide an international crime, as Pope Francis has been pushing for. We are at a crucial moment in the history of humanity and we need measures like this to face the current climate emergency.""If Mexico passes this law, it would be the first Latin American country to recognise ecocide, which would prevent and, if necessary, punish major environmental catastrophes that until now have been committed with impunity or only incurred an insignificant fine compared to the damage caused.The appeal has been referred by the Senate to the Foreign Affairs Committee and the President of the Republic is expected to issue a response.Senator Paz has also pointed out, ""this has been an effort of several months and here in Glasgow, at COP26, we show that we are here to work on the changes that Mexico and the world need"".Paz Alonzo has decided to join the Stop Ecocide initiative after witnessing, as president of the Water Resources Commission, that the country has witnessed one of the worst droughts in 20 years, and after seeing how in the same period the legal frameworks have not been updated to deal with crimes against the environment.Stop Ecocide International (SEI) was, however, co-founded in 2017 by pioneering barrister Polly Higgins (1968-2019) and current Executive Director, Jojo Mehta.SEI is the driving force behind, and central communications hub for, the growing global movement to make ecocide an international crime. Its core work is activating and developing global cross-sector support for this.Positioned at the meeting point of legal developments, political traction and public narrative, we are uniquely placed to support and amplify the global conversation.Its core international team is located in many parts of the world and managed from the UK by Stop Ecocide International Ltd.Its charitable entity the Stop Ecocide Foundation was created in November 2019 in the Netherlands to be the fundraising vehicle for the campaign, and was the commissioning body for the independent Expert Panel for the Legal Definition of Ecocide.Before now, the senator participated in an independent event during COP26, organised by Stop Ecocide International, which dealt with how to protect Mother Earth, from the Sacred Guardianship of indigenous peoples to Ecocide Law.''In the face of the climate and ecological crisis we are experiencing, we need to put an end to this massive destruction of nature and to do so we urgently need to introduce the crime of ecocide into the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Stop Ecocide welcomes the Senator's initiative and we have also asked that it be supported by all political groups in a non-partisan way, because protecting the environment and the future of new generations is a task to which we must all commit ourselves"".In the meantime, speaking at an independent panel event on Ecocide Law and Climate Justice, hosted by Stop Ecocide International during COP26 in Glasgow (along with co-hosts Global Witness, Client Earth and Climate Counsel), Shadow Secretary of State for Justice, David Lammy MP publicly announced the commitment of the Labour Party to support discussions around an international crime of ecocide.""I think that we should be hopeful, and this is why I am very pleased that I, as Shadow Justice Secretary, have committed the Labour Party to assisting with this cause"", he said.\l"

At COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, we must be visible as a global climate change leader able to accelerate Africa's 'Just Transition' to a resilient and equitable continental society'', he said.This is coming as the dust settled on the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), the world started realising that it fell\\xa0short of the promise to launch a new global deal for a low-carbon future. Nevertheless, Africa has displayed encouraging global climate leadership.The African members of the UN Security Council \- Niger, Tunisia and Kenya \- together with Ireland, led a resolution on climate change and security in December 2021. The proposal was to integrate climate-related security and conflict prevention strategies. It didn't carry, with China abstaining and Russia exercising its veto.''This followed a November 26, 2021 meeting of the African Union Peace and Security Council (PSC) on the nexus between climate change and peace and security. Participants were unambiguous about the threat multiplier potential of climate change. They called for more coordination and for Africa to speak with one voice in international negotiations. The PSC also reiterated its support for a climate change fund for Africa.''The next world climate change conference (COP27) is in Egypt in November. The African Union and its member states need to present a strong, unified position that shows the continent's commitment to dealing with security and other climate change threats, and accelerating Africa's 'Just Transition'.''The links between climate change and security risks were reinforced in the World Economic Forum Global Risks Report 2022. It argues that the top three most severe global threats over the next decade are from climate change. The biggest is climate action failure followed by extreme weather and biodiversity loss. Human environmental damage and natural resources crises follow in seventh and eighth places'', Naidoo said.Continuing, he said, '£ mapping of the global effects in the report reconfirms the PSC's position that climate change is a huge 'threat accelerator.' This analysis is supported by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) in the 2022 Climate Change and Security Risks report.''It is becoming increasingly clear that climate change is a primary risk \- environmentally, economically, socially and in terms of security. Where it isn't, it is a significant threat multiplier.''In the UNEP's 2011\\xa0analysis of climate change impacts in the Sahel, resource scarcity, especially water, was a primary risk driver.

It will also be blended to de-risk transactions and mobilise domestic institutional investment from local pension funds, insurance firms and other local institutional investors.This will help scale up domestic financing for eligible off-grid clean energy infrastructure, such as solar mini-grid and home systems, clean cooking infrastructure and SME cold storage infrastructure in Nigeria.""The UK is committed to increasing both renewable energy and energy access in Nigeria, driving clean, sustainable and resilient growth. As the world looks to transition to clean growth, we are witnessing an era-defining opportunity for the private sector. This transaction is particularly exciting as it brings together UK government support with the institutional capital which is essential to grow the sector at scale,"" she added.Godwin Jedy-Agba, Nigeria's minister of state for power, in his remarks, noted that Nigeria started its clean energy transition in 2014 with the first solar energy hybrid project executed in Lagos, Kaduna and Borno states.According to Mr Jedy-Agba, ""whereas all efforts have been geared towards unlocking private sector activity in the clean energy transition, one major challenge continues to be private sector access to local currency financing.""The mobilisation of both funds will be done alongside InfraCredit, a Nigerian entity that provides local currency (Naira) guarantees to enhance the credit quality of debt instruments issued by eligible infrastructure project sponsors.The Managing Director, Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) and Chairman of InfraCredit, Uche Orji, said, ""InfraCredit is pleased to be working with FCDO to mobilise private investment from domestic pension funds and other institutional investors into such an important developmental area as low carbon energy access.

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria167","WOMEN, GIRLS MORE VULNERABLE TO CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS - WHO","Nigerian Tribune"," ","WORLD Health Organization (WHO) has said that climate change has more direct and indirect health consequences on women and girls, including the interruption of health services.WHO's Regional Director for Africa, Dr. Matshidiso Moeti in a message to mark this year's International Women's Day themed: 'Gender equality today for a sustainable tomorrow,' stated that women and girls, especially those living in rural, poor and remote vulnerable areas in low- and middle-income countries, including Small Island Developing States, are more susceptible to changing climatic conditions.According to her, 'Due to their gender, they bear a disproportionate burden of the effects of climate change in their social and reproductive roles. In Africa, the increasing incidence of extreme weather conditions means women and girls devote the time that could be better spent on productive ventures catering to the basic needs of their families. This includes the provision of water, food, and fuel for lighting, heating and cooking.'Such extreme events also have direct and indirect health repercussions for women and girls, including the interruption of health services. Emerging evidence suggests that air pollution and heat contribute to poor reproductive health outcomes, due to their impacts on cellular physiology and organ response.'Potential consequences include infertility, intrauterine growth retardation, low birth weight, perinatal mortality, pre-term delivery and associated pregnancy complications. Disruptions due to drought, floods, conflicts over natural resources and forced migration are an added concern.'According to her, indirectly, environmental degradation and changing climate patterns raise the risk for the emergence and re-emergence of diseases such as Dengue fever, Chikugunya and the Zika viruses, and for exacerbating the spread of water- and vector-borne diseases such as malaria, cholera and schistosomiasis - all of which disproportionately affect children and women, especially pregnant women.'Inadequate access to water can impede agricultural production, with significant potential risks for food security and consequent nutritional deficiencies and anaemia among women and girls, because of their unique nutritional needs.'Women and girls are also at higher risk for sexual violence, sexual exploitation, abuse, trafficking, and intimate partner violence, along with psychological stress, anxiety and depression in response to displacements as a result of climate change events.'To address the challenges, Moeti said gender-responsive action is needed, along with equitable development that recognises and addresses the particular vulnerability of women and girls to the consequences of climate change.She added that it is also important to harness the power of women to effect change at the community level and in the development of policy instruments and national climate response plans.'Women's organisations must be prioritised to receive the necessary financial and technological support to make a meaningful contribution to addressing the threat, while access to land for women farmers should be assured to build food security and equitable land ownership.'Addressing the health impacts of climate change requires innovative thinking and a more holistic, population-based public health approach. As WHO, we are providing guidance and technical support to governments to ensure that health and environmental responses, including climate change strategies, are integrated, equitable and just.'In the African Region, 19 Member States have been supported to assess the capability of their health sectors to withstand the threats posed by climate change, and the same number have committed to the COP26 Health Programme for sustainable, low-carbon health systems. In addition, 22 Members States have developed national health adaptation plans.'There is still much work to be done, however, and as we mark International Women's Day this year, I urge all stakeholders, from governments and partners to civil society and ordinary citizens, to support country-driven and gender-sensitive approaches to mitigating the impacts of climate change, especially on our vulnerable women and girls.'\l"

(Tuwo is a local delicacy made from guinea corn or corn in the Northern part of Nigeria).Using the edge of her wrapper to wipe her teary eyes and sweating face, Asia said she uses firewood to cook at least three times a day.&ldquo;I have been cooking with firewood for over 20 years every day. I started cooking with firewood when I was young. Cooking with firewood is tedious, the smoke affects my eyes; it makes me cough and I think the smoke is the cause of my chest pain. I wish I had another alternative way to cook, but other means are expensive. My children and I can pick firewood anytime we go to the farm. It is available and cheaper,&rdquo; she said.Another housewife, 38 years-old Fatimah Saliu, residing in Dukpa said she also wishes to stop using firewood, but cannot afford it.&ldquo;I know there are other alternatives like gas, electric cooker, but my husband cannot afford it. We cook in large quantities. The smoke affects my eyes and I usually have constant cough and chest pain. I use local medicine anytime the cough starts. I have a sister who has been coughing for a while too. She went to the hospital and was advised to stop using firewood if she wants to get better,&rdquo; she said.Smoke and health hazardsThe stories of Asis and Fatimah are some of the several narratives by women whose lives are being threatened by the harmful effects of inhaling the smoke that comes from cooking with firewood, charcoal, and kerosene: all inefficient, polluting fuels which is a health risk and major contributor to respiratory diseases, natal complications, heart diseases and premature deaths of children.According to a WHO report, 4.2 million people die from exposure to outdoor air pollution, in addition to the 3.8 million whose deaths are linked to household smoke produced by dirty stoves and fuels.These solid fuels produce carbon, one of the biggest contributors to climate change after carbon dioxide. Also, the woods for cooking in form of firewood or charcoal contribute to deforestation which in turn have a negative impact on climate change.Speaking on the negative effect of cooking with firewood, a family health doctor in Abuja, Dr Tolu Omodunbi, said the use of firewood and solid fuel is like a double edge sword which have a harmful effect on the user and the environment.&ldquo;For users, the smoke when inhaled affects the lungs and can lead to respiratory and heart diseases. Meanwhile, the smoke particles are deposited in the ozone layer which is still emitted into the environment and inhaled by people. The continuous use of firewood and other solid fuel constitutes dirty air and leads to air pollution which defects some of the Sustainable Development Goals, especially SDG3 (Good Health and Well-being, SDG 7 - Affordable and clean energy, SDG 11 -sustainable cities and communities and SDG 13 - climate action),&rdquo; he said.Message on 2022 World Health DayNoting that fossil fuels are responsible for most of the harmful emissions linked to acute and chronic sickness, WHO, in commemoration of this year's World Health Day, is calling for tangible steps to curb their use.A report released in the lead-up to World Health Day showed that almost the entire global population (99%) breathes air that exceeds WHO air quality limits, and threatens their health.The findings have prompted the WHO to highlight the importance of curbing fossil fuel use and the need to take other tangible steps to reduce air pollution levels.The WHO Regional Director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, in her message to commemorate the day said this year's theme serves as a timely reminder of the inextricable link between the planet and our health, as the burden of noncommunicable and infectious diseases rises alongside growing incidence of climate-related challenges&ldquo;We cannot afford to lose sight of the fundamental truth that the climate crisis, the single biggest threat facing humanity today, is also very much a health crisis,&rdquo; she saidInterventionIn Nigeria, WHO has been supporting Nigerian government to strengthen health and environment systems to implement Climate action and Air Quality control measures.The Deputy Country Representative in Nigeria, Alexander Chimbaru said WHO has facilitated the activation of National Technical Working Group on Climate Change and Health and 45 public health experts were trained on COP26 health sector climate action.He said &ldquo;WHO is also providing guidance on the control on black soot air pollution in Port Harcourt Nigeria and has continued to disseminate WHO Air Quality Guidel"

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria172","Climate Change - Is Nigeria's Net Zero Pledge Credible?","November 11, 2021","Vanguard (Lagos)","LAST week, at the ongoing 26th United Nations Climate Conference of the Parties, COP26, in Glasgow, United Kingdom, President Muhammadu Buhari announced that Nigeria would become a net zero country, evoking climate emergency.""I do not think anyone in Nigeria needs persuading of the need for urgent action on the environment,"" he said, adding: ""For Nigeria, climate change is not about the perils of tomorrow, but what is happening today"". Then, he declared: ""Nigeria is committed to net zero by 2060""!Nigeria is in good company. According to Net Zero Tracker, 137 out of 198 countries have made net zero pledges, covering 90 per cent of the global economy, 85 per cent of the world's population and 88 per cent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. So, Nigeria is swimming with the tide, joining major fossil fuel countries like China, Russia and Saudi Arabia to commit to net zero.Yet, while commitment to net zero is symbolically important, the real test is whether a country is willing to make the tough choices that net zero requires, whether it has detailed plans to do so and, thus, whether its net zero pledge is credible. These are the criteria by which Nigeria's net zero commitment should, and will, be judged at home and abroad.But what's net zero? The word ""net"" suggests it's not about absolute zero emissions. Truth is, it's impossible to eliminate all greenhouse gas emissions completely because some sectors, such as aviation, are difficult to decarbonise.So, ""net zero"" means that a country must reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to as close to zero as possible and ""offset"" the residual emissions through natural carbon sinks, that is: measures that absorb carbon, such as forestation and technologies that capture carbon. So, net zero is achieved through reducing emissions and increasing carbon sinks, the former being the dominant action.Thus, a credible net zero commitment must entail a detailed plan for reducing emissions and increasing carbon sinks, as the UK's recently published Net Zero Strategy does by setting out ambitious decarbonisation measures across society as well as off-setting measures. A credible net zero pledge must also be underpinned by legislation, such as the UK Climate Change Act of 2008, as amended, which legally binds the UK's net zero target.So, how credible is Nigeria's net zero pledge? Well, President Buhari said in Glasgow that detailed plans are in place to meet the net zero target. He pointed specifically to the revised National Policy on Climate Change, NPCC, approved last June and the updated Nationally Determined Contribution, NDC, submitted to the UN last July.In the updated NDC, Nigeria promised to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent (unconditionally) and 47 per cent (conditionally) by 2030. But neither the revised NPCC nor the updated NDC represents a detailed net zero plan because neither sets out ambitious emission-reduction measures.That said, the National Assembly's passage of the Climate Change Bill, sponsored by Samuel Onuigbo, a member of the House of Representatives, is a positive development, as the bill includes a net zero target for 2050 - 2070. Onuigbo said that, had President Buhari signed the bill into law ahead of COP26, that would have been Nigeria's ""loudest statement of ambition"" in Glasgow. Well, one must hope that, with the president's announcement at COP26, he would now sign the bill into law so that Nigeria can have a Climate Change Act!Yet, a climate change act with a net zero target would still not induce climate action credibility because of Nigeria's unwillingness to wean itself of fossil fuels. As President Buhari announced the net zero pledge in Glasgow, he also said that Nigeria would continue to burn gas to generate electricity.What's more, although less mentioned these days, there was also a plan to revive Nigeria's coal sector, and, as we know, the Petroleum Industry Act sets aside 30 per cent of NNPC's profits to fund oil and gas exploration in the frontier basins.So, basically, at COP26, President Buhari was saying: yes, Nigeria wants to reach net zero by 2060, but we would continue to burn fossil fuels and want rich countries to help fund our hydrocarbon projects.That flies in the face of the G7 countries'decision to stop funding oil, coal and gas projects overseas, and ignores the International Energy Agency's view that investments in oil, coal and gas projects must end for the world to reach net-zero global emissions by 2050 and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.Truth is, although Nigeria needs considerable international support to become a net zero economy, it won't get that support unless it seriously commits to weaning itself from fossil fuels. The right approach would have been to commit to net zero by 2060, set out a detailed pathway to decarbonising the economy and ask for financial support to do so.That's South Africa's approach. Coal accounts for 77 per cent of South Africa's energy mix, but the country has committed to net zero by 2050 and has set out plans to decommission and repurpose its coal-fired power stations. In response, the US, the EU and the UK agreed to provide $8.5bn to help South Africa switch from coal to green energy.So far, Nigeria has no such credible plan. The energy sector accounts for 60 per cent of Nigeria's total emissions. That sector needs to be radically decarbonised with shifts to renewables and electric vehicles. But Nigeria is still paying lip service to low-carbon energy generation, and, despite the hype about assembling electric vehicles, there's no pathway to phasing out the 11.5m combustive emission vehicles in circulation.Then, there's livestock breeding, particularly cattle, which accounts for about 13 per cent of total emissions. In a country that values cows more than humans, can Nigeria ever raise climate-friendly cows? Doubtful!COP26 lacks credibility.\l"

""We are now living in the eye of the storm From now on we are fighting a battle on two fronts: we have to fight to slash emissions while investing the same level of energy to adapt to a global climate emergency,"" Verkooijen said.While Africa is responsible for a mere 5% of global emissions, the continent bears a disproportionate negative impact of climate change. This includes changing rainfall patterns, droughts, floods, and other natural disasters. They affect agriculture and reduce food security. The leaders agreed that action on climate adaptation was even more urgent in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.""We need the world to come together and be very specific We should see this as a combination of opportunities that should mobilize us,"" Timmermans said. ""Adaptation and mitigation are two sides of the same coin.""""In addition, the $650 billion issuance of the Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) by the IMF presents a unique opportunity to also provide some SDR resources to the multilateral development banks.

The big question is the extent to which remote working will continue to be adopted.While remote working was at first highly appealing in the early days of the pandemic and national lockdowns, the cracks soon started to appear as boredom and monotony set in.The reality is that humans are social creatures and the workplace is, amongst other things, a social environment. Face-to-face engagements and chats around the coffee machine provide a sense of belonging that the digital world of Zoom and Skype just cannot replace. There is an energy found in the workplace that is not replicated when working from home and a level of creativity that results from spontaneous collaboration.As restrictions have been eased, many organisations have allowed their employees to return to work. Others have adopted a hybrid system of both in-office and remote working. However, key to any return to work has been the need for staff to be vaccinated, to protect both themselves and their colleagues.Some countries have ruled that being vaccinated against Covid-19 is mandatory for employees working in certain sectors. Kenya, for example, ruled in 2021 that public service employees must have had at least one vaccination. Other countries, including Ghana, have ruled that health workers must be vaccinated.As employees return to the workplace, opportunities to attend conferences and events, for example, will only be accessible to those who are fully vaccinated. International travel has already opened up for those who are fully vaccinated.Bertrand from Cote d'Ivoire was working on a large-scale climate project for an international African organisation when the client requested that he attend COP26. ""Fortunately, I had already had two doses of the vaccine and was able to attend,"" he explains. ""The trip proved to be a great opportunity to meet people who are crucial to my career and business. I'm very relieved that I did not miss out on attending this event &ndash; as I would have done had I not been vaccinated.""The lesson I learned from this experience is that it's better to be proactive.

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria178","Africa and the Glasgow Climate Summit [editorial]","November 11, 2021","This Day (Lagos)","For all nations to be on board, the developed countries must fulfil their promisesThe ongoing 26th Conference of the Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom, is unlike other conferences. At the sessions which end tomorrow, there have been a sense of urgency for global leaders to move from mere pronouncements to action in dealing with carbon emissions that heat up the earth, causing extreme weather conditions like flooding, drought, and wildfires. There has also been an urge to fast track the implementation of these commitments entrenched in the Paris Agreement to ensure the survival of all humanity. The ultimate goal is to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement, to keep the rise in the global average temperature to well below two degrees above pre-industrial levels while leaders at COP26 settled for 1.5 degrees, as recommended by scientists.Specifically, the target is to achieve net zero emission of carbon by 2050 with considerable reduction by 2030 to show that there is identifiable progression to the goal. To achieve this, countries submitted their nationally determined contributions, that is, what they intend to implement to reduce carbon emission and to ultimately stop the emission by 2050. These actions include stopping the burning of crude oil, coal, and gas to power their factories, and to stop manufacturing vehicles and power plants that use these fuels. The focus is on the use of renewable energy - solar, electric and wind, among others.However, there are salient issues of equity. There are suspicions by developing countries that this pledge may not be honoured. The critical point is that the developed world is under pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This means reducing investment in fossil fuels (crude oil and coal) and speeding up the transition to green energy. But Africa, especially Nigeria, is yet to achieve progress in fossil fuel energy, let alone discussing transition to greener energy.According to the World Resources Institute, Africa's per capita emissions of carbon dioxide in the year 2000 were 0.8 metric tonnes per person, compared with a global figure of 3.9 tonnes per person. In fact, the highest emitters in the G20 are responsible for around 80 per cent of global emissions, while Africa's only 2-3 per cent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions from energy and industrial sources. This accounts for the strident calls for provision of support to Africa and other developing nations, particularly with the commitment to mobilise $100 billion from developed to developing nations.The questions therefore are: should there be a transitional provision for African countries or should Africa leapfrog along to greener energy in the hope that we can reap the benefits while being stuck with our dirty fossil fuel dependent economies? Can Nigeria survive without its hydrocarbon dependency? So many questions to ponder, but we suspect our leaders are not even paying attention to what is going on.There are three things embedded in the discussions at this COP26 that should interest Nigeria and other developing countries: the $100 billion in climate finance, global goal on adaptation, and loss and damage, which are economic and non-economic harms caused by climate change impact that cannot be avoided through adaptation or mitigation. But much more importantly, for all nations to be on board, the developed countries must come good on their promises.\l"
"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria179","Africa's climate change diplomacy must step up a gear","January 26, 2022 Wednesday","Premium Times","Nigeria, Jan. 26 -- As the dust settled on the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), the world started realising that it fell short of the promise to launch a new global deal for a low-carbon future. Nevertheless, Africa has displayed encouraging global climate leadership.The African members of the UN Security Council - Niger, Tunisia and Kenya - together with Ireland, led a resolution on climate change and security in December 2021. The proposal was to integrate climate-related security and conflict prevention strategies. It didn't carry, with China abstaining and Russia exercising its veto.This followed a November 26, 2021, meeting of the African Union Peace and Security Council (PSC) on the nexus between climate change and peace and security. Participants were unambiguous about the threat multiplier potential of climate change. They called for more coordination and for Africa to speak with one voice in international negotiations. The PSC also reiterated its support for a climate change fund for Africa.The next world climate change conference (COP27) is in Egypt in November. The African Union and its member states need to present a strong, unified position that shows the continent's commitment to dealing with security and other climate change threats, and accelerating Africa's 'Just Transition'.The links between climate change and security risks were reinforced in the World Economic Forum Global Risks Report 2022. It argues that the top three most severe global threats over the next decade are from climate change. The biggest is climate action failure followed by extreme weather and biodiversity loss. Human environmental damage and natural resources crises follow in seventh and eighth places.A mapping of the global effects in the report reconfirms the PSC's position that climate change is a huge 'threat accelerator.' This analysis is supported by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) in the 2022 Climate Change and Security Risks report.It is becoming increasingly clear that climate change is a primary risk - environmentally, economically, socially and in terms of security. Where it isn't, it is a significant threat multiplier. In the UNEP's 2011 analysis of climate change impacts in the Sahel, resource scarcity, especially water, was a primary risk driver. The report highlighted three threats for the region - diminished livelihoods, associated migration pressures particularly in agriculture communities, and increased tensions over scarce resources. The UNEP identified the Sahel as 'ground zero' for climate change, and more recent studies confirm this analysis.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Working Group 1 report released in 2021 is explicit on the severity of climate impact already being experienced worldwide. UN Secretary General Ant&#243;nio Guterres called the report a 'code red' for humanity. Natural disasters and extreme weather events have expanded beyond the Sahel 'ground zero' with major hotspots all around Africa.In Southern Africa, Zimbabwe's Victoria Falls have been choked back to a mere trickle. South Africa had a devastating four-year drought that brought Cape Town, a major global city, close to Day Zero. Mozambique endured the brunt of Cyclone Idai. In West Africa, the cost of environmental degradation in Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, Senegal and Togo was calculated at US$3.8 billion or 5.3 per cent of their combined GDP in 2017.At the same time, the reality is that electrification is core to Africa's development ambition, as expressed in the AU's Agenda 2063. The African Development Bank and the International Renewable Energy Agency have provided an encouraging outlook for Africa's renewable energy prospects. But the potential loss of foreign direct investment associated with the more than US$10 trillion fossil fuel asset on the continent in the form of coal, oil and natural gas is still a dilemma.Africa is increasingly gearing up its diplomatic leadership on climate change. Together with the UN Security Council debate and the recent PSC deliberations, it appears that Africa, led by the African Group of Negotiators, had a powerful presence at COP26. Although agreements reached in the formal negotiations were unambitious, deals on the margin, like the $8.5 billion pledge to support South Africa's Just Energy Transition partnership, were encouraging.And climate change has featured in important recent diplomatic platforms for Africa's relationship with key partners. The December 2021 Forum on China-Africa Cooperation included a declaration on climate change in its outcomes. Support has also been pledged for major African climate projects like the Great Green Wall and African Adaptation Initiative.A successful African transition will see the continent's development engine running on a low-carbon diet. This will enable it to compete internationally in a trade environment increasingly characterised by a green wave of consumer awareness and potentially new green trade conditions.There are encouraging indications that Africa's diplomatic machinery is working in the right direction. At COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, we must be visible as a global climate change leader able to accelerate Africa's 'Just Transition' to a resilient and equitable continental society.Dhesigen Naidoo, Senior Research Associate, African Futures & Innovation, Institute for Security Studies (ISS) Pretoria(This article was first published by ISS Today, a Premium Times syndication partner.

Diri noted that the state was blessed with abundant resources that needed to be harnessed through partnership and collaborations.He thanked the consultants for making a comprehensive report on the state's participation at the conference, adding that the the government would work with them to explore other areas to improve its economy.He said: 'Bayelsa State is one of the most affected by climate change in Nigeria. Bayelsa is at the epicenter in terms of climate change. Our people and environment have been affected.'Recently, we had one of the worst oil spills in the world in Nembe community. That explains what people are suffering in the state. For us, that was an opportunity to take our issues to the world. 'Let me use this opportunity to call on our environmental activists to be part of this process and ensure that we are not left out in this transition we are about to experience. Particularly those of us from this state, oil is about to finish and we are transiting to cleaner energy.'Join hands with the state government and see what Bayelsa will make out of this transition in terms of partnership, technical know-how and attracting the finances out there for our state.'In his remarks, the President of Ecologistics, Dr Paul Abolo, commended the governor for his interest in the climate change action.Abolo stated that the action of the governor showed the quality of leadership in the state, saying that no state government in Nigeria had engaged in climate action like Bayelsa did.He said the state had keyed into a critical part of the climate change action, which is how developing countries could access funds such as grants, loans and others from developed countries to cushion the effects of climate change.While thanking the governor for leading the team to the conference, Abolo said the action showed the state had taken the lead in the climate change action that other states are expected to follow. ...As farmers count losses as suspected herdsmen destroy farmsSome farmers along the Tombia-Amassoma Road in Okutukutu, Yenagoa Local Government Area of Bayelsa State, are counting their losses following the destruction of their farms by herd of cattle.The aggrieved farmers have called on the state government to urgently intervene to forestall an impending conflict between them and herders in the state.They urged the Governor Douyi Diri-led administration to properly enforce the anti-open grazing law already existing in the state to protect the farmers against the herders and their cattle.Recall that the Bayelsa State Livestock Breeding and Marketing Regulation Bill 2021 became a law on March 10, 2021 after Diri assented to it.The law prohibits open grazing in the state and confined herders and cattle owners to a space at the popular Bayelsa Palm Road in Yenagoa, the state capital.Consequently, the state government set up an anti-open grazing task force to enforce the law.However, herders were still seen breeding their cattle outside areas allocated to them, hence, leading to confrontation with farmers.Lamenting the destruction of her farm by the herds of cattle, an elderly woman of about 75 years, Mr. Patience Obein, said she lost all her cassava farm to cows.'I am an old woman. I lost my entire cassava farm to the cows. The situation is not funny at all. How am I going to survive this loss?'Also, a widow, Mrs. Martha JohnPerry, while expressing her frustration, said her only source of livelihood was the farm that had now been destroyed by the cattle.Another farmer, Mr. Bernard England, urged the anti-opening grazing enforcement task force in the state to wake up to its duties to forestall incessant destruction of their farms.A couple, Mr. George Bouye and Mrs. Success Bouye, narrated how they approached vigilante group in the area and confronted the herders after finding out the level of destruction in their farms.They said the cattle had repeatedly invaded their farms, mostly at the hours of 11pm and 1am.\l"
"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria185","ANALYSIS: COP26: More challenges for Nigeria's economy as 25 countries unite against fossil fuels","November 10, 2021 Wednesday","Premium Times","Nigeria, Nov. 10 -- No doubt, oil drives Nigeria's growth as it accounts for about 65 per cent of government revenue and more than 90 per cent of foreign exchange earnings.In 2010, when the oil price reached a record high of $110 per barrel, Nigeria's economic growth was 11.3 per cent.In 2020, the country experienced its deepest recession in two decades, but growth resumed in 2021 as pandemic restrictions were eased and oil prices recovered, and the authorities implemented policies to counter the economic shock.Though the battle for comprehensive economic revival has been a major focus of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration, the nation received a big shocker on Thursday when 25 countries and public finance institutions announced their commitment to ending finance for overseas fossil fuel energy projects by 2022.They pledged to shift their attention to clean energy.The announcement came at the occasion of the energy day at the ongoing United Nations Climate Conference in Glasgow, United Kingdom.A statement jointly released by these parties, including the U.S., the EU, UK, and Canada, noted that the action was informed by the mission to align their international public support towards the clean energy transition and out of unabated fossil fuels.The signatories to the commitment also include Ethiopia, Fiji, Finland, Financierings-Maatschappij voor Ontwikkelingslanden N.V. (FMO), The Gambia, Italy, Mali, Marshall Islands, New Zealand, Moldova, Portugal, Slovenia, South Sudan, Switzerland and Zambia.The statement was also backed by five public banks, including the East African Development Bank and the European Investment Bank with a plan to mobilise $17.8 billion a year for the clean energy transition and keep 1.5degC alive.The statement reads in part: ""Our joint action is necessary to ensure the world is on an ambitious, clearly defined pathway towards net-zero emissions, that is consistent with the 1.5degC warming limit and goals of the Paris Agreement, as well as the best available science and technology.""The statement said the countries will prioritise their support fully towards the clean energy transition, using their resources to enhance what can be delivered by the private sector.""We will end new direct public support for the international unabated fossil fuel energy sector by the end of 2022, except in limited and clearly defined circumstances that are consistent with a 1.5degC warming limit and the goals of the Paris Agreement,"" the statement added.They further commit to encouraging more governments, their official export credit agencies, and public finance institutions to implement similar commitments into COP27 and beyond.This includes driving multilateral negotiations in international bodies, in particular in the OECD, to review, update and strengthen their governance frameworks to align with the Paris Agreement goals. For government signatories, this will also guide their approach on the boards of multilateral development banks.With this announcement, a lot of countries in developing economies that rely majorly on fossil fuels may be prone to financial challenges in the coming days.Though the Nigerian president had made a net-zero emission target by 2020 with his country statement during the world leaders summit on Tuesday, current realities in the country do not favour that ambition.The World Bank reported that Nigeria was highly vulnerable to the global economic disruption caused by COVID-19, particularly due to the decl"

COAL-DOWN, not COAL-OUT cannot keep the global temperature rise to max 1.5 C. However great leaps were made like reducing methane emissions, Net-Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050, ending deforestation by 2030 and increasing funds for developing countries suffering from first-world-caused global warming resulting in rising water levels, catastrophic weather and having to pay cost of introducing renewable energy. This will make the world a liveable earth rather than a coming hell on an unliveable planet. All governments and people must participate to move from 'earth scarring' to 'earth caring'.Ask this sing along question. 'What can the earth's 7.9b people do? Everybody should know! Everybody should care!!The federal, state and LGA authorities must insert 'Climate Change' and 'COP26 Decisions for Climate Change Reversal' into the 2022 syllabus for all primary and secondary schools and 'General Subjects' in tertiary institutions. Every state and federal Ministry of Education supervising the 2022 syllabus must urgently approve this as should all tertiary institutions academic committee. Every person, teacher and student, in school everywhere must be taught 'Climate Change Reversal Strategies'. Nigeria suppressed information on oil-spills in Ogoniland and beyond and murdered and then paid lip-service to the clean-up. No one can suppress Climate Change.

Do not leave the tap on when brushing your teeth. Do not take a long shower. Do not www, waste washing-up water. Do not wash your car unnecessarily. Do not throw away a half bottle of water. Save water. If we all saved one litre of water/day, that is 7.9 billion litres/day saved.Do you, your co-workers and family waste trees and tree products - wood, paper, leaves? We need shade, the oxygen and the removal of carbon dioxide through the leaves of trees and shrubs near your home and office. These trees and shrubs are the lungs of the world absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. 'Cut a tree, cut a lung', 'Cut a leaf, cut out 10 breaths'. Your paper in any form- envelope, letters, sheets of paper, wrapping and packaging; your wood in any form - trees, shrubs, furniture- can be put to further 'recycled use'. Imagine 7.9b each saving and reusing envelopes not once but 10 times, making jotters by discovering a page by opening out envelopes and on used letters' back, reusing newspapers in art and as drawer lining, recycling bags especially Christmas wrappers and present bags. Imagine the number of trees that would still be standing? How many trees are killed every year to decorate homes and wrap all the world's Christmas presents? Some families have used recycled plastic Christmas trees for years, saving five or ten live-to-dead trees. Is it necessary to wrap Christmas presents at this dangerous time to our planet?Of course, after Christmas in cold countries the tree is burnt for firewood to warm or cook. But many millions of trees are just thrown out to become oil in a million years...if the world survives. We must prevent more trees falling victim, so we can breathe cleaner air and because trees are key to fight desertification.Do you, your co-workers and family misuse and abuse plastic? Do you use plastic and in particular the dreaded 'Single Use Plastic' - bags, bottles, straws, kitchen wear, food packs and other plastic products? Hospitality, entertainment and hospitals are especially guilty. The Covid Epidemic produced many mountains the size of Mount Everest, from single-use medical plastic waste. We have oceans, rivers and gutters filled with a fraction of the world's plastic bottles floating as detritus from a huge number of the 7,9billion earthlings. Imagine one person drinking two 1.5ltrs or six 500cc plastic bottles of water and plastic soft drinks a day for one year= 6\'d7365=2190 plastic bottles or more than two trailer loads/person. I rarely use plastic bottles. We banned them in my office and went from using 12 bottles 1.5litres each a day for 260 working days, or 3,120 bottles/year down to zero now using the recycled drums of water and washable cups. To date in my office and home we have saved more than 70-100,000 plastic bottles from rubbish dumps. Not enough but what are you doing?Examine what you, your co-workers and family contribute to climate change and world pollution. As you know, fossil fuels, coal, petroleum, and methane gas are being phased out. The increasing oil price is 'good' for government but also 'good' for it makes renewable energy cheaper. The world's enemies are becoming clearer - coal, petroleum and gas -even though they are the lifeblood of several countries.

Interim inquiries from petroleum experts indicate that the incident was caused by maximum pressure from piled-up gas in the well, which has witnessed several spills in previous years."" This time, it is catastrophic. As described by the operator of the unattended oil well, Aiteo Eastern Exploration and Production Ltd, a Ghanian-Nigerian oil giant that has been parading global awards for corporate social responsibility, ""The magnitude of this incident is of an extremely high order.""""The indigenous peoples' entire mangrove forest and marine environments are adversely affected by the same methane gas that world leaders have gathered in Scotland to cut emissions. What is happening now in Nembe is the opposite of whatever the Nigerian Government promised as its nationally determined contribution to global climate action.""In a neighboring oil field, coastal communities in Brass Local Government Area in Nigeria have also been ravaged for several weeks by gas spewing continually from another conglomerate's oil rig site named The Adriatic. There has been virtually no official action from the petroleum and environment ministries and agencies, as usual.""For strange considerations, including conflicted and incestuous interests, Nigeria's fossil industry regulators have routinely looked away as companies like Aiteo, Shell, and Total routinely gas and pollute hundreds of Ijaw, Ogoni, and other local communities in the Niger Delta. These disasters occurring during COP 26 are graphic examples of Nigeria's insincerity and lack of capacity for climate security, environmental justice, and indigenous minorities' protection. We can no longer allow this catastrophic environmental destruction to go on without a consolidated international response.""Therefore, we call on the Presidency, the United Nations and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and world leaders to take every immediate action to cause the Government of Nigeria to stop the ongoing Nembe-Nigeria gas explosion in parallel with the COP26.""The superintending Nigerian ministries and departments are too compromised to act to determine and sanction defaulting operators. Their officers and the recalcitrant regulators have encouraged their repeated crimes of ecocide. Therefore, we demand that trusted international bodies lead the investigations, and commence ecological remediation and economic reparations."" SweetCrude Reports 2021.\l"
"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria190","Buhari to developed world: release annual $100b funds on climate change","The Nation (Nigeria)"," ","PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari has urged developed nations to fulfill their pledge of helping developing countries with about $100 billion annually to meet their commitments to the global greenhouse gas emissions eradication target.President Buhari stated this while delivering his national statement at the ongoing COP26 Leaders' Summit, in Glasgow, Scotland, assuring the audience that Nigeria will cut its gas emissions to net zero by 2060.According to a statement issued by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, President Buhari told the summit that attaining national and global climate change goals will require adequate, sustained technical and financial support to such nations.He noted that easier access to climate finance had become imperative in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, which really battered the economies of developing countries.He said greater effort should be channelled towards assisting developing nations to meet their ''Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) commitments through the pledges made by the developed countries to provide at least $100 billion yearly.'I do not think anyone in Nigeria needs persuading of the need for urgent action on the environment. Desertification in the North, floods in the centre, pollution and erosion on the coast are enough evidence.Making a case for gas-based energy transition in Nigeria, President Buhari requested international partners to finance projects using transition fuels such as gas in Nigeria.Acknowledging that net zero ambition can lead to economic transformation across all sectors, President Buhari said it would require critical infrastructure to be in place.He also told the COP26 Leaders' Summit that Nigeria has developed a detailed energy transition plan and roadmap, based on data and evidence.The President explained that the plan has highlighted some key facts that force the difficult conversations.On energy access, President Buhari declared that Nigeria's commitment to a just transition is reflected in ''our ambitious Energy Compact, which includes the government's flagship project to electrify 5 million households and 25 million people using decentralised solar energy solutions.''He described the project as a major first step towards closing energy access deficit in the country by 2030.World leaders yesterday made unprecedented commitments to protect forests, reduce methane emissions and accelerate green technology.Amid powerful pleas heard in Glasgow yesterday, world leaders, young people and campaigners all stressed the urgency of taking tangible action to keep the prospect of holding back global temperature rises to 1.5C and building resilience to climate impacts.About 114 leaders took a landmark step forward at a convening of world leaders on forests by committing to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030. The pledge is backed by $12bn in public and $7.2bn in private funding.Countries from Canada to Russia to Brazil - which also increased its NDC yesterday - China, Colombia, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo all endorsed the Glasgow Leaders' Declaration on Forest and Land Use.Together, they support 85% of the world's forests, an area of over 13 million square miles which absorbs around one third of global CO2 released from burning fossil fuels each year.This announcement was bolstered with a commitment by CEOs from more than 30 financial institutions with over $8.7 trillion of global assets - including Aviva, Schroders and Axa - committing to eliminate investment in activities linked to deforestation. Yesterday is also the first time a COP in recent history has hosted a major event on methane, with 105 countries, including 15 major emitters including Brazil, Nigeria and Canada, signing up to the Global Methane Pledge. This historic commitment, led by the US and EU alongside the UK COP26 presidency, equates to up to 40% of global methane emissions and 60% of global GDP.\l"
"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria191","A Conversation With Ernesto Yeboah, Part 1","Nigerian Tribune"," ","Despite being famous for the abundance of its natural resources, Africa has not lived up to its potential in the eyes of many. The continent has come to be synonymous with strife in contemporary times. The current situation of the continent is often blamed on the sensationalism and selectiveness of western media coverage of the region, which is underscored by a seemingly unending string of unflattering experiences-bloody coups, ethnic conflicts, electoral violence, political repression, poverty, famine, and pandemics. Other arguments seeking to explain Africa's undesirable socio-economic condition have pointed to the great atrocities of the transatlantic slave trade and colonialism, which indubitably had-and continue to have-significant consequences for the region's development but fail to exonerate Africa's post-colonial leadership from its abysmal treatment of the continent's most promising asset, its youth.Around the world and throughout history, the youth have been the backbone of social changes. From ancient times, even when our ancestors scarcely lived beyond their forties, the continuance of human civilization rested on the vigour of youth; on the farm, on the battlefield, and even on the floor of industry, youth have proven an indispensable asset. During and after the colonial rule in Africa, the youth have played a crucial role in political development. The youth movements of the 1920s and 30s gave rise to the political parties that bolstered Africa's readiness for self-government, and a bulk of Africa's independence leaders were youths themselves, under thirty-five years old.In addition, the perpetrators of Africa's first coups were young members of the army, some of whom held on to power for considerable periods. During the dark days of military rule, the African youth maintained activism for civil rights and democracy and fought against economic and social injustice through their various student union bodies. More recently, the Arab Spring movement in northern Africa, the RhodesMustFall movement in South Africa, and the EndSARS movement in Nigeria have represented the continuation of an agelong youth struggle against social and economic injustice.Whatever the scientific or historical reason for the systemic association of the youth with ignorance, incompetence, and irresponsibility characteristic of contemporary society, it is more a reflection of the 'life history theory' than it is of any biological limitation. The 'life-history theory,' built on the conclusion that teens behave differently depending on how hostile and unforgiving their environment feels to them, is a testament to youth's malleability and not their incapacity. This theory, which is primarily based on the perception that the period up to the 1950s was much tougher and its youth was £llowed' to assume responsibilities that would socially be considered outside its purview today, applies conversely to the emasculation of today's African youth in a period of unprecedented difficulty. Today, against the backdrop of rising unemployment and other socio-economic difficulties induced by climate change and bad leadership, the African youth is, in addition to several socio-economic deprivations, burdened with concocted and atavistic ageist perceptions.With a little apprehension, one may argue that nowhere has the youth suffered more deprivation in the twenty-first century than in Africa. Home to the world's second-largest youth-people under 25 years old-population after China, Africa's leadership has done very little to harness the creative energy of this vast human resource in providing the ideal socio-political and economic conditions required for this great continent to prosper. The widespread instances of debilitating poverty, disease, famine, and near-constant political instability on the continent weigh heavily on this youthful demographic that numbers about a billion people (around sixty per cent of the entire population).If not faced with intimidation, marginalization, or abuse, African youth have had to contend with unemployment and other challenges that come with being denied access to the kind of education and vocational training that would allow them to become productive members of society. As a result, except for the marginal percentage who have successfully risen above monumental odds to establish themselves through hard work and ingenuity, even on the global stage, many others remain trapped in a disabling environment, succumbing to social pressures and becoming tools in the hands of mischief makers and, in effect, a menace to their society.As all requests from the youth quarter for political inclusion and an address of the factors impeding youth development-human rights, women's rights, quality education, proper healthcare facilities, gainful employment opportunities, and climate change-have either fallen on deaf ears or been attended to by lip-service, the African youth have concluded that the only way they can turn their plight around for good is to take matters into their own hands. Thus, the continent has seen an increase in the number of youth activists who have formed associations and organized awareness campaigns-sometimes through protest marches-to mobilize their contemporaries to the youth cause of equity, liberty, and inclusion. Certain names/faces have emerged as symbols of the youth struggle in Africa due to this endeavour, which the technological revolution of social media has greatly facilitated.Alaa SalahIn 2018, twenty-five-year-old Alaa Salah (the 'Nubian Queen'), an engineering student of the Sudan International University, gained global recognition for her role in the 2018/2019 Sudanese revolution that eventually led to Omar-al Bashar's removal. As a Sudanese human rights activist and a member of MANSAM (Women of Sudanese Civic and Political Groups), Alaa and her fellow women activists decried the continued exclusion of women from leadership positions despite the significant role they have played in the struggle against social and economic injustices in the country. Alaa took the message of gender inequality in Sudan to the United Nations (UN) assembly in 2019. In her address to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), Alaa called for an all-inclusive government encompassing ethnic and religious minorities, civil society, resistance groups, and a fifty-per cent parity for women in governance. In the same year, she was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for her contributions to bringing peace to her country.Elizabeth WathutiElizabeth Wathuti is a twenty-six-year-old Kenyan environment and climate activist. She is the founder of Kenya's Green Generation Initiative, which encourages young people to care more about nature and be environmentally conscious. Her initiative has led to the planting of 30,000 tree seedlings in Kenya, a portion of which are food trees aimed at combating hunger in Kenya. At the 2021 COP26 Climate Conference in Glasgow, Elizabeth delivered an impassioned speech, calling on delegates to consider the cost of their inaction on the African continent and its peoples. In her own words: 'Please open your hearts...If you allow yourself to feel it the heartbreak and the injustice is hard to bear. Sub-Saharan Africans are responsible for just half a per cent of historical emissions, the children are responsible for none, but they are bearing the brunt.'Kilifeu, Thiat, and Malal TalaThe trio of Malal Talla, Cheik Oumar Cyrille Toure, and Bessane Seck are a group of Senegalese musicians and journalists who started the protest group Y'en a Marre (Fed Up) in 2011 to protest rampant power cuts in Dakar. From power cuts, the group came to identify a range of problems they were fed up with in Senegalese society. Beginning with their music, some of which evolved into rallying cries, the group and its members progressed to door-to-door campaigns to encourage youths to register to vote. Enduring arrests in 2012 for their role in organizing a sit-in protest at Dakar's Obelisk Square, the group pressed on with their campaign for political reform and were alleged to have raised over 300,000 votes, which led to the ousting of then Senegalese President, Abdoulaye Wade. Since then, the group has remained active, organizing meetings and shows and calling on the government to implement reform agreements, including land ownership reforms, which remains a critical issue for Senegal's rural poor.Stacy OwinoStacy Owino, a twenty-one-year-old Kenyan women's rights campaigner, is passionate about ending the widespread female genital mutilation (FGM) practice in East Africa. At the age of eighteen, Stacy, a Computer Science and Mathematics student, co-created an app that works to save girls from FGM by linking them with authorities and life-saving services close to them. Stacy Owino also represents Africa on the Youth Sounding Board for the European Commission. Her efforts towards eradicating FGM earned her honour at the 2020 Youth Activist Summit held at the UN in Geneva.The activists mentioned above by no means cover the breadth of youth engaged in activism in Africa. Several other young African activists scattered around the regions are actively engaged with one social, political, or economic injustice or the other. In many instances, such movements are faceless. They do not have an identified leader/leadership as a way of avoiding targeted government arrests and crackdowns that can easily break the spirit of the movement. Pitiably, this has been the common government response to such youth demands for change. Despite the brutal crackdowns that have met youth actions against social injustice-as witnessed with the EndSARS movement in Nigeria in 2020, youth action against anti-people government policies/practices is expected to persist as long as the proper measures are not taken to address these grievances.Please join us for a conversation with Ernesto Yeboah, the renowned Radical Activist and Commander-in-Chief, Economic Fighters League.\l"

The United Nations environmental agency UNEP calculates that the world's transport sector is almost entirely dependent on fossil fuels.But this\\xa0could change in the coming decades.COP26, over 100 national governments, cities, states and major businesses signed the\\xa0Glasgow Declaration on Zero-Emission Cars and Vans\\xa0to end the sale of internal combustion engines by 2035 in leading markets in 2040 worldwide.\\xa0 At least 13 nations also committed to end the sale of fossil fuel powered heavy duty vehicles by 2040.Local efforts are also underway, with Latin-American cities, including Bogota, Cuenca and Salvador, aiming to transform to zero-emissions public transport fleets by 2035.""The message for decision makers is: We need to make sure that we start normalizing that by 2035, we must stop selling petrol and diesel cars. For buses, it's going to be earlier, 2030; heavy trucking, can give some time, 2040.The point is getting used to the idea of having a calendar so we can shift to zero emission options in all segments. This is not just for advanced markets in developed countries, it's also for developing economies because we know the worst pollution is there"", said Monica Araya from the global initiative\\xa0Drive Electric Campaign.Ms. Araya was very clear that during the transition,\\xa0developing countries must not become the dumping grounds for old technology from the richest ones, and instead they should be seen as drivers of transformational change.""I grew up in Costa Rica. I do remember going to school on a third hand bus imported from the US. That experience shaped a lot of my thinking around this transition. I know, on the one hand, we have to make sure we transform the big markets that produce trucks, buses, cars, (but we also) have to activate changes in those markets so there are ripple effects,"" she explained.A green shipping industryThe shipping industry also made moves today with 200 businesses from across the shipping value chain committing to scaling and commercializing zero-emission shipping vessels and fuels by 2030. They also called on governments to get the right regulations and infrastructure in place to enable a just transition by 2050.Meanwhile, 19 countries signed the\\xa0Clydebank Declaration\\xa0to support the\\xa0establishment of zero-emission shipping routes.\\xa0This means creating at least six zero-emission maritime corridors by the middle of this decade, while aspiring to see many more in operation by 2030.""There's about 50,000 merchant ships out there in the world so it is a large task at hand, and I think different parts of shipping will move at different paces. So, having the commitment of the\\xa0Clydebank Declaration\\xa0for green corridors enables first movers to trial and prove technology then bring down costs, create the policy, enable the ecosystems that are needed, and then others can learn from that and then follow"", Katharine Palmer, a UN Climate Change High-Level Champion, explained to UN News.These green corridors mean the ships that transport goods all over the world would travel without using hydrocarbon fuels and instead would use fuels derived from green hydrogen \- hydrogen generated by renewable energy \- renewable electricity and other sustainable options.""It also includes engaging with energy producers so\\xa0they can produce enough (green) fuel.\\xa0A public-private collaboration with governments [will also be needed] to put out the necessary policy,"" the expert added. Aviation industry businesses and large corporate customers also announced an update of their\\xa0Clean Skies for Tomorrow Coalition,\\xa0whose mission is to accelerate the deployment of sustainable aviation fuels.Now, 80 signatories have committed to boost the green fuel to 10 per cent of the global jet fuel demand by 2030.These 'green fuels' are produced from\\xa0sustainable feedstock such as cooking oil, palm waste oil from animals or plants, and solid waste from homes and business, and are very similar in chemistry to traditional fossil jet fuel.If achieved, this will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 60 million tonnes a year and provide around 300,000 'green' jobs.But what about solar or electric? According to Lauren Uppink, head of Aviation at the World Economic Forum, these power sources might be possible for short flights in the future.""There will be a small portion of the energy demand that will rely on new technology like hydrogen and battery, but long haul is\\xa0not feasible for the physics of it.\\xa0So sustainable aviation fuels are our only solution for decarbonizing and flying carbon neutral,"" she told UN News.The expert also announced that the first electric and hydrogen fueled planes will possibly start being deployed by 2030, and the transition of the industry could also generate thousands of green jobs in developing countries.The COP26Beyond transport, the other big news at the conference on Wednesday was that the COP26 draft agreement was published by the Presidency, a preview of the final outcome document of the conference when it wraps up on Friday.The document urges countries to strengthen their national commitments and submit their strategies for their net-zero plans by 2022\\xa0to keep the 1.5C goal within reach.It also includes, for the first time in a COP outcome text, a mention of 'loss and damage', as well as a call to end fossil fuels subsidies.""The eyes of the world are very much on us. So, I will ask you to rise to the challenge"", Alok Sharma, COP26 President, told negotiators during an informal plenary.""We have all shifted gears this week as we seek to accelerate the pace and I still have the intention to finish at the end of Friday, this Friday for clarity!"" he said, sparking some nervous laughter in the room (COP negotiations are known for spilling over beyond their official day).Later in the day, Sharma told journalists that the text, drafted by his office, will change and evolve as countries begin to engage in the details but the commitment to accelerate action this decade must be ""unwavering"".""I want to be clear:\\xa0We are not seeking to reopen the Paris Agreement.\\xa0The Paris Agreement clearly sets out the temperature goal well below 2 degrees and pursuing efforts to 1.5 degrees,"" he said, adding that the presidency is aiming to chart a path across the three main pillars of Paris: finance, adaptation and mitigation.He said getting to the final draft of the text would be a 'challenging' task but stressed that there is a lot at risk if an ambitious outcome is not reached.""Everyone knows what's at stake in this negotiation. What we agree in Glasgow will set the future for our children and grandchildren, and we know nobody wants to fail them,"" he told journalists.Sharma cited Prime Minister of Barbados Mia Motley's words last week: ""Two degrees for her country and many others is a death sentence"".""We are fighting tooth and nail so that we have an ambitious outcome, and I have reminded negotiators that world leaders set out ambition last week and we need to deliver.

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria194","2022 Arrives with Doubtful Global Action on Climate Change","January 3, 2022 Monday","News Chronicle (Nigeria)","With the arrival of 2022, it was not clear by last year ending if the international community's efforts to tackle the climate change crisis, as seen at the COP26 UN Climate Conference, will result in meaningful action. Undoubtedly, 2021 saw another steady stream of UN-backed reports reinforcing a stark message: man-made climate change is an urgent and even existential threat to life on Earth.To avoid catastrophic climate change, global temperature rises need to be kept to a maximum of 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, but the odds of the world getting hotter in the next five years continue to increase.The World Meteorological Organisation's (WMO) flagship\\xa0State of the Global Climate\\xa0report warned in April that the global average temperature had already risen by about 1.2 degrees, and a UN Environment study in October revealed that, unless commitments to cut harmful greenhouse gas emissions are not improved, the world is\\xa0on track to warm\\xa0by 2.7 degrees this century.Several more reports from UN agencies showed that greenhouse gas concentrations are at record levels, and that the planet is on a path towards dangerous overheating, with worrying repercussions likely for current and future generations.The consequences of climate change, include more frequent extreme weather events, and there were many more of them this year, such as the\\xa0catastrophic flooding\\xa0in several western European countries that led to several deaths in July, and\\xa0devastating wildfires\\xa0in Mediterranean countries and Russia, in August.Data from the WMO\\xa0shows that, over the past few decades, the surge in natural disasters has disproportionately affected poorer countries and, last year, contributed to\\xa0mounting food insecurity, poverty and displacement in Africa.Paradoxically, the countries suffering most from the climate crisis are also those that are least responsible for creating it, a point made with increasing stridency governments and activists, who have helped to push the topic of adaptation higher up the agenda.Adaptation is a key pillar of the 2015\\xa0Paris Agreement\\xa0on Climate Change. It aims to reduce different countries and communities' vulnerability to climate change by increasing their ability to absorb impacts.A key UN Environment (UNEP) report in November\\xa0pointed out\\xa0that even if countries were to turn the emissions tap off today, climate impacts would remain, for decades to come. ""We need a step-change in adaptation ambition for funding and implementation to significantly reduce damages and losses from climate change,"" said UNEP chief Inger Andersen. ""And we need it now.""We also need to speed up the worldwide transition to cleaner forms of energy and end the use of coal, if we are to stand a chance of limiting temperature rises.Progress on this front remains sketchy, however: under current plans governments will\\xa0continue to produce energy from fossil-fuel\\xa0sources in quantities that will lead to more warming, despite improved climate commitments.Over the next two decades, governments are projecting an increase in global oil and gas production, and only a modest decrease in coal production. Taken together, these plans mean that fossil fuel production will increase overall, at least until 2040.These findings were laid out in the latest UN\\xa0Production Gap report, which included profiles for 15 major fossil fuel-producing countries, showing that most will continue to support fossil fuel production growth.Governments also committed to installing an additional 698 gigawatts of renewable energy from solar, wind, geothermal, hydro and renewables-based hydrogen, and businesses, notably power utilities, pledged to install an additional 823 GW, all by 2030.The increasing incidents of extreme weather is a clear sign that the natural world is reacting to man-made climate change but working with nature is touted as being one of the best ways to restore balance.This will require a lot of investment, and an overhaul of the way we interact with the natural world.The UN has\\xa0estimated\\xa0that an area of land roughly the size of China will need to restore to its natural state, if the planet's biodiversity and the communities who rely on it are to be protected, and annual investments\\xa0in nature-based solutions to the crisis will have to triple by 2030, and increase four-fold by 2050 if the world is to successfully tackle the triple threat of climate, biodiversity and land degradation.Meanwhile, with more than a million species at risk of extinction, UN chief Ant\'f3nio Guterres called on countries to work together to ensure a sustainable future for people and the planet, as the first part of the UN\\xa0Biodiversity Conference\\xa0opened in October (the second part is scheduled to take place in Spring 2022).The conference will develop a global roadmap for the conservation, protection, restoration and sustainable management of biodiversity and ecosystems for the next decade.From renewable energy, to\\xa0electric transport, reforestation and lifestyle changes, there are countless solutions to tackling the climate crisis, which many believe is the existential threat of our times. However, it is still not entirely clear where the money will come from to pay for it all.More than a decade ago, developed countries committed to jointly mobilize $100 billion per year by 2020 in support of climate action in developing countries. However, the figure has never been met. Nevertheless, the business world seems to be waking up to the fact that climate investments make economic sense. In most countries, for example, going solar is now cheaper than building new coal power plants, and clean energy investments could create\f18 million jobs by 2030.In October, 30 CEOs and senior business leaders of major companies, collectively worth some $16 trillion,\\xa0attended a meeting\\xa0of the Global Investors for Sustainable Development (GISD) Alliance, to develop guidel"

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria196","OPEC will maintain steady flow of energy supplies \u8211  Barkindo","March 10, 2022 Thursday","The Sun (Nigeria)","The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), says it will remain fully focused on maintaining a steady flow of energy supplies to consumers.Dr Mohammad Barkindo, OPEC Secretary-General said this on Thursday at the ongoing Nigeria Energy Forum (CERA Week 2022 Agenda) in Houston, Texas.The forum is tagged: ""Oil and Gas Investments: The Future of Fossil Fuels Amid the Quest for Decarbonisation"".Barkindo in a Keynote address, which was made available to newsmen in Abuja, said that OPEC would remain focused on energy supplies in spite of Russia-Ukraine crisis and COVID-19 pandemic which had adverse effects on the energy markets globally.""Over the past ten days or so, we have seen escalating geopolitical tensions, which are still unfolding and having adverse effects on energy markets across the world, resulting in heightened levels of volatility.""Our hope in this crisis is that all parties involved can reach positive outcomes that will be acceptable to all,"" he said.Barkindo noted that the COVID-19 pandemic taught OPEC the value of taking a prudent approach to oil supply and demand developments.According to him, this should be done with the flexibility to adapt strategies as and when needed, ultimately for well-being of global community.In terms of the market outlook for 2022, the secretary-general said there was evidently some optimism, but it was also cognisant that uncertainties remained and was further complicated by geopolitical developments and exceptional market volatility.According to him, optimism is being driven by the vaccine rollout, although this needs to filter through to more developing countries, improving mobility, and the continuing economic recovery.""Uncertainties relate to COVID-19 developments, although at present we see the impact of the Omicron variant on the oil market to be relatively mild and short-lived.""Additionally, the geopolitical challenges already mentioned global supply chain issues, potential effects of rising inflation, consequent rise in interest rates, and knock on-impacts from challenges in gas, coal, electricity sectors, need to be closely monitored,"" he said.Speaking on the theme of the session, he said the unpredictability and volatility brought on by the pandemic had intensified discussions related to climate change and the energy transition.This, Barkindo said was clear at 2021 COP26 meeting in Glasgow, Scotland.He listed a number of positive outcomes such as the U.S. returning to the head of the multilateral table, all Parties commitment to the implementation and full operationalisation of the Paris Agreement, and the announcement of the Glasgow Climate Pact.This, he said was all encouraging, given the pressing need to reduce global emissions, alleviate energy poverty, counter the impacts of the pandemic, and find a sustainable way forward leaving no country, industry, or peoples behind.Additionally, he said that it was witnessing investors, environmental lobbyists and some corporate boards pressuring oil and gas companies and governments to pursue increasingly radical policies and initiatives that could be more disruptive, than productive for global energy industry.""There have recently been calls for investments in new oil and gas projects to be discontinued, particularly in the context of discussions around net-zero targets. This is again wrong.""We understand the move of many developed nations to set net-zero emissions targets. A number of developing nations have too. In fact, some OPEC Member Countries, including Nigeria, have made political pledges on net zero.""However, it is important to appreciate the massive challenges for developing countries to reach net zero emissions, many of which are acutely focused on priorities such as energy access, living wages, and supplying basic necessities.""We need to continually keep in mind that access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy, is a right for all, not a privilege of the few, and is enshrined by the UN in Sustainable Development Goal Seven,"" he noted.According to him, the unfortunate reality for developing countries is that a staggering 759 million people worldwide did not have access to electricity in 2019, with about 79 per cent of them located in Africa.This, he said included a massive 70 per cent of Africans, exposing them to high levels of household air pollution.He further disclosed that from the perspective of Nigeria alone, in 2019, only 55 per cent of the population had access to electricity and only 13 per cent had access to clean cooking.He recalled that in the energy poverty debate that Africa was still relatively unexplored in terms of oil and gas.According to him, this is in spite being bestowed with approximately 125 billion barrels of proven oil reserves and 16 trillion standard cubic metres of natural gas.

The show was a build up to the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow on from November 1 to 12.Featuring four climate change artists, on 17 canvas, the project showcased sustainable art aimed at provoking innovative responses on enhancing climate resilience, green economic recovery and low-carbon development for Nigeria and the world at large.The paintings were arranged in four categories namely limiting global temperature by 1.50c; Climate adaptation, climate finance and collaborations.In her opening remarks, the Project Director of Solution17 for Climate Action and Naija Climate Now, Foluke Michaels recounted the dangers of complacency in the threat of polluted earth and why art is a viable tool for saving the earth.""By 2030, there will be reduction in rainforest and of course species will be lost and there will be speed in global warming, just nine years' time. By 2040, greenhouse gas will be many times more potent than carbon dioxide, accelerating the speed of climate change. By 2050, the ocean will become very acidic because of heat. By 2080, a global food crisis will happen due to soil overuse. Weather will become very unpredictable.We are mobilising everyone across Nigeria and beyond to act for climate change through education, creativity, innovation, technology and entrepreneurship and art. Art and music will help us to reach our goal quickly,"" she said.Oba Abdulwasiu Omogbolahan Lawal, Abisogun II, the Oniru of Iru Kingdom expressed his confidence in the project.""Our actions and inactions are very germane. I know what Lagos State Government is doing in making Lagos to be climate change resilient,"" he said.The Deputy British High Commissioner, in his welcome address, Ben Llewellyn-Jones mirrored the sentiment shared by the project director.""The 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties or COP26 which the UK is hosting in Glasgow in just under four weeks from today is an invitation for all of us to rethink our way of life. And we will use our platform at COP26 to focus this ambition,"" he said.The leading textile artist, Nike Davies-Okundaye who also mentored the four artists offered encouraging words to the artists. One of them, Anjolaoluwa Olanrewaju who explored renewable energy in her work described the exhibition as a lifetime opportunity.""The CYCDI organised some art competitions in the past and that was how I got developed since I was 9 or 8. As I was growing, I was always part of the art competition and I participated each year and the years when I was above the age, I was called in as a mentor to other younger ones.As for Oluchi Nwaokorie, who is a CEO for a waste management organization, collecting waste and converting it to art is serious business.""Our last clean-up was in Iwaya. We have converted plastic waste to 3D filament. Everyone can make a difference,"" she said.Other exhibiting artists are Victory Ashaka and Tobi Titiloye who explored mixed media painting.

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria198","Animal Welfare, Human Health And Climate Change: Why FG Must Take Action Now","Nigerian Tribune"," ","For some time now, I have been promoting laying hens' welfare under the name of my organisation, known as Animal Protection Organisation of Nigeria. For the past two years, we have been calling for the eradication of battery cages due to the menace it contributes to human and environmental health, laying hen welfare and surrounding wildlife.Today, several countries are ditching confinement of hens in battery cages because research has pointed to critical issues that needs urgent attention. For futuristic nations, moving ahead other nations in all ramifications is a core value. COP26 as you may know revealed the effect of factory farming on the planet and all we need to do to savage the situation. Going forward matters a lot and only wise nations who understands the concept of climate resilience and animal welfare and how they all tie together with social justice, will make the big-break.My opinion centres on the connection between animal welfare, human health and climate change and why this is the time for Nigerian government to take drastic actions to mitigate impeding dangers when the opportunity is still available.Have you ever heard of super bug?According to the World Health Organization (WHO), this condition will affect over 50million people globally in few years to come. Super bug is resistance to antibiotics caused by misuse and overuse of antibiotics on farmed animals, which ends up in human body through regular consumption of farmed animals and their products. To overturn this situation, I suggest intensive research into organic medicine remedy than orthodox medicine. Secondly, government agencies and non-governmentalorganizations should work together to enforce existing welfare regulation and brainstorm new ideas towards improving established regulations through reforms, research and strategy.As more cages are removed and replaced with free range systems in Europe, more chickens in Africa will suffer confinement as the huge numbers of battery cages banned in Europe end up in Africa, where battery cages thrives like wildfire. Animals are suffering in Africa because there are no adequate welfare measures in place for the non-human animals. This calls for concern as lack of adequate welfare may infringe on human health bearing in mind super bug as explained above. To mitigate this, government should enact anti caging laws and make if effective immediately. This action will save millions of birds from the pains and diseases caused by bird cages, like, acute respiratory disease and cage layer fatigue.A free range poultry system which we are craving for will end chicken abuse, antimicrobial resistance, reduce methane emissions and other menaces. In this typical farming systems, birds behaves more naturally as there are enough space for them. The large expanse of land allows perching, foraging, stretching, nesting, sand bathing etc.My delving into animal welfare advocacy goes beyond my love for animals. Animal sentient simply means an understanding of man that all animals share almost same instinct as us.Animals are sentient beings in that, they feel pain, emotional, respond to stimulus, fear, etc. Just as we do. Researchers have come out with evidence to buttress this fact. Now, how many people know this? I'm sure it's only just a few. In modern animal advocacy, it is believed that the major intent of animal Protection is born out of the understanding and recognition of animal sentient. No longer due to a personal love for animals. It goes beyond that now!Another reason why we do what do is because Nigerian government, as with other countries, recognises animal sentient. For this reason, we shall always use this as a reference point in the discharge of work, even though the Nigerian government has not made it applicable. But we believe with time and with our constant pressure, the animal Law reform will enhance social justice for animal beyond what it is currently, as enshrined in the criminal code.In addition, we do this for the health benefits of the people. Imagine devouring eggs or meat from a poor production systems, the possibility of contacting salmonella from a filthy poultry or tuberculosis from an infected cow or consuming antibiotics infested fish is 99%. Animal welfare is crucial in ensuring the food is safe for consumption. Not everyone understands this concept. This is why we take this issue very seriously for the overall benefits of man and animals. Our ongoing cage-free campaign is aimed at ensuring that hens get the best form of welfare standard while ensuring safe and quality eggs are produced.Furthermore, ensuring a safe haven for all life forms is what we pride ourselves in. The call for climate action globally, is never more needed than now. Animal agriculture or otherwise called 'factory farming' is one of the major cause of climate change. Large gasses (methane) from ammonia emits from farm and the long-term effect of this huge emission is ozone layer depletion.I hereby call on everyone to join us not just to create a better world for animals but also to sustain it.Joseph Odika is the Executive Director of Animal Protection Organization of Nigeria (APON) and he writes from Ibadan, Oyo State.\l"

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria200","Why are public banks bankrolling harm on nature?","Business Day"," ","I grew up in Nigeria a country twice the size of Germany. Its landmass spans different climates, and it brings a huge variety of habitats and ecosystems. Its protection and sustainable use is critical to the economic security of the country. But it also gives Nigeria, and other parts of Africa with similar biodiversity, an indispensable role in tackling climate change, with rainforests, swamp forests and flood plains all acting as carbon sinks.40% of Nigerians are deemed to be living in poverty, and the links between environmental degradation, climate change and high poverty levels have not gone unrecognised by Nigerian leaders in the past. Despite the knowledge that the state of nature is of critical importance to many Nigerians, it has one of the highest deforestation rates globally, losing approximately 350,000 400,000 hectares per year.By the end of week one of the UN Climate Summit (COP26) last year, it was clear that nature was beginning to lose its consignment to the fringes of climate summits. One of the biggest announcements to come out of COP26 was that 120 world leaders from both forest commodity producers and consumer countries were to end deforestation by 2030 Nigeria being one of these.Despite these commitments, public money is causing harm.By their very nature, development banks (DFIs) exist to boost economies sustainably. It's not an easy balance to strike. On one hand, the banks should be creating opportunities and jobs in the immediate term by supporting the private sector. On the other, they should be ensuring that what they are funding is compatible with climate goals and the protection and restoration of nature for long term security. These aren't ""nice to haves"" pushed by green activists: 45% of the global population live in rural areas of developing countries where income and sustenance are generated from the land. Those living in poverty are relying on institutes like development banks to think of the long-term impacts of how they spend their money. They don't have the luxury to pick and choose where they gain their income, or where they get their food, but I'm sure they wouldn't expect the banks that are supposed to be helping them to be destroying what options they do have.Yet, despite having these people's futures in their hands, a new report from portfolio.earth has found a complete lack of policies from development banks to prevent the funding of projects that will leave forests, peatlands and oceans in dire states. If you take forests as an example, globally 1.6 billion people depend upon them for their livelihoods; portfolio.earth finds DFIs headquartered in the UK, EU and Asia have no exclusion policies concerning some of the key drivers of biodiversity degradation such as industrial fishing and agriculture, extractives, and plastics to name a few.Read also:Climate change: Group warns campaigns could hurt Africa's transport sectorRather than supporting the people of Nigeria, development banks are letting them down.Nigeria produces half a million tonnes of poorly managed single-use plastic every year, 40% of which is estimated to end up in the ocean. Indorama Eleme is a plastics and petrochemicals plant in Port Harcourt. Yet if you take the UK as an example donor of development finance, they have invested 5 times more in this plastic company in Nigeria than they have in rural agriculture that could directly benefit people.What is the solution that countries like Nigeria need?To what extend do DFIs systematically assess how reliant on nature the people they are supposed to be supporting are? If they don't have a way in which to quantify the long-term risks the projects they are funding pose to vital ecosystem services, then they need one. Only then can exclusion policies and measures be put in place to rule out the worst offending industries. Nature and its value must be mainstreamed into development finance, not just by excluding harmful sectors, but by financially boosting those that provide the triple benefit of addressing poverty, climate, and nature. The value of supporting sustainable agriculture or creating jobs in industries designed to restore peatlands and forests needs to be recognised. Strategies for building up these types of sectors needs to be created. Particularly whilst they stand on the global stage and tell the world they are working hard to tackle climate change and protect nature.

Without a strong African presence in the room, COP26 will be a caucus of polluters.The statement by the civil societies noted that the new measures are designed to undermine meaningful debate on the critical issues that must be addressed to ensure that climate action is both sufficiently ambitious and caters for the long-standing needs and demands of the African people.'It is ironical that despite its publicly stated ambitions, the UK government is doing everything possible to ensure that fails, or at least fails Africa. This is particularly disturbing in the light of the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report that shows that the window of opportunities for action to avoid a climate calamity is fast closing,' noted Mithika.The recent IPCC report reaffirms that Africa is among the regions most affected by climate change and is expected to reach irreversible extremes earlier than other parts of the world.While acknowledging the need for the UK Government to protect delegates and the UK public from COVID-19, the CSOSs however demanded that the need for response to the twin global threats posed by COVID-19 and the climate change demand that the UK government waive mandatory quarantine for all COP 26 participant, irrespective of whether they are in the red list or not.'In the place of current discriminatory and suppressive travel restrictions, the UK should direct its efforts towards the enforcement of distancing and hygiene rules at COP 26 venues,' said the statement.Further, the African activists said the UK should match their pledge of delivering an ambitious COP with action by facilitating the full and duress-free participation of all delegates, especially those from Africa.

Their decisions for making firm commitments and implementation of climate action are set far too late for any chance of slowing down or reversing the harsh climate impacts. As activists fought and raised their voices during the recently concluded climate talks, COP26, literally the world's best last chance to save the planet from a climate emergency,\\xa0 little tangible gains have been made.For the umpteenth time, the global north has chosen to forsake the demands of the most vulnerable communities in the global south who are already experiencing the worst there is from the devastating effects of climate change. Wealthy countries that failed to honor their $100bn commitment have now decided to put off that demand until an unlikely date in 2023. This comes even as the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), indicated that adaptation and damage could cost developing nations between $140 and $300 billion per year by 2030, dwarfing the initial pledge that is yet to be met. Leaders of wealthy nations are hesitant about meeting this target for fear of being the cash cow whenever climate finance is needed for addressing climate solutions even as they have for a long time been the biggest polluters on the planet causing climate catastrophe.What's worse, the summit showed that the appetite for continued fossil fuel use is set to increase with peak demands expected within the decade, and the fossil fuel industry sent the largest delegation to Glasgow just to ensure that their business model continues to thrive amidst an existential crisis. Arguably, there's more money to be made in this industry and a lot of fossil fuels to be exploited before any binding and exit commitments are made. This fossil fuel addiction makes the goal of limiting global warming to 1.50C ever elusive. A briefing by the Climate Action Tracker (CAT) states that even if all current pledges are made, the world is still headed to 2.40C warming if not more. Yet, global leaders and the fossil fuel industry continue to make net-zero targets and announcements, another greenwashing tactic at play that is more of a lip service than geared towards real action which means zero emissions.In contrast, there's huge potential for solar and wind to make up for renewable energy even in the most vulnerable countries such as those in Africa. However, the transition to renewable energy is considered as an imaginable tech for the future, too complex to integrate now, and too inefficient to sufficiently meet current global energy needs. As such, the uptake has been slow with unreliable products. Yet, the fossil fuel industry wants us to imagine the possibility of creating a carbon capture and storage mechanism just so that they can ensure that they keep up with their rising carbon emissions and greenwashing tactics.Resultantly, there is no convincing global leaders otherwise, as leaders want their pockets l"

Meanwhile, over 750 million people lack access to electricity and 2.6 billion still cook and heat with wood, charcoal, and other unhealthy fuels.""Today, hundreds of millions of people struggle with energy poverty.

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria209","Placing Gender On the Front Burner of Climate Change Action","November 11, 2021","This Day (Lagos)","There is a commitment from member countries at the ongoing Climate Change Conference (COP26) to promote gender-responsiveness programmes in climate change related activities.Climate change has become one of the most defining policy issues of the 21st century. From changing weather patterns that threaten food security, to rising sea levels, that increase the risk of catastrophic flooding as well as increase in atmospheric temperature that results in global warming, the impacts of climate change are global in scope. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) recognizes adaptation as a critical option that countries should pursue to reduce the impact of change.Speaking during a presentation of the Nigeria's Adaptation Communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) report in Glasgow Scotland, the Minister for State, Federal Ministry of Environment, Sharon Ikeazor, said the Adaptation Communication (ADCOM) established by article 7, paragraphs 10 and 11, of the Paris Agreement requires parties to submit and update periodically its ADCOM.She also noted that ADCOM would increase visibility and profile of adaptation alongside its balance with mitigation, strengthen adaptation action and support for developing countries, provide input to the global stock take, assess progress, ""made in achieving the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA) and enhance learning and understanding of adaptation needs and actions.""She added, ""It has been recognized that women and men are disproportionately affected by climate change and usually, women are more impacted than men. However, the federal government is expanding on its Implementation Strategy for their National Gender and Climate Action Plan.""Ikeazor noted that women are more vulnerable to the effects of climate change than men primarily as they constitute the majority of the world poor.Meanwhile, a recent report by Women Watch (2009) and FAO (2011) revealed that about 70 per cent of the people who live on less than $1 per day and are highly dependent for their livelihood on natural resources are women and therefore more threatened by climate change.Another report by the Nigerian Environmental Study Action Team (NEST) affirmed that women experience and/or react to climate change differently from men. The report stated that increased pests and diseases due to climate change can increase women's workload as they have more responsibility for caring for their families and the sick.According to the report, ""Gender element in climate change and adaptation refers to how climate change affects men and women in different ways; how men and women respond to and cope with the changing climate and the differences in shifting from short-term coping strategies to resilience.It is a known fact that climate change worsens the existing gender inequality, making women face higher negative impacts than men. However, women are not just mere victims but active agents of change. Furthermore, they possess the knowledge and skills that relevant authorities can utilize for climate change adaption and the development of resilience.""Recently, the United Kingdom Government announced the donation of \£3165 million as part of its commitment to tackle climate change. The fund is expected to address inequalities that make women and girls more vulnerable to climate change and empowering them to take climate action.They noted that around the world, the UN had found that women were more vulnerable to the effects of climate change than men, because they constitute a large majority of the world's poor and often depend on small-scale farming for a livelihood, which is particularly vulnerable to climate change.They affirmed that women and children could comprise 80 percent of those displaced by climate-related disaster.But it noted that addressing gender inequality had also been proven to advance efforts to tackle climate change.It would be recalled that in 2017, Nigeria adopted the International Gender Action Plan by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and in 2020, the country developed its National Action Plan on Gender and Climate Change, with the main goal of the plan being to ensure that national climate change efforts in Nigeria mainstream gender considerations to guarantee the inclusivity of all demographics in the formulation and implementation of climate change initiatives, programs and policies.However, an implementation strategy was developed in 2021 with UK support, which set out how gender action should be implemented under five climate change priority areas namely: agriculture, forestry and land use; food security and health; energy and transport; waste management; water and Sanitation.Other national climate plans on adaptation and mitigation including Nigeria's revised Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and its recently published Adaptation Communication highlighted measures to enhance gender integration in climate change policies and actions.""It is women, girls and those who are already most marginalised, that will be most severely impacted by climate change. But they also have a critical role to play to address the climate crisis. ""The UK is committed to addressing this dual challenge head on, committing new funding to empower communities and women's groups to take locally-led adaptation action, to build local, national and global resilience. I urge more countries to make commitments to implement the UNFCCC Gender Action Plan and deliver the goals of the Feminist Action for Climate Justice, ""the government said.The British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Catriona Laing said: ""Climate change has led to the preventable loss of lives through actions that are insufficient or delayed, rolling back women's economic gains of past decades. Aligning resources and responses, and taking deliberate action will provide us an opportunity to improve livelihoods of women, create a sustainable economic future and better protect the planet.""Throughout the UK's COP26 Presidency, we are encouraging countries around the world to put gender equality at the heart of climate action. I am pleased that Nigeria is engaged on this agenda and is putting gender considerations at the core of national climate and development plans.""The UN AngleMeanwhile, the COP26 President Alok Sharma and UK International Champion on Adaptation and Resilience for the COP26 Presidency, Anne-Marie Trevelyan hosted the UK's Presidency Gender Day event accompanied by Little Amal, the 3.5 metre puppet travelling 8,000km in support of refugees, and Brianna Fruean, a Samoan Climate Change activist.She espoused that women and girls are disproportionately impacted by climate change, adding that they cannot allow equality to be a casualty of climate.She expressed delight that women and girls are also leading efforts to tackle climate change in communities around the world.According to her, ""We must enable the full and meaningful participation of women and girls in climate action. So, I am very pleased to say that countries and other stakeholders have made announcements today to make climate action gender-responsive.""I am also very pleased to report that yesterday countries collectively pledged in excess of $232 million to the Adaptation Fund, which will support countries to deal with the impact of a changing climate.""Gender and inclusivity run throughout our COP Programme, including Science and Innovation Day. And I have always said it is vital that we follow the facts, and allow science to light the way. I'm going to turn now to the negotiations. I am encouraged by countries' commitments to anchoring science at the heart of the Cover Decision.""Yesterday, my lead negotiator Archie Young convened Heads of Delegations on the elements of the Cover Decision, that we proposed in our Non-Paper. As I announced at the informal stocktaking plenary yesterday, I have requested pairings of Ministers to support the Presidency in some of the key outstanding issues on which we need to reach agreement. These Pairs started their work yesterday and are consulting with a wide group of ministers and negotiators. And then we convened yesterday evening and the Ministerial pairs reported on their discussions.""The time has now come to find political consensus on the areas of divergence. and we have only a few days left. New texts were also tabled on issues including common timeframes, transparency, finance and adaptation. We are making progress at COP26 but we still have a mountain to climb over the next few days. And what has been collectively committed to goes some way, but certainly not all the way, to keeping 1.5C within reach.""The gap in ambition has narrowed. Now the world needs confidence that we will shift immediately into implementation, that the pledges made here will be delivered, and that the policies and investment will swiftly follow. We have an opportunity to succeed. The transition to a resilient zero carbon economy is technologically possible, it is economically attractive and it is accelerating everywhere. And if we successfully manage this will deliver immense benefits for the world.""Building on existing mechanisms; transparency and accountability must be at the heart of these commitments. So overnight the Presidency will publish the first draft of the Cover Decision. It will likely require negotiating teams to consult their leaders and capitals. We have an urgency to our negotiations so I ask Ministers and negotiators to carry out these consultations expeditiously.""Gender Commitments at COP26There is a commitment from the US government to commit new funding for gender-responsive climate programming which includes $14 million of the Gender Equity and Equality Action Fund to advance women and girls' leadership in climate action and participation in green industries, while building their climate resilience, and $3 million investment to support women farmers in East Africa to adapt to climate impacts.The government of Norway has also committed to strengthening the role and impact of women and girls in both international and national climate decision-making, including in UNFCCC-processes and in national decision-making on climate policies. Canadian government is set to ensure that 80 percent of its $5.3 billion climate investments over the next five years target gender equality outcomes.Similarly, Sierra Leone is committing to address long-standing discriminatory land tenure practices, which deny women access to and control of land through enacting a range of new legislation.There is a call to action from The Rallying Cry, urging the finance community to further invest in the women business leaders and enterprises at the heart of the transformation the world needs.\l"

In the suit, Nigeria is claiming more than $1.7 billion for the bank's role in the controversial deal. In 2011, Shell and Eni, paid $1.3 billion to the Nigerian government for the acquisition of an oil block prospecting licence. However, it was alleged that about $1.1 billion of that amount ended up in the account of Malabo Oil and Gas, which was owned by former petroleum minister Dan Etete. It is alleged that the funds were used to pay political bribes. The London case dates back to 1998 when Nigerian military ruler Sani Abacha awarded the offshore oilfield licence, OPL 245, to a company former oil minister Etete owned.Nigerians push for Buhari to sign election reform billbr A coalition of Nigerian activists have protested in the capital city Abuja, demanding that President Muhammadu Buhari sign a bill that aims to improve transparency, inclusion, and planning for national elections.

The estimated spending on all those need to be $3.5 trillion per year more than today if the world was to achieve net-zero by 2050, according to the firm.To put the global funding requirement in context, McKinsey stated that the increase was equivalent to half of global corporate profits and one-quarter of total tax revenue in 2020.According to the report, the impact of the energy transition would be uneven across countries and sectors.""Many of these sectors would also incur cost increases as they decarbonise. For example, steel and cement production costs would rise by about 30 per cent and 45 per cent, respectively, by 2050, compared with today, in the scenario we analyse,"" McKinsey said.It added that spending on the net-zero economy would also be unevenly distributed around the world, stating that developing countries and producers of fossil fuels will have to spend more as a share of their GDP than other countries.In the case of sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, India, and other Asian nations, the spending would be about 1.5 times as much as advanced economies, or more, according to McKinsey.It noted that the developing countries in South-east Asia and Africa, those that cannot afford to splash trillions of US dollars on anything, are also those most exposed to the effects of climate change.""One of the most immediate risks is that of a disorderly energy transition, if the ramp up of low-emissions activities does not take place fast enough to fill gaps left by the ramping down of high-emissions activities,"" McKinsey said.It explained that soaring energy prices could create a backlash that delays the transition, noting the importance of the careful management of the transition to spare the world more shocks in energy supply and prices.At the COP26\l"

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria214","Climate change: Much ado about carbon reduction target","November 3, 2021 Wednesday","The Punch","Opinion Published 3 November 2021COP26), world leaders are once again talking of ambitious carbon reduction targets. The US President Joe Biden, for example, has set the goal of creating ""a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035 and net zero emissions economy by no later than 2050."" Most rich nations' governments have formulated similar ambitions.Unfortunately, that target will be prohibitively expensive. A new study in the renowned journal Nature shows the cost of 95 per cent reduction by 2050  almost Biden's net-zero  would cost 11.9 per cent of GDP or more than $11,000 present-day dollars for each American every year.Twenty-four years have passed since the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol, the first major global agreement promising to cut carbon emissions. Since then, the world has hosted hundreds of climate summits and rich nations have reliably talked green; but emissions have kept increasing because no leaders want to stick their citizens with the huge price tag.In a very frank analysis of the last decade of climate policy, the UN calls the 2010s a ""lost decade."" It cannot tell the difference between what has happened and a world that adopted no new climate policies since 2005. Just think about that: After all these climate summits and all these climate promises, when looking at the actual emissions we can't tell the difference from the world we're in and a world where we didn't care to do anything about climate since 2005.That puts the challenge with COP26 in perspective. World leaders can choose to do what they have done over decades and contribute to yet another climate meeting in a world overflowing with well-meaning climate summits. Nation after nation will show up and make nice sounding promises like transforming its electricity sector (which is responsible for only 19 per cent of all the energy the world consumes) to renewables. There is a good chance those promises will eventually be revealed to be just as hollow as the last decades' worth of promises, because voters will reject the bill.Or leaders could finally go down a different path.What is needed is a much stronger focus on green energy research. If the world could innovate green energy that was cheaper than fossil fuels, we would have solved global warming. Everyone would switch, including Asia, Africa and Latin America. Working with 27 of the world's top climate economists and three Nobel laureates, my think tank, the Copenhagen Consensus, found the most effective, long-term climate policy is in investing a lot more resources in green R&D.During the 2015 Paris climate summit, more than 20 countries promised to double R&D spending on green energy innovations by 2020. Unfortunately, they are failing this promise, too.Instead of making big and expensive promises that future governments will have to backtrack on once citizens protest rising power bills, leaders should immediately commit to spending much more on green R&D. Not only have most nations already made that promise, but compliance can be verified within 12 months. And the total cost for each nation will be much lower than current climate policies. For 2030, our Nobel economists suggested that the world increase its spending another $70 billion per year. Compare that to the $195 billion we are currently spending on subsidising ineffective green energy.At the COP26Bjorn Lomborg is President of the Copenhagen Consensus and Visiting Fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution\l"

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria216","Interview: End trade barriers to help tackle climate crisis, says WTO chief, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala","December 25, 2021 Saturday","ionigeria (Lagos, Nigeria)","Removing trade barriers around the world would help to tackle the climate crisis, enable a 'just transition' away from fossil fuels and make developing countries more resilient to the impacts of global heating, the head of the World Trade Organization has said.Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, who took over as director-general of the global watchdog last March, said: 'Trade is part of the solution, not part of the problem ... We need a global effort to climate-proof the supply chains and infrastructure of the most vulnerable economies or risk undoing hard-won economic progress and development.'She told The Guardian trade would be essential to helping developing countries cope with the effects of extreme weather, which are already being felt. 'We need to put in place trade policies to cushion against the negative impacts of climate change, to ensure food security in the face of climate threats [and] provide access to adaptation technologies,' she said.Developing countries have long been wary of international trade talks, fearing that wealthy countries were using them to protect their own economies while enabling them to export goods to poor countries, and in some cases criticising the WTO for being biased in favour of the rich. Many have also been sceptical of including climate issues, and fear that 'environmental' standards insisted on by some developed countries would be used as a cover for raising barriers to cheap imports from the developing world. Green campaigners have also claimed the WTO has encouraged high-carbon trade.Okonjo-Iweala, a former finance minister of Nigeria and World Bank economist, who is the first African and first woman to head the WTO, moved to reassure doubters. 'Trade helps to build resilience. People don't recognise it but the fact [is] that in times of great difficulty, trade can help move services and goods to where they are needed. Food for instance: trade helps to move food from one area that is not drought-stricken or flood-prone to another.'Environmental rules could be compatible with trade, she said: 'The WTO rules do not preclude people from putting in environmental standards [but] if you're designing your environmental policies you have to do it in such a way that it's transparent, and you are not discriminating against like products.'The WTO last week embarked on an initiative to incorporate environmental concerns into trade, with roadmaps for the reform of fossil fuel subsidies, encouraging sustainability in international trade, and controlling plastic pollution.Okonjo-Iweala believes that, in the wake of the Cop26 summit, trade will become a vital tool in achieving the drastic cuts necessary in greenhouse gas emissions, helping to shift the global economy to a low-carbon footing. She said: 'What is clear is that climate negotiations have shifted from technical discussions to actual implementation ... This makes the role of trade and trade policy even more urgent in ensuring a just and effective green transition for all.'Agreements were signed in Glasgow last month to cut methane around the world, protect forests, and institute a global system of carbon trading under the 2015 Paris agreement, all of which she said the WTO could help with.But she said developing countries also needed assistance from the rich world, especially in the form of climate finance, which comes from public and private sources in the rich world to help poor countries cut emissions and cope with the effects of extreme weather. Rich countries have so far failed to produce the $100bn in climate finance promised each year to developing countries from 2020, though they are likely to hit the target by 2023.Okonjo-Iweala said this was not good enough: 'If you can mobilise $26tn [in response to Covid-19], it beggars belief from the part of developing countries that you can't mobilise $100bn [for climate finance]. That's what's causing a huge trust deficit.'The UK should also restore its recent cuts to overseas aid, she added. 'We all want the UK to go back to 0.7% [of GDP going to overseas aid, the previous target which was slashed to 0.5% by the chancellor of the exchequer, Rishi Sunak]. It's been a leader in overseas aid and should continue to lead. So we don't want to see this cut back.'Over the next year, countries will be asked to reconsider their national targets on cutting emissions and how to meet them, before the next UN climate meeting, Cop27 in Egypt in November. Okonjo-Iweala said: 'We saw promising outcomes from Cop26, but I would not be alone in saying that the world is not yet on track to giving the most vulnerable countries and communities a fighting chance in the face of climate change. The WTO has a vital role to play in harnessing trade as a tool to get us closer to climate targets.'\l"
"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria217","Zero Emission Target: Nigeria Should ""Follow Follow'' With Open Sense","Weekly Trust"," ","In a recent interview, the Managing Director, Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC), Mr. Chiedu Ugbo said there is ""serious demand for electricity across the country. We also have gas in the ground across the country; we also have gas thermal power plants. Therefore, we must as a matter of principle and policy optimise the use of this gas to provide electricity for Nigerians. Out of the 14,000 megawatts contracted to power generation firms by Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (NBET), well over 85 per cent of that are for gas thermal power plants.""So, what are you going to do with these plants if we are going to cut down on renewables? Also, where are we with regards to renewables? Again, I know it is the government's policy to increase renewables over time. But as at today, about 85 per cent of the contracted 14,000MW is supposed to be fueled by gas and we need to harness this gas, get electricity to consumers, develop our country, and then begin to increase other sources of electricity.Tributes as Desmond Tutu, South Africa's anti-apartheid hero, dies at 90Free train rides: NRC debunks ticket sales, records passengers' surgeIt has been stated that our electricity demand is somewhere around 28,000MW, perhaps we can then use other sources of renewables such as solar, small hydro plants and wind to develop the rest amount of electricity that is required.In 2019, the World Bank reported that only 55.4 per cent of Nigerians had access to electricity. Yet, at the November 2021 climate talks in Glasgow, President Muhammadu Buhari announced a 2060 net zero target. Zero emission means that vehicles and other mobile machinery used for transport (over land, sea, air) and for other uses (agricultural, mobile power generation, etc.) will cease to be powered by fossil fuels believed to contribute heavily to climate change and pollution.In its long history, the Earth has warmed and cooled depending on how more or less the planet received sunlight due to subtle shifts in its orbit, as the atmosphere or surface changed, or when the energy of the sun varied. In the past century, however, there are fears that warming has increased more than any time in history due to human influence. To cool things down, climate activists have been advocating deliberate actions to reverse the trend by national governments. Now, 192 countries have adopted the Kyoto Protocol which, among many other objectives, aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55 per cent from the 1990 levels by 2012.In spite of these commitments, only a couple of the 10 countries contributing the highest to global warming - China, United States, India, Russia, Japan, Brazil, Germany, Indonesia, Canada, and Mexico - are making any serious efforts at minimising their dependence on fossil fuels. These 10 biggest culprits are responsible for 65.53 per cent of total greenhouse emissions. Nigeria is scarcely recognised on the global emission map.In 1976, late mercurial musician, Fela Anikulapo Kuti released the album, ""Mr. Follow-Follow"" wherein he advised, ""If you dey follow-follow, make you open eye, open ear, open mouth, open sense; Na dat time, na dat time you no go fall; If you dey follow-follow dem book, na inside cupboard you go quench"". So, why would Nigeria be pledging to banish the use of fossil fuels to generate energy within such a relatively short period when fossil fuels are its comparative advantage, and it must develop its heavy industries to get its young population employed?A look at the 10 highest performing countries in the fight against global warming revealed that all of them are already providing electricity to 100 percent of their population. The countries are Denmark, Belgium, Portugal, Malta, Luxembourg, Morocco, Cyprus, UK, Sweden, and France.Nigeria currently generates zero energy from its 379 million tons (MMst) of proven coal reserves as of 2016, ranking 44th in the world. Nigeria has proven reserves equivalent to 1,961.4 times its annual consumption. This means it has about 1,961 years of Coal reserves left (at current consumption levels and excluding unproven reserves). On the contrary, India, backed by China, made a last-minute diplomatic push at the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow to water down the language of the final agreement from calling for a ""phase out"" of unabated coal power to a ""phasedown"". Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promoted coal mine expansion, with plans to ramp up domestic coal production from 783 million tonnes in 2019 to one billion tonnes per year as part of his self-reliant India policy.Nigeria's power generation relies mostly on thermal and hydro with an installed capacity of about 12,522 MW. Meanwhile, only 6,000MW of this is available! So, rather than be politically correct, Nigeria should team up with other developing countries across Africa and Asia to push for concession in the transition from fossils to renewable since the entire continent of Africa contributes less than three percent of total emissions. Just like Prime Minister Mordi of India, Nigeria should lobby for gradual phasedown or outright concession so as to develop coal turbines in addition to gas.As of today, the Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC) Limited, the largest power generating company in Nigeria, is facing serious gas supply constraints. Its power generation has considerably been limited by gas constraints, a development that has also driven down electricity supply to households and businesses.\l"

Let us take a quick peep into the future: By the 2030s, there'll be a significant reduction in rainforest until it can no longer produce enough moisture. Species will be lost and increase in the speed of global warming. 2040s greenhouse gas will be many times more potent than carbon dioxide, thus, accelerating the rate of climate change dramatically. 2050s - As the ocean becomes more acidic due to heat, coral reefs die around the world. Fish populations crash significantly. 2080s - Global food production enters a crisis as soils become exhausted by overuse. Pollinating insects disappear. The weather becomes unpredictable. 2100s - Our planet becomes four degrees Celsius warmer. Large parts of the earth are uninhabitable. Millions of people will be rendered homeless. There will be mass extinction everywhere. And our Garden of Eden will be lost,' she said.'Big thanks to Sir David Attenborough for inspiring us at Solution17 for Climate Action. His Documentary - 'A Life on Our Planet,' inspired our climate artists to produce 17 Masterpieces! Back at home, we are mobilising everyone across Nigeria to act for Climate Change through Education, creativity, innovation, entrepreneurship, and technology. ART will help us reach our goals pretty quickly.'Llewellyn-Jones stated that climate change is a common concern for countries, which is a threat. 'We are at a critical moment for the future of our planet. Temperatures are rising, storms are raging and crops are failing across the world. Considering the impact of climate change and COVID-19, building back a fairer, greener and more resilient recovery and safer economy should be a big priority of all governments across the globe, including the United Kingdom and Nigeria,' he said.According to him, addressing challenges relating to climate change is at the heart of the UK government's agenda.'We recognise the role that we, as a world leader in fighting climate change, have, to use our voice and our influence, to champion climate action. The 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties or COP26 which the UK is hosting in Glasgow is an invitation for all of us to rethink our way of life. And we will use our platform at COP26 to focus this ambition.'To keep the possibility of limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C alive, we need to act fast. We have to put the world on track to halve emissions by 2030 and reach net zero carbon emissions by the middle of the century.'Oniru of Iru Kingdom, Oba Abdulwasiu Omogbolahan Lawal, Abisogun II, expressed his confidence in the project, stressing that, 'Our actions and inactions are very germane. I know what Lagos State Government is doing in making Lagos to be climate change resilient,' he said.Renowned artist, Nike Davies-Okundaye, who also mentored the four artists, commended the artists for their efforts.One of the artists, Anjolaoluwa Olarenwaju, who explored renewable energy in her work, described the exhibition as a unique opportunity.'The CYCDI organised some art competitions in the past and that was how I got developed since I was eight or nine. As I was growing, I was always part of the art competition and I participated each year and the years when I was above the age, I was called in as a mentor to other younger ones.'For Oluchi Nwaokorie, who is a CEO for a waste management organisation, collecting waste and converting it to art is serious business.'Our last clean-up was in Iwaya. We have converted plastic waste to 3D filament. Everyone can make a difference,' she said.Other exhibiting artists are Victory Ashaka and Tobi Titiloye, who explored mixed media paintings. Titiloye's 'I can't Breathe' underscored the need for cleaner earth.\l"

Twenty-five countries and public finance institutions have committed to ending international public support for the unabated fossil fuel energy sector by the end of 2022. Major global banks have also said they would no longer fund coal projects.These decisions were taken at the Climate Change of Parties taking place at Glasgow, in the United Kingdom. This is significant, the UN said because it could shift an estimated $17.8bn a year in public support out of fossil fuels and into the clean energy transition.However, for this to happen, some rich nations committed to helping countries that rely on coal for power generation.Some experts say Nigeria holds over 2.8 billion tonnes of coal but proven reserves were put at 379m tonnes by the Ministry of Solid Minerals, making it the world's 44th largest proven reserves. Large swaths of coal deposits can be found in Nasarawa, Enugu, Gombe, Kogi s and in 15 other states, much of which may never be tapped.Upon his appointment as minister of solid minerals, Kayode Fayemi in 2016 said within the next four years, Nigeria would be generating over 1,000MW of electricity from coal. That dream never materialised.Prior to the indigenisation policy of 1972, Nigeria was a key producer of coal and it was used in electricity generation. The policy which sort to increase local participation excluded key foreigners with the superior technology and resources to develop the commodity.Nigeria's obsession with oil further put paid to any ambition to develop coal. With the developments from COP 26, Nigeria's vast coal resources may not only be untapped, but the country will also get nothing from abandoning it.Read also:COP 26: UNECA establishes $30bn facility for AfricaTo persuade coal-dependent countries to join the plan to phase out the commodity, rich nations led by the United Kingdom promised a raft of financial support.South Africa which depends on coal for 85 percent of its power generation received a ground-breaking $8.5bn support to transition to clean energy on Tuesday. This has buoyed other countries depending on coal to ramp up their commitments.""Securing a 190-strong coalition to phase out coal power and end support for new coal power plants and the Just Transition Declaration signed today, show a real international commitment to not leave any nation behind,"" said Alok Sharma, COP 26 President.""Together we can accelerate access to electricity for more than three-quarters of a billion people who currently lack access, consigning energy poverty to history as we create the clean power future needed to keep 1.5 alive,"" he said.In 2019, 37 percent of the total energy produced in the world came from burning coal, but as of today, a new pledge has been signed by over 40 countries at COP 26 to move away from coal as an energy source to more renewable energy sources.Signatories to the pledge include Indonesia, Vietnam, Poland, South Korea, Egypt, Spain, Nepal, Singapore, Chile and Ukraine, and South Africa.As part of the pledge, all signing nations are now committed to ending all investment in new coal power both at home and abroad, with additional promises to phase out coal in developed countries by 2030 and developing countries by 2040.""The world is moving in the right direction, standing ready to seal coal's fate and embrace environmental and economic benefits of building a future that is powered by clean energy,"" said Kwasi Kwarteng, secretary f state for business, energy, and industrial strategy of the United Kingdom. just transition to clean energy and the rapid phase-out of coal has been at the heart of the COP26In a new 'Global Coal to Clean Power Transition Statement', countries also committed to scaling up clean power and ensuring a just transition away from coal.Banks and financial institutions also made landmark commitments at today to end the funding of unabated coal, including major international lenders like HSBC, Fidelity International, and Ethos.t the ongoing COP 26, China, Japan, and South Korea have announced that they would end overseas coal financing which now means all significant public international financing for coal power has effectively ended.In addition, a group of 25 countries including COP26 partners Italy, Canada, the United States, and Denmark together with public finance institutions have signed a UK-led joint statement committing to ending international public support for the unabated fossil fuel energy sector by the end of 2022 and instead prioritising support for the clean energy transition.Developing countries including Ethiopia, Fiji, and the Marshall Islands offered their support, signalling growing unity. This is an inclusive agenda that must recognise the development and energy needs of all economies. COP26 has set a new gold standard on the Paris Alignment of international public finance and sends a clear signal for private investors to follow.On Thursday, 28 new members also signed up to the world's largest alliance on phasing out coal. The Powering Past Coal Alliance was launched and co-chaired by the UK and Canada. New members include Chile and Singapore, joining more than 160 countries, sub-nationals, and businesses.Twenty 20 new countries, including Vietnam, Morocco, and Poland committed to building no new coal plants, matching similar announcements over the past year by Pakistan, Malaysia, and the Philippines, and building on the No New Coal Power Compact launched in September by Sri Lanka, Chile, Montenegro, and European partners.There has been a 76 percent drop in the number of new coal plants planned globally over the last six years since the Paris Agreement was adopted, said the UN. This equates to the cancellation of more than 1000GW of new coal plants.In separate announcements, major emerging economies today took significant steps to move from coal to clean power. India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and South Africa announced partnerships with the Climate Investment Funds to accelerate their transitions away from coal power, backed by a dedicated $2bn facility.Indonesia and the Philippines announced pioneering partnerships with the Asian Development Bank to support the early retirement of coal plants.\l"

He also recommended that credible businessmen in the continent could also be motivated to pick interest in the industry, adding that ""there must be a means of aggregating the various funds so that big-ticket funding transactions can be carried out.""In his comments, the Secretary-General, African Petroleum Producers' Organization, (APPO), Dr. Omar Farouk Ibrahim pointed out that a major study commissioned by APPO on the Future of the Oil and Gas Industry in Africa in the Light of the Energy Transition revealed that the oil and gas industry in Africa would need a new development model to survive the energy transition.The new model would emphasize greater cooperation and collaboration among African oil and gas producing countries. He stated that: ""the model shall also seek to emphasize a continental-wide approach to addressing the funding challenge, the capacity development challenge, the lack of cross-border and regional energy infrastructure challenge, the technology deficit challenge and the underdeveloped energy market challenge, using the African Continental Free Trade Agreement as an enabling vehicle.""On sources of finance for energy projects in Africa in the absence of the traditional financiers, the APPO scribe recommended that various oil-producing countries should enact laws that provide for a portion of windfalls from oil and gas sales to be re-invested in the industry.According to him, ""we need to find ways of getting African oil and gas producing countries' governments to commit a certain percentage of the windfalls to a special fund for the sustenance of the oil and gas industry during the transition period. A guaranteed source of revenue is the only guarantee for the success of the new order we want to see in Africa.""Ibrahim added that revenue shall not come from the private sector alone because the issue is a matter of national security. He insisted that ""none of the financial institutions operating in Africa today can afford to provide all the funds required for the oil and gas industry in Africa to operate and grow, and at the same time meet its original mandate.""Acknowledging the impact of the global energy transition on investment philosophies of international operating companies and financial institutions, the President of Afreximbank, Dr. Benedict Oramah, stated that African countries still rely on fossil fuels for growth and sustainable development, hence there is a need to continue financing oil and gas development in the continent to avoid destabilizing their economies.Oramah who was represented by the Director and Head Advisory and Capital Markets, Mr. Ibrahim Sagna assured of the bank's commitment to the African oil and gas sector, pointing out that it had extended loans to players in the industry to the tune of $5bn by the third quarter of 2021.He said the bank would continue to finance economically viable oil and gas transactions and would work with stakeholders to explore the feasibility of the Africa Local Content Development Fund.

This transition is particularly exciting as it brings together UK government support with the institutional capital, which is essential to grow the sector at scale,"" the minister added.Nigeria's Minister of State for Power, Jeddy Agba, who received the money on behalf of his country, thanked the UK government for its active support towards Nigeria's effort in achieving its carbon neutrality target in 2060.Mr. Agba disclosed that Nigeria is currently implementing its clean energy transition scheme with a number of projects in Lagos,Borno and Kano states and has gone ahead to develop investor-grade data for project development and a $550 million facility from the World Bank and the African Development Bank, thus emerging with the largest clean energy access programme across the continent of Africa.Agba said that while efforts had been made towards unlocking private sector activity in the clean energy transition, lack of access to local currency has continued to pose a major challenge to such investors and called for more international support to overcome the challenge.""It is important for international partners to start contemplating on how best they can collaborate with these institutions to define blended finance models that combine local institution capital with foreign currency dominated support to unlock local currency financing of off grid development in a large scale,"" Agba said.Between 2014 and 2022, UK has provided more than \£380 million into the renewable energy sector in Nigeria, including grants, technical assistance and leading support through advisory programmes such as UK Nigeria Infrastructure Advisory Facility.It also provided over $50 million for the establishment of InfraCredit in 2016, which provides local currency guarantees for renewable energy projects in Nigeria.Also on Monday, the UK Minister for Africa, Vicky Ford, signed a memorandum of understanding with Nigeria's Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, for the return of the sum of \£3210,610 (about N118.4 million) being compensation payment to Nigeria following a successful investigation by the UK's Serious Fraud Office relating to the use of corrupt agents in Nigeria's oil and gas sector.The MoU effectively serves as a commitment of the two nations to continue the fight against corruption and bribery.Ford said: ""The Security and Defence Dialogue held in February 2022 between our two countries reaffirmed both UK and Nigeria's commitment to work together to tackle illicit financial flows, bribery and corruption. The UK has zero tolerance policy to corruption and we hope that today's signing sends a clear statement about our commitment to this.""The Acting Solicitor-General of Nigeria and Acting Permanent Secretary in the Federal Ministry of Justice, Mr. Benjamin Okolo, who represented AGF Abubakar Malami, said Nigeria was delighted to receive the compensation and pledged that the cash would be strictly applied to the three identified projects-Second Niger Bridge, Lagos-Ibadan Expressway and the Abuja-Kano Highway.It will be recalled that the compensation payment to Nigeria was secure after a four-year corruption investigation led by the UK's Serious Fraud Office, SFO.The money was obtained througha deferred Prosecution Agreement, DPA, which applies when a prosecutor agrees to defer prosecution in exchange for the defendant agreeing to fulfil certain requirements such as accepting criminal liability for offences and paying the appropriate compensation.

The region is widely known for its richness in biodiversity and abundance of crude oil and natural gas resources.This large wetland ecosystem supports a wide variety of life, including the mangroves and diverse species of flora and fauna. The inhabitants of the Niger Delta community depend on the aquatic resources for their livelihood and food. Today, this ecosystem is seriously deteriorating from the impacts of crude oil and natural gas pollution, rising human populations, uncontrolled deforestation, unsustainable development, and weak governance.The government is completely aware of the present menace of oil spill pollution and gas flaring in the area and has done little to address the issue. The need for environmental action both at the local and governmental levels is paramount because the Niger Delta is home to 30 million people who depend on it. Rather than appropriately managing the area, the government has exploited it for foreign exchange, national budget revenue, and power.To remedy the negative consequences of exploitation, potential solutions must be sourced out and implemented, such as the practice of sustainable development, ocean conservation, ecological restoration, renewable energy consumption, and the establishment of environmental agencies.In the search for potential solutions, everyone has a role to play, including the federal government, the elected representatives from this region, their rural leaders, ordinary citizens, and, especially, the Youth. The government has a big role to play in protecting the lives of future generations and this involves responsible planning and environmental conservation through the establishment and enforcement of agencies; agencies that will monitor pollution level in the wetland communities.In addition, the elected representatives and stakeholders from this region need to ensure that laws are enforced to help preserve the marine environment. These laws include areas, like sustainable oil and gas explorations and poverty alleviation.Furthermore, the rural leaders should help inculcate sustainable lifestyles into the community to build local awareness, action, and support. Activities, like the collection of water-bound plastics, is a great way to involve the community in a valuable environmental effort that will have an immediate and direct impact on the region.Other possible community efforts include: demanding plastic-free alternatives, reducing carbon footprint, avoiding ocean-harming products, eating sustainable seafood, voting on ocean issues, and contacting lawmakers on sustainable policies.In a bid for Climate and Environmental Justice, Sustainable Development must be practiced by everyone on the globe to keep the present and future generations safe, and also to keep our ecosystem balanced. The United Nations has tagged 2021-2030 the decade of 'Ocean Science and Sustainable Development,' and the #COP26 also focused on greenhouse gas emissions cuts. Therefore, there is a need to join hands to actualize these goals.This is a call for a global movement.\l"

While the report indicates signs of recovery, it also signals the need for African governments to step up their efforts to ensure the health and longevity of our industry - and the need for even more immediate and decisive action in the post-pandemic environment.If our oil and gas industry is to deliver the benefits of a just energy transition to the African people, our governments must move quickly.The AEC report brings new urgency to the issues that have plagued our industry for decades. I've written at length about the need to reform our fiscal policies and regulatory structures.This includes better deal-making, retooling ineffective regulations, and putting an end to corruption, human rights abuses, and resource nationalism. And in the post-pandemic environment, it's even more critical that we adjust our deal structuring to account for the higher perceived risk of doing business in Africa.Signs of RecoveryThere's still time for African governments to take the lead and reshape our future. The 2022 Outlook highlights some positive indicators for the period ahead. But the window of opportunity is small, and we must take advantage of every upward trend.2021 saw crude prices begin to recover and stabilize well above the historic lows of 2020. Several major projects have been sanctioned, including the Eni-operated Cuica field in Angola, the Total Energies-operated Tilenga project onshore Uganda, the Chevron-operated Sanha lean gas development, and the CNOOC-operated Kingfisher South project.That activity helped maintain African capital expenditures at an estimated USD33 billion, slightly above the year-end 2020 estimates.Rig demand, another growth indicator, is expected to rebound significantly beginning in 2022 as higher oil price expectation helps to revive exploration activity and drilling programs for projects currently in development get underway. Based on the oil price outlook presented in the report, the combined potential of these new projects and further exploration activity will help propel demand back toward pre-pandemic levels.Gas-to-power remains a huge - and still growing - area of opportunity. Gas supply and demand are forecast to recover after the sharp 2020 decl"

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria234","The changing priorities and fatigue of the international community","Business Day"," ","Gordon Brown, once the UK prime minister, made an appeal earlier this month for rich countries and institutions not to forget the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the rest of the world.Speaking ahead of the recent meeting of G20 finance ministers in Indonesia, Brown was warning against donor fatigue and pleading for the inclusion of the pandemic in the meeting's main agenda rather than its relegation to a place in AOB (any other business).Brown has been praised for his role in the redesigning of the international financial architecture in the wake of the global financial crisis. He also deserves credit for his grasp of detail, which is evident in this appeal and which provides a welcome change from the generalities and buzzwords favoured by many politicians.He noted that the ACT-Accelerator, the global umbrella group of nine international agencies mandated to provide a full medical response to the pandemic for poorer countries, was USD16bn short in its appeal for funding.The international community has good intentions although its efforts have been constrained by the emergence of new crises, notably climate change and now UkraineBrown quoted an estimate that citizens of rich countries need contribute only US10 cents per week to raise the required funds. At the back of his mind was his experience that donors (indeed most human beings) focus on the most recent crisis. The same can be said of the media.The rich world started to take the pandemic seriously in Q1 2020 but has since seen climate change take its place at the top of the agenda as a result of COP26 in Glasgow in November. The needle moved again last week with the Russian invasion of Ukraine.It is not that Western decision takers are heartless and do not care about the ravages of Covid-19 in low-income countries. The unprecedented rapid response of the IMF in April 2020 tells us otherwise. The data monitor of Johns Hopkins University in the US provides a clue, however.Almost 100,000 South Africans have died from the pandemic according to the monitor. In three North African countries the death toll has ranged between 15,000 and 30,000 but elsewhere on the continent the number of casualties has been well below 10,000. These low figures can encourage the view that we must ""learn to live"" with the virus.The sixth AU-EU summit in Brussels earlier this month again showed that the international community has its heart in the right place as well as flagging up an obstacle or two. The agreed EUR150bn investment package has an important health component.However, the EU was unwilling to grant a temporary waiver of intellectual property rights, without which it would be difficult to manufacture vaccines on the continent. On the fringes of the summit the WHO, one of three drivers of the Covax initiative to create global equitable access to vaccines, named six African countries (including Nigeria) as the likely first beneficiaries of the technology transfer to produce mRNa vaccines.The EU may yet relent on this point, which would be a transformative step. Incidentally the summit was told that 11.3 per cent of Africans had been fully vaccinated against Covid, which compares very poorly with other continents but is still higher than other figures we have seen.To flag up a second obstacle, the declaration emerging from the summit hoped that rich countries would reallocate up to USD100bn in SDRs granted them by the IMF in August 2021 to the poorest states, most of which are African. The total allocation was USD650bn, of which about USD275bn went to emerging and developing countries (and just USD21bn to low-income countries).Read also:WHO sets up hub to train Nigeria, others on vaccine productionWe would welcome such voluntary transfers but caution that the most indebted states and those most in need of reallocations in their favour tend to score poorly on governance. We will not name names but rich countries are bound by domestic policy constraints (and are answerable to their taxpayers).To take the bigger global picture, there appears to be a two-speed recovery from the pandemic.In contrast, African countries have seen far fewer deaths from Covid but have also suffered from fewer resources (and vaccines) to fight it. In December 2020 the Central Bank of Egypt released a clear note about the measures it had taken to combat the pandemic: they are numerous but dwarfed by those of industrialized countries.The international community has good intentions although its efforts have been constrained by the emergence of new crises, notably climate change and now Ukraine.It has finite resources as well as its own interests to uphold (such as intellectual property rights in the EU's case) and legitimate concerns over governance. Reluctantly, we should temper our expectations of the community's response.Kronsten is a consultant on Africa economics and finance\l"

According to a statement issued by the government, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo made the call at the High-Level United Nations event on the Energy Transition plan in Africa with a special focus on Nigeria.He said the scaling up in the Nigerian context was based on clean energy, a reflection of the Federal Government's commitment to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, with energy consumption in developing countries doubling in the last 15 years, and expected to grow another 30 per cent in the next fifteen years.Osinbajo stated, ""It means building sustainability into our economic planning, and so our Economic Sustainability Plan, includes a plan to provide five million homes with cleaner energy through its decentralised solar power programme. This means an estimated 25 million Nigerians would have access to solar power.""The first phase of this plan is already underway, and we think that this sort of programme will very quickly ramp up our progress towards net-zero emissions.""This is why the international community should understand that the plan to defund gas projects in the run-up to the global net-zero emissions target would be unhelpful to developing countries like Nigeria.""The Vice President added, ""The energy access element of the transition must be linked with the emission reduction aspect of the transition. For too long, we have considered these to be parallel tracks. However, pathways to reaching net-zero by 2050 have to include first ending energy poverty by 2030.""If energy access issues are left unaddressed, we will continue to see growing energy demand being addressed with high polluting and deforesting fuels such as diesel, kerosene and firewood.""He said, ""Nigeria has already made a commitment to have 30 per cent of our electricity supply from renewables by 2030.

I maintain my disappointment with the global elites for failing to invite the oil and gas industry. Oh well, they invited me. HYPERLINK http://bit.ly/3bIjd4shttp://bit.ly/3bIjd4sAs I said at that time ""we live in reality. And today, in real-world Africa, this goal is not feasible. Nor is it advisable""The threat of climate change is real, and the goal of lessening it is noble, but what is often forgotten in these discussions are the repercussions of a rapid shift from fossil fuels, particularly in developing nations like those in Africa. Countries that have enjoyed over a century of energy development and near-universal electrification did so first by exploiting their own natural resources to the fullest extent possible  a right not everyone has been able to exercise equally. While the developed world can afford to take risks and think about sloughing off old industries, large parts of Africa are still struggling to provide their people with reliable electricity. As a result, industrialization and economic stability have remained out of reach for large swaths of the continent. Education, already a challenge in impoverished communities, is even harder. So is the provision of health care.These are some of the reasons the African Energy Chamber has become an outspoken advocate for continued natural gas production: Gas-to-power initiatives  the development and expansion of gas-powered electricity plants  are not new to Africa, but they are building momentum. They are a practical way to address energy poverty and they make sense for Africa. This is not the time to pressure African countries to abandon them.Living in the DarkIt is not an exaggeration to say energy poverty is one of our continent's most pressing problems: Only 56% of Africa's population has access to electricity today, and in many places that power is still inadequate and unreliable at best. We address this topic in our recently released report, The State of African Energy 2022.""Comprehensive energy access across the continent remains a central target, with some 600 million people without access to electricity today,"" says the report. ""Moreover, households themselves, facing low and inadequate supply of electricity, often rely on highly polluting traditional energy sources such as hard biomass, which constitutes 45% of total primary energy demand in Africa.""As Africa's population grows rapidly, the continent cannot sustain the mass burning of its plant life in hearth fires indefinitely, nor can the rest of the world afford to let it. Replicating the bad old days of black coal smoke pouring from tall towers isn't an option either. Africa needs modern power sources to compete on the world stage and to do its part to fight global climate change. On the surface, renewables sound like the ideal solution  sunshine and wind are certainly plentiful, after all. It would be wonderful to kip a century and turn all of Africa into Black Panther's Wakanda with the newest green technologies\- but this isn't a movie, and real life is never that simple.The Downside of Wind and SolarMany existing power grids in Africa remain underdeveloped, such that an intermittent supply of energy can threaten the stability of an entire grid. Such is the case in Kenya, which is widely considered to be at the forefront of Africa's energy transition, building momentum in the renewable sector with the 310 MW Lake Turkana wind farm and 50 MW Garissa solar PV station. Some 15% of Kenya's installed capacity comes from solar and wind, but as our 2022 Outlook reports, they have experienced severe voltage instability. Better system management, upgraded infrastructure, and long-term power storage technology are needed to solve these problems, but implementing these things on a nationwide or continent-wide scale won't happen overnight.Another problem plaguing renewables development is near-complete reliance on overseas manufacturing and expertise. The majority of solar cells and windmills are made in China, like so much else, with most of the rest made in Europe and the USA. Those same countries also provide the primary supply of knowledge, training, and technology for installing, maintaining, and repairing renewable facilities. Economically, this means fewer home-grown jobs for Africans in this sector until such capacity can be developed. It also ensures security of supply in case war or politics cripples the ability to import key materials and workers.Energy demand across Africa is expected to triple within the next 20 years\- faster than anywhere else in the world  as a result of population growth, rising incomes, and rapid urbanization. To meet such rapidly accelerating demand, Africa needs the ability to make use of its existing natural resources and human capital, and to employ tried-and-true solutions that will reliably keep the lights on when the wind won't blow and the sun won't shine. Mitigating climate change must remain part of the equation, but the perfect cannot be allowed to be the enemy of the good when so many people are still starting from zero.Why Gas-to-Power Makes Sense in AfricaWhen it comes to reliability, fossil fuels remain the standard by which all other energy sources are judged, and natural gas is the cleanest among them by far. All of sub-Saharan Africa could triple its electricity use overnight using only natural gas and still account for only a 1% increase in global emissions, so low is its starting point.Gas power also pairs better with wind and solar than other clean power sources. Unlike coal, hydro, nuclear, or geothermal generators, gas turbines can power up and down quickly, making them ideal as backup for wind and solar when the weather isn't cooperating and increasing the reliability of the power supply. Gas turbines require less up-front capital investment than most other generating equipment, and they have the advantage of being modular as well for quicker deployment. Until wind and solar become more reliable, gas has the potential to keep coal out of the fuel supply and displace older, dirtier equipment running on diesel or fuel oil, while ensuring that a growing society's basic needs are met.Africa already is seeing the benefits of its growing liquified natural gas (LNG) sector. As the 2022 Outlook reports, LNG-to-power has the potential to help build a resilient, low-emission power infrastructure across the continent.The report cites promising developments in Ghana:And this is only one example: From new gas-to-power projects in Tanzania to the construction of gas pipel"

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria245","Climate action under the Buhari administration, By Sharon O. Ikeazor","April 11, 2022 Monday","Premium Times","Nigeria, April 11 -- Climate change has been rated continuously as being amongst the top global issues of our time. This is because the ways that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are altering the climate are strongly linked with other major global challenges, such as conflicts and unsafe migration. The rising temperatures from GHG emissions have several impacts on the environment, which include accelerated sea level rise and increased frequency and severity of droughts, floods, and other destructive events, such as the recent Australian bushfires. Thus, if nothing is done to mitigate and build resilience to climate change, increasing average surface temperatures and other impacts of climate change will continue to threaten our lives and livelihoods.Already, the last seven years have been the warmest on record, according to scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Similarly, six leading international datasets consolidated by the World Meteorological Organisation show that 2021 was the seventh consecutive year in which the global average surface temperature was more than 1 degree centigrade above pre-industrial levels. This unambiguous and alarming trend underscores the need for urgent climate action to safeguard the future of the most vulnerable regions of our planet. According to the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released recently, West Africa is one of the global hotspots of high human vulnerability to climatic hazards. Nigeria is particularly vulnerable due to high dependence on climate-sensitive livelihoods, such as pastoralism, farming, and fishing.In November 2021 at the COP26 in Glasgow, President Muhammadu Buhari made a commitment for Nigeria to achieve net zero emissions by 2060. Net zero simply refers to the balance between the amount of GHG produced and that removed from the atmosphere. Accordingly, we reach net zero when the amount of GHG added to the atmosphere is no more than that which is taken out. This is critical because scientific evidence suggests that achieving net zero will likely stop global warming. Although Nigeria's net zero commitment is 10 years later than the United Nations' set target of 2050, we are not the only country that has delayed the target. For example, China, which emits more GHG than the entire developed countries combined; and India, which is the third largest emitter (after China and the United States), have committed to achieving net zero by 2060 and 2070, respectively.While many countries of the world have pledged to the United Nation's 2060 net zero target, only Bhutan and Suriname have achieved carbon neutrality and are carbon negative (meaning that they remove more carbon than they emit). In Nigeria, our net zero pledge must include actions to curb all the GHG we produce. These should include direct emissions from owned or controlled sources; indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, and other activities such as heating and cooling; and all other indirect emissions that occur in the value chain of businesses.President Buhari signed the Nigerian Climate Change Bill on November 18, 2021, less than a week after the conclusion of the Glasgow Climate Pact. The Climate Change Act is a legal framework for achieving low GHG emissions, while ensuring green and sustainable economic growth. By the provision of the Act, Nigeria would form programmes to achieve its long-term goals on climate action, consistent with national development priorities. The Act also provides for the creation of a National Council on Climate Change, with the responsibility of decisions and policymaking on all climate change matters in Nigeria.Other tasks of the Council include mobilising finance to support climate change action, the implementation of a mechanism for carbon emissions trading, and meeting Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) by working together with the Nigerian Sovereign Green Bond. An NDC is a climate action plan aimed at cutting emissions and adapting to climate impacts. Each party to the Paris Agreement is expected to establish an NDC and update it every five years. Nigeria has updated its NDC, with 20 per cent emissions reduction unconditionally, and 47 per cent emissions reduction conditionally by 2030.In addition to the Climate Change Act, the Buhari administration also approved Nigeria's Energy Transition Plan (ETP) as a pathway toward achieving the net zero target. Thus far, Nigeria is the only African country with an ETP. The overall aim of the ETP is to lift over 100 million people out of poverty by driving economic growth, connecting the population to modern energy services, and managing the potential job loss in the hydrocarbon sector due to global decarbonisation. Very broadly, the ETP focuses on reducing emissions across sectors such as construction, manufacturing, oil and gas, transport, and power, as well as from cooking.The initiatives to be put in place in relation to these sectors would be to ensure emissions reduction through the implementation of carbon capture and storage (CCS), direct air capture and hydrogen fuel technologies in the oil and gas, construction, and manufacturing sectors; deployment of electric vehicles and renewables in the transport and power sectors; and a shift to electricity and biogas-based cooking. Nigeria's progress with the Climate Change Act and the ETP provides an opportunity for us to lead other African countries in climate policy, just as the United Kingdom leads the world by legally mandating GHG emissions reduction through the UK Climate Change Act of 2008.It is generally agreed by scientists that CCS is a key strategy for decarbonising the industrial sectors. It is estimated that globally, CCS can contribute almost 20 per cent reduction in emissions by 2050, and its exclusion can cause up to 70 per cent increase in the global cost of reaching emissions reduction targets. Despite the CCS being a technically proven technology, some uncertainties and challenges remain, which may hinder fast and effective technology deployment. To this extent, early this year, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the World Bank have begun to work with the Nigerian government to develop a domestic market for carbon capture utilisation and storage (CCUS) for industrial emissions.Similarly, with support from the International Energy Agency, the Nigerian government, under the leadership of the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, has developed a National CCUS Work Programme. The IFC/World Bank engagement, termed the Industrial Carbon Dioxide Utilisation and Storage in Nigeria: Diagnostics and Scoping (ICCUS D&S), aims to provide information on the effectiveness of industrial CCUS in Nigeria as a first step towards promoting knowledge sharing and providing recommendations for technology deployment by stakeholders.Also, the CCUS Work Programme is aimed at outlining the requisite tasks and activities for CCUS adoption, from pilot to large-scale integrated projects. These initiatives would fast track Nigeria's ETP and help reach the net zero target. It is worthy of note that the commencement of CCUS projects would make it the second CCS/CCUS project ever conducted on the African continent. The first CCS project was deployed at In Salah, Algeria in 2004. In Salah was a world-pioneering onshore gas field project, which received carbon dioxide from the In Salah oil field, but operations were discontinued in 2011 over fears of storage security.At the resumed fifth session of the United Nations Environment Assembly held earlier this year in Nairobi, the Nigerian government announced the development and implementation of the new National Forest Policy, aimed at promoting sustainable forest management practices. This is to ensure sustainable increase in the economic, social, and environmental benefits for the country's present and future generations. The new Forest Policy is in l"

'For me, this is the way to go and is most desirable for our common good. The fight against climate change is therefore a cause that requires a concerted global approach.'The experience with Covid19 pandemic has shown that the world needs to always come up with global plans and strategies to address global problems so that nations can key into these plans to resolve issues affecting the whole of humanity.The former President also noted that the 'global effect of climate change including flooding, droughts, accelerated desert encroachment, and erosion which are increasing in intensity and frequency, is felt more here in Africa, even though the continent contributes less than 4 percent of greenhouse gases.'According to him: 'The implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement which aims to substantially reduce greenhouse emissions and strengthen the ability of parties to adapt to climate change has not been impressive, especially as the instrument lacks a binding edge.'There is also the perception of lack of will on the part of developed and wealthier countries, who are indeed the heavy emitters, to continue to robustly fund mitigation and adaptation efforts in developing countries, like ours.'This fear is sustained by the fact that the pledge made 12 years ago in Copenhagen by developed nations, to contribute $100 billion annually towards mitigation and adaptation has never fully materialised.'He also challenged the global business community to look beyond the quest for profit and do more to save Planet Earth.'There is a lot that big businesses and multinationals companies in Nigeria and elsewhere can do to check pollution and land degradation going on in the Niger Delta and in many other parts of the country where there are mining sites. We should all join hands to reverse the earth's present dangerous trajectory.''The former President further said: 'As an advocate of democracy and good governance in Africa, I understand that adverse weather conditions, affecting the lives and livelihood of people, could trigger heightened social tensions in our societies, thereby putting democracy and constitutionality in danger. So, the peace of any society is inextricably linked with the stability of the environment.'He noted further that as President, his £dministration's considerable support for the Great Green Wall initiative is a testament of my passion for environmental and climate issues.'\l"
"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria249","COP26: Experts call for review of global tax system to achieve net-zero by 2050","November 11, 2021 Thursday","Premium Times","Nigeria, Nov. 11 -- As the global climate conference (COP 26) draws to a close in Glasgow, the Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation (ICRICT) has released a statement that securing a worldwide commitment to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 will not be possible without putting the entire tax system to work to support the climate transition.In a statement sent to PREMIUM TIMES, on Thursday, the commission said there is a need for an ambitious and comprehensive tax action plan to be designed to curb carbon emissions, but the burden should not be borne by average citizens whilst multinationals and the richest in the society do not pay their fair share.According to the statement, the richest 10 per cent of the global population emits nearly 48 per cent of global emissions, with the top 1 per cent producing 17 per cent of the total, whereas the poorest half of the global population emits 12 per cent of global emissions. The global map of carbon pollution merges perfectly with the map of economic inequality, both within and between countries.Leonce Ndikumana, a professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, said that with only 4 per cent of global emissions coming from Africa, the continent has contributed very little to global warming but is already suffering the most from its consequences.""Beyond Africa, developing countries are the first victims of the climate change consequences. Rich countries must honour their climate debt, financing developing countries to adapt to climate disasters and to make the transition to less-polluting energy sources"".Experts said even though the decision to tax multinationals is a step in the right direction but the global minimum corporate tax of 15 per cent is very insufficient especially as the world needs to pay attention to redistributing the revenue among rich and less rich countries.Thomas Piketty, Professor at the Paris School of Economics and a member of ICRICT, said ""at least a part of the revenues of the most prosperous economic actors on the planet - the multinationals and the billionaires must be shared with the countries of the South, not as aid, but on a rights basis. This is the only way to face the climate challenge"".The commission declared that financing decarbonization in rich countries and helping developing countries to do the same requires funding commitments.""The global tax deal signed in early October by 136 countries could have made an important contribution towards this goal. But by opting for a minimum global corporate tax rate of only 15% and by making rich countries the main beneficiaries of the additional tax resources that will be generated, the world has deprived itself of a valuable source of funding for the ecological transition.""The reform could have delivered more than $250 billion in increased fiscal revenues worldwide with a 21 per cent global minimum tax rate - and these revenues could jump to $500 billion with a 25 per cent rate but will deliver only $150 billion with a 15 per cent tax rate, with the lion's share of this additional revenue expected to be received by a small group of rich countries in the Global North.The commission questions the sincerity of developed economies on the broken promise to mobilise funds for developing countries to adapt to the effect of climate change.Twelve years ago, at a United Nations climate summit in Copenhagen, rich nations promised to channel $100 billion a year to less wealthy nations by 2020, to help them adapt to climate change and mitigate further rises in temperature. That promise was broken.""Even in 2020, this target was out of reach. A more ambitious global tax deal could have provided resources to meet and even double this pledge. But it would have required the richest countries in the world to side not with multinationals and tax havens but with citizens both in the Global North and in the Global South.""For Jose Antonio Ocampo, a professor at Columbia University, while responding to the G20's agreement to set a global minimum tax rate, the deal will do little to help poorer nations.""By setting the rate at a low rate, 15 per cent, the agreement is akin to throwing a glass of water at a house that is on fire. It is crucial to launch a more inclusive round of negotiations to deliver a new global tax deal for the world, so it has the resources to deal with the climate emergency"".A former member of the European Parliament and a member of ICRICT, Eva Joly, said there is still a window of opportunity to avoid the worst, but this window is closing.""We must urgently and radically decarbonize our economies, reduce our energy consumption and massively develop renewable energies. However, implementing revolution has a cost. The money exists, so we must go and find it where it is: in the accounts of multi-millionaires hidden in tax havens, and especially of those of multinationals which, for decades, have not paid their fair share of taxes.""Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Premium Times.

This is just as he assured that in its commitment to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the Federal Government is already making efforts to use large shares of clean energy sources, saying, 'limiting the development of gas projects, poses dire challenges.' He asserted on Friday in London at the High-Level United Nations event meetings on the Energy Transition plan in Africa with a special focus on Nigeria. According to him, this is why the international community should understand that the plan to defund gas projects in the run-up to the global net-zero emissions target would be unhelpful to developing countries like Nigeria. Osinbajo observed that Africa as a continent is home to the world's youngest fastest growing population and in order to create jobs and enable climate-smart industrialization, 'the scale and quality of electricity services must increase significantly.'A statement issued by issued by his spokesman, Laolu Akande, said while continuing, the Vice President noted that the scaling up in the Nigerian context is based on clean energy, a reflection of the FG's commitment to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. He said this 'means building sustainability into our economic planning, and so our Economic Sustainability Plan, includes a plan to provide 5 million homes with cleaner energy through its decentralized solar power programme. This means an estimated 25 million Nigerians would have access to solar power. 'The first phase of this plan is already underway, and we think that this sort of programme will very quickly ramp up our progress towards net-zero emissions.' He explained that the moves to defund gas projects wouldn't help the 'whole enterprise,' which 'requires gas, especially if we are putting it on the grid. We want to be able to put renewable energy on the grid, we need power for industry, and of course, we are looking at the significant cost of that.' According to him, 'limiting the development of gas projects, poses dire challenges for African nations, while making an insignificant dent in global emissions. Energy demand in Nigeria and across Africa is set to rise, as indeed it must, to deliver the industrialization, jobs and economy-wide progress people deserve.' In addition, Osinbajo explained that 'the energy access element of the transition must be linked with the emission reduction aspect of the transition. For too long we have considered these to be parallel tracks. However, pathways to reaching net-zero by 2050 have to include first ending energy poverty by 2030. 'If energy access issues are left unaddressed, we will continue to see growing energy demand being addressed with high polluting and deforesting fuels such as diesel, kerosene and firewood.' On current energy consumption patterns globally, Osinbajo noted that 'energy consumption in developing countries has doubled in the last 15 years, and is expected to grow another 30 per cent in the next fifteen years. So making capital available to fulfil the growing energy demand in these regions of the world is central to reaching the goals of the Paris Agreement.' He highlighted the disparity in global energy investments, noting that 'while representing just 15% of the world's population, high-income countries received 40 per cent of global energy investment in 2018. Conversely, developing countries with 40 per cent of the world's population received just 15 per cent of global energy investments.' The Vice President said 'Nigeria has already made a commitment to have 30 percent of our electricity supply from renewables by 2030. Also natural gas is currently used for industry, fertilizer manufacturing, and cooking - which are more difficult to transition than power generation.' He affirmed that Nigeria is 'resolutely committed to all of our national determined contributions under the Paris Agreement, and we have in fact updated our commitments in our new Energy Transition Plan.

That approach has been consistently demonstrated by one nation through its multilateral actions in kindness and courage. That country is China. China has shown an ability to coordinate diplomatic interaction of more countries than any in international politics in many strategic areas of the world - foreign, security, peace, technology, development, investment, and so on.Therefore, when President Xi Jinping was speaking at the conference marking the 50th anniversary of the Restoration of the Lawful Seat of the People's Republic of China on October 25, 2021, he indeed underscored why the nations should build ""a community with shared future for mankind, and work together to build an open, inclusive and beautiful world that enjoys lasting peace, universal security and common prosperity."" For keen watchers of global events, one would see how multilateralism with Chinese characteristics is giving tangible meaning to the concept and practice of multilateralism. It has made multilateralism a central element of its foreign policy by seeking consensus through consultation and managing common affairs through cooperation for shared benefits and win-win results.The strategies of China's foreign policies to what the UN stands for in the last 50 years have been geared towards dedication to improving the welfare of all humanity and achieving global development through building multilateral cooperation and understanding. Altruism, pragmatism, and consistency that are at the core of multilateralism are essentially the epitome of China and intrinsic parts of its relations with the world. China is committed to its allies and partners and has rendered consistent, enduring and reliable support to the organisation. These qualities are worth examining.First, there is no single country that has more bilateral and multilateral relations than China. As of 2021, there are about 140 countries, including 40 African countries, that have signed up with the Belt and Road Initiative, one of the successes of globalisation that is designed to provide infrastructure development and trade investment around the world. The initiative is quietly building a human community of shared destiny and prosperity. As of today, China is a member of all international intergovernmental organisations and over 500 international conventions.Devoid of imperialist pasts and colonial legacies, China has risen from isolation to become a world power. It has demonstrated adaptive strategies to accommodate, integrate and work within local environments and realities. A nation of one-fourth of the world's population (1.4 billion) has leapt from low productivity to become the second-largest economy in the world by adopting reforms and opening up in pursuance of socialism with Chinese characteristics. This enamoured nations, institutions, groups and individuals seeking to achieve the development goals across different continents and regions with China.Secondly, China has promoted global peace, tolerance and inclusion more than any other country. As a non-belligerent country and as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, it has stayed true to the principles of the UN Charter by standing in solidarity and cooperation with people around the world and upholding international equity and justice, contributing significantly to world peace and harmony. According to Xi, in his UN speech, ""...the Chinese people have upheld the authority and sanctity of the United Nations and practised multilateralism, and China's cooperation with the United Nations has deepened steadily.""Due to its foreign policy of non-interference in the host country, China promotes peace by resolving political conflicts through peaceful means and safeguards sovereignty, security and development interests. China has sent over 50,000 peacekeepers to UN peace operations in Africa and other regions. It is now the largest financial and personnel contributor to the UN and applied the universality of human rights in the Chinese context. In the view of Cuba Ambassador to China, Carlo Miguel Pereira, in the Global Times, while assessing China as a vital player and progressive stance in the UN system, said China has helped to ""democratise the United Nations and promote multilateralism.""Third, China is promoting humanitarian assistance through multilateral actions. In the ongoing global battle against the COVID-19 pandemic, many developed nations are looking inward and initiating vaccine diplomacy. But China, in accordance with the promise and principles of the UN, has been active in sharing its experience with the world and rendered large quantities of medical and material supplies like preventive kits, medicines, doctors and nurses and vaccines. Africa is an esteemed beneficiary of this gesture.By extending its hand of fellowship to Africa, China has promoted cooperation through multilateral platforms like the BRI, BRICS (with South Africa) and Forum of China and China Cooperation. Many people have walked out of poverty, unemployment, diseases and ignorance through assistance unleashed by development infrastructure and trade investments by China. Roads, railways, bridges, dams, hydroelectric and alternative energy plants, airports, ports, free trade zones and others are built to open up development opportunities.China has helped African countries to self-determination. China's presence on the Security Council not only represents unity and balance of power but also safeguards the interests and rights of developing countries. The African Union has its headquarters edifice in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia courtesy of China. The complex serves as an indispensable platform for AU to play its role efficiently and effectively on the continent. For us in Africa, China is considered a source of inspiration. African diplomats and experts have also commended China for its contributions to multilateralism in the last 50 years.Likewise, for all the good deeds of China as a responsible multilateral power, the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, while congratulating China for the past 50 years, also thanked China for upholding multilateralism for supporting the UN's work and playing a major part and making significant contributions to promoting world peace and development. In another way, I used to tell colleagues, China is like a mini UN because it has initiated a wide range of multilateral forums in banking, infrastructural, investment, research and other sectors that embrace diverse countries to achieve peace and development. BRI, BRICS (Brazil, Russia India, China and South Africa), Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and Asian Development Bank are some of the multilateral groups China belongs to. Antonio Guterres has wholeheartedly received XI's proposal for the UN to set up the Global Development Initiative. Actions should be accelerated to actualise this lofty idea in order to address development challenges.The ongoing G20 meeting in Rome and the COP26 IN Glasgow on 1 November offer the big nations the opportunity to show ""more ambition and more action"" as Guterres puts it. This is another test for China and others to demonstrate their commitment to humanity to discuss and find solutions to the existing disorder between nations, and holistically address climate change, and re-launch the global economy battered by the pandemic. Commitment to multilateralism also calls for strengthening unity and coordination, and honouring one's words with concrete actions and completely abandoning the Cold War mentality, bullying and zero-sum game. Partners should be ready to compromise on the basis of mutual respect and a balance of interests.The world should emulate the Chinese model of multilateralism if it's going to overcome the myriads of global challenges and issues. As the world is transiting the pandemic and economic recessions, no country can thrive in isolation but through solidarity and cooperation in pursuit of common goals. Multilateralism will foster a shared future and prosperity for mankind. Multilateral mechanisms should be genuinely engaged for the equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, fight future pandemics and climate change, protect human rights, cybersecurity, biosecurity and biodiversity. In Africa in particular, multilateral and regional cooperation can be broadened and deepened to fight the most critical problems bedevilling the continent - terrorism, hunger, poverty, injustice, inequity and other drivers of crimes and underdevelopment. Africa has a lot to connect more to multilateral platforms that China provides to achieve the AU's 2063 Agenda.The UN and other comities should practice true multilateralism. Improving the global governance system requires true multilateralism. China recognises this aspect of international law of relations and adheres to its practice. Big nations should not manipulate the UN for their own gain or use it as a tool for hegemony and power politics but should stay committed to true multilateralism. Unilateralism is no longer the norm. The present world realities call for altruism, pragmatism and consistency, which the UN stands for.While reiterating the universality of approach in his closing remarks at the UN Conference, Xi called on the world saying ""we should resolutely uphold the authority and standing of the United Nations and work together to practice true multilateralism."" Realising coherent, genuine and long-term development is through deeper connectivity, openness and inclusiveness as exemplified by China in the last 50 years. The world should embrace multilateralism with kindness and courage.Dr Babatunde is a Fellow, Peacebuilding & Evidence Practitioner at Nigeria's Institute for Peace and Conflict Resolution.

The estimated potential benefit, she said, was $9 trillion, which she added was an obvious win-win.Read also: IFC, Fidson partner to bridge gap in Nigeria's pharmaceutical production capacityShe said global efforts to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic had dampened her optimism about the global responses to climate change, urging immediate action but warning that the world cannot rely on innovation alone.""The impact of purely technological solutions is often very disappointing in real life,"" she stressed.ccording to Duflo, globally combating climate change will require changes in behaviour and consumption patterns.She noted that economists underestimate the capacity of humans to change behaviours, and that shifts in consumption would need to be made primarily in industrialised countries.""I don't think we can tell Africans with a straight face that they need to consume less when they, in fact, need to consume more,"" she said.AfDB Acting Chief Economist and Vice President Kevin Urama said the topic could not be timelier, coming right after the COP26 global climate conference in Glasgow last month.Duflo's lecture was followed by a conversation with AfDB President Dr Akinwumi Adesina, who praised her pragmatic economic research and the insights she provided.He said Duflo's remarks underscored the need to change the way we measure wealth creation.""GDP tells us very little about how wealth is produced,"" Adesina said. ""I have been a big advocate of the need to weigh the GDP of countries by the extent of negative externalities they create. ""Adesina engaged in an extensive discussion with Duflo about the importance of accurate carbon pricing as an incentive to developing nations.

In the second week, heads of state are expected to meet to negotiate and reach agreements.For the first time in history, the UNCOP is being held in the UK as Scotland's largest city, Glasgow, serves as host.In his address at the African energy stakeholders' gathering, the Secretary-General of OPEC, Mohammed Sanusi Barkindo, said OPEC's World Oil Outlook projected cumulative oil-related investments of $11.8tn till 2045. This consists of $9.2tn for upstream, $1.5tn for downstream, and $1.1tn for midstream.However, Barkindo stated that under-investment posed challenges that might worsen the global energy crisis.The OPEC scribe also said Africa's oil and gas sector had a bright future with significant opportunities. Citing figures, he said in 2019, Africa produced about 8.5 million barrels per day of oil and currently had proven oil reserves of about 126 billion barrels as of 2019.For the downstream, he stated that Africa's local refining capacity was expected to increase, with a corresponding reduction in imports, and that the continent's long-term demand growth would lead to about 5 million barrels per day of throughput in 2045.The Minister of Mines, Petroleum, and Energy of the Republic of Cote D'Ivoire, Thomas Camara, stressed the need to secure the requisite funding to ensure that the energy transition is successful.

Nigeria is committed to net zero by 2060.''Making a case for gas-based energy transition in Nigeria, President Buhari requested international partners to finance projects using transition fuels such as gas in Nigeria.''Parties to the Paris Agreement are expected to transit from fossil fuel to clean energy and reach a Net Zero ambition for greenhouse gases emission.''Nigeria is actually more of a gas than an oil producing country.''Consequently, I am requesting for financing of projects using transition fuels, such as gas.''Nigeria has energy challenges for which, we believe, gas can be used to balance a renewable energy-based system, be it wind or sun.''This would enable us launch the long-term renewable energy infrastructure procurements and investments needed to have a sustainable energy supply.''Acknowledging that net zero ambition can lead to economic transformation across all sectors, the Nigerian leader said it would require critical infrastructure to be in place.President Buhari also told the COP26 Leaders' Summit that Nigeria has developed a detailed energy transition plan and roadmap based on data and evidence.He explained that the plan has highlighted some key facts that forces the difficult conversations.''Our transition plan also highlights the key role that gas will play in transitioning our economy across sectors, and the data and evidence show that Nigeria can continue to use gas until 2040 without detracting from the goals of the Paris Agreement.''Gas will be key for addressing the clean cooking challenge, which is also a challenge of deforestation, and for giving our electric grid the stability and flexibility to integrate renewables at scale.

The Government Pension Fund Global, the largest fund of its genre in the world, manages about USD1.4trn and holds an average stake of 1.5 percent in every listed company globally. Over 25 years it has grown to the point that in 2019 for the first time it made a larger contribution to government coffers than the taxes and royalties from the Norwegian oil and gas industry.There is an unspoken cap of 3 percent of assets under management (AUM) on the annual transfer to the government. This was breached in 2020, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic when the disbursement of about USD50bn represented about one-quarter of government inflows that year. The spending helped cushion the impact of the pandemic such that GDP contraction of -2.5 percent was among the best outturns in Europe. The disbursement went a long way for a population of less than six million.Nor is its record to be lightly dismissed: Norges Bank Investment Management, the effective manager, has just reported a 14.5 percent return for 2021 (including 20.8 percent on its equity holdings). In our research for this piece, we came across an article from a well-known wire service from early 2016 flagging the possibility that the Public Investment Fund, the Saudi vehicle, would become the largest SWF globally within five years. Ah, the beauty of hindsight and the joy of witnessing the splattering of eggs across faces!While the AUM of the Saudi fund have grown to an estimated USD400bn, we should highlight the challenge for Nigeria and indeed all commodity-exporting emerging markets to diversify their economies.The Norwegian fund, by virtue of its size and relative openness, has become a torchbearer for elements of the industry. The newish chief executive of its manager is eager to boost its environmental, social, and governance reporting. He is following an established trend. The fund had earlier halted all investment in tobacco products, nuclear weapons, and coal. Among its one-off trades, it sold its positions in Walmart on the grounds of the company's labour relations, in the miners Rio Tinto and Vale on the basis of environmental damage, and in two Israeli construction firms that had been active in the West Bank.t the other end of the spectrum, we recall the sorry tale of the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA), which took household names in Western investment banking to court over several trades booked in 2008.

""On the external front, Africa needs a new deal to recover from the ravages of the pandemic. The Roosevelt's New Deal cost $41.7bn at the time it was instituted.""Given Africa's current population of 1.37 billion, a New Deal would have to deliver $7.1 trillion in financing to equate the US New Deal on a per capita basis.""The resources required to financing a New Deal are enormous and cannot be funded exclusively through public resources. Private funding will be critical.""Yet we are all aware of the cost of private financing is high. At the same time private direct capital investments are motivated more by economic rates of return than by social welfare considerations.""Blending public financing with private resources can redirect more private investments and financing to social and other orphaned sectors through risk-sharing and risk mitigation,"" he said.He said that the ECA had partnered to launch the Liquidity and Sustainability Facility (LSF) at the margins of CoP26 with the objective of lowering the cost of portfolio investments in emerging markets and crowding in a new class of investors into the continent.He said that the LSF seeks to use on-lent SDRs to leverage private financing by making it possible for holders of African sovereign bonds to access short term financing using such instruments as collateral.

Administrator Power announced the launch of the Comprehensive Africa Climate Change Initiative (CACCI) alongside Josefa Sacko, African Union Commissioner of the Department of Agriculture, Rural Development, Blue Economy and Sustainable Environment, and other African Union Member States representatives.Many African countries disproportionately bear the brunt of climate change. Adapting and strengthening resilience to climate change is critical. CACCI advances USAID's climate priorities and its commitment to working with countries to address the effects of climate change.Fifty-four countries in Africa have ratified the Paris Agreement, and as next steps will implement the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) that they submitted as part of their commitments to reduce emissions and adapt to climate change.The new partnership with the AUC exemplifies USAID's commitment to strengthening country-level implementation of NDCs and NAPs led by African leaders and institutions. It will build local and regional capacity and institutional infrastructure and develop an Africa-wide accountability platform that not only informs debate at the continental level but also informs global discussion on climate change mitigation and adaptation. This partnership advances the Global Climate Ambition Initiative, announced by the White House at the U.S.-hosted Leaders' Climate Summit, to support partner countries in establishing net-zero strategies and strengthening resilience to climate change.Distributed by APO Group on behalf of U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).\l"

Nigeria is committed to net-zero by 2060.''Making a case for the gas-based energy transition in Nigeria, President Buhari requested international partners to finance projects using transition fuels such as gas in Nigeria.''Parties to the Paris Agreement are expected to transit from fossil fuel to clean energy and reach a Net Zero ambition for greenhouse gases emission.'Nigeria is actually more of a gas than an oil-producing country.'Consequently, I am requesting for the financing of projects using transition fuels, such as gas.'Nigeria has energy challenges for which, we believe, gas can be used to balance a renewable energy-based system, be it wind or sun.'This would enable us to launch the long-term renewable energy infrastructure procurements and investments needed to have a sustainable energy supply.''Acknowledging that net-zero ambition can lead to economic transformation across all sectors, President Buhari said it would require critical infrastructure to be in place.He also told the COP26 Leaders' Summit that Nigeria has developed a detailed energy transition plan and roadmap based on data and evidence.The President explained that the plan has highlighted some key facts that forces the difficult conversations.He further stated: 'Our transition plan also highlights the key role that gas will play in transitioning our economy across sectors, and the data and evidence shows that Nigeria can continue to use gas until 2040 without detracting from the goals of the Paris Agreement.'Gas will be key for addressing the clean cooking challenge, which is also a challenge of deforestation, and for giving our electric grid the stability and flexibility to integrate renewables at scale. Nigeria will need to integrate an unprecedented 7GW additional renewable capacity each year to achieve net-zero.'On energy access, President Buhari declared that Nigeria's commitment to a just transition is reflected in ''our ambitious Energy Compact, which includes the Government's flagship project to electrify 5million households and 25 million people using decentralised solar energy solutions.''He described the project as a major first step towards closing the energy access deficit in the country by 2030.On green projects in the county, the President declared that Federal Government agencies have been directed to ensure the inclusion of projects with Climate Change credentials in the budget.''I am happy to state that the 2022 budget, which I recently submitted to our National Assembly, is the first cross-sectoral, gender and climate-responsive budget ever prepared in the annals of our history.The President announced that the National Assembly has also passed the Climate Change Bill, which provides a framework for achieving low greenhouse gas emissions, inclusive green growth and sustainable economic development.President Buhari cautioned: ''The outcome of this Conference must result in quick resolution of all outstanding issues pertaining to the finalisation of the Paris Agreement Rulebook, Adaptation, Mitigation, Finance, Article 6 and Loss and Damage.''\l"

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria289","Sugar Revolution - the Journey So Far","March 24, 2022","This Day (Lagos)","Dike Onwuamaeze enumerates efforts put in place by the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Mr. Niyi Adebayo, to enable Nigeria to attain self-sufficiency in sugar production by growing the required local capacity to meet the demand for sugar, create large number of jobs for Nigerians and stem the tide of unbridled importation of sugar and its by-products.The Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Mr. Niyi Adebayo, probably had one goal in mind when he switched on the microphone to address a State House press conference on March 17, 2022. The goal was to give Nigeria's account on its quest to attain self-sufficiency in sugar production, which is still a journey in progress, through the implementation of the country's National Sugar Master Plan (NSMP) and the Backward Integration Program (BIP) that it birthed. The plan is a tool in the hand of the federal government to accelerate domestic manufacturing of sugar to meet the country's food requirements and provide raw material inputs for the manufacturing sector?Adebayo said in his introductory remarks that ""I am glad to be here this morning to brief you on our vision for Nigeria's Sugar Industry and the milestones recorded so far on the Presidential Sugar Backward Integration Program (BIP).""As you may be aware, this is a key sector that has received the required attention by this administration in order to fully realise its economic development and growth potentials, which I will speak to greater details shortly.""The StatisticsWords, said a literary critic, could be so slippery especially in the mouth of a politician. But that was none of his intentions. Speaking with candour as a public servant who wanted to be trusted and believed, the minister bared the facts on the current status of the country's bid to attain self-sufficiency in sugar manufacturing by providing the statistics. The statistics showed that the annual demand for sugar in Nigeria in 2021 was estimated at 1.75 million metric tonne (mMT). The annual quota allocation as approved by President Buhari for the sugar BIP operators was also 1.7mMT. However, the country installed refining capacity for sugar is projected at 3.0 mMT.The statistics further revealed that the country still import 1.7million tonnes of raw sugar to feed the refineries at $700 million, which he described as, ""the largest import bill for sugar in Sub-Sahara Africa largely because of the size of the Nigerian economy and its population.""The minister stated that Nigeria needed to develop 250,000ha of cane land to meet the annual target of 1.7mMT/annum. He stated that the land already acquired for the cultivation of cane is 150,000 hectares by the BIP operators, out of which 19,000 hectares have been developed in readiness for actual cultivation. He, however, said that the actual land under cultivation was 10,000 hectares.Adebayo identified ""the cane production phase of the sugar value chain as the most capital intensive due to the cost of infrastructure and land development. The industry therefore requires the right type of investors with adequate capital and cash flows to make and sustain the investment.""He projected that $128.68 million would be required to cultivate 10,000 hectares (ha) of cane plantation, mill and refine it into finished sugar product. The breakdown of this sum showed that $120 million would be needed to cultivate cane in 10,000 hectares of land while milling and refining would cost $7.804 million and $878,000 respectively.Objectives of NSMPHe said that the primary objective of the NSMP is to enable Nigeria to attain self-sufficiency in sugar production by growing the required local capacity to meet the demand for sugar, create large number of jobs for Nigerians and stem the tide of unbridled importation of sugar and its by-products.The master plan was also designed to contribute to local production of ethanol and electricity. Adebayo stated that its core targets included the production of 1,797,000 tonnes of sugar annually; 161.2 million litres of ethanol annually; 411.7 MW of electricity annually; 1.6 million tonnes of animal feed annually; 37,378 permanent jobs; 79,803 seasonal jobs; realizing $350-$500 million savings in foreign exchange on sugar imports annually; and $65.8 million savings in foreign exchange on fuel imports annually.He explained that the Buhari's administration is interested in sugar because the benefits of a thriving sugar industry aligned with the federal government's development priorities.He said: ""Sugar's main importance in an economy stems from the ability of the sector to generate jobs in hundreds of thousands due to the vast expanse of land that needs to be cultivated and the sheer amount of sugar cane that needs to be planted and harvested. This aligns perfectly with our need to create a significantly high number of jobs to address our unemployment challenges.""Creating a strong linkage between agriculture and industry is a sure way of bringing about inclusive and sustainable growth by improving value added, creating wealth for farming communities and enabling the roll-out of infrastructure around farming communities. Sugar provides this opportunity by enabling increased yield and output via out-grower schemes and providing higher paying buyers for sugar cane.""The minister also noted that the significance of sugar to the Nigerian economy could not be over emphasised. For instance, it is a key input in the manufacture of food and beverages and pharmaceutical products. It is also a source of ethanol, a renewable fuel which could be used to contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions and improve air quality. It would also enable the country to fulfill its commitment to reduce carbon emissions at the recently concluded United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)COP26 where President Muhammadu Buhari made a specific commitment that Nigeria will cut its carbon emission to net-zero by 2060.Moreover, the availability and access to the pharmaceutical and beverage companies affect the nation's security; therefore, the growth of Nigeria's sugar sector greatly reduces vulnerability to external shocks and our nation's security as a whole.""Lastly, Bagasse is the pulpy residue that is left over after juice is extracted from sugarcane. It was traditionally used to produce heat and electricity in sugar mills but we are seeing the extension of its use in national grids as a substitute for less efficient energy sources. For us in Nigeria, this is especially important as bagasse can be a source of electricity for the surrounding communities of sugar processing plants,"" minister said.Key Milestones in Nigeria's Sugar Sector:Adebayo spent some time during the press briefing to look back at key milestones in the evolution of Nigeria's sugar sector in order to shed light on the issues that the sector has faced and how government has intervened in the sector over the years.It all began in 1961 when the federal government established the Nigerian Sugar Company, Bacita, with an installed capacity of 40,000MT. In 1974, local consumption of sugar rose to 45,000 tonnes while sugar production from NSC Bacita reached 35,000MT per annum.A major development occurred in 1981 when the government established the Savannah Sugar Company Limited (SSCL), Numan, with an installed capacity of 50,000MT. By this time the domestic consumption of sugar has risen to 450,000 MT per annum.However, the SSCL Numan and NSC Bacita were privatized in 2003 and 2004. The privatisation could not improve their productivity, which actually decl"

However, the projections suggest that the Fossil Fuelled 5 will reduce coal production by only 30percent, and actually increase oil and gas production by 33percent and 27percent, respectively. This level of support to fossil fuel production is more than the entire G7 put towards clean energy as part of the pandemic recovery ($147 billion).The report released on the final day of COP26, led by Freddie Daley from the University of Sussex, synthesises the most recent government emissions pledges and compares them to the fossil fuel production plans in the coming decade, as well as other factors such as fossil fuel subsidies.They show that several of the world's wealthiest nations ""are doubling down on fossil fuel production"" which will ""have disastrous impacts for all life on our planet, but especially those communities in the Global South who have done the least to create this crisis and have the fewest resources to adapt to its impacts.""Read also:Nigeria urged to increase non-oil exports to GermanyDespite their historical responsibility for emissions, and being well-placed to finance a global just transition, these countries are also guilty of exporting large amounts of coal, oil and gas, fuelling other countries' dependency on dirty energy sources.""There's an alarming gap between what wealthy nations are saying and what they are doing. You would expect these five nations to provide the leadership needed to move the global economy away from fossil fuels and reduce emissions to zero. However, they seem to be quite content to make pledges and promises with one hand, while expanding and subsidising fossil fuel production to the tune of billions on the other, said Freddie Daley, Research Associate at the University of Sussex and the Lead author.""Not only are these wealthy nations jeopardising their own futures and the futures of their citizens through this continued expansion, but they are condemning communities in the global south to a state of perpetual crisis which they did nothing to create. If these nations want to be climate pioneers, it is time they addressed the elephant in the room: fossil fuels.""Country-specific analysis from the paper's country profiles includes: The United States has pledged to halve emissions by 2030 yet have simultaneously provided $20 billion in annual support to the fossil fuel industry.Despite hosting COP26, the United Kingdom is expected to green-light the Cambo oil field, which contains approximately 255 million barrels of oil.br Canada is looking to increase their price on carbon but also provided approximately $17 billion in public finance to three fossil fuel pipel"

In signing the law, the president has made Nigeria join an elite group of countries that have enacted emissions-target legislation aiming to eliminate carbon emissions. This is a big deal for an oil-dependent nation that is also ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change in the world.Climate law has grown in leaps and bounds since the Copenhagen Accord in 2009 but so far only a handful of countries has passed national legislations setting CO2 reduction targets. Other countries in this elite group include the United Kingdom, New Zealand, France, Sweden, Ireland, and Scotland, which hosted the just concluded COP26 in Glasgow.The objectives of the new Climate ActThe main objective of the climate law is to provide an overarching legal framework for achieving Nigeria's long-term climate goals, including a net-zero carbon emission target, national climate resilience, an adequate volume of climate finance, and the mainstreaming of climate change actions into national development priorities. The bill places climate change action in the broader context of efforts to achieve inclusive green and sustainable economic development for the most populous black country in the world.Nigeria has long maintained that it wishes to use its climate policies as part of wider measures to achieve low-carbon, resilient, and equitable economic growth. The Act, therefore, seeks to facilitate the intensive and complex cross-ministerial coordination of climate change action, as well as the involvement of businesses and the civil society needed to achieve long-term climate objectives, while also promoting climate-resilient social-economic development in the country.The Act also sets out to establish a systematic approach for the country to identify the major climate risks and vulnerabilities facing the country and how to strengthen existing capacities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.Key aspects of the climate ActSome key aspects of the Nigerian climate law are modeled after those of the U.K. and Ireland, but the new climate Act also has many innovative aspects, specially designed to adapt to the unique Nigerian situation.The law provides that the government shall set five-year carbon budgets in the context of a National Climate Change Action Plan, which should be ratified by the Federal Executive Council. The budgets are supposed to advance efforts to achieve net-zero GHG emission reduction between 2050 and 2070. The five-year budget shall be broken down to the annual carbon budget for each of the years that make up the five-year cycle. President Buhari has, at COP26, already committed Nigeria to a net-zero carbon target by 2060. The first carbon budget is to be submitted for approval not later than 12 months from the date that the bill is signed by the president, which is now no later than November 18, 2022. Subsequent carbon budgets are to be submitted for approval not later than 12 months to the end of the date of the expiration of the current budget cycle.While the Federal Ministry of Environment is tasked with setting the carbon budget, the new law provides for a National Council on Climate Change that will oversee the implementation of the National Climate Change Action Plan. The National Climate Council is a major innovation in the Act intended to suit the largely bureaucratic nature of governance in Nigeria. Headed by the president, who will serve as the Chairman, the Council will supervise the activities and help the Environment Ministry to coordinate the implementation of sectoral targets and guidel"

A failure to do so may result in legal action, said Peer de Rijk, policy officer at Milieudefensie.Fourteen of the 29 groups to receive a letter replied to a Reuters request for comment and all said they were acting to reduce emissions. Shell did not receive a letter but is also part of the campaign, Milieudefensie said, referring to its court victory against the oil giant.""We are very clear that in the end, if needed, we are willing to go to court. But of course we are hoping these companies will be moving by themselves,"" De Rijk told Reuters in an interview.""We are willing to engage in talks, but we are in a hurry as well, so we won't accept talks for the sake of talks themselves,"" he said.

Other commodities such as silicon and copper that are central to a low-carbon transition, for example in battery production for electric cars, as well as garlic and coconut are also often linked to expropriation.Head of Environment and Climate Change Research at Verisk Maplecroft, Will Nichols, tells\\xa0Global Trade Review, ""as demand grows, we are expecting more incidents of this type in the commodities we have flagged \- especially if issues around corruption and around indigenous peoples' rights aren't addressed.""Palm oil is most exposed to land grabs because Indonesia, the biggest producer of the commodity, is known for weak practice in this area. ""The country produces more than half the world's palm oil and land conflicts are on the rise"", reads the report.Meanwhile cobalt, the other material rated as extreme risk, has long been linked to child labour in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which accounts for around 70% of the world's supply of the metal.In 2019, a lawsuit was filed against tech companies including Google and Tesla over the deaths of Congolese children in cobalt mines. The case was recently dismissed over a lack of evidence connecting the companies to the mines.While there is no established link between the firms and the mines, in general it is ""very difficult"" for companies to have visibility beyond tier one suppliers, says Nichols. Cobalt is used in the manufacture of batteries for electric vehicles, which are important in the low-carbon transition.However, mining cobalt or other commodities that will power economies of the future should not leave behind a trail of social disasters, say campaigners. ""The energy solutions of the future must not be built on human rights abuses,"" warned Seema Joshi, then head of business and human rights at Amnesty International, in late 2017.According to the report, there is a ""clear link"" between land grabs and the environment (figure 2), with expropriation fuelled by weak governance and corruption.

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria297","Environment As Electoral Issue [column]","November 03, 2021","This Day (Lagos)","It was fitting that the excellent moderators of the Anambra Governorship Election Debate put environment on the table among other issues for the candidates to address. Parts of Anambra state have been ravaged by gully erosion. Roads have been destroyed by the ecological menace which is responsible for some communities becoming inhabitable and inaccessible. Farmlands are shrinking and houses are collapsing in Anambra as in other states of the southeast, nay Nigeria. The problem is relatively more pronounced in the state than some others.The ARISE NEWS duo of Reuben Abati and Ngozi Alaegbu justifiably allocated some time for the candidates who featured in the debate to enunciate their plans to combat erosion in state. The three candidates - Andy Uba of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Charles Chukwuma Soludo of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) and the Valentine Ozigbo of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) - were in agreement in acknowledging the reality of erosion as an environmental challenge, although they differed in terms of the depth of perspectives on how to the problem.The example of what happened in the Anambra debate should be emulated in other state and national elections: environment should henceforth be a central issue of politics. Elections should be fought on the basis of party manifestoes on the environment among other issues. And that would be a rational step to take by political parties and their candidates for executive and legislative positions. In future governorship elections in other states, it would be helpful if candidates could tell the electorate their proposed policies to solve the problems of desertification, flooding and sanitation. As a matter of fact, all the candidates for the governorship election ought to state their policies on environment clearly while demonstrating how to fund the projects that should be implemented to achieve the policy objectives. In other words, environment should be squarely put at the heart of governance.Doing so would simply mean being alert to the global trend in which damage to the environment has become an enormous risk the world. Oxford Philosopher Toby Ord rigorously argues this point in his recent book, The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity. According to Ord, existential risks are ""just as real and urgent (as the present suffering of the poor), yet even more neglected."" The author posits optimistically that while environmental damage is one of those risks with ""higher probability"" of materialising, with the right policy choices humanity ""can pull back from the precipice and, in time, create a future of astonishing value - with a richness of which we can barely dream, made possible by innovations we are yet to conceive."" National and subnational governments should be conscious of how this primacy of environment should shape socio-economic policies. After all, the human habitat has to be secure first before any development plan could be executed in a sustainable way.Now, the damage to the environment is not only a scientific problem, it is also a huge geo-political issue. And the politics of the environment could indeed be a tricky one. As an electoral issue, perspectives are bound to vary in formulating solutions to the problem. Yet in order to formulate the solutions that could be effective a certain degree of consensus is needed. This is because regardless of the political, ideological and regional divides all the societal forces should collaborate to achieve results in environment policies.This is partly what is playing out at the current global negotiations and discussions taking place at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, United Kingdom.At the take-off of the all-important conference, a team of scientists from the China, Europe and the United States released a report stating that by 2070 unless global warming is curbed 3 billion of the projected 9 billion world population would suffer from temperatures as high as what obtains in the hottest of the Sahara today. It is projected that about 19% of the planet would be affected by this extreme climate. The scientists could also foresee the possibility of migration of people in large numbers from the heat. Adaptability on the part of the people is also predictedIn the scenario-building, it has been predicted that by the middle of this century, Africa would double its population to 2.4 billion. And with a projected population of about 477 million, Nigeria would be the third largest nation displacing the United States. It is also projected that with a population of 61.5m Lagos would be the largest city in the world in 2075. The scenario poses a huge challenge for those responsible for development plans and policies to execute the strategy for the future. In the scenario, the ""Shared Socio-Economic Pathway (SSP)"" sketched for Nigeria is far from being cheery. The forecast is that of ""business as usual, in which social, economic and technological trends do not shift markedly from historical patterns.""The undertone of Afropessimism in the foregoing scenario-building is, of course, unmistakeable. It is, therefore, the task of governments at all levels to ensure that these scenarios do not play out eventually. It is a sacred duty those in charge of policies owed the future generations. After all, by the same projection Africa still has an opportunity of about five decades to reverse the trends using the instrumentality of consistent policies of pro-people and sustainable development.The address of President Muhammadu to COP26 should be viewed in the context of the above trends and scenario. In the spirit of the Climate Paris Agreement, the United Nations has set 2050 as the target for the net-zero carbon emission. But Buhari reportedly told other world leaders yesterday that Nigeria's target for zero carbon emission would be 2060.By the way, India, the third largest polluter in the world, has a target of 2070!Buhari's statement is hinged on a balance of national economic development and a clean global environment.""We are investing in renewables, hydro-dams and solar projects. Nigeria is not looking to make the same mistakes that are being repeated for decades by others. We are looking for partners in innovation, technology and finance to make cleaner and more efficient use of all available resources to help make for a more stable transition in energy markets.""The revised Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) has additional priority sectors. Water and waste, nature-based solutions, adaptions and resilience, vulnerability assessment and a clean cooking gender and green jobs assessment.""Nigeria has developed a detailed energy transition plan and roadmap based on data and evidence. This plan has highlighted some key facts that face the difficult conversations. Our transition plan also highlights the key role that gas must play in transitioning our economy across sectors.""The data and evidence show that Nigeria can continue to use gas until 2040 without distracting from the goals of the Paris Agreement.Earlier at a side event Buhari has expressed the optimism that Nigeria would give regional leadership in developing the ""Great Green Wall."" The continental ambition really is the restoration of the 100 million hectares of degraded landscape which could be useful for agriculture. In a way, the defence of the environment is also a fight for food security in Africa. The President reiterated the commitment given at the One Planet Biodiversity held in Paris in January.The tone and tenor of Buhari's speech reaffirm the point that the environmental challenge facing different countries of the people would ultimately be resolved by geo-political negotiations. Unilateral steps and unbridled contestation for advantage would not bring solutions. To the rest of the world, perhaps the most absurd action of former United States president, Donald Trump, was the unilateral withdrawal of his country from the Climate Agreement reached among nations of the world in Paris in December 2014. Trump's successor, Joe Biden, is doing the right by reversing the irrational policy steps of Trump. Biden made the American return to the Paris agreement an electoral issue in the 2019 presidential election campaign. It would be recalled that Trump also made the irresponsible withdrawal from the agreement part of his incoherent campaign in 2015. In the process, Trump even had some harsh words for Greta Thunberg, the exceptionally courageous young Swedish girl who is a symbol of her generation's sustained campaign against climate change.If environment is an issue of geo-political negotiations internationally, it should also be an electoral issue locally. The purpose is clear. Apart from mobilising the people in the process of solving environmental problems, the government would be confident to push its position in the international arena as President Buhari has just done in the COP26. When a government is elected it would be presumed that its mandate is inclusive the policy on environment.In some western democracies environment has long been placed at the centre of politics. Environment often comes up as major issue of elections in some climes. Hence, Green Parties have won parliamentary seats and in some places parties focussing on the environment have joined coalitions to form governments. The global green movement has been resilient in defence of the environment. Some politicians are identified with the cause of the environment in their career. For instance, former American Vice President Al Gore is known to be passionate in promoting environment-friendly policies.In real terms, environmentalism has been somewhat on the margin of Nigerian politics (in both military and civil dispensations). From campaigns in the late 1980s led by Ken Saro-Wiwa and other environment-conscious Niger Delta activists and some organisations brought the destruction of the oil-rich region to global attention. The judicial murder of the Ogoni 9 by the Abacha regime following the brutal killing of the Ogoni 4 further drew the world attention to the environmental problems of the Niger Delta region. Before the agitation from the Niger Delta, environment hit the headl"

My expectations are limited by the philosophical backbone of thelaw and subsisting practices in the nation on the issues of climate change.'The basic underpinning of the law is acceptance that the basic challenge is one of fixation on the carbon molecules in the atmosphere. This is the global trend. This is what was elevated at COP26 in Glasgow.'The Act requires the government to set emissions reduction target aimed at attaining a net zero carbon emissions by 2060.'Now, the fossil fuels industry is the major champion of the net-zero concept. This concept is merely a glorified name for carbon offsetting which will rely on means such as direct carbon capture/storage and having trees, soils and oceans serve as carbon sinks.Unfortunately net-zero doesn't. It is not equal to zero.'Beyond the carbon in the air, we should be concerned about the carbon in the ground. Can we afford to keep pumping outthe carbon and then go chasing after it in the atmosphere?'The Act requires the setting up of a council headed by the President and populated by ministers and other top government officials.Having a president head that council is a good idea and could really aid action.'A problem would creep in if a president in office is indifferent to the climate crisis.'There is critical need for the government to take urgent climate change actions that can build public confidence. In 2019 the president pledged to plant 25 million trees in Nigeria. What's the scorecard on that?With the Great Green Wall alone, that target can be met.

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria302","Female mood swings and climate change","November 4, 2021 Thursday","News Chronicle (Nigeria)","''For Nigeria, climate change is not about the perils of tomorrow but what is happening today. Nigeria is committed to net zero by 2060.'' This was President Buhari's statement while delivering his speech at the COP26 Leaders' Summit, in Glasgow, Scotland. The speech is a very welcomed one though it sounds quite ambitious in lieu of the body language of global leaders towards tackling climate change; it appears nobody ones to take active measures towards this right cause.While pondering and researching on the many reasons why the climate is changing rapidly and dangerously too, the female folks come to mind, not that they are the cause of climate change, maybe it was more of a distractive thought on the female emotions and their celebrated mood swings in particular.The female folks are such wonderful people; their sheer presence and aura inspires. They have this therapeutic touch (something close to an anointing) and needless to say; they are beautiful as the clement weather.Men too experience mood swings, but not like the women do. To give a simple definition in context of mood swing here, it means ones mood changing from happy to sad, active to sober, in a matter of seconds, for no explainable reason. When women experience mood swing it is difficult to help them at times, the husband or anyone for example could stay besides her, asking her as romantic as possible what the matter is and yet she will be unresponsive. Sometimes they even go as far as blaming people who have no hand in their ordeal through emotional blackmail and using every damning arsenal they can muster.This bad handling of mood swing through unresponsiveness and emotional blackmails never provide solution to the cause of the problems. At best, the situation remains the same until there is a swing to another direction by default and time.When we consider that these mood swings are not the making of the women at times, but are results of menstruation, menopause and other issues peculiar to the female gender, then we cannot but hold them in reverence and sympathy.There are similarities between mood swings and climate change. Climate change could be a natural phenomenon just like mood swing, yet it has been heightened by industrial activities of man in burning fossil fuels like coal and oil. It should be pointed out that though it sounds bogus, climate change is not as complex as mood swing. In fact from details regarding climate change, it is easier to solve the problem of climate change than that of mood swings.There has been extensive medical research into mood swings and therapy sessions for people who go through it, yet emotions will never completely fit into textbooks and formal education. \\xa0For climate change, we know the cause (not neglecting the inevitable factor of being a natural occurrence) and we know the way out. All that is needed is the willingness by nations around the globe \- developed and developing \- to make great sacrifices to tackle the scourge of climate change.Yes it is sacrifice that is needed to solve climate change. The UN Secretary General, Ant\'f3nio Guterres, in one of his speeches before the COP26 began said ""As the title of this year's report puts it: ""The heat is on.""\\xa0 And as the contents of the report show  the leadership we need is off. The emissions gap is the result of a leadership gap"".The issue of climate change must not be politicized in any way; it should be faced with all seriousness of purpose because it is real and will not succumb to gimmicks of any kind. More than a woman would want her period pain which is no fault of hers to go away, we must work to mitigate climate change which is mainly our fault. Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder has committed $2 billion already to a greener world, he deserves huge commendation while we hope others will follow suit.Heatwaves have been on the increase, the glaciers are melting, there is 90% drought in Lake Chad, sea levels are rising, and the climate which gave us food and succor is threatened and threatening with gloom and emptiness.There are just two main hindrances to tackling climate change; following the Paris agreement and other such resolutions, for developed countries, it is the willingness to put their vows into action by actually working towards ending hazardous emissions and providing finance and technical assistance to developing countries on the road to achieving zero emission. For developing countries it is the simple work of shunning corruption by using resources, both theirs and aid from developed countries and blocs for the purpose which these resources and funds are meant for.\l"

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria306","Global COP, bad COP","The Nation (Nigeria)"," ","The paradox is stark: to rein in severe climate change, the United States and Europe lead a global campaign against fossil fuel and greenhouse gas. Yet, in that twin-bracket may lay Africa's path to cheap, sustainable energy.Meanwhile, the WENA (Western Europe and North America) neo-climate crusaders have been the most reckless in the carbon poisoning of the globe. Africa has been the least contributor to that plague. So, the solution to this dire challenge must be balanced and equitable, if it's not to land Africa in fresh - and serious - energy trouble.That was the long-and-short of President Muhammadu Buhari's well publicized address to the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference, officially tagged Conference of the Parties 26 (COP26) at Glasgow, Scotland, UK.COP26 opened on November 1 with rhetoric matching the current environmental doomsday. Antonio Guterres, UN secretary-general, couldn't have been starker: 'Either we stop it,' he told the more than 120-nation delegations gathered, 'or it stops us.'Boris Johnson, British prime minister, went historic: pollution started right there, near Glasgow, home to one of the first Industrial Revolution-era factories. That perhaps sent English romantic poets like Wordsworth, Coleridge and Keats tingling in their graves with 'we told you so!' This genre of poetry decried and attacked pristine industrial poisoning of the environment.Joe Biden, the US president, assumed a moral high ground in his environmental bully pulpit of fellow heads of government: 'Will we do what is necessary?' he queried. 'This is the decade that will determine the answer.'But the approach to carbon elimination is no way unanimous. Indeed, there seems a dissonance between the industrialized WENA, China pumping out carbon at the zenith of own industrial power and much of Africa, which lot has been de-industrialization. It's all along the one global problem but varied local solutions, which President Buhari canvassed in his Glasgow speech.Why - China might ask and it appears asking -should she keep off coal, the same energy WENA earlier used to power its industries to reap tremendous global wealth, just because WENA now says so? A similar question President Buhari asked on behalf of African countries: why should the current attempts to de-emit carbon and curb global warming, though plausible, lead to sure future crisis for Nigeria and others, whose future industrial development still depends on cheap hydrocarbon?These are critical questions world leaders need to seriously address, if they hope to cobble together a workable consensus needed to yet save the world from own carbon-industrial appetite.COP's target is to freeze the earth's temperature rise at 1.5 degrees Celsius: the global warming of the pristine industrial era (1850-1900). Between 2006 and 2015, that has flared to 2.5 degrees Celsius or worse, hitting 2.7C right now; and leading to rising ocean beds, harsh and erratic weather, terrible droughts, wild fires and increased desertification. America and the EU believe global cooling can be achieved by shunning coal, fossil fuel and gas.But the developing countries of Africa demur on this 'green bullet,' claiming fossil fuel was the fastest and surest path to power own economies into global reckoning.

She attributed the disparity in part to the reluctance of wealthy countries to forcefully commit to tackling climate change.The Nobel laureate said the IMF had made an estimate of $50 billion as the cost package for Covax to help most of the countries of the world vaccinate up to 60% of their population within two years. The estimated potential benefit, she said, was $9 trillion, which she added was an obvious win-win.She said global efforts to tackle Covid-19 pandemic had dampened her optimism about the global responses to climate change.Professor Duflo urged immediate action but warned that the world cannot rely on innovation alone. ""The impact of purely technological solutions is often very disappointing in real life,"" she stressed.According to the Nobel laureate globally combating climate change will require changes in behavior and consumption patterns. She noted that economists underestimate the capacity of humans to change behaviors, and that shifts in consumption would need to be made primarily in industrialized countries. ""I don't think we can tell Africans with a straight face that they need to consume less when they in fact need to consume more,"" she said.The Bank's Acting Chief Economist and Vice President Kevin C. Urama said the topic could not be timelier, coming right after the global climate conference in Glasgow last month.The Nobel laureate's lecture was followed by a conversation with African Development Bank President Dr. Akinwumi A. Adesina, who praised her pragmatic economic research and the insights she provided.He said Professor Duflo's remarks underscored the need to change the way we measure wealth creation. ""GDP tells us very little about how wealth is produced,"" Dr Adesina said.\\xa0 ""I have been a big advocate of the need to weigh the GDP of countries by the extent of negative externalities they create.""Dr Adesina engaged in an extensive discussion with Professor Duflo about the importance of accurate carbon pricing as an incentive to developing nations He proposed the establishment of a long-term carbon sink fund to compensate countries like Gabon and the Democratic Republic of Congo for preserving vast forests that sequester carbon dioxide. He noted that the debt-to-GDP ratios of such countries would substantively be lower if their forests were taken into consideration.Professor Duflo said there was a crisis of credibility and trust for governments whose actions were not aligned with their commitments and that change would require a global enforcement of regulations. According to Duflo, ""Nature is stronger than us and dire warnings do come to pass,"" hence the need for collective action.\l"

However, due to its abundant natural resources, particularly solar, the north-African country has a significant potential to diversify its energy mix while adhering to worldwide commitments to a global energy transition.Speaking through a virtual platform from Geneva, Switzerland, Curran identified his views \- from an international and an African perspective \- on Libya's energy transition and what are effective opportunities and risks linked with carbon markets. Noting three primary takeaways from the COP26 UN Climate Change Conference as the reversal of coal, forestry land management, and the global commitment to carbon emission reductions, he identified Libya's potential to contribute to the energy transition by exploiting its vast land area, available resources, and space for renewable energy.Curran noted carbon credit \- a permit representing the right to emit greenhouse gases \- as being a key opportunity for oil-rich nations to benefit from global sustainable development goals (SDGs).With the potential to become a powerful emerging economy in the region, a key opportunity for Libya is to benefit from international markets and to assure that the country's energy sector is aligned with current and future SDGs, noted Curran, concluding that, the energy transition offers the potential for Libya to give life back to its land while promoting socio-economic growth.Distributed by APO Group on behalf of Energy Capital & Power.Media filesDownload logo 2021 Ventures Africa.\l"

But each year as the countdown to United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP) begins, they grow in volume and intensity.'Recently, senior United Nations officials raised the alarm of 'world conflict and chaos' and mass migrations and institutional collapse should greenhouse gas emissions remain unchecked for much longer.'Mankind has a duty to act on these dangers. But because of their seriousness, we must not do so rashly. It is an inconvenient truth, but energy solutions proposed by those most eager to address the climate crisis are fuel for the instability of which they warn.'No more clearly can this be seen than in Africa. 'Estimated to rise to 2.5 billion by 2050 - by 2100. Nigeria alone is projected to have the second-largest population on the planet-this 'great doubling' (for Nigeria, quadrupling) has the right to more dependable electricity than their forebears.'Without extra and stable power, we cannot build the factories that will transform Africa from a low-job, extractives-led economy to a high employment middle-income continent.'The President warned that children cannot learn for longer and better by battery light any more than by candlelight, adding: 'No more than the Africa of today, the Africa of tomorrow cannot advance using energy production that intermittently delivers.'Yet in our rush to address climate concerns, and for western aid agencies and investors to burnish their green credentials, we rush to install the most alternative of energy sources which are often the most unreliable.'It also seems unnoticed that in our global rush for electric cars we risk replacing the last century's scramble for fossil fuels with a new global race in lithium for batteries.'Where significant deposits are to be found, such as in Africa, this could endanger geopolitical stability. This makes the economic migrations the U.N. warned of more likely.'We must think carefully whether our dash to terminate the use of fossil fuels so swiftly is as wise as it sounds.'There is no single 'green bullet' that can be deployed either in Africa or the world that solves concerns of environmentalists while simultaneously offering the power to fuel hope of greater wealth and progress for the extra 1 billion citizens of our African future.'President Buhari pointed out what can be done to transition to cleaner energy.He said: 'But there are certain things we can and must do-starting with transitioning to cleaner, but consistent, energy production.'Fossil fuel power generation that can provide electricity 24 hours a day in all conditions can be re-tooled greener through carbon capture and the conversion of coal and heavy fuel oil power stations to biomass.'We can also invest in nuclear. Though not renewable it is carbon neutral and capable of producing baseload, constant electricity production on which sustained economic progress can be built.Nigeria is among a handful of African countries exploring nuclear power, with a research reactor already operational. And we can also learn from our friends in Europe and America who do not always practice what they preach.'Buhari called for the lifting of the moratorium placed on fossil fuel investments in Africa, noting that Nigeria has pledged to eliminate illegal gas flaring by 2030-a by-product of our oil industry-and harness it for electricity production.He added: 'Our intention to end Nigeria's single greatest contribution to greenhouse emissions may stall without it. Yet there are no such limitations on investment in natural gas power in the West where it is considered a transitional energy source.'There is a deal to be done at COP26, but none without the agreement of the nations of Africa. The climate warnings we hear them. We live them. But no one has the right to deny the advancement of our continent.'Yet unless the developed world wakes up, we run the risk of trying to fix the climate crisis with an energy crisis.'\l"

They also discussed how the programme can support the Energy Transition Councils' efforts to prepare Nigeria for COP26 and beyond.During the discussions the Deputy High Commissioner explained that UKNIAF remains critical to the UK-Nigeria collaboration in the Energy Transition Council, not only in preparing for COP26 but also for initiatives beyond this event.UKNIAF supports COP26 through its work with regulators and other Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) in the energy sector, where they highlight opportunities to mitigate the challenges of the energy transition, both on-grid and off-grid. These opportunities are also matched with potential investments. The Energy Transition Council allows UKNIAF to step up our engagement and efforts in the run-up to COP26; and beyond , the focus will be on resolving the obstacles hindering Nigeria from making the energy transition a reality where our programme's assistance in this respect is critical.During the talk, they both agreed that coordination and capacity across key MDAs must be improved in the run-up to and beyond if policy objectives are to be met, adding that already, a lot of work is being done to encourage energy transition, however, the challenges of the energy transition remain, and they must be acknowledged as we work to overcome them.During the discussions, the Deputy High Commissioner, Ben Llewellyn-Jones said: ""We live in a competitive world where investors are looking for a location that provides adequate return on investment. It is important, therefore, to make Nigeria as competitive as possible to attract those investments."" There is a lot of goodwill, effort, and application; consequently, we must work with the Nigerian leadership while also highlighting this to potential investors. This is one of UKNIAF's key component areas - Infrastructure Finance.""Prof Chidiebere Onyia, the Managing Director of UKNIAF said: ""The UKNIAF's efforts to assist the regulator in developing evidence-based regulatory practices are critical in raising climate awareness and will go some way to aligning Nigerian government priorities with climate-smart principles.""Looking at government priorities through the lens of climate sensitivity does not preclude seeing the broader issues that require attention, such as bankability, efficiency, and access. Data is always critical for regulators and investors, and understanding the impact of policy and allowing data to inform predictable regulation is vital.""Additionally, the Press and Public Affairs Officer, British Deputy High Commission, Lagos, Ndidiamaka Eze, disclosed that ""the UKNIAF is collaborating with relevant MDAs, building the capacity regarding infrastructure investment, to boost the confidence of potential investors in the energy, roads, and infrastructure sectors in general. Increasing the capacity of MDA personnel is an issue that has arisen across the board, including at the sub-national level.""UKNIAF is a demand-led technical assistance programme funded by the United Kingdom Aid that assists the Nigerian government in delivering socially inclusive, climate-smart infrastructure. The program began in October 2019 and will last four years, until September 2023.""The program has made the following significant achievements in the 20 months since its inception and they include road conditions surveys: in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, UKNIAF has developed a road survey method that provides a good coverage level (with regard to kilometers per day).""Between mid-2020 and March 2021, three road survey programs were carried out in collaboration with FERMA and FMWH personnel. Two of them focused on key agricultural routes (in collaboration with FERMA), while the third focused on gathering information to support FMWH's Highway Development and Management Initiative (HDMI), a high priority project for the Ministry that aims to place concession-specific routes on the FRN;""Infrastructure Finance: in March 2021, we provided out a three-day training workshop on climate-smart infrastructure public-private partnerships to selected staff of the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission, Debt Management Office, Bureau for private Enterprise and Rural Electrification Agency.

The message is clear: as more countries switch to cleaner energy sources, the value of oil as the mainstay of any economy is shaky and uncertain.For Nigeria especially, with over 200 million persons, wracked by poverty and fiscal haemorrhage, diversifying revenue sources is desperately urgent.Although environmental activists said its resolutions fell short of their radical agenda, the recent 26th Conference of the Parties of the 197 countries that have signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius till 2030. More to the point, over 100 countries agreed to cut methane emissions, transition to clean energy and decarbonisation. The national governments, cities, states, and car manufacturers that signed the Glasgow Declaration on Zero-Emission Cars and Vans resolved to stop the sale of internal combustion engines by 2035 in major markets, and worldwide by 2040. Eleven countries went further, creating the 'Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance', to jointly set an end date for national oil and gas exploration and extraction.For years, analysts have foreseen the decl"

This is driven by stronger support from government policies and more ambitious clean energy goals announced before and during the COP26 Climate Change Conference.""This year's record renewable electricity additions of 290 gigawatts are yet another sign that a new global energy economy is emerging,"" said Fatih Birol, IEA Executive Director . ""The high commodity and energy prices we are seeing today pose new challenges for the renewable industry, but elevated fossil fuel prices also make renewables even more competitive.""The growth of renewables is forecast to increase in all regions compared with the 2015-2020 period. China remains the global leader in the volume of capacity additions: it is expected to reach 1200 GW of total wind and solar capacity in 2026 four years earlier than its current target of 2030.Read also:ND Western, partners build diagnostic laboratory in WarriIndia is set to come top in terms of the rate of growth, doubling new installations compared with 2015-2020.

These four markets together account for 80 percent of renewable capacity expansion worldwide.""The growth of renewables in India is outstanding, supporting the government's newly announced goal of reaching 500 GW of renewable power capacity by 2030 and highlighting India's broader potential to accelerate its clean energy transition,"" said Birol. ""China continues to demonstrate its clean energy strengths, with the expansion of renewables suggesting the country could well achieve a peak in its CO2 emissions well before 2030.""Solar PV remains the powerhouse of growth in renewable electricity, with its capacity additions forecast to increase by 17 percent in 2021 to a new record of almost 160 GW. In the same time frame, onshore wind additions are set to be almost one-quarter higher on average than during the 2015-20 period. Total offshore wind capacity is forecast to more than triple by 2026.The IEA report expects this record growth for renewables to take place despite today's high commodity and transport prices. However, should commodity prices remain high through the end of next year, the cost of wind investments would go back up to levels last seen in 2015 and three years of cost reductions for solar PV would be erased.Despite rising prices limiting growth, global biofuel demand in 2021 was forecast to surpass 2019 levels, rebounding from last year's huge decl"

Eskom requires R400bn over the next 10 years, while funding for electric vehicles and green hydrogen are at the initial stages, aimed at project development.However, both Eskom and the country are constrained by high debt levels.

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria323","What is Nigeria's economic outlook for six of its key sectors in 2022?","February 9, 2022 Wednesday","Ventures Africa","2021 was such an important year for Nigeria, primarily because it marked the beginning of the nation's recovery from a pandemic-induced recession. Policies were issued, promises made, setbacks happened, market trends changed, and a few unexpected events happened. However, innovation and technology became the highlights of the year. Many companies had to adopt technology to stay in tune with the rapid changes in consumer behaviours.As with every year, several economic promises and predictions are in for the year, one of which is that the long-awaited Nigeria Air will launch on April 22, 2022. Another is that Nigeria's economy will grow 2.7 per cent. Last year, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted a 2.6 per cent growth for Nigeria's economy. But at the end of the third quarter, the nation reported a 4.03 per cent growth. Based on significant happenings in the past year, here are some things we can expect in different sectors this year.AgricultureAgriculture is the second-largest source of export in the country. In 2021, the sector made significant contributions to the GDP, with the first and second quarter of 2021 accounting for 22.35percent and 23.78 per cent, respectively. This shows that agriculture is not slowing down, despite several challenges. However, technology will play a crucial role in its advancement hereon. Even the National Institute of Technology and Development Agency (NITDA) has supported agritech startups by establishing incubation centres. These centres will enable smallholder farmers to get access to mechanisation services.Nigerian farm produce has always been affected by low-yielding seed varieties, and last year, wheat &mdash; which Nigeria produces but still imports &mdash; took the hit. The National Agricultural Seed Council (NASC) collaborated with industry stakeholders to form a strategy to stop this. If properly implemented, we expect to see the importation fall.Also, in recognition of the increasing climate change and COP26, sustainable agriculture will remain part of Nigeria's agricultural practices. We will likely see more adoption of practices that reduce waste and pollution, plus increased investment in the technology needed to make this happen. We also expect the Nigerian model grazing reserve to become active.2022 is looking at increased direct investment and capital injection by private and institutional investors, as the sector is on its way to being the highest contributor to the National GDP by 2025. However, there's still a lot to be done, and without tackling challenges like insecurity, 2022 might as well be a cloned 2021 for the sector.ICTCurrently enjoying a space in the spotlight, this sector will only get better in 2022. Technology has become a key player in our socio-economic advancement. The private sector has known this for a while, but the government is just catching on. According to the speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, &rdquo;Nigeria can have a tech ecosystem that will be the top destination for investment in sub-Saharan Africa.&rdquo; For this reason, the federal government offered five million naira each to help four Nigerian tech startups in 2021.Meanwhile, tech is taking up the medicine and Health industry. Nigeria's health ministry plans to look into biotech for vaccines and other medical products in 2022. In the private sector, health startups are springing up. Whether or not we are ready for it, this trend is not slowing down in 2022. Meanwhile, tech adoption is spreading in other industries nationwide, including water tech.Nigeria is still a top destination for tech investments in Africa, and a clear legislative framework to support the efforts will attract further investments. A startup bill, which has been in the works since 2021, is likely to become effective this year.FinanceThe sector recorded a growth rate of 23.23 per cent in the third quarter of 2021. With more businesses embracing contactless payments tech solutions, cryptocurrencies making waves, and more engagement in digitally-powered platforms like Kuda, Nigerians are rapidly moving towards digital transaction methods. Fintech is also proving to be an answer to financial inclusion and is pushing the entire sector to become intentional about it.Telecommunication companies are also leveraging their massive infrastructure and dealer network to rollout banking services. 2021 marked the first step with Mtn and airtel getting a CBN licence to operate as PSBs.However, the sector might come under pressure from an amended NITDA bill in 2022, which includes increased taxes and levies on certain businesses.Mining and quarryingNigeria's mining sector needs a lot of work. With over 34 minerals, there is a lot to expect, but not so much has come out of it. The Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Olamilekan Adegbite, described Nigeria as friendly for new investment in mining. But it will take more than words and a structural overhaul to convince investors.Nigeria is also looking to increase participants in the entire ecosystem &ndash; mining companies, small-scale mining operators, investment companies, legal firms, and multilateral investors. In November, UAE pledged a two-billion-dollar investment in Nigeria's mining sector.Nigeria's Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (NEITI) will also be on its toes for illegal mining activities. It will be doing so to ensure the industry does not lose another $9 billion to illicit activities.The real estate sector has experienced a consistent rise in the last six years. It contributed 3.8 per cent growth to the economy in the 2nd quarter of 2021. However, when a 21-storey building in Lagos collapsed, killing scores, the government decided to address the numerous irregularities and inadequacies in the system. These include spiked prices, poor building quality, ineffective property protection laws, and, of course, housing shortage. Consequently, the Nigerian Senate passed a bill to set up the Real Estate Regulatory Council of Nigeria to address some of these issues.This is a step towards the much-needed adequate regulation of the real estate sector. Nigeria has a long way to go to tackle housing issues. It needs a dramatic reduction in fraudulent practices and building conditions in 2022. Serious attention to policies in this sector should give room for more investments.Crude oil and natural gasLast but not least is Nigeria's most famous export. The future of crude oil in Nigeria is not looking so bright. Nigeria made no revenue from oil export in October 2021, despite an average daily oil production of 1.417 million barrels in September. Overall, Nigeria has been making less money from its top export.As for expectations, the government projects the country to produce 1.88 million barrels of crude oil per day in 2022 and used a benchmark oil price of $57 per barrel for its budget planning.On the other hand, the government announced that in 2022, citizens would be paying a premium for fuel due to the removal of subsidy, an attempt to cut expenditure. Although this plan is now on hold for the umpteenth time, subsidy removal could lift inflation towards 16 per cent. Also, due to Nigeria's commitment towards zero gas emissions, crude petroleum might see a decl"

BASIL OMIYI, chairman of Stanbic IBTC in this interview with MODESTUS ANAESORONYE gives insights into what the institution is doing. Excerpts:There have been various calls for the adoption of green energy, especially among corporate organisations on the need for zero-emission. How important is green energy to sustainable development in Nigeria, and what are financial institutions doing to drive this?For development in Nigeria to be sustainable, there must be an appropriate balance to ensure the environment and society are not negatively affected by economic activities, both today and in the future.We acknowledge that the economy and society are wholly owned subsidiaries of the environment; hence we must strive to ensure that the environment remains stable to support economic and social activities.Green energy (Solar, Wind, Hydro etc.) thus presents an opportunity to pursue economic development while ensuring minimal adverse impacts on the environment.We are barely scratching the surface, as a lot of work still needs to be done to develop appropriate regulations and enforce existing regulations to ensure compliance with environmental best practices and standardsGreen energy is devoid of carbon emissions (unlike fossil fuel energy sources), which harms the environment and is one of the major contributors to climate change.

Communities must be involved as well as the investors so as to sustain livelihoods in communities.""""We will be counting on your support in the areas of technical assistance,"" Obaseki urged.The governor noted that the British Government had helped establish the best forestry governance system in Benin City, stating that the advent of crude oil truncated it.""We have done a bit of work in reclaiming our forests as we have a well-developed regeneration programme for our forests. We are also working hard to police our forests to ensure they are not hideouts for criminals,"" he added.overnor Obaseki also renewed the call for the return of Benin artefacts in the United Kingdom, noting that it would help inspire and reenergize the state's young population to recreate such masterpieces.He further stated, ""As a government, we are working to ensure our artefacts are returned, as the works represent our culture, creativity and innovation. The work will influence and re-energise our young ones as it will connect them with their history.""The return of the work is important to us as we have the capacity to support the works as it will attract tourism; the artefacts are a global public good.""In the area of technology, Governor Godwin Obaseki said his administration is preparing Edo youths to take advantage of technology, adding, ""We are using basic education to drive the process of actualizing our policies and plans.""The issue of human trafficking has been taken seriously and we have made remarkable success in that aspect as we traced the root causes and addressed it. We are hoping to work with the Federal Government to come up with a strategy for regular migration, knowing those that want to travel and preparing them for such journeys.""On her part, Catriona Liang said the United Kingdom is ready to partner with the Edo State Government to tackle climate change and deforestation, using oil palm trees.The High Commissioner said she was in Edo to follow up on commitments Nigeria made on forest regeneration at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP26, held in Glasgow.She emphasized that the goal was to ensure that the oil palm approach was sustainable for the good of not just Nigeria but the world as a whole.\l"

For 1.5\'b0C of global warming, there will be increasing heat waves, longer warm seasons and shorter cold seasons.At 2\'b0C of global warming, heat extremes would more often reach critical tolerance thresholds for agriculture and health.""Climate change is already affecting every region on earth, in multiple ways.

Because most oilfields are remote, they lack a grid connection, making gensets necessary to keep operations running,"" It added.According to the report, Nigeria, one of the world's largest crude oil producers, is dominated by commercial applications, owing largely to the continuous operation of gensets in oilfields, as commercial spaces in the country generally use high-power gensets for continuous operations due to the country's poor grid infrastructure.The poor grid infrastructure is the biggest reason that makes gensets important, according to PandS Intelligence.While highlighting the reasons for the high consumption of genset, the report stated, ""One of the biggest factors encouraging residential, commercial, and industrial users to buy gensets is the decreasing prices of low-power variants"".enset is the combination of a generator and an engine. The engine powers the generator, which in turn powers other equipment.Read also:Generator company, JMG, 7 others get FG's tax incentiveSome key companies in the Nigerian diesel genset market include; JMG Limited, Mikano International itLimed, Denyo Co. Ltd., Honda Manufacturing (Nigeria) Limited, General Electric Company, among others.The P and S Intelligence report added, ""This is itself because of the regulations imposed by the Nigerian government to curb the import of these machines and produce them locally instead"".""With the rapid industrialization and population growth, the amount of power being generated in the country is becoming increasingly inadequate. Moreover, the large transmission losses make the situation worse, thereby driving the demand for diesel gensets,"" the report stated.Meanwhile, following the declaration made by President Muhammadu Buhari at the recently concluded Conference of Parties () which happened in Glasgow, where he pledged the country will meet net-zero emission by 2060, the government has put stringent regulations in place to check greenhouses gasses (GHG) emissions from diesel machines and initiated policies to promote cleaner fuels, such as natural gas.With this in mind, the emission of greenhouse gasses has been seen as one of the major factors which will have a negative impact on the Nigerian diesel genset market growth.In accordance with this, some key findings by the report have also identified that the major factors driving the demand for gas genset include but are not limited to growing construction and oil and gas sectors, increasing air pollution levels.""The growing construction and oil and gas sectors are a key reason for the rising demand for gas gensets. Construction sites, even those that are located in cities, often lack a grid connection, while most oil fields are located at remote places. Therefore, both these sectors require an alternate source of electricity for keeping the machines and operations running nonstop.""The increasing air pollution levels are another key factor behind the high sale of gas gensets in Nigeria. Although gas gensets do emit greenhouse gasses (GHGs), the emissions are a lot lower than those of diesel gensets.Thus, with the implementation of strict emission regulations on diesel engines, people in the country are turning to gas gensets, which are, additionally, cheaper to operate because of their high fuel efficiency,"" the report indicated.""PandS Intelligence is a provider of market research and consulting services catering to the market information needs of increasing industries across the world.\l"
"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria336","Green money: A summit to climb, By Natalie Beinisch","January 21, 2022 Friday","Premium Times","Nigeria, Jan. 21 -- COP26 revealed the total failure of developed countries to live up to their commitment of channeling $100 billion per year towards the greening of the economies of the developing world. During the COVID-19 pandemic, when the wealthy countries ploughed more than $10 trillion towards the challenges that have primarily gone to benefit their citizens, this failure is made even more apparent and disappointing .How do we address the jaw-dropping gaps between the green investment needs of Nigeria and the resources that are available to fund them? There are no easy answers. The path to a green economy is one with many forks in the road - different investment agendas involving different types of priorities, institutions and risks.A top-down approach can help us to appreciate the scale of the task but it is both polarising and paralysing. Why do anything locally if needs are so substantial and international support is so flimsy?Far less sexy and eye catching, flipping our gaze of green investment reverses from top-down to bottom-up reveals the incredible strides now being made to develop green investment opportunities in Nigeria. In doing so, we can also identify the limits of these opportunities and strategies to overcome them.Green Bonds: An Extraordinary Step Forward for Green Finance in NigeriaThe Financial Market Dealers Quotation Group (most often referred to as FMDQ)'s green bond exchange is one example of such an incredible stride. Established in 2012, FMDQ provides financial market infrastructure that facilitates financial transactions by setting standards and improving information flows. It's foray into the green bond market began in 2017, when it facilitated the listing of Africa's first green sovereign bond, a N10.69 billion issuance by the Federal Government of Nigeria, whose proceeds are used for financing community-based clean energy provision and reforestation. Just over one year later, FMDQ facilitated Africa's first non-sovereign green bond listing, a N10.69 billion issuance with Access Bank, for projects directed at solar, agriculture and flood defence. North-South Power followed suit, using the green bond framework to issue two separate bonds for solar and hydropower projects.Through a partnership established between FMDQ and the Luxembourg Green Exchange, green bonds listed in Nigeria are now listed on the Luxembourg exchange, providing access to international investors. This is an opportunity that has been seized by pioneering issuers like Access Bank and in the words of Solape Hammond, Special Adviser to the Office of SDGs and Investment in Lagos State, it goes a long way to address the risks that constrain international investors from participating in Nigerian financial markets..It takes a village to raise a child and it also takes a village to raise a green bond. FMDQ worked with multiple organisations to raise these first green bonds, including the UK-based non-profit, Climate Bond Initiative, FSD Africa, a U.K.-sponsored financial sector development programme, and local issuers and intermediaries, including Chapel Hill Denham. Such collaboration demonstrates that local and international institutions are doubling down on efforts to invest, with a focus on sustainability, in Nigeria. The depth of these efforts and the inter-organisation coordination is nothing short of Herculean.The appetite for the GB listing has been very robust; it is oversubscribed. The strong institutional architecture and demand makes it a solid pathway to grow investments that are focused on the green transition.The first and most obvious challenge is that green bonds are not free money. As they need to be paid back and should not be terribly risky investments, this type of financing is most attractive to projects that are mature or/or require re-financing. The green bond is not a panacea and is just one among many types of financing instruments that need to function well to really support the green transition in Nigeria.Secondly, and more importantly for the first-time issuer, the green bond is more than a traditional bond and it is significantly more work to issue a green bond and comply with a green bond framework, and there are not many tangible rewards for issuers to go the extra mile, as the coupon rates are comparable to those in the traditional bond market.While the FMDQ's assistance to issue bonds is substantial, with end-to-end support, this is not enough to move green issuances from virtue-signaling to a more mainstream financial market activity. Improving other competitive dimensions of green bonds for issuers could motivate companies to invest in green products and services within a framework that creates access, transparency and security for investors.Implementing this is a challenge, but it is not insurmountable. The Climate Bonds Initiative recommends national governments to extend the same reporting and compliance requirements to all bond issuers. However, in a country like Nigeria where there is a higher priority to make all types of financial instruments more accessible, such an approach may be tricky.Another strategy, successfully used in the United States, is public support for green asset-backed securitisation of smaller scale loans and projects. This requires a healthy volume of smaller green lending in the market. In this respect, it is imperative that investors work more closely across the value chain to create, identify and support potential green projects, so that relevant funding is available to them at every step of a project's maturity. Luckily, organisations like the Impact Investors Forum have been established to provide this support.The $100 billion headl"

We look forward to working with you in this regard.''He said his administration had taken infrastructure expansion in Nigeria seriously, conscious of the fact that new investments in critical sectors of the economy would aid lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty by 2030.''There's a nexus between infrastructure development and the overall economic development of a nation.''My administration identified this early enough as a major enabler of sustainable economic development and the realization of other continental and global development aspirations particularly the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals.''On my assumption of office in 2015, Nigeria faced a huge infrastructure deficit and the total National Infrastructure Stock was estimated at 35% of our Gross Domestic Product.''In solving these problems, we embarked on a massive infrastructure expansion programme in the areas of healthcare, education, transportation, manufacturing, energy, housing, agriculture and water resources.''We provided more financial resources for these policies, charted new international partnerships and pursued liberalization policies to allow private sector participation,' he said.Buhari welcomed the G7 countries for their ground-breaking plan to mobilise hundreds of billions of dollars of infrastructure investment for low - and middle-income countries.He noted that the 'Build Back Better World' plan, an initiative of the G7 countries, was expected to be a values-driven, high-standard, and transparent infrastructure partnership.''It's our fervent hope and expectations that this plan will be pursued to its logical conclusion in order to bridge the infrastructural gap between the North and South.'Earlier, while delivering his national statement at COP26 Leaders' Summit, Buhari said Nigeria would cut its emissions to net zero by 2060.\l"

Though not renewable, it is carbon neutral and capable of producing baseload, constant electricity production on which sustained economic progress can be built.""Nigeria is among a handful of African countries exploring nuclear power, with a research reactor already operational. And we can also learn from our friends in Europe and America who do not always practice what they preach.""Buhari called for the lifting of the moratorium placed on fossil fuel investments in Africa, noting that Nigeria has pledged to eliminate illegal gas flaring by 2030--a by-product of our oil industry--and harness it for electricity production.He added: ""Our intention to end Nigeria's single greatest contribution to greenhouse emissions may stall without it. Yet there are no such limitations on investment in natural gas power in the West where it is considered a transitional energy source.""Dire warnings of the end of the world are as old as civilisation itself. But each year as the countdown to United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP) begins, they grow in volume and intensity. ""Recently, senior United Nations officials raised the alarm of ""world conflict and chaos"" and mass migrations and institutional collapse should greenhouse gas emissions remain unchecked for much longer.""Mankind has a duty to act on these dangers. But because of their seriousness, we must not do so rashly. It is an inconvenient truth, but energy solutions proposed by those most eager to address the climate crisis are fuel for the instability of which they warn.""No more clearly can this be seen than in Africa. ""Estimated to rise to 2.5 billion by 2050, Nigeria alone is projected to have the second-largest population on the planet--this ""great doubling"" (for Nigeria, quadrupling) has the right to more dependable electricity than their forebears.""Without extra and stable power, we cannot build the factories that will transform Africa from a low-job, extractives-led economy to a high employment middle-income continent.""The president warned that children cannot learn for longer and better by battery light any more than by candlelight, adding: ""No more than the Africa of today, the Africa of tomorrow cannot advance using energy production that intermittently delivers.""Yet in our rush to address climate concerns, and for western aid agencies and investors to burnish their green credentials, we rush to install the most alternative of energy sources which are often the most unreliable.""It also seems unnoticed that in our global rush for electric cars we risk replacing the last century's scramble for fossil fuels with a new global race in lithium for batteries.""Where significant deposits are to be found, such as in Africa, this could endanger geopolitical stability. This makes the economic migrations the U.N. warned of more likely.""There is a deal to be done at , but none without the agreement of the nations of Africa. The climate warnings we hear. We live them, but no one has the right to deny the advancement of our continent.""Yet unless the developed world wakes up, we run the risk of trying to fix the climate crisis with an energy crisis.""\l"

It is just this opportunity that FMDQ green exchange is embracing and creating by expanding green blue sustainability funding options as alternative options of funding for projects and assets not just in Lagos but across the African region. The Lagos State government believes that the launch of the green exchange will open up options especially unlocking sustainable investment opportunities for investors"", Sanwo-Olu said.Earlier, the Chief Executive Officer, FMDQ Group, Bola Onadele, said the group recognises the imperative role it plays in the Nigerian financial market and the opportunities its business represent in its ability to promote sustainable economic growth and development and, as such, understands that the delivery of long term business success, value creation and prosperity is not only hinged on financial but also environment and social performance.\l"

Insecurity in the north and elsewhere needs to be tackled head long. Insecurity is really affecting the growth of Nigeria's economy"", he said.Owokalade whose institute preaches corporate governance in all establishments to grow the economy, cited the example of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) assistance to agricultural sector in the north which was having impact but regrets that some of the farmers have abandoned the farms on insecurity, a situation which has pushed prices of crops high.Read also:COP26Owokalade announced the institute's plan to set up sectoral groups as one of the major initiatives to have a platform for members who are operating in various sectors of the economy to cross-ventilate ideas and also bring to bear the import of Corporate Governance best practices in all sectors.On the Ikoyi collapsed building, he commended the establishment of the six-man investigative panel by the Lagos State government and strongly believed that the committee will not abdicate professionalism on the platter of political support.

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria350","Technology and climate: in support of a pragmatic approach","February 3, 2022 Thursday","News Chronicle (Nigeria)","by Patrice Caine, CEO of ThalesI think it's time to take another look at some of the more common arguments in this debate, which sometimes overlook the role of human creativity in environmental protection.First, some people argue that technology cannot save the climate because it is precisely technology that got us into this rocky situation in the first place.The post-war period is engraved in our collective memory as a time of blind faith in technical progress, with all its promise of prosperity and social advancement and the hope of a brighter future. Today, we have a much more critical view of these years of growth and optimism, holding them responsible for creating an unsustainable, productivist society.""We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them,"" said Albert Einstein. So common sense should tell us to reject the technological utopia that some observers see as the root of all evil in the world.But this simplistic view overlooks one fundamentally important fact: technology is merely a tool that does what we want it to do.After the Second World War, all our efforts were focused on creating material wealth and embracing the return of abundance after years of painful privation. This was the path taken by all the major nations of the world, followed by their companies, universities, research institutes, and so on.Today, we are asking something quite different of our engineers and researchers. Technology has taken a new direction and is increasingly expected to be a driving force behind ecological transition. Look at satellite technologies, for example: without them we would never have been able to understand or monitor climate phenomena in as much detail as we can today.Image of North Africa and Spain taken by the Sentinel 3A satellite built by Thales Alenia Space for the European Space Agency. This type of satellite makes it possible to understand and measure the impact of climate change.\\xa0ESALook at the vast creative potential that researchers are unleashing in the search to make the world more sustainable. This is the case for two major pillars of the ecological transition that will be needed in the short and medium term, namely electrification (batteries, electric vehicles, solar energy, etc.) and optimised energy consumption (artificial intelligence and big data, recycling, eco-design, etc.). But more broadly, what we are witnessing today is an upsurge of sustainable innovation in a huge number of areas: the quest for new energy sources (low-carbon hydrogen, osmotic power, bioluminescence, marine energy, etc.), the transformation of agriculture (drones, low-nitrogen fertilisers, cultured meat, etc.), carbon capture and sequestration, and so on.Technological innovation today should not be confused with what it was yesterday, simply because it is not trying to solve the same problems.The second argument commonly advanced by the techno-pessimists is that time is running out and the technologies that could be useful are not yet mature.It is true that many promising solutions  carbon capture and even hydrogen, for example  are still at the development stage. But there is nothing intrinsically wrong with these technologies. There is simply a lack of political will. What the world needs today is massive government support for sustainable innovation so that these technologies can be developed at full scale more quickly.This is what is happening today with electric vehicles, which are already more cost efficient than diesel or petrol cars, and will soon be cheaper to buy as well. When that happens, the tide will turn and electric vehicles will have a huge impact on the CO2 emissions of the transport sector. They do raise environmental issues, but that is another debate.We need to act now to ensure that other appropriate technologies follow suit. It is encouraging to see world leaders signing up to the Breakthrough Agenda, which aims to make sustainable solutions more affordable and accessible than their conventional counterparts.There's no doubt we still have a long way to go, but the technologies are already there. We are not waiting for a miracle to happen  we just need to accelerate the development process.People also say that relying on technology to make the transition will consume vast quantities of energy and natural resources. Indeed it may seem contradictory to start a process of decarbonisation by building new infrastructure on a massive scale.From this point of view as well, the task ahead is colossal, in particular because electricity currently only accounts for 20% of the energy consumed by end-users worldwide. Increasing this proportion would require an enormous amount of production capacityThis may sound counter-intuitive. But it's important to weigh the costs against the benefits at the right scale.Let's take one example from Thales's aerospace business. We have designed a new system that connects the aircraft's flight management systems more closely with the air traffic management infrastructure. The new solution will inevitably require more energy, but our engineers believe it can reduce overall fuel consumption by at least 10% by 2023. That's a savings of more than 100 million tonnes of CO2 by 2040, and highly beneficial for the carbon footprint of the air transport sector as a whole.What works on a small scale will also work on a global scale. To see how useful a technology can be, you need to look at the big picture, not just the short-term effects.Lastly, people also say that counting on technology is too risky, and that it's a safer bet to reduce our consumption straight away by adopting radically different, more frugal lifestyles.Here again, it is not for me to judge which policies would be best, and there is probably a lot to be said for living more frugally. But for two main reasons, I do think we need to be wary of Malthusian reactions which could lead to drastic solutions.First, the economy cannot be treated in isolation: it is only part of the equation. If we stop growth, we erode our capacity to invest in research and development, which means we could never hope to develop low-carbon technologies. Ending growth would be just as risky as counting solely on low-carbon technologies to save the world. Because economic prosperity is not just a question of material comfort  for millions of people in poorer countries, it's a question of survival.Second, the difficulty of reaching an international consensus on climate action makes radical frugality on a global scale an [even more] illusory goal. Trying to follow that path would waste precious time in the race to adopt more moderate, more realistic solutions. When Thales started to disclose its carbon footprint just over 15 years ago, we set a precedent in our sector which has become standard practice today. At that time, environmental performance had very little to do with the company's attractiveness and reputation. Today, young people quite simply refuse to work for a company that doesn't share their values, and investors are more and more attentive to the extra-financial performance of the businesses they invest in.Thanks to the work of the IPCC and others, the facts are now established, information is widely available and ecological awareness is making real progress. Today it's time to act. And that means we need to be rational, inventive and above all pragmatic  three qualities that are in no short supply in the scientific and engineering community. We would be well advised to give them pride of place as we step up to the biggest challenge of the 21st century.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the United Nations body for assessing the science related to climate change.Distributed by\\xa0African Media Agency (AMA)\\xa0on behalf of Thales.The post Technology and climate: in support of a pragmatic approach appeared first on African Media Agency.Source : African Media Agency (AMA)\l"

Evidence suggests that one in five people faced hunger in Africa in 2020 \- more than double the proportion of any other region.Several factors account for the prevalence of hunger and undernourishment on the continent, notably demographic changes, and rapid urbanization.

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria356","IS NIGERIA READY FOR GLOBAL ENERGY TRANSITION BY 2025?","Nigerian Tribune"," ","IN 2017, Nigeria ratified the 2015 Paris Agreement, an international agreement adopted by 196 countries to combat the climate change crisis. The agreement adopted at the 21st United Nations (UN) conference of the parties, also known as COP21, saw countries' commitment to reducing global warming. They are required to make action plans in the form of commitments referred to as nationally determined contributions (NDCs). The idea is to communicate plans of how countries intend to reduce their carbon emissions and adapt to climate change. Nigeria, as part of its NDCs, committed to cutting its carbon emissions unconditionally by 20 per cent or conditionally by 45 per cent with international support by 2030. Other targets it set as part of its NDCs include: ending gas flaring by 2030, make for efficient gas generators, ensure 30 per cent energy efficiency by 2030 (2 per cent per year), among others. In March 2021, Nigeria revised its NDCs to include clean cooking as a way of ensuring conversion from cooking fuels such as kerosene and charcoal to eco-friendly cooking gas and efficient wood stoves. In view of this was the unveiling of the National Gas Expansion Programme and the National Autogas Roll-out Initiative which comprised three alternative fuels, LPG, CNG and LNG, as options for transportation, industrial and domestic use. The alternative fuel is aimed at affording Nigerians a cheaper, cleaner and eco-friendly energy option, with lesser impact on the environment. Prior to this, the country had developed policies as part of its climate action, including the Vision 20:2020 which identifies climate change as a threat to sustainable development and a potential catalyst for irrecoverable damage on Nigeria's natural resources, food production and infrastructure. Nigeria's economy, global energy transition threat Conference on Climate Change, several nations, including Nigeria, reaffirmed their commitment to the Paris Agreement 2015 and adopted climate change policies with a target to go carbon-neutral by 2050 or 2060. This implies that the usefulness of fossil fuels will diminish significantly, and even where they are still utilized, must be offset with some form of carbon capture technology. The reality of this is that Nigeria may need to do more in ensuring that it meets the target especially as the country's economy is heavily dependent on revenue from fossil fuel. Already, global organisations such as the African Development Bank (AFDB), World Bank and their likes have stopped funding fossil fuel projects. Also, 20 countries including the United States and Canada committed at the COP26 climate summit to stop public financing for fossil fuel projects abroad by the end of 2022, and instead steer their spending into clean energy instead. Some of the countries that signed the pledge include Denmark, Italy, Finland, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Gambia, New Zealand and the Marshall Islands, plus five development institutions including the European Investment Bank and the East African Development Bank. What this means is that the ability of industry players to access needed funds with which to bring assets into production and by extension, reduce government revenue ordinarily derivable from this extractive industry will be impacted. Nigeria whose source of revenue is heavily dependent on the oil and gas sector may now need to set realistic goals towards diversification. No doubt, revenue from the non-oil sector has been on the increase within the last few years. To corroborate this assertion, the Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo had at the Nigerian Society of Chemical Engineers (NSCHE) 51st Annual International Conference/AGM held recently in Lagos, said revenue recently flowing into the nation's treasury are majorly from non-oil and gas exports. Osinbajo, who spoke through the Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, said the Federal Government had worked assiduously to ensure that the country achieve economic diversification. 'Many countries in different continents are now preparing themselves to depend less on fossil fuels. 'Electric cars are found on roads and streets of many of the technologically developed countries of the world. 'This has sent a clear signal and a strong message that fossil fuels will not be as important as they are in years to come,' Osinbajo had said. FG makes over N12trn from non-oil sector in five years Data gathered from the Nigeria Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that between 2016 and 2020, the non-oil sector comprising telecommunications, agriculture, transportation, textile industries among several others, contributed over N12.2 trillion to the country's economy. The data showed that within the period being reviewed, there was a steady increase in income from the sector. For instance, the Year to Date income for 2016 was put at N1.8trillion, 2017 at N2.2 trillion, while 2018, 2019 and 2020 were N2.5 trillion, N2.7 trillion and N3 trillion respectively, with an average 12 per cent increase within the period. In November, 2021, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, said the country's non-oil revenue had risen by 15.7 per cent above the FG's targets to N1.15 trillion. Also, the recently published GDP report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that the sector grew by 5.44 per cent in real terms during the reference quarter (Q3 2021). The growth recorded in the sector was mainly driven by trade, Information and Communication (Telecommunication) followed by Financial and Insurance (Financial Institutions); Manufacturing (Food, Beverage and Tobacco); Agriculture (Crop Production); Transportation and Storage (Road Transport). Despite commitment to Paris Agreement, global transition worries FG 'Through the federal government has reaffirmed its commitment to meeting the set target on renewable clean energy and has various policies to this effect, it is still worried that the global shift may further shrink the income of other oil revenue-dependent countries. 'Already, the volatility of global crude prices, the cuts in OPEC quota, the proliferation of countries finding hydrocarbons and making the same available for exploitation via bid rounds have all impacted the demand for crude as well as the revenue and profits accruable from it. 'This suggests a new direction of travel for economies that heavily depend on fossil fuels that is fraught with steep challenges. If not well managed, one major risk is for such transition to unleash unintended yet harmful consequences on their populations, many of which already live in poverty or fragile contexts,' the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva said at the 2021 Africa Energy Futures held in Texas, United States (US) stated. He argued that a prompt reduction in fossil fuel revenue without sufficient time or support to manage macroeconomic risks and the structural transformation required to build diversified, sustainable and resilient economies, could have catastrophic social knock-on effects for millions of people. He noted that many fossil fuel-based economies, as a result of increasing populations, high levels of urbanisation and burgeoning energy demand are experiencing severe economic contractions and unsustainable levels of debt.Based on the Federal Government's position, it is rather safe to say that if something is not done, Nigeria may in a couple of years to come to be faced with the recession experienced in 2016 due to falling oil prices caused by an increased supply of oil from shale-producing countries like the US, Canada, and China. Also, the Federal Government had worried that the conversation around 'how' fossil fuel developing economies can undertake an orderly exit from fossil fuels, while safeguarding the rights and interests of their citizens is barely articulated in global discussions on climate change.

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria357","Race for investment dollars belongs to environment-conscious firms","Business Day"," ","The increasing scrutiny by investors and multilateral organisations on a company's environmental, social and governance risks before making investment decisions could reshape the global investment landscape, leaving behind companies that refuse to change, analysis shows.Current trends suggest that a company's environmental, social and governance (ESG) record as well as sustainability initiatives will play a critical role in whether it gets investments, secures government approvals and licences or even engages in international business.In corporate speak, ESG is a term that denotes a stakeholder-centric approach to doing business. Under the environment, a company commits that its operations would not harm the environment, would be socially responsible, for example, in the use of customer's data and uphold corporate governance principles including ensuring gender equality.Some of the world's biggest financiers and lenders say ESG now plays a critical role in their decision to spend investment dollars with many singling out environmentally conscious companies as deserving of their investment.""ESG principles inform the way we run our firm, approach investing and partner with the assets in our portfolio,"" said the world's largest private equity firm, Blackstone, in its 2021 ESG report.These private equity firms that largely source capital from institutional investors, such as pension funds, endowments and sovereign wealth funds are increasingly being pressured to fund environmentally responsible companies.Even pan-African multilateral development organisation, the African Finance Corporation, has also said it ""ensures that it carries out its lending, investment and advisory services to its clients and counterparties in a manner that is not negatively impactful on the environment and which ensures sustainable development.""A recent survey by a leading professional services firm, PwC Nigeria, found that investors are paying keener attention to ESG risks and opportunities facing companies they invest in and are ready to take action.The survey sought the views of 325 investment professionals from 43 territories. 53 percent were asset managers and 34 percent were analysts, and they had a combined $11.6 trillion assets under management.Nearly 80 percent of the respondents said ESG was an important factor in their investment decision making; almost 70 percent thought ESG factors should figure into executive compensation targets, and about 50 percent expressed willingness to divest from companies that did not take sufficient action on ESG issues.The results suggest that investors are torn between what they view as a responsibility to the planet and society and their fiduciary responsibilities to their clients.While three-quarters of the investors surveyed said they thought it was worth sacrificing short-term profitability to address ESG issues, about the same number said they would be willing to accept only 1 percentage point or less of a haircut on their investment returns.However, the reality is that pressure to factor climate and environmental concerns into investment decisions is building globally and could become a norm.Already, several financiers have indicated their unwillingness to lend to oil and gas projects around the world. At the COP26 Norway's $1.4 trillion Sovereign Wealth Fund says it has exited hundreds of companies in the past few years because they were not compliant with ESG targets.The European Union has proposed a rash of new laws to wean its economy off fossil fuels and could impose further tariffs that will impact businesses around the world including Africa.One contentious proposal is the introduction of a border carbon adjustment tax that would impose tariffs on the greenhouse gas emissions associated with products imported from outside the European Union. In effect, this would protect European companies from goods made in countries with less stringent climate policies.Some of the insights deduced from the PwC survey are that companies are better served if they embed ESG directly into their corporate strategy and investors are emphasising the importance of leadership from the top team, starting with the CEO to communicate clearly the ESG goals.However, companies need not go overboard proving they are compliant by inundating ""investors with reams of data just for the sake of more disclosure or to overreach and fall prey to ""green-washing"" critiques,"" noted the PwC analysts.\l"

This is one of the largest crop index insurance payouts ever on the African continent, amounting to US$2.4 million.""Most farmers in Malawi rely on rain-fed agriculture but with the surging effects of climate change, livelihoods are cyclically disrupted, and this fuels hunger,"" said Honorable Lobin C. Lowe, the Minister of Agriculture, present at the launch of the crop insurance payouts. ""Scaling up crop insurance can enhance people's capacity to anticipate and withstand shocks and mitigate their effects in the long run.""The Government of Malawi and a coalition of partners are empowering farming communities to manage their climate risks and reduce impacts of climate-related hazards. In the 2020-2021 farming season, farmers insured crops such as maize, sorghum, rice, groundnuts, pigeon peas and cotton to protect their incomes from harvest losses. Farmers accessed these policies through either paying a portion of their premium in cash or participating in building community assets such as wells, vegetable gardens and tree nurseries that help them withstand future weather shocks.""With the changing climate, farming can be an uncertain business in Malawi, especially for smallholder farmers. The recent drought saw farmers who usually harvest up to 15 bags of 50kg of maize now harvest only one bag,"" says Paul Turnbull, WFP Malawi Country Director and Representative.

He noted that from its inception, the GRI received a total of 29 ideas out of which three are being researched for the past year.Additionally, the Forum's official pointed out that the GECF Global Gas Outlook 2050, a flagship annual publication, now carries a dedicated Technology Advancement Scenario, amongst others, and opined that this scenario allows observers to gauge the direction and impact of technology on the global society.In the theme of science education and support to youth, Sentyurin recalled the efforts of his Secretariat to institute regular internships for qualified students, in addition to inviting young researchers and scientists to several of Forum's events. He highlighted the recently held 4th GECF Annual Workshop on Promotion of Natural Gas Demand, which had earmarked a dedicated session to young voices.GECF Secretary General emphasised cooperation with the Saint Petersburg Mining University (SPMU), a premier education institute of higher and post-graduate education for the oil and gas as well as mining specialists, which also houses the UNESCO International Centre for Competence in Mining Engineering Education. He suggested that a three-way GECF-UNESCO-SPMU collaboration will create common approaches to educational standards and implementation of joint projects.It should be noted that amongst the several priorities of UNESCO's mission are development in Africa and gender equality \- themes that resonate with the GECF. The Forum's active role in Africa has won it plaudits for advocating the cheaper, cleaner, and abundant natural gas for Africa's development trajectory. Meanwhile, the GECF's Secretariat in Doha, Qatar enjoys gender parity, and it is working towards influencing its member nations to reflect gender balance in the energy industry.The GECF-UNESCO MoU, signed in December 2020, seeks to bring the competencies of two organisations together in the areas of climate action, natural resources management, capacity-building, technical support, and sharing of expertise. In respect to 'Rigs-to-Reefs' concept as part of protecting biodiversity and the environment, being covered by the MoU, Sentyurin highlighted a Coral Management Programme being undertaken by GECF Member Country of Qatar on protecting coral reefs.The Secretary General invited UNESCO's Natural Science division to support efforts to standardise GHG emissions measurement, which is currently gnawing at the industry in the absence of a unified methodology.Summarising the discussion, the two sides agreed to work out the joint work plan for 2022 which will facilitate the directions of cooperation and specific projects.

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria375","African cities need climate-resilient infrastructure","Business Day"," ","In July this year, Lagos Island experienced some of its worst floods in recent years. Commuters were stuck in traffic, wading through knee-deep rainwater, past abandoned vehicles and businesses, as the city ground to a halt.This is not an unusual occurrence in Africa's largest megacity; reports of flooding in Lagos date back to at least 1947, with floods described as widespread in the 1970s1, and have in recent years risen in frequency and severity. This is partly because nearly 30% of Lagos state is covered by water and wetlands its low-lying position being less than two metres above sea level and heightening the city's exposure to coastal and fluvial floods. Additionally, poorly planned and maintained infrastructure leaves Lagos exposed to the elements.One of the most pervasive truths of the climate crisis is that it hits lower-income households and communities in precarious or informal settlements in the severest ways. Transnational corporations and large firms can manage the impact of natural hazards with the help of insurance plans, but recovery from flooding is much more challenging for poor and marginalised segments of society.Beyond the destruction of properties and disruption to businesses, climate change affects all of society, exacerbating conflicts, affecting health, and impeding sustainable growth. For example, during floods in Lagos, drainage carrying raw sewage and solid waste overflows in many areas, polluting water sources and often causing the spread of water-borne diseases.Read Also: ""post-titleClimate change may sink Africa deeper into poverty, conflict World BankThe economic implications are multifaceted, with the total economic loss across the state estimated at US$4 billion a year the equivalent of 4.1% of the state's GDP or 1% of national GDP due to flooding alone.Even as world leaders gather for the UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow, the impact of climate change is already accelerating in Nigeria and across many African nations. study conducted by the UK Government documents Nigeria's escalating cost of climate change activities, estimating a minimum loss of N38trillion (about US$100 billion) annually by 2050. This raises an unequivocal call to reimagine Lagos' infrastructure increasing focus on how climate-resilient infrastructure can boost the productivity of one of the fastest-growing cities in the world.The planned construction of an 8.5km structural defence from the coast known as the Great Wall of Lagos', designed by Royal Haskoning, is expected to shield Victoria Island and Eko Atlantic from flooding. This is one of Nigeria's most visible and anticipated interventions to counter coastal flooding but this is not enough.Strategic high-impact urban infrastructure is imperativeIn cities like Lagos, we need to think water first' when reimagining infrastructure. To sustainably overcome legacy issues such as water and waste pollution, congested streets, and gridlocked traffic, we need to combine innovative climate-smart solutions and infrastructure to help upgrade the quality of life, the environment and stimulate progressive industries.round-breaking projects are gaining ground in the market. Water transport is an emerging industry in Lagos that uses waterways to get customers across the city quickly. Unfortunately, waterways are substantially under-utilised; therefore, a government agency with a mandate to develop water transportation, Lagos State Waterways Authority (LASWA), is exploring efforts to license new operators of safe and standardised boats for water transit. LASWA is also building jetties to boost the number of passengers. Success will however be contingent on LASWA's ability to secure investments that improve accessibility and mobility for local communities.Further afield, 50 of Lucid Energy's Lucid Pipes have been installed in the City of Portland in Oregon, United States. The micro-hydropower technology generates electricity from drinking water networks using specially designed in-pipe turbines and now produces 1,100MWh of electricity annually enough to power roughly 150 homes.This is one example illustrating the opportunity for adopting innovative technology to a specific context, to help overcome seemingly insurmountable infrastructure challenges, particularly in cities that are vulnerable to climate change. However, embedding innovative infrastructure technologies in African cities requires investment instruments that support nascent markets and build more inclusive and sustainable economies.A new wave of financeWith financing of the water sectors majorly sourced from the public sector, the water infrastructure gap is the greatest among any infrastructure sector across the continent, costing US$56-66 billion per year.4 Due to funding requirements and general perceptions of high risk, the private sector has not been prepared to invest in many projects over the years.By reimagining Nigeria's water infrastructure challenge, impact investors with catalytic capital, such as CDC Group, can play a progressive role in developing financial models and risk management strategies to support profitable investments for commercial partners.Detailed financial modelling considering key factors such as material selection, contractor selection, and technology adoption is required to analyse the cost-benefit of implementing these sustainability measures into project design and delivery. Succeeding at this could make Nigeria an example of engineering policy and practices that improve the conditions for creating and maintaining sustainable infrastructure.Kinetic and Greenovate are just two recent CDC initiatives that can help tackle the challenges associated with climate change and catalyse transformational impact in Nigeria. Kinetic can help deliver climate-focused funding to support novel technological solutions in cases where commercial investors may otherwise hesitate to invest. While the Greenovate project finance instrument can offer flexible funding in priority sectors such as new clean energy technologies, water access, sanitation, and hygiene.Even as world leaders gather for the UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow, the impact of climate change is already accelerating in Nigeria and across many African nations. Now is the time to put words into action and place climate resilience at the core of Nigeria's development ambition.In facing this great climate challenge, Nigeria can be defined by its ability to adapt infrastructure, businesses, jobs, and communities to the changes occurring throughout the environment. Achieving these objectives necessitates a purposeful, holistic and commercially viable investment strategy that includes local stakeholders, industry initiatives, technology transfer, and resolute infrastructure and environment policies.We must act on solutions that fortify the country's development plan to build an optimised and inclusive quality of life for Nigerians creating, inclusive sustainable and productive economic prosperity for all.denuga, is the head of Office and coverage nirector, Nigeria, CDC Group\l"
"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria376","These are commitments made by Nigeria ahead of COP 26","Business Day"," ","Mohammad Abubakar, Nigeria's minister of environment will lead the country's delegation to the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP26 holding in Glasgow, Scotland from October 31 to November 12.Ahead of this global event, the Nigerian government, like other countries have made commitments towards reducing Green House Gas (GHG) emissions and has also increased its conditional contribution.In June, the Nigerian government submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (referred to as the UNFCCC or the Convention), its updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDCs) which are national commitments. The UNFCCC provides the foundation for multilateral action to combat climate change and its impacts on humanity and ecosystems.Under Nigeria's updated NDC, it committed to unconditional contribution of 20 percent below business-as-usual by 2030 and a 47% percent contribution conditional on international support. A 47 percent conditional contribution of around 100 million tonnes CO2-equivalent (MtCO2e) below current (2018) levels is consistent with a global 1.5oC pathway.The government said that committing to this level of climate ambition in the face of lower-than-expected economic growth represents a significant enhancement, as it will result in substantially lower absolute GHG emissions than stated in the 2015 NDC.The country has updated the base year for the GHG assessment from 2010 to 2018. The total emissions of greenhouse gases estimated between 2010 and 2018 range between 247 million tonnes CO2-equivalent (MtCO2e) emissions in 2010 and 347 MtCO2e in 2018.Economic sectors emission indexThe energy sector was the largest source of GHG emissions with 209 MtCO2e emitted in 2018 (60 percent of total emissions). Fugitive emissions from oil and gas are the largest contributor to overall energy sector emissions (36 percent of total energy sector emissions in 2018), followed by transport, electricity generation (grid and off-grid), and residential and industrial energy consumption.Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) is the second-largest contributor to total GHG emissions, contributing approximately 25 percent of national GHG emissions in 2018, followed by waste (9 percent), and Industrial Processes and Other Product Use (IPPU) (5 percent).Read also:Ahead of COP26, gas producers urged to cut methane emissionsHow 2015 NDCs compare with updated versionThe 2015 NDC covered emissions for three greenhouse gases: CO2, C and N2O.

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria381","ANALYSIS: As AU turns 20, it must speak with one voice","January 10, 2022 Monday","Premium Times","Nigeria, Jan. 10 -- The African Union (AU) will mark its 20th anniversary in 2022, and as pressure to perform better increases, the upcoming heads of state summit from February 5 to 6 will be crucial. Following the election of two commissioners in October 2021, the new AU Commission is now fully operational and must show progress on implementing long-running reforms.The AU's leadership in addressing COVID-19 came into focus again at the end of 2021. After the Omicron variant's discovery, travel restrictions inflicted on several Southern African countries saw African governments, activists, and citizens looking to the AU for a response. The continent was being punished for transparency, while Omicron rapidly spread worldwide.The Africa Centres for Disease Control (Africa CDC), the AU vaccine acquisition task team led by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, and the AU's vaccine delivery task team have been applauded for their work. Yet the continent still is not sufficiently vocal and united to speak with one voice against unfair treatment.Apart from in a select few countries, far too few vaccines are available for Africa. By January 5, only 9.5 per cent of Africans had been vaccinated, according to the Africa CDC. This is expected to be a major theme of the February summit.A common African position is also needed on the climate debate. The continent's foreign affairs ministers stressed the importance of this at the executive council meeting in October 2021. While some progress was made at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow a month later, African states should present a united front at this year's November COP in Egypt.There, the AU needs to change the perception of Africa as a climate change victim. Instead, the focus must be on the continent's contribution to cleaner energy by, for example, producing key minerals to spearhead new technology. The rainforests of the Congo Basin and other parts of the continent are also crucial sources of CO&#178; emissions needed to reach the global goal of net-zero emissions.Several conflict flashpoints are also expected to be on the February summit agenda - if not formally then in the corridors, if the meeting doesn't take place virtually. Among the most pressing is the conflict in Ethiopia, which has plunged the host of the AU into crisis and political uncertainty. Mediation by AU envoy, former Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo, has been unsuccessful. Finding a peaceful solution will be a crucial test for the AU.The rise in unconstitutional changes of government and the threat of terrorism will also probably be discussed. The AU's newly constituted Political Affairs, Peace and Security department needs to show member states what it has achieved and how the AU reform process ultimately serves citizens' interests. The controversial decision by AU Commission chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat to grant observer status to Israel will also be on the agenda.During the summit, the 15 new members of the Peace and Security Council (PSC) will be elected - five positions for the three-year seats and 10 for the two-year seats. Each of Africa's five regions chooses candidates using its preferred methods. Nigeria - the only country that's been a council member uninterruptedly since the PSC's creation - is expected to remain. This complete renewal of members could see the emergence of new dynamics in the continent's premier peace and security body.A final decision is also needed on the AU Peace Fund, which has more than $230 million thanks to contributions by member states. Despite the urgency of achieving peace and security on the continent, there have been delays in establishing modalities and criteria for disbursements. The management of the fund must be resolved.At the October 2021 executive council meeting, ministers approved an overall AU Commission budget for 2022 of just over $650 million. This comprises $176 million for operations, US$195 million for programmes and $279 million for peace support. International partners are expected to fund 66 per cent of the budget and member states 31 per cent. The remaining 3 per cent will come from the administrative and maintenance reserve funds.Ministers commended member states for contributing 72 per cent of 2021's regular budget (operations and programmes). This is, however, far from the AU's goal of self-financing its total regular budget and at least 75 per cent of its programme budget, which is still fully funded by partners.For years, states have been reluctant to name and shame those who do not pay their dues. Now the AU has decided to accept submissions for delays and payment plans to clear arrears. Fourteen countries received 'cautionary sanctions' for not paying at least 50 per cent of their 2021 fees.As part of the effort to ensure full member state payments, ministers and ambassadors in Addis Ababa are insisting that the AU Commission and AU organs eradicate corruption and irregular expenditure. For example, before receiving new funds, AU organs will have to show that recommendations of previous audit reports have been taken on board.The AU theme for 2022 is 'Building resilience in nutrition on the African continent: Accelerate the human capital, social and economic development.' This expands on previous AU decisions such as those establishing an African task force on food and nutritional development and an Africa regional nutrition strategy (2016 to 2025).Across the continent, the COVID-19 pandemic has compounded an already dire situation of food insecurity and malnutrition. While child mortality rates in Africa dropped dramatically from 106 per 1 000 births in 1990 to 51.7 in 2019, undernutrition is still a major cause of child death.The AU, chaired by Senegal this year, can use its 2022 theme to emphasise the importance of linking agricultural production and food security to health and nutrition. In doing so, it's crucial that efforts by other continental bodies are not duplicated and that this statement of intent goes beyond mere meetings and events.PSC Report, Institute for Security Studies(This article was first published by ISS Today, a Premium Times syndication partner.

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria382","Nigeria's agric growth slows to lowest in 3yrs","Business Day"," ","Despite efforts targeted at boosting food production, Nigeria's agricultural growth has slowed to 1.22 percent in the third quarter of 2021 the lowest since second quarter of 2018, according to data from the country's GDP report.The sector grew by 1.22percent in the third quarter of 2021, lower by 0.17 percent when compared to the corresponding period in 2020 and 0.08percent from the preceding quarter.Stakeholders in the sector have attributed the steady slowed growth to worsening issues of terrorism, banditry, kidnapping that have continued to obstruct farming activities.They also said that the high cost of key inputs seeds, fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides among others has forced many to cut down on their production areas.fricanFarmer Mogaji, chief executive officer, X-Ray Consulting said that slowed growth rate in the sector is due to the government's inability to address issues that continue to limit production.He noted that the federal government is yet to resolve insecurity issues that have deterred lots of farmers from farming as many have abandoned their farmlands for safety.""This is the major reason why food prices are increasing. Look at the price of beans, it has gone up by almost 300percent because Borno is the major producing state and insecurity has crippled farm activities there,"" he said.Read also:COP26However, he stated that the sector might stop recording growth if the government fails to address issues of insecurity.He called on the government to provide more incentives to farmers while driving mechanisation and irrigation farming.""Prices of food are escalating and it is important we drive down cost. To do this farmers must make mechanisation and innovation the centre of farming methods as well as addressing security concerns as it is critical in boosting productivity and maximising cost,"" he said.The average prices of all staple foods across major cities in the country have surged by over 200percent in the last year and are not in any way showing signs of slowing down.Although the country's inflation figures in October slowed to 15.99percent, analysts questioned the rate, saying it does not truly reflect market realities.The country's poultry industry has come under tremendous pressure over the last 20 months as farmers suffer severe losses owing to the scarcity of grains and escalating prices.The situation is taking a heavy toll on poultry farmers as many have shut down their farms while others are slaughtering less weighty chickens to deal with the surging price of maize and soybeans key inputs accounting for most of its feed costs.Similarly, Suleiman Ladan, lecturer at the Department of Basic and Applied Sciences, Hassan Usman Katsina Polytechnic, Katsina said that the current insecurity situation had significant implications for the country.""Bandits and kidnapping have made farming almost impossible in major agricultural producing areas,"" Ladan said.\l"
"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria383","In 2021, We Added $2.9 Billion in New Climate Finance, Green Climate Fund Chief Says","December 24, 2021 Friday","News Chronicle (Nigeria)","Executive Director of Green Climate Fund (GCF), Yannick Glemarec, says the climate portfolio of the Fund grew by 40% this 2021, adding $2.9 billion in new climate finance.''Our portfolio now totals $10 billion in GCF resources, amounting to $37 billion in climate assets under management'', he said in a thank you message to the Fund's partners.GCF\\xa0was created to support the efforts of developing countries in responding to the challenge of climate change.The rest of the message goes thus: ''2021 was a year when the world needed GCF more than ever, and I am proud that we have risen to the challenge, just when it has been critical for us to do so. Our role is not just to channel climate finance to developing countries, but to do so in a way that drives a paradigm shift towards low-emission, climate-resilient development. For that we need scale, we need efficient delivery, and most of all, we need a transformational approach. On all these measures, I am proud to say that GCF has delivered this year.''These funds are spread across 190 projects and programmes, equally targeting adaptation and mitigation action. And almost two-thirds of our adaptation funding goes to the most vulnerable countries: Least Developed Countries, Small Island Developing States, and African states.''Alongside this huge volume of new climate finance, we have also been able to speed up our delivery to developing countries. GCF has now disbursed a cumulative $2.3 billion for adaptation and mitigation action in developing countries, exceeding our target for the year, and increasing the total disbursements made over the lifetime of GCF by 64% since the end of 2020.''We are also reducing the time taken between project approvals by our Board and the disbursement of funds on the ground. Thanks to greater operational efficiencies, we have halved the average time taken between these two milestones, from an average of 15-19 months in 2018, down to 7-10 months for projects approved in 2021.''More programming and more rapid delivery of resources are essential, but that alone is not enough to drive the paradigm shift we need. GCF has a clear, four-pronged strategy to drive such a transformation, and we have further refined our approach this year to deliver real change.''First, we are helping nurture a supportive climate regulatory environment and public support in developing countries. In response to the COVID-19 economic shock, we have leveraged our capacity-building Readiness programme to support developing countries' efforts to craft climate-compatible economic stimulus measures and explore innovative financing instruments to finance them without increasing their debt burden.''Second, GCF's investments are also accelerating innovation, providing early-stage financing to climate innovators to pilot new climate solutions. One example this year is our new $279 million investment in the Amazon Bioeconomy Fund to support new bio-businesses across six Latin American countries to reduce emissions and enhance climate resilience.''Third, we are de-risking\\xa0the first deployment of new climate solutions at scale. As part of our efforts to make blended finance work better for the most vulnerable, for adaptation and for ecosystem-based approaches, our Board approved the Global Fund for Coral Reefs this year.''This $500 million blended finance vehicle will leverage up to $3 billion in private investment for coral reef conservation and restoration in developing countries. It will offer critical risk equity capital, debt swap schemes, and grant funding to deliver exciting and impactful coral reef projects.''And finally, we are\\xa0strengthening domestic financial institutions to support the widespread adoption of commercially proven new climate solutions in developing countries. In 2021 we have worked with Jamaica to establish the first Caribbean exchange for green bonds to finance net-zero, climate-resilient infrastructure in the Caribbean region.''As we prepare to mark the end of 2021 and enter a New Year, I would send my sincere thanks to all our partners for your contributions this year to the fight against climate change. The Green Climate Fund is a partnership organisation, and we can only achieve our ambitious mandate with the support of all our partners, including Accredited Entities, delivery partners, Civil Society Organisations, and of course our developing country partners.''The momentum around COP26 last month has kept opened our window of opportunity to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. I hope that this year has also delivered a sobering realisation that there is no further time to lose to reach the ambitions of the Paris Agreement. If the increasingly ominous scientific reports were not enough, in 2021 we have also witnessed a series of devastating extreme weather events that risk becoming increasingly common in the years to come.''It may be difficult to remain optimistic in the face of these signs of climate breakdown, coupled with another wave of COVID-19. But we know that the societal transformation we need for our climate can also deliver inclusive economic recovery from the pandemic. The solution is the same. A climate-resilient recovery must be our top priority for 2022.''\l"
"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria384","Germany backs Naija Climate Now","The Nation (Nigeria)"," ","The German government, through the Consulate General Federal Republic of Germany in Lagos, has joined Creative Youth Community Development Initiative (CYCDI) - Solution17 for Climate Action and the United Nations Information Centre for Nigeria (UNIC) to promote Climate Change Adaptation as a build-up to the crucial COP26 - UN Climate Change Conference, holding in Glasgow between November 1 and 12.The Campaign tagged #NaijaClimateNow, which began in June 2021, is currently calling for doers, creators, innovators, scientists, students, youths, and entrepreneurs to design and implement solutions towards Climate Change Adaptation in Nigeria through tech-driven sustainable businesses and projects in climate smart agriculture, eco-friendly growers, waste to wealth, food processing programme, food preservation and others.The registration, which was originally closed on July31, was extended to August 31 to allow wider registration and submission of solutions in the six geopolitical zones of Nigeria.According to Foluke Michael, Project Director of CYCDI - Solution17 for Climate Action, the project was designed to cushion the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent a climate crisis. Solution17 for Climate Action has embarked on massive climate adaptation projects through Green Recovery to build back better in Lagos and Nigeria. Naija Climate Now was launched to support green businesses in climate smart agriculture, food processing, water resources, product value chain, tech for climate, biodiversity protection, and others.The support from the government of Germany will help promote the Green Entrepreneurs to champion Green Recovery in Lagos and across other Nigeria states. It will also cover the training of 34 Finalists, Incentives for growers and some equipment to support climate action enterprises beyond the project life cycle.COVID-19 and impact on the economyThe impact of COVID-19 has resulted in an enormous economic loss. This is aside the constant devaluation of the naira and massive insecurity that has caused shortage of food supply across Nigeria.The rate of poverty has drastically increased in Nigeria. Households have lost about one-quarter of their incomes, and over 17 million people were added to the poverty class in the country. Also, Lagos State has witnessed a 3.44percent growth rate, with over 20percent vulnerable to poverty.Impact of climate change on the economyAgriculture is the key source of food in Nigeria, and it employs over 70 percent of the country's labour force and contributes up to 40 percent of its national economy. Nigeria is exposed to a range of climate conditions and extreme weather events. One of the important ways climate change affects development and livelihood in Nigeria is through its impact on agriculture.The impact of climate change has become more extreme in recent times, leading to the loss of land resources, low agricultural productivity, food scarcity and economic hardship, and also fueling herder-farmer violence in the south.Extreme climate events like flooding, drought, and extreme temperatures have resulted in soil degradation, which has led to low crop yields for most small-scale farmers. When food systems are supplied by rain-fed agriculture, even moderate rainfall patterns can substantially negatively impact productivity and food security.Naija Climate NowWith registration now extended to 31 August 2021 from its earlier 31 July 2021 date, 'the project will welcome applications from anyone under 35 years old in Nigeria who has ideas or solutions. Submission can either be by individuals or teams. All eligible entrants must apply onl"
"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria385","COP 26, Africa and the Imperative for Energy Transitioning, By Dakuku Peterside","November 9, 2021 Tuesday","Premium Times","Nigeria, Nov. 9 -- Elementary leadership lesson highlights that today's decisions shape tomorrow's future. It is only those meant for the destruction that will not pay heed to this all-time truth. This aphorism aptly captures the mood of the country as the world gathered recently in Glasgow, Scotland, to discuss climate change and the future - a future that depends directly on activities within and outside the frontiers of our immediate ecosystem and biosystem.We witness climatic chaos that impacts different parts of the world irrespective of who was most culpable in emitting the greenhouse gas or more carbon compliant. Nature sees the globe as one; hence the impact of pollution and carbon dioxide in faraway Asia may have a devastating effect in Africa and vice versa.It is a fact that climate change is impacting communities in every country in different dimensions. It causes rising sea levels, coastal erosion, extreme weather events, disrupted economies, food and water scarcity, insecurity because of resource scarcity, and conflict and terrorism.These are all manifestations of this global challenge. Undoubtedly, the world needs urgent action, new partnerships, and ambitious ideas to tackle this challenge. Any meaningful solution must be international in approach. Little wonder global leaders gathered in Glasgow to negotiate and strategise on how to achieve net-zero emission soon.In the imaginary hall in Glasgow, there were four classes of countries represented. The first is the developed countries, the post-industrial economies, who are entitled to be preaching the gospel of net zero-emission, and 1.5C temperature goals. The second group of nations are those who were in Glasgow for showmanship to register their presence. The third group of countries are those whose national economic interests will be impacted by the actions or inactions of post-industrial economies in pursuit of climate change objectives. The fourth group are those who, in pursuit of their national economic interest, are resisting the mitigation measures prescribed by the West against the harmful effect of climate change or are unenthusiastic about the narrow Western definition of climate change mitigation.Based on signals coming from Abuja, Nigeria seems to belong to the third group. It runs a mono-product economy heavily dependent on fossil fuel and rent-seeking on other natural resources, which the world is clamouring to reduce or eliminate in favour of clean and renewable energy sources. It may be counterintuitive for Nigeria to champion 1.5C and zero-emission goals, given that it may not be in its national interest, at least in the interim. The importance of national interest and the various divergent positions of different countries in the discussions at Glasgow shows the contradictions and conundrums the world faces in dealing with carbon emission and energy production issues, which is why COP26 could not arrive at a consensus on crucial issues.The post-industrial nations took the position of an immediate and severe shift in energy production and usage from carbon to renewable and clean. This position is understandable because these nations historically used carbon energy to fuel their industrialisation and have mostly moved to a knowledge economy and have the financial and technological muscle to champion green energy and the economic opportunities therein. The new emerging energy giants (Kuwait, Qatar, UAE, and Saudi Arabia) have a different position which primarily is a call to be given more time to power a new economic renaissance based on exploiting carbon energy and using it to transition into a knowledge economy less reliant on carbon energy and more reliant on technology and innovation.The developing countries that are heavily reliant on carbon fuel for primary substances have a different position altogether. Although not wholly condemning a shift from carbon to clean energy sources, we are calling for the developed countries to assist them to make such a transition. President Buhari, in his speech at the conference, emphasised this position. He pledged that Nigeria would cut its emissions to net-zero by 2060 but argued, however, that ""attaining national and global climate change goals will require adequate and sustained technical and financial support to developing countries. And that developed countries should channel greater effort towards assisting developing nations to meet their ""Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) commitments through the pledges made by the developed countries to provide at least $100 billion yearly."" China and Russia seem not enthusiastic about climate change and are struggling to lead in these discussions and participate actively.Leaders from developed economies have made various pledges to show their commitment to achieving the 1.5C temperature goal, and they are calling on other leaders to work together to accelerate the innovation and deployment of clean technologies needed to keep the 1.5degC goals within reach so that they are accessible and affordable for all. Most of the leaders set out the ambitious actions they are taking domestically and internationally and send a clear message to all stakeholders to accelerate urgent action this decade. They set out a positive vision for a clean, green future and its benefits, including creating new jobs and global growth. However, where does it leave developing countries, especially in Africa? What is Nigeria's national interest in switching to carbon- free, renewable, and clean energy forms given our abundance of fossil fuel and gas deposits and our reliance on them for national development?The case of developing countries is unique. Africa claims that it is contributing less to carbon emission in the world given its low level of industrial activities. But Africa presents an even more unique stance. Africa has a net disadvantage in climate change because it suffers more than it contributes to the problem. Compared with developed countries, the whole of Africa does not emit as much greenhouse as some major industrial countries or industrial blocs of the world. Therefore, African countries must articulate a better strategy in dealing with the global issue of climate change and greenhouse emissions that will help it grow and not be disadvantageous in the long run. Therefore, I propose the following: First, African countries will mostly need to continue exploiting fossil fuel for consumption and sales to grow their economies into industrialised or knowledge economies. Any power bloc should not harangue Africa to take actions detrimental to its growth. They should avoid any quick and dangerous shift to cleaner energy unless the structures and systems that will facilitate such transition smoothly are in place. The consequences of a wrong move may be dire and catastrophic given the poor state of the African economy now hugely dependent on carbon energy. Proper research and planning are needed to understand and articulate a more robust approach to such a transition that will have little or no consequences to our economy and way of life.Second, for African economies to leapfrog to carbon neutrality and zero-emission effectively, they will need new technologies, know- how, and economic imperatives to make such a move. Therefore, Africa should be demanding technological transfer in green, clean, and renewable energy as part of these negotiations. The developed countries must be ready to provide that. They must not be preaching to Africa to take a leap of faith and transit to carbon-free energy whilst hiding the technology and milking Africa from using such technology. It will be tantamount to a double standard. It is like asking someone to do deep-sea diving he does not need, only to come back to ask him to buy swimming gadgets at an exorbitant price from you.Third, commensurate incentives for investment in a carbon-neutral economy for African economies need to compensate for the loss of investment in fossil fuels. If the developed economies want to save the planet for future generations, they may need to pay the bill for leapfrogging African economies to carbon neutrality. It is noteworthy that $100b has been earmarked yearly to facilitate the achievement of the 1.5C goal. This action is commendable, but this amount is a drop in the ocean compared to what is needed to make the transition easier for Africa. There is a need to continuously increase the funds and get nations that contribute to more CO2 emissions to pay more.Finally, Africa must be made to benefit extensively from the economic opportunities inherent in the transition to clean and renewable energy. Future economies will be built on new energy forms. The way we live our lives will change forever. New jobs, new ideas, new ways of working, new gadgets and technologies will come up. The renewable energy technology may not completely replace carbon energy and its technology. They are more likely to coexist together with carbon energy technology and usage reduced to the barest minimum. Africa must be positioned to benefit from the energy mix of the future and not play catch up to the rest of the world.However, Nigeria needs to adequately articulate its national interest and modus operandi in engaging with the rest of the world inrenewable energy, climate change and their economic implications. In his speech at COP26, President Buhari hinted at the broader scope of Nigeria's stance and approach in dealing with these issues. I commend him for such leadership in such an important issue. His pledge of net-zero carbon emission by 2060 gave Nigeria a 40 year gap to plan and put its acts together. Therefore, Nigeria can strategise to increase exploration and exploitation of fossil fuel in the short run to position itself economically to cut down carbon emission and dependence on fossil fuel at the appropriate time. Recently, Nigeria has been preoccupied with preventing millions of its citizens struggling with rising cost of petrol and gas from not resorting to charcoal and firewood, which means fewer trees, deforestation and more carbon offloading. It shows that Nigeria is not ready yet to deal aggressively with clean energy and climate change issues.Nigeria and the rest of the world are on different pages at COP26. The next ten years will be critical for Nigeria as the world increases its pace towards clean energy. The world is pushing towards zero- emission while Nigeria is still battling to decide on what to do with gas flaring and gas resources generally. The world is creating a new model of economic prosperity, but Nigeria has not even optimised the old model much more, positioning itself to benefit from the recent economic model. It is time we got ready to face the future. The decisions we make today will shape tomorrow and the future.I implore the government to take the issues of energy transition and the concomitant implications seriously. I call on the government and research institutes to invest in research in this area focussing on Nigeria and how it must navigate the turbulent waters of global energy shift from carbon to clean energy. Products of the study should guide the government in its plans and policies in this regard. I will suggest the government sets up a think tank of appropriate professionals to keep abreast of developments in this critical energy area and advise the government accordingly.We need a cross-ministerial collaboration among the relevant ministries and Industry to start working at coming up with ways of achieving the 2060 net-zero carbon emission pledged by the President and put Nigeria in a position to benefit fully from the new global energy economy devoid of carbon emission and delivers for the climate and the people, economic development, and biodiversity. The crux of Nigeria national interest in this energy issue is to work collaboratively with others in the comity of nations to keep the 1.5degC temperature and carbon emission goals in sight whilst supporting sustainable livelihoods and meeting shared promises on adaptation and finance of its people and economy.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Premium Times.

We at the Federal have to wait for the steps taken by the states, and we have to allow the system to work.""We can't impose ideas on them. Federal Government has to wait for the reaction of the states.""On the recent removal of Nigeria from the watchlist of countries violating religious freedom, which Blinken said was ""based on facts,"" the President expressed the country's appreciation, noting that there was freedom of worship in Nigeria, and no one is discriminated against based on his or her faith.He said education is a priority in the country, ""because when you educate a people, there are certain levels they will not fall below.""The President equally appreciated the United States of America for allowing Nigeria to procure military hardware to fight terrorism in the country, and for the training given to the Nigerian military.""It's helping us to stabilize the situation in the Northeast, and we've made a lot of progress since 2015.

We are a developing economy, they must talk to our program,"" Mantashe said.Mantashe has repeatedly stressed the security of power supply as his priority, promoting coal, nuclear, and gas as sources of generation to replace old coal-fired plants. South Africa is being subjected to a record year of blackouts, which are implemented to prevent a total collapse of the grid when the state power utility cannot meet demand.""Rushing into renewables at the expense of coal can have adverse consequences, such as the power outages currently being seen in China, India, and the UK,"" Mantashe said.South Africa is the world's 12th-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, with wind and solar energy currently accounting for only about 6% of supply and coal more than 80percent.Read also:ARM-Harith launches $250m Urban Climate Fund for West AfricaThe energy minister had skipped a meeting in September with climate envoys from the United Kingdom, United States, Germany, France, and the European Union, where an initial amount of almost N2,250billion ($5 bn) in concessional loans and grants was discussed.South Africa's environment and public enterprises ministers attended the talks, as did the deputy finance minister.The envoys aim to reach an emissions-reduction deal with South Africa that could be announced at the United Nations Climate Change Conference known as Conference of the Parties (COP26), climate talks that begin in Glasgow later this month and serve as a model for other countries seeking to transition to green energy.The minister's attitude is seen as putting him at odds with Cyril Ramaphosa, the South African President who in a letter to the nation this week spoke of the need to cut emissions and win climate aid. The consequences of not doing so will ultimately harm South Africa's ability to trade, as tariffs could be imposed on carbon-heavy goods, the president said.Mantashe defended the country's 2019 energy blueprint, which allows for the development of 1 500 megawatts of new coal capacity.

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria390","External debts and debt forgiveness entitlement","November 14, 2021 Sunday","The Punch","Sheriffdeen Tella Published 15 November 2021It is difficult to stop talking about Nigeria's debt, particularly external debts. It is a major source of our underdevelopment contrary to the belief in government circles. It is a catalyst in the corruption equation and should be part of the explanatory variables, like corruption, in economic models of growth in Nigeria and even Africa. A friend confided in me that anytime he heard that Nigeria had gone to the loan market again he finds it difficult to sleep deeply at night. He always has that fear that the country is going bankrupt, if not already in the debt trap and some countries could come to colonise us for our inability to pay our debts. I always have the same feeling of sleeplessness but not because of colonisation as our oil income, which is our soul, is already colonised. My own problem has to do with the uncertain future our children will live in; the future without oil, without gas, the e-world and the world without compassion from the wealthy countries. When you see countries like China and Russia walking away from such an important conference on climate change, the recently concluded ""26th Conference of the Parties,"" or COP26, one can imagine what the future of such gatherings will be like.African leaders would claim that Africa countries are generating the lowest carbon monoxide and should be compensated. Is it the fault of the industrialised countries that we are generating the lowest or do we do so deliberately because of concern for humanity? No, sub-Saharan Africa is generating the lowest because we are underdeveloped or not industrialised, which is not their fault. If we are also capable of generating much more because we are industrialised and can cause serious damage to the world's ecosystem, they would listen. They do listen to South Africa because she is a major contributor to gas emissions in the world and received financial support from international organisations to encourage her to cut down on emissions. Leaders of developing and highly indebted countries may feel they are attending all those international conferences like the United Nations General Assembly and the COP26 as equal partners but they should know that nobody outside their circles takes them seriously. There is hardly any remarkable response to African leaders' demands, in particular, at such fora. I suspect that part of such reactions from leading countries is based on the kind of dependent economy they all run and the fact that leaders of these highly indebted countries are big customers with illicit funds in various banks abroad. Thus, they can only bark.Unfortunately for citizens of the highly indebted countries, including Nigeria, they are just pawns on the chessboard of international relations. I was in a gathering where we were discussing issues raised by African presidents at the UNGA meeting and a friend felt impressed with the position of our President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), calling for debt forgiveness. In the typical Nigerian way, my friend prayed that God should soften the hearts of our creditors to cancel the debts so that we can have some reprieve for development to take place. But, the debts were initially contracted to promote development, so why should there be forgiveness if it had been applied properly or had not been mismanaged, misapplied or misused? Was God brought into the picture when the loans were being contracted or is there evidence that God approved of it? I asked my friend if there was any response to the president's speech on debt forgiveness. Of course, there was none. The gathering was used to such requests and even expected them. They must have made up their minds not to respond to such superfluous requests at any time and in any forum.Since the coalition of debtors' clubs in the 1980s, championed by the Latin American group with debt forgiveness success, many developing countries have developed the habit of seeking and hoping for debt forgiveness. There have been successes and failures to the requests and Nigeria enjoyed such debt forgiveness between 2005 and April 2006 during the President Olusegun Obasanjo era. From that period, many governors have taken it for granted that debt forgiveness is an entitlement. That has also resulted in frivolous demand for internal and external loans by them. In an article published in September this year on the need for the Federal Government and its agencies to showcase the results of their economic interventions over the years, I wrote, ""Positive outcomes seem not glaring to the naked eye because the country has been moving deeper and deeper into the abyss of unemployment, under capacity utilisation in industries, debt issues and rising prices  The figures in the international sphere which show that the Nigerian economy is in serious trouble is supported by the facts on the ground   and there is the need for the MDAs to showcase the results of interventions"". Since that challenge, neither the government nor any of the MDAs cared to provide answers. It is as if accountability is alien to our democracy. The fact is that there was and still nothing to declare!The woeful results for the various interventions by the Federal Government and the MDAs is replicated in the case of loans acquired by states and the Federal Government. But the opportunity to debunk this claim is here now. I wonder what would have made the governors rush to court to seek an injunction on a stay of action over deductions of outstanding loans from their allocations if they are sure they actually invested the loans on projects that would repay themselves. The belief that the Federal Government would likely forgive these loans made state governments outdo themselves in the request for loans. Many have perfected the art of presenting projects and programmes that can attract loan approval with little conviction, but the loan would be applied to totally unrelated projects like sponsoring candidates for elections.The Nigerian economy at state and federal levels seems to be taken by politicians and civil or public servants as a potpourri of various assets for personal aggrandisement rather than the commonwealth. I asked Google to give me the value of a kilometre of road in Nigeria and I got an answer that jolted my spirits, more than what I bargained for. I asked: ""How much is 1km road in Nigeria?"" The answer: ""A kilometre of asphalt road in Nigeria is currently estimated to cost N1bn (or about four times the average cost of a kilometre of an asphalt road on the African continent)' 1 August 2020. That response is loaded and coded and it is an assignment for you. You can google any issue on education, health, technology, energy, et cetera.Unfortunately, we cannot run to the legislature for restitution because it looks like they are accomplices to the nefarious acts. It is not just the noise being made by the public and institutions like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund on the precarious economic situation of the Nigerian economy vis-\'e0-vis the level of debt but even the statement by the Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed, that national revenue is dwindling and a large proportion of what is earned presently is used to pay and service debts that should have made the National Assembly think twice before approving new loans. But they acted in their own interests. One of the major duties of the legislature is oversight function and they cannot afford to fail to perform such function if democracy is to be strengthened. The federal and state governments have to change their orientation towards income generation rather than loan acquisition. The legislature, the judiciary, the non-state actors or non-governmental organisations, academia and civil society have some roles to play by insisting on accountability and transparency as well as the need for politicians to stop addiction to loans.It looks quite certain that debt moratorium has replaced debt forgiveness in the international financial market and the Federal Government seems to have read this rightly. Hence the insistence that states should pay their debts. As an interested party in Nigeria's affairs, I challenge the states and federal governments to publicise what projects and programmes they have completed or committed outstanding loans to in the last ten years, along with their costs. To borrow from President Buhari: ""if we don't kill the appetite for external loans the loans will kill us.""\l"

Last week, the companies announced they would re-evaluate the deal here, ending two years of negotiations.The collapse of the deal reflects the changing global energy landscape as oil and gas companies shift away from fossil fuel to renewables. Valuations of refining and petrochemical assets have gone down especially after the recent COP26 climate talks in Glasgow, a second source involved in the deal discussions said.Despite this, Reliance had stuck to the $75 billion valuation for the O2C business made in 2019, he said.""Evaluation by consultants showed a significant cut in valuation more than a 10% cut,"" he added.""Reliance has highlighted the difficulty of separating Jamnagar from the clean energy business as a reason to not complete the transaction, although we suspect business alignment and valuation were also key reasons,"" Bernstein wrote in a recent note, referring to Reliance's huge refining complex in Gujarat state.A second source familiar with due diligence said the procedure was halted in ""early stage assessment"".

""Yet, our soils are at risk,"" he stressed in remarks ahead of the December 5 event on the theme: ""Halt Soil Salinization, Boost Soil Productivity"".Among the critical issues are:Unsustainable agricultural practices and the overexploitation of natural resources as well as a growing population are putting increased pressure on soils and causing alarming rates of soil degradation globally.Over 833 million hectares of soils worldwide are already salt-affected, as shown on the Global salt-affected soils map launched by FAO in October.Estimates indicate that more than 10% of cropland is salt-affected, which poses a major risk to food security worldwide.Some of the worst affected regions are in Central Asia, the Middle East, South America, North Africa and the Pacific.The management of salt-affected areas demands an integrated approach, embracing sustainable soil and irrigation and drainage management, the selection of salt-tolerant crops and plants including halophytes, which are able to grow well in such environments.Collecting soil data and building sufficient capacity in the soil laboratories of FAO Member countries is essential to manage soil-affected land resources and pave the foundation towards digital agriculture in the future.The Director-General underl"

The Forum which began in 2018 is a solution-primed initiative to create targeted investments and capital for the continent to meet its infrastructural needs.The Africa Investment Forum Market Days event brings together investors, project sponsors, transaction advisors, legal and other applicable professionals under 'one roof' to engage and continue the process of addressing the continent's investment gap. The inaugural Africa Investment Forum 2018 (AIF2018) boardrooms convened investors, project sponsors, and transaction facilitators around 63 deals valued at $46.9 billion. Also, the platform mobilised investment interests across 49 of these boardroom deals worth $38.7 billion  across 24 countries. The 2019 edition (AIF2019) upped the ante. AIF2019 featured 57 boardroom deals valued at $67.7 billion and succeeded in crowding-in investment interests across 52 deals worth $40.1 billion from 25 countries.Akinwumi Adesina, president of the African Development Bank; Africa50, Afrexim Bank, the Africa Finance Corporation, the Development Bank of Southern Africa, the European Investment Bank, the Islamic Development Bank, and the Trade Development Bank set up the Forum as a transaction hub where real investment deals for Africa are concretised \- so the Forum is essentially a dividend-deliverer and not a chatter assembly.According to AfDB's economic outlook on Africa (2018), the continent's infrastructure needs amount to $130\- 170 billion a year, with a financing gap in the range $68\- $108 billion. Clearly, Africa needs investment in critical infrastructure \- power, transportation, water, agriculture, etc  if it must industrialise and bridge the deficit, as well as reduce the unemployment of millions of youths. This underscores the viability of the Forum.The theme of the 2021 edition is ""Accelerating Transformative Investments in Africa"". Sessions focusing on the five investment sectors that received priority under the Forum's Unified Response to COVID-19: agriculture and agro-processing; energy and climate change; health; ICT/Telecoms; and industrialisation and trade will be elemental to the programme.In addition, sector-specific discussions at this year's event will include energy and climate \- including reflections on November's COP26 summit in Glasgow, UK \- agriculture and agro-processing; health; ICT and telecommunications; and industry and trade.Nigeria has been a principal feature in the Africa Investment Forum since 2018. In the 2018 edition, out of the 63 boardroom deals presented at the Forum, Nigeria had five deals worth $7 Billion. This represents 14.9 percent of the total deals accounted for on the continent, and 43 percent of the deals accounted for in the region.The AfDB, facilitator of the Forum, had said it would help Nigeria to bridge its infrastructure gap estimated to cost about $3 trillion in the next 26 years. According to Ebrima Faal, former director AfDB, Nigeria and director of operations committee secretariat, Nigeria's infrastructure cumulative financing needs are estimated to reach $3 trillion by 2044 or about 100 billion dollars annually.The Africa Investment Forum offers Nigeria a smorgasbord of opportunities to attract the needed investments to the country. And as always, a high-level delegation of the Nigerian government and captains of industry from Nigeria are expected to be at the Forum this year.The Africa of the future will be driven by infrastructure. But to achieve that future, infrastructure-led investments are critical \- most especially in this time of global economic peril brought on by the COVID pandemic.Africa needs more accessibility for citizens within the continent; it needs better healthcare; it needs to achieve food security, have stable power supply, affordable internet connectivity, technology innovation, good transport system, and ensure the safety and security of its populace. It all starts with the right investments.By Fredrick Nwabufo; Nwabufo is a writer and journalist.Instagram/Twitter/Facebook: @FredrickNwabufo\l"

It is believed that all the requests made while performing the act are answered by Allah.Buhari was also joined in the Umrah by his aides, including the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu; the State Chief of Protocol, Amb. Lawal Kazaure; the president's personal physician, Dr Suhayb Rafindadi; and the Chief Security Officer, Idris Ahmed.The religious ritual was successfully completed by the president and members of his entourage at the Holy Ka£ba on Thursday, at about 3.20 a.m local time.Buhari had a brief stopover at Madinah for intense prayers for the return of peace and security to Nigeria, and for the recovery of economy battered by the COVID-19 pandemic.NAN reports that prayers were offered by the president and members of his entourage at the Holy Mosques in Madinah and Makkah, while performing the Umrah rituals.Speaking to NAN on the significance of Umrah, Malam Garba Shehu, the President's spokesman, expressed optimism that Nigeria would win the favour of the Almighty Allah in addressing her challenges.The Nigerian leader, who was specially chosen by the Saudi Authorities to deliver the keynote address at the Future Investment Initiative Summit, drew the attention of 5,200 participants including world leaders to the devastating effect of climate change on the livelihoods of people around Lake Chad.He also stressed the need for massive investments through strong public-private partnership to recharge the waters of Lake Chad to address the challenges of poverty and insecurity in the Lake Chad region.He attributed growing social unrests to inequalities and unfair policies that exclude the majority from opportunities for participation, admonishing world leaders and global investors to prioritise on inclusive and humane policies.Buhari said his administration would keep encouraging public and private initiatives that increase investments in health, education, capacity building, youth empowerment, gender equality, poverty eradication, climate change and food security.According to him, this will go a long way in reenergising the global economy in a post-COVID-19 era.He expressed the hope that participants at the forum would rise to the challenge in the interest of durable peace and sustainable development of the Lake Chad region.The president used the opportunity to convey heartfelt gratitude and appreciation to the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, for the invitation extended to him to participate in the summit.He also congratulated Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman for his leadership and support through the Future Investment Initiative Summit.Also commenting on the Riyadh investment summit, the Minister of Trade, Industry and Investment, Niyi Adebayo, said the forum provided Nigeria the opportunity to educate the world on the abundant economic and business opportunities in the country.He said: 'It is always important for Nigeria to be in such an international forum such as this because it gives us an opportunity to tell our story.'It gives us an opportunity to let the world know what we are doing and why we believe Nigeria is the best investment destination in Africa.'I was at a forum recently and I pointed out that anybody wishing to do business in Africa must first do business with Nigeria because if you don't do business in Nigeria you are not doing business in Africa.'We are aware of the problems that we have and we are working to resolve those problems to create an enabling environment for investors,'' he said.Also while in Makkah, the president had on Friday met with a select group of Nigerians, resident in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia where he warned that nobody should start campaigning for an unconstitutional extension of his tenure in office beyond May 29, 2023.He said: 'I swore by the Holy Qur£n that I will serve in accordance with the constitution and leave when my time is up. No 'Tazarce' (tenure extension).'I don't want anybody to start talking about and campaigning for an unconstitutional extension. I will not accept that.'Buhari also tacitly expressed support to efforts to increase the role of technology in the nation's elections.He maintained that the introduction of the card reader and electronic register was God's answer to his prayers, having been cheated of his victory in three previous elections.'After the third so-called defeat, I said 'God Dey'. My opponents laughed at me but God answered my prayers by bringing in technology.'At that point, nobody can steal their votes or buy them,' the president added.The president, who ended his visit to the Kingdom with the Friday Prayers at the Grand Mosque in Makkah, said he would continue to abide by the constitution in all its ramifications.A leader of the community, Dr Abdulkadir Maikudi, who spoke on behalf of the group, requested the president to assist the privately-run Nigerian International School in the Kingdom by equipping it to provide science and technical education.The Nigerian Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Yahaya Lawal, and the Consul-General in Jeddah, Amb. Abdulkarim Mansur, attested to the good conduct of the nearly 1.5 million Nigerians living in the Kingdom.'Nigerian professionals are doing well and projecting a good image of our country', they said.Buhari had earlier inaugurated the eNaira, saying the adoption of the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and its underlying technology, called blockchain, could increase Nigeria's GDP by $29 billion over the next 10 years.The president also declared that the introduction of the eNaira would enable the government to send direct payments to citizens eligible for specific welfare programmes as well as foster cross-border trade.According to him, alongside digital innovations, CBDCs can foster economic growth through better economic activities, increase remittances, improve financial inclusion and make monetary policy more effective.Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo had also represented the president, virtually at the opening of the 27th Nigerian Economic Summit, themed 'Securing our Future: The Fierce Urgency of Now', on Oct. 25. Osinbajo had also on Oct. 29 participated, virtually, at a panel of discussion on 'A Just Transition: Balancing Climate Mitigation with Africa's Development', organised by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, few days to the commencement of the COP26 holding in the United Kingdom.The president had on Monday in Abuja urged foreign envoys in Nigeria to be guided by diplomatic practices to ensure that their activities remain within the limits of their profession.NAN also reports that Buhari, who is preparing to join other world leaders for COP26 holding in the United Kingdom, had since returned to Nigeria on Friday.\l"

We would no longer allow that to happen again because government is the ultimate lover. If they are not able to operate such assets optimally government won't be able to generate revenue from such assets.

With the passage of the PIA there are a lot of interests in the oil and gas sector in Nigeria today. The responses we have gotten from investors so far it's quite good. Everybody is quite happy,' Sylva said, adding that the Federal Government while willing to encourage new investors would open its doors first to those who already have business and investments in the country.The minister who also spoke on cost optimization, security of oil and gas assets, domestic gas utilization called for more investments in the sector.At a breakfast meeting organised by the African Energy Future, Sylva urged the African continent to wake up to find solution the African problem or the word would leave Africa behind.Sylva who spoke yesterday morning at the Hyatt Regency Hotel, Houston, said with the Omicron virus ban placed on Africa and the rush for energy transition, the continent leaders need to look for urgent financing solution if the continent will continue to play key roles in the hydrocarbon sectors.Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Secretary General, Dr. Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo yesterday also said the current global energy crisis is a larger picture of what it could become if the complexities are not comprehended.In his opening remarks at the 23rd World Petroleum Conference in Houston, US, he said: 'The current energy market turmoil seen across the world in recent months is perhaps an early insight into some of the issues we are dealing with, and what can occur if we do not see the bigger picture and the interwoven complexities.'The OPEC scribe sought concerted efforts at addressing the current energy crisis instead of a divisive approach.He said: 'Our energy future is not about 'Them' or 'Us'. It has to be about 'We'.Barkindo warned that stifling investments in the oil and gas industry will be perilous to the producers and consumers.He said 'If necessary investments are not made it could have knock-on implications, and leave long-term scar, particularly for security of supply, affecting not only producers, but consumers too.' Barkindo described US as a vital cog in the global oil and energy markets, as both a major producer and consumer.He said the OPEC welcome the decision of Biden administration to return to Paris Agreement, and take the lead at .According to him, the energy transition and global conversation around it would be incomplete without the US at the head of the multilateral table.He said the oil and gas producers are also key to addressing energy transition, since there are oil and gas producers all over the world.He sought all inclusive dialogue for the energy transition instead of the disruptive manner.Barkindo said 'for many of the world's population, electric vehicles do not offer a viable alternative to the internal combustion engine, primarily due to cost.'There is also debate about how environmentally friendly they are considering their build process, especially the required batteries, mining for minerals and metals, and the sourcing of the vehicles' electricity.'\l"

It will restore degraded land and help inhabitants of the Sahel produce food, create jobs and promote peace. Yesterday's gathering focused on marshalling efforts to scale up implementation of the project as a critical nature-based solution to climate change in Africa.Adesina thanked HRH The Prince of Wales for what he said was the Prince's global leadership and lifetime commitment to safeguarding nature and the environment.He also also commended French President Emmanuel Macron for his passion and leadership on climate issues, especially in Africa, and for appointing him as a Global Champion for the Great Green Wall initiative, to help mobilize financing for it. He said the French president's leadership in convening the One Planet Summit for Biodiversity earlier in the year and his call for commitment to accelerate actions had been a turning point for the Great Green Wall for the Sahel and the Sahara.The African Development Bank chief applauded the leadership and commitment of all African heads of state on the Great Green Wall.""The Great Green Wall is not a wall that divides. It is a wall that unites  uniting livelihoods, resilience, and adaptation against climate change,"" Adesina said.Adesina said desertification, obliteration by sand dunes, and droughts, had continued to pummel vast areas of the Sahara and the Sahel. ""Life is unbearable, so people migrate, populations are\\xa0 displaced, conflicts are aggravated as previously co-existing communities of farmers and herders engage\\xa0 in\\xa0 relentless battles over declining communal resources,"" he explained. He said that for the millions of people in the region, it was either they adapt or see the disappearance of Sahel.The African Development Bank has committed to mobilize $6.5 billion towards the Great Green Wall initiative, by 2025. This is 45% of the $14.5 billion that development partners committed to the initiative at the One Planet Summit in Paris. It also represents 20% of the $33 billion needed to deliver on the 10-year priority investments of the Great Green Wall by 2030.The Bank chief said his institution was delivering on its commitment through several projects, including $2 billion for the Desert-to-Power program to deliver universal access to electricity in the G5 Sahel countries (Niger, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Burkina Faso) via solar power. The Green Climate Fund recently approved $150 million towards this project. The Bank is also mobilizing $2 billion for digital climate advisory services, as part of the African Adaptation Acceleration Program. And yet a third is $1 billion from the Bank's Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation to deploy climate resilient technologies at scale to millions of farmers.\l"

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria404","Nigeria Shouldn't Have Joined the Race to Net Zero [opinion]","November 21, 2021","Daily Trust (Abuja)","A report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change showed that limiting global warming 1.5\'b0C, which scientific consensus suggests is the tipping point beyond which catastrophic climate change will occur, required global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to reach zero by 2050 and become net-negative thereafter. With these findings and increased pressure on governments from citizens to accelerate climate action, over 130 countries pledged to deliver Net Zero by 2050. At the 26th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, COP26, President Buhari committed Nigeria to a 2060 target. The announcement, met with celebration and surprise, is indicative of increasing consensus that climate change mitigation efforts need to be accelerated, but more so that the mix of pressure and persuasion--often in the form of investment contingent on progressive climate action--from advanced economies has worked. I had expected Nigeria to resist this pressure, given our negligible contribution to historical GHG emissions and the limited understanding of what Net Zero would mean for our underdeveloped economy and energy systems. So, I was curious about the factors, be they economic or political, that influenced the government's announcement.After the announcement, the government presented its first-ever energy transition plan, which detailed how it planned to deliver climate change mitigation within its borders and seemed to be the evidence backing the Net Zero pledge. The plan was prepared for the Federal Ministry of Environment by a leading management consulting firm in collaboration with Sustainable Energy for All. It assessed how key sectors of the economy need to transit to deliver Net Zero by 2050, compared to a business-as-usual scenario where no decarbonisation action is taken. Decarbonisation strategies are often informed by energy system models, which are mathematical models that can guide decision-making on the design and operation of an energy system by illustrating different strategies to meet future demands and environmental targets. They are designed to meet such targets, while optimising economic, operational, or environmental factors (such as energy price, investment cost, or greenhouse gas emissions) given real-world constraints such as energy demand, technology costs and resource availability. These models are data-intensive and computationally complex because a wide range of design features and model inputs (thus results) are possible.The firm that led the work used one of its proprietary analytical tools to develop pathways for Nigeria's energy and industrial sectors. The acceptance of a model that is not widely accessible or peer-reviewed to inform policy that has potentially far-reaching implications for the economy is irresponsible, as it has limited our ability to critique the underlying assumptions in the plan and assess whether they are suitable to our nation's context. It may be the case that the pathway modelled focused on driving down emissions as quickly as possible, with little consideration of the optimal pathway for job creation or local resource utilisation.According to the plan, delivering Net Zero would only allow for a limited increase in emissions until 2025, after which they need to fall rapidly to zero by mid-century. Essentially, economic planning decisions must ensure that whatever population and economic growth occurs in this period does so in a manner that will be carbon-neutral or -negative. This is a staggering challenge as industrialised economies have historically experienced significant rise in emissions from the fossil fuel use that drove economic growth, which then peaked post-industrialisation through increased energy efficiency and renewable energy use. Unlike advanced economies, Nigeria isn't so much committing to an energy transition--because we don't have established energy and industrial systems to transition from--but attempting a new, low-carbon model of development that hasn't been trialled elsewhere. Should this model fail to realise the levels of economic growth achieved by fossil fuels, the effects will likely be borne solely by us. Given our negligible contribution to climate change, why should we share the burden of mitigation equally with industrialised countries that are pressuring us to achieve carbon-neutrality at the same time?Dr. Habiba Ahut Daggash, PhD DIC MEng (Oxon) AMIChemE AMEI, writes from Abuja\l"

The VP also highlighted funding challenges for developing countries in its response to climate change and preparation for adaptation, alongside other implications of the Paris Agreement.As part of that Agreement, a $100billion per year was pledged by the wealthier economies to help developing economies to respond to the challenges of climate change and support mitigation and adaptation.In her remarks, Dr. Mari Pangestu, expressed her delight at visiting Nigeria, saying this is her first country mission since assuming her current position in March.According to her, following COP26, the global body was considering ways to £ddress both development and climate crisis in developing countries, noting that the development crisis has been heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic.'The way we are trying to approach it is the Green, Resilient, and Inclusive Recovery and growth strategy which must start with developing countries.'Commending Nigeria's energy reforms, Pangestu noted that the World Bank would explore ways to ensure developing countries attract the needed financing so as to achieve its climate and development objectives.During the interaction with IMF which was virtual, the VP restated Nigeria's position on Climate Change adding however that no developed economy grew its industrial base on renewable energy alone and so developing economies should not be asked to do that.The IMF Article IV Consultation Mission team was led by Ms. Jesmin Rahman, Mission Chief for Nigeria at IMF. The consultations based on the IMF's Articles of Agreement involves bilateral discussions between a member-country and the IMF.

But it is also rewarding and fulfilling to get to read and watch so many great pieces. This is why this journalist competition aims at fostering quality and balanced reporting on migration subject-matters in West and Central Africa including environmental migration, migrant reintegration, awareness raising about risks and alternatives to irregular migration and alternatives to irregular migration.The competition celebrates journalists who bring attention to the many facets of migration in West and Central Africa in both French and English language. In light of important discussions at COP26, Olatunji Olaigbe highlights in his winning entry the impact of climate change on people's movements and how rising temperatures and drought in Nigeria have caused conflicts over lands affecting farmers livelihoods and forcing them to relocate. Mental health and the stigmatisation that many returned migrants face upon their return home, is highlighted in Innocent Duru's winning entry. The 8 winners were announced during a virtual award ceremony which was moderated by CNN Journalist Eleni Giokos. Each of the winners received up to USD 1,250 each and a plaque of recognition.Alpha Seydi Ba, IOM Spokesperson for the Regional Office in West and Central Africa is convinced that ""the role of journalists in clearly understanding the different dynamics of migration, is crucial. The deconstruction of stereotypes begins with shifting the narrative that underpins the anti-migrant feeling and continues with the sensitization on multiple levels.

On behalf of the entire U.S. Mission, I extend our warmest wishes for a healthy, peaceful, and joyous holiday season.At the outset of 2021, we all had high hopes of controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, another variant has come to the center stage of global concern. However, thanks to renewed global health collaboration efforts, vaccine development and distribution is gradually making headway.At the U.S. Mission, we are fortunate to have dozens of our staff working side by side with our Nigerian counterparts to monitor and respond to the pandemic. The strength of our support is reflected in the over $130 million we have contributed towards the COVID-19 health response and the hard work of staff who provide expertise, technical assistance, and logistics support. So far, we have pledged 36 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine to Nigeria - of which 18 million have been delivered to date, and the balance of 18 million will be shipped in the coming weeks. The pandemic has shown us how interdependent our world is. No one is safe until everyone is safe. Through robust global dialogue and ingenuity, we will continue to build global health security in the new year together.I firmly believe that, together, the world will overcome COVID-19, the same way that we have overcome other global health challenges. Together, we have brought HIV/AIDS to a point where epidemic control is within our reach. We achieved the eradication of wild polio virus as all of Africa is now certified as wild polio virus free. In Nigeria, the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) has invested more than $6 billion in the national HIV/AIDS response, where measures of our success include more than 1.6 million men, women, and children currently on HIV treatment. In partnership with the Federal Ministry of Health, we remain committed to completing the task of placing all people living with HIV on treatment and to strengthening capacity and commitment at all levels.In fact, we have many reasons to remain positive about the progress made this year toward our shared goals. This past year, I had many opportunities to engage with Nigerians from all walks of life, from Kebbi to Akwa Ibom, and Ife to Jos. One common theme inevitably prevails - Nigerians seek a more secure living environment to raise and educate their children, earn a decent living, and strengthen their communities. We have done our utmost to address these concerns through a variety of mechanisms.Countering violent extremism in Nigeria remains a top priority for both our countries. We were proud to support such efforts with the delivery of 12 Super Tucano aircrafts, which are already being employed to assist the Nigerian Air Force in their fight against violent extremist organizations. We have also worked with civil society, civilian law enforcement, the judiciary, and corrections officials to combat insecurity, strengthen effective and equitable access to the rule of law and justice, protect human rights, and together create a safer Nigeria.Nigeria is the United States' second largest trading partner on the continent, and we seek ways to further deepen this vital economic relationship. During 2021, we strengthened this partnership in important sectors such as agriculture, healthcare, information and communication technology, and renewable energy. On this latter issue, together our nations recognized the impact of climate change. We welcomed President Buhari's commitment to strive for zero carbon emissions by 2060 at the COP26 summit, as the United States agreed to slash methane emissions by 30 percent by 2030./ Separately, we welcomed the arrival in Nigeria of well-respected American brands such as United Airl"

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria413","African govts need $2.8tr to achieve net zero emissions","The Nation (Nigeria)"," ","Global race to net zero emissions by 2050 is accelerating, but Nigeria and other African countries would need to invest an estimated $2.8 trillion in a clean energy mix and reduce its yeraly carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions of 1.62m kilotons of CO2e.Multinational professional services company PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) said investment in low-carbon energy systems in Africa lagged global pace.It said despite global climate finance commitments from developed economies aimed at $100 billion yearly, the allocation to Africa falls significantly short of what the continent requires to meet global targets.PwC stated that the fiscal constraints being experienced across Africa create a challenge for the continent to move with pace on its net-zero journey.It, therefore, pointed out that private partnerships, public-private partnerships (PPPs) and blended finance are becoming important and will need to be deployed together with strong public sector governance and innovative financing instruments to overcome these challenges.These were some of the key highlights from 'PwC Africa Energy Review 2021' released at the weekend. The review, which was accessed by The Nation, said with an acceleration of the global net-zero journey, there is increasing focus on developing countries and their lack of affordability to meet such net-zero targets.Notwithstanding, PwC, in the review, said the majority of Africa's 54 countries (35) have made commitments towards net-zero emissions, but at an estimated cost of $2.8 trillion just to transition Africa's energy base by 2050. The required investment levels are unaffordable to most countries. This message has been given at COP-26 in Glasgow, through calls for increased international financial support from developed nations.The ongoing United Nations (UN) Climate Change Conference, also known as COP26, is the 26th UN Climate Change conference.

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria414","Marking the End of An Era: OPEC Secretary General Barkindo Served with Distinction","January 13, 2022 Thursday","News Chronicle (Nigeria)","Many will agree OPEC Secretary General H.E. Mohammed Barkindo walks in the same shoes as late world leaders Kofi Annan, who served as Secretary General of the United Nations, and Dr. Rilwanu Lukman, a former Nigerian Minister and OPEC Secretary General who has been described as one of the oil industry's most influential and respected ambassadors.\\xa0Barkindo, throughout his tenure with OPEC, has fought the good fight, finished his race, and kept the faith. After six years of what can best be described as remarkable leadership, he will turn over the reins to his successor, Kuwaiti Haitham al-Ghais, this July.We knew the day was coming. After all, the position is term-limited, and no one can lead the group forever. Barkindo has always been against staying a day longer than his term.Yet the industry has become accustomed to Mr. Barkindo's steady hand on the rudder, guiding OPEC through the volatile waters that global oil and gas producers must navigate, including growing public sentiment against fossil fuels.If he had just maintained order during his term, that would have been enough, especially given the upheaval brought on by the pandemic. But Barkindo is not one to be satisfied with the status quo, even during the most trying times.Granted, he could never have anticipated the global grip of COVID-19. But he did have the foresight to imagine how much impact OPEC could have through cooperation on an even more global scale  and that proved key to stabilizing the market when demand hit record lows.Barkindo cultivated a very respectful relationship with oil-producing nations within and outside of OPEC, including Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, China, and Russia, as well as U.S. shale producers. His talent for building bridges was just what OPEC, and producers worldwide, needed. In 2017 Barkindo steered OPEC into a mutually advantageous relationship with 11 non-OPEC producers (10 nations since Equatorial Guinea joined OPEC in May 2017), including Russia. The benefits of the OPEC+ alliance were keenly apparent in 2020 when the pandemic hit and travel nearly stopped in its tracks. It didn't help that an oil war between Saudi Arabia and Russia flared up in March of that year, driving up production when demand was at a dramatic low. By April, oil futures plunged, at least for one day, into negative territory, and the oil industry was in jeopardy. It was Mr. Barkindo who skillfully brought all parties to the table to find a resolution: The 23 members of OPEC and OPEC+ agreed to record reductions in output, a move that helped oil prices recover more quickly than they might have otherwise. This outcome is a testament to Barkindo's skills as a leader, though, of course, President Trump took credit for resolving the crisis. OPEC's Secretary General knew that the longer the price war continued, the more economic harm would be inflicted on Africa and many poor people around the globe.A Champion for AfricaAs OPEC chief, Barkindo has a duty to be impartial. Yet it is no surprise that during his tenure, the number of member countries from Africa has increased. Barkindo's homeland of Nigeria joined OPEC 50 years ago. In his own words, the nation ""played a major role in driving the organization's focus on cooperation, goodwill, a sense of belonging and unity, and in working towards achieving oil market stability, conscious of the benefits this brings to both producers and consumers."" Since then, that sense of belonging and unity has been extended to Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, and Congo. Today, those countries have a seat at the table, so to speak, a greater say in how their petroleum resources are used to benefit their people and grow their economies.Recognizing his support of the continent's energy industry, in 2018 the Africa Oil & Power Conference named Barkindo their Africa Oil Man of the Year. His leadership proved that ""if you want to go far, you go together,"" Gabriel Mbaga Obiang Lima, Minister of Mines and Hydrocarbons of Equatorial Guinea said at the time.""He has been an enormous champion of African countries and giving them a voice to help stabilize oil markets,"" Obiang Lima added.Barkindo also has been an advocate for Africa in the greater energy transition discussion. Having led Nigeria's technical delegation to the UN climate change negotiations for 30 years and serving three times as vice president of the Conference of the Parties  COP13 (Bali, Indonesia), COP14 (Poznan, Poland), and COP15 (Copenhagen, Denmark ) he is realistic about the way forward. It is his firmly held belief that a world eager to meet the challenges of climate change must also accept that it will take all sources of energy to meet current and future demand, especially given that energy poverty remains a reality across great swaths of the continent.Barkindo never shied away from visiting leaders around the world and making the case for abundant, cheap, reliable energy. Nor did he shy away from tough conversations. I remember him going against the advice of his advisors to have a civil discussion with a climate-change activist who insisted on protesting OPEC in Vienna. You could hear a pin drop as he talked about energy poverty and his own experience growing up poor in Nigeria. His eloquence, transparency, and respectful approach gave many of us chills. He urged young demonstrators to hold fast to the idea of making the world a better place and welcomed them to be part of the solution to global solutions.During the last year, Barkindo has been a particularly outspoken opponent of the current movement to restrict investment in hydrocarbons. Unless there is more spending on new oil and gas development, he has warned, the world should prepare for energy shortages and rising prices. Shortly after the COP26 summit in Glasgow, Mr. Barkindo said oil and gas had been unfairly targeted at the event as unsuitable for the energy transition, a claim that is blatantly false. The global gas shortage that occurred in fall 2021  when European countries grew increasingly reliant on burning coal in its place  should have been a worldwide ""wake-up call,"" he said, that investment across the oil and gas industry is required.During a visit to Congo Brazzaville, Minister of Petroleum Bruno Jean Richard Itoua and the current OPEC president described Barkindo as a true son of Africa, a man with a love for the continent who embraced Congo without reservations. There are so many stories that it would require a book to cover everything Mr. Barkindo does when it comes to encouraging investors to look at Africa and urging Africans to create an enabling environment to do business. I can tell you this: He does it with class.He Served With IntegrityFor many African businesses and countries, Barkindo has been a source of encouragement and inspiration: He expanded their belief that success is possible. He lifted their sights and encouraged them to serve with integrity and maturity.In turn, leading OPEC has been a positive, life-changing experience for Barkindo. He has made amazing friends that he calls family, and I believe if you ask him quietly if he would do it again, the answer would be yes. He will still tell you, ""I am proud of OPEC and I am a proud Nigerian and Africa is my home.""Although Barkindo has not said publicly what his plans are after Mr. al-Ghais succeeds him, his legacy is secure. A veteran of Nigeria's energy industry, equal parts businessman and diplomat, and a humble person of unerring faith, his wisdom, strength, counsel, and direction are greatly appreciated and will be sorely missed at OPEC. But, knowing Barkindo, he would be quick to ask us to be patient with him; he'd point out that God is not finished with him yet.\l"

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria416","Country's Total Debt-to-GDP Is At 33.3%, Which Is Low Compared to Other Low-Income Countries -World Bank MD [interview]","November 15, 2021","This Day (Lagos)","Mari Pangestu is the World Bank Managing Director of Development Policy and Partnerships. In this role, she provides leadership and oversees the research and data group of the World Bank, the work programme of the World Bank's Global Practice Groups, and the External and Corporate Relations function. Pangestu, who is presently on a Mission Visit to Nigeria in this interview with THISDAY, warns that unless governments at all levels in Nigeria provide opportunities for the country's high youth population, its demographic dividend could turn into a demographic crisis. She also harps on the need for countries to integrate climate change adaptation into development, among other issues. Excerpts:You participated in the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow that ended at the weekend; for you, what were the takeaways from the conference and what lessons do you think African countries like Nigeria should take home in order to enthrone a better planet?The main takeaways are obvious because it was the five-year milestone from the Paris Agreement where countries were asked to provide more ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). We saw a lot of countries committing to more ambitious NDCs as well as net-zero. It was not all countries, but a larger number compared to before. A lot of the developing countries were of the view that even though we are committing more, development should still be key. So this is also a priority issue for the World Bank Group. We have to integrate climate into development. It cannot only be about climate, it has to be how a country can still achieve development with issues around climate integrated into their development pathways. That is the broad strategic picture we are looking at. In that regard, the developing countries are saying they would like to do more, but that for them to do more, they would need financial, funding and technology support. Then, you come to the second issue which was part of the negotiations that have been going on - the $100 billion climate finance which was promised back in 2015 to be delivered in 2019.Today, we are in 2021, only around $80 billion has been delivered out of that amount. So there is a lot of push for that fund to be released. That means further commitment for the bilateral donors and multilateral agencies. The World Bank has done its part by increasing its commitment and 35 per cent of our financing would be going to climate and that amounts to about $25 billion a year, and half of that would be going to adaptation because that was another issue that was raised during the COP26, especially coming from African countries and some of the small island states because they are only responsible for four per cent of the greenhouse gas emission, yet they are the most impacted by the climate crisis.So for African countries, the issue is less about energy transition, but more about energy access because half of Africa still doesn't have electricity. And it is more about addressing the need for adaptation and resilience as well as protecting and restoring the natural assets that Africa has. The priority has to be on adaptation and resilience. That was one of the things that emerged from COP26. We need more funding, more attention, more priority and policies on what to do. Next year is COP27 and it will be held in Egypt and because it is in Africa, adaptation would be the big thing and for Africa, that would be a very important issue.Then the final takeaway is that the private sector was present in big numbers at COP26. I have been to many COPs and I think this was the highest level and most comprehensive of the private sector and that came up with promises and commitments of trillions of dollars because they are also committed to net zero for their companies and for their sectors. And these trillions of dollars are going towards transformative investments for climate and development in emerging countries and that is the opportunity for Africa and for countries like Nigeria.The focus for African countries, including Nigeria should be on how to come up with a clear design of low-carbon, long-term development strategy that identifies and prioritises which areas of transformative investments we need to have in our country and how much funding and the types of technologies we need. And as a government, we would create a kind of societal approach that packages these reforms, policy changes and institutional changes that would lead us to say, for instance, for South Africa, I would think it is about energy access as well as developing renewable energy as well as transiting out of the fossil fuels, but doing it in a way that we would still have just transition because we are still developing.I would think it would largely be about resilience and adaptation, especially in the coastal areas as well as the agricultural lands. So this would be a package that countries like Nigeria can come up with, with a clear identification of the changes and reforms that the country would do and be quite specific about the funding needs, capacity building needs and amount of investment required. So there would be a combination of public funding, either coming from the $100 billion multilateral/bilateral donor funding as well as other concessional sources and the International Development Association (IDA) would be an important source here. Then, you would want to crowd in private sector funding in some of these trillions of dollars. But it would require countries to create the right kind of conducive environment to attract this kind of funding. Again, the country should be very clear on its objective.The latest World Bank's Debt Transparency Report was released last week, can you take us through the key findings in that report, especially as it relates to African countries?The key findings include the fact that we do need to analyse and have comprehensive data on debt if we are going to address the debt issue. There are several missing issues in terms of the data that don't tend to be totally captured by the report that we have on sovereign debts. Forty per cent of low-income developing countries didn't even publish any data on sovereign debt in the last two years and when they are published, they are done in multiple official and private sources that show deviations. So getting the accurate numbers has been a big issue for those countries.And we don't have data on central banks' repos (repurchase agreements) and currency swaps, which are increasingly being used to facilitate external borrowings rather than to implement monetary policy or manage check liquidity, so that needs to be included in the overall debt number. And the other number we need to have in order to have a complete picture of understanding how to view the debt situation in countries, is the domestic debt market. In low income countries, it tends to be not very transparent and we don't always know totally the size of those debts. The other number that we don't have is the resource-backed loans, and this is a rising share of the debt stock in low-income countries like African countries and they do pose transparency challenges. They are not usually organised by borrowers.The big issue is that we have different kinds of credit risks. Not all are members of the Paris Club. Also, the big one that we don't have is private sector debt and we often don't have numbers on debts from State-owned Enterprises or special purpose vehicles, which are off-budget. So basically, our view is that debt transparency is key and we need to have the whole picture. Right now, we have different pieces of the picture and we don't know how that adds up. If we are going to address the debt issue, we need to have a complete picture to understand what needs to be done; whether it is a continuation of the debt suspension initiative.You need that to start talking about reducing the size of the debt, debt relief or debt restructuring programmes. The final thing I would say is that we do all this work on debt transparency with countries that do want to come on that common framework initiative, like we are working with Chad, Ethiopia and Zambia, together with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). We also at same time provide countries with large net-positive flows to the poorest countries. For example, between April 2020 and June 2021, we committed $36.3 billion in financing for countries participating in the debt service suspension initiative, of which $11.8 billion was in form of grants, which is three times more than their $3 billion debt service repayments that they received from the debt service suspension initiative. So we help on the debt side and we also help in providing net-positive flows to the poorest countries.While in that report, Nigeria was commended for its openness in debt reportage, a major concern for a lot of its citizens is the country's rising debt profile. Considering the work you have done in other countries, what steps would you advise Nigeria's government to take to avert a debt overhang?Based on the numbers that we have, Nigeria's total debt-to-GDP is at 33.3 per cent, which is low compared to other low-income countries; and this actually includes the overdraft from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and other contingent liabilities. So the debt overhang does not seem to be an issue at present for Nigeria. What is important is that new debts that Nigeria incurs (and this potentially could happen given its large needs), should be used in the most effective ways to achieve inclusive growth and should be used in a transparent way, which takes us back to the importance of debt transparency. While total public debt in Nigeria is currently sustainable and external debt levels are actually low by international standards, the country's debt profile is vulnerable to two macroeconomic shocks. Large share of the government's revenues goes towards servicing these debts.While debt service-to-GDP ratio remains high at six per cent, interest payments-to-revenue ratio standing at 37 per cent and with inflation pressures rising all over the world, interest rates are going to go up. So this would be something to watch out for. In terms of the fiscal policy aspect, what Nigeria should be looking at is how to make sure that on the revenue side, it is watching out. That is because half of the revenues are coming from oil and oil revenues are volatile and Nigeria's debt stock would rise rapidly if there is another oil shock. That is a major source of macroeconomic shock. So I think debt transparency is a priority for Nigeria, including the overdrafts from the CBN, which is another issue that we emphasised in the report that Nigeria should adopt.Another priority is to improve the monitoring and evaluation of contingent liabilities from state-owned enterprises and making sure that all are accounted for and published. Then obviously, if you think about the revenue side, given the amount that is already being used to pay for debt service, it leaves little room for other spending. Then, how can we have a better fiscal policy? So policies like reducing petrol subsidy would free up large amount of resources, which I believe is between N2 trillion and N3 trillion.That can free up the resources to fund the public spending on education, housing and poverty reduction and at same time support the energy reform process that would be needed and provide the right kind of outcome in terms of energy needs and provide incentives for renewable energy. In a way, it is like a triple win that you are going to achieve if you free up those resources and you will be using the money more effectively to achieve the development outcomes and at same time, you can also achieve better climate outcomes by reducing the amount of gasol"

The CFA is part of the UK Government's efforts to help South Africa tackle climate change and support a just transition.Projects in the CFA cohort come from a range of sectors including waste management, energy and transport. Some of them will increase sustainable mobility alternatives in cities while reducing emissions, whilst others support the growth of renewable energies in South Africa.To ensure the selected projects are in the best position to attract investment from South African and international financiers, the projects will receive capacity building support in areas such as low-carbon technologies, blending finance from public and private sources, as well as advice on enhancing gender, equality and social inclusion. If they secure funding, the projects will benefit communities across South Africa through pollution abatement, employment opportunities, access to energy, water conservation, improved food safety, and by supporting gender equality and social inclusion efforts.The CFA is funded by the UK government's Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). By bringing together stakeholders who can develop and finance climate projects at scale the CFA will support South Africa's efforts to meet the priorities set out in its Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement.Acting British High Commissioner to South Africa, Adam Bye, said:South Africa's Cabinet recently approved a new more ambitious Nationally Determined Contribution ahead of COP26. To help deliver this level of ambition by 2030 and net zero by mid-century, every sector of the economy will need to develop low-carbon alternatives. I am therefore delighted to see the projects the Climate Finance Accelerator is supporting in its first cohort, including in key sectors like water, sustainable agriculture, waste management and green transport. The CFA's support is all about helping unlock the finance that these and other innovative projects will need as part of delivering green growth and transition.NBI CEO, Joanne Yawitch, a commissioner on the South African Presidential Climate Change Commission (PCCC), said:SA's climate commitments to the UNFCCC in the lead up to COP26 show an enhanced level of ambition, which the private sector can help deliver through the activation of domestic and international finance. This will enable the realisation of investment potential in SA through the active support of climate projects and SMMEs, thereby ensuring our transition is just, inclusive and economically competitive.GreenCape Energy and Climate Finance Program Manager, Jack Radmore, said:The South African ecosystem is perfectly primed for an intervention that supports the country's efforts to implement its Nationally Determined Contribution by bringing together stakeholders that can develop and finance climate projects at scale. If this reorganisation can be done in a ""just"" way, an opportunity arises to address many of the existing social ills through increased investment, new jobs and new skills. This is particularly true when investing in long-term infrastructure projects which will have lasting economic, environmental and socio-economic impacts.The projects have been receiving tailored support ahead of a four-day event at the end of October. The support so far has included individual needs assessment discussions and analysis of each of the projects from financial and technical perspectives. The October event will allow project proponents to further refine their financial structuring through tailored discussions with interested financial institutions. The event will also provide an opportunity for all participants to network and for policymakers and other initiatives in the climate finance space to learn from the landscape mapping findings and recommendations.The CFA projects include:Black Soldier Flies Breeding South Africa \- Providing black soldier fly larvae that can be grown by anybody and used to produce products such as protein meal, insect oil, biodiesel, and soil enhancer.Go-Lectric \- Providing electric scooters to middle and low-income urban commuters as well as the growing short-distance delivery market.

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria419","Kyari advocates 'energy justice' for Africa","The Nation (Nigeria)"," ","Ahead of the commencement of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland next week, the Group Managing Director(GMD)/Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Limited, Mallam Mele Kyari has advocated the consideration of what he calls 'energy justice' in the implementation of energy transition.Discussions on countries transiting to less carbon-intensive energy sources have been gaining momentum in the last few years, with global leaders calling for a shift away from fossil fuels as a critical action towards tackling climate crisis.Speaking at the 17th All Nigerian Editors' Conference in Abuja, where he was Special Guest of Honour, Kyari argued that the wholesale execution of energy transition without regard to the peculiar socio-economic conditions of various countries would cause dislocations that could exacerbate security challenges in developing nations.Kyari, whose paper was entitled: 'Insecurity as it affects the oil and gas sector', maintained that his concept of energy justice was to allow each country, especially developing nations, to progress at their own pace while leveraging on their hydrocarbon resources for smooth transition to Net Zero by 2050.'Talking about energy transition, it is my very well-considered view that there must be energy justice, which means that countries should develop at their own pace while taking into consideration the realities that they face,' Kyari stated.According to the NNPC chief, each nation should be allowed to transit on the basis of their contributions to the carbon emission to the point that, ultimately, there will be justice for all by 2050. 'Energy justice would ensure that as we transit, we are allowed to develop at a pace and in a manner that is just,' Kyari added.The NNPC helmsman also urged the media industry and other stakeholders to champion the cause of energy justice in the global quest for cleaner energy, stressing that gas development remained the only option for Nigeria to achieve energy transition.He said the NNPC management was keen on changing the narrative and getting the refineries back on stream by taking advantage of the free-hand given to the management by President Muhammadu Buhari to do the right thing.On the menace of crude oil and products theft, the NNPC CEO said much progress has been made through collaboration with security agencies.He called for support of the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) and other stakeholders towards reducing insecurity in the industry.Earlier in his welcome address, the President of the Nigeria Guild of Editors, Mr. Mustapha Isah, said the purpose of the conference was to find solution to the various security challenges facing the country.\l"

By funding premiums for drought and tropical cyclone insurance in African countries, Germany is helping to ensure that vulnerable communities are better protected from the escalating risks that they face as a result of the climate crisis.""ARC, an African Union initiative that is led by 35 AU Member States, provides insurance for droughts and tropical cyclones.The ARC said the standard approach to pay for climate disasters is slow and unpredictable, using humanitarian appeals or loans arranged after a disaster strikes, therefore, ARC replaces these outdated approaches by offering governments and humanitarian actors the opportunity to plan and purchase insurance that can provide fast payouts, quickly reaching people who need support.This prevents humanitarian needs from escalating, ultimately saving lives, protecting livelihoods and assets, and safeguarding development gains.About 62 policies have been signed by Member States for cumulative insurance coverage of $720 million for the protection of 72 million vulnerable populations in participating countries since 2014.Given that climate change is threatening to bring more frequent and severe extreme weather events, the Premium Support Facility will be crucial for the most vulnerable African countries.Following the Covid-19 pandemic, many African governments have severely constrained budgets and humanitarian agencies are struggling to meet unprecedented levels of need.This new funding will subsidize insurance premiums, decreasing in future years as countries and organisations are able to take over the costs using their national budgets and long-term sustainable financing.Germany's support will catalyze effective risk management and help protect the poorest and most vulnerable people across the continent.\l"

On behalf of the entire U.S. Mission, I extend our warmest wishes for a healthy, peaceful, and joyous holiday season.At the outset of 2021, we all had high hopes of controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, another variant has come to the centre stage of global concern. However, thanks to renewed global health collaboration efforts, vaccine development and distribution is gradually making headway.At the U.S. Mission, we are fortunate to have dozens of our staff working side-by-side with our Nigerian counterparts to monitor and respond to the pandemic. The strength of our support is reflected in the over $130 million we have contributed towards the COVID-19 health response and the hard work of staff who provide expertise, technical assistance, and logistics support.So far, we have pledged 36 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine to Nigeria \- of which 18 million have been delivered to date, and the balance of 18 million will be shipped in the coming weeks. The pandemic has shown us how interdependent our world is. No one is safe until everyone is safe. Through robust global dialogue and ingenuity, we will continue to build global health security in the new year together.I firmly believe that, together, the world will overcome COVID-19, the same way that we have overcome other global health challenges. Together, we have brought HIV/AIDS to a point where epidemic control is within our reach. We achieved the eradication of the wild poliovirus as all of Africa is now certified as wild poliovirus free. In Nigeria, the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief has invested more than $6 billion in the national HIV/AIDS response, where measures of our success include more than 1.6 million men, women, and children currently on HIV treatment. In partnership with the Federal Ministry of Health, we remain committed to completing the task of placing all people living with HIV on treatment and strengthening capacity and commitment at all levels.In fact, we have many reasons to remain positive about the progress made this year toward our shared goals. This past year, I had many opportunities to engage with Nigerians from all walks of life, from Kebbi to Akwa Ibom, and Ife to Jos. One common theme inevitably prevails \- Nigerians seek a more secure living environment to raise and educate their children, earn a decent living, and strengthen their communities. We have done our utmost to address these concerns through a variety of mechanisms.Countering violent extremism in Nigeria remains a top priority for both our countries. We were proud to support such efforts with the delivery of 12 Super Tucano aircraft, which are already being employed to assist the Nigerian Air Force in their fight against violent extremist organisations. We have also worked with civil society, civilian law enforcement, the judiciary, and corrections officials to combat insecurity, strengthen effective and equitable access to the rule of law and justice, protect human rights, and together create a safer Nigeria.Nigeria is the United States' second-largest trading partner on the continent, and we seek ways to further deepen this vital economic relationship. In 2021, we strengthened this partnership in important sectors such as agriculture, healthcare, information and communication technology, and renewable energy. On this latter issue, together our nations recognised the impact of climate change.We welcomed the commitment of the President (Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) to strive for zero carbon emissions by 2060 at the summit, as the United States agreed to slash methane emissions by 30 per cent by 2030. Separately, we welcomed the arrival in Nigeria of well-respected American brands such as United Airl"

We don't want to use air conditioners. We are also looking at the different environments in Lagos such as heat island, coastal, land field, and sand field. So, you cannot say you want to build the same house on heat island and land fields, or the same house in coastal or flood prone areas. You need specialist designers. In Lagos, we are paying attention to energy, functionality and maintenance.""The one health agenda encompasses environment. The carbon footprint is increasing daily because of the influx of people entering Lagos every time. The state government is here in Glasgow to support the federal climate adaptation and mitigation strategy because if they federal government is able to push the desert back; you will have less people coming from the south. If we are able to plan the required number of trees in Nigeria, stop deforestation, then you are going to make life comfortable for Nigerians in every state in Nigeria which will stop the rural to urban migration. Lagos has a climate adaptation plan breakdown into adaptation and mitigation. So, every agency is developing their own strategy to address mitigation and adaptation. The health ministry is teaming up with the Ministry of environment in a very strategic way because we are aware that the ministry of environment is relevant stakeholder in this effort.""Speaking on the state government's efforts to combat COVID-19 pandemic, he stated that the administration has analysed the three waves in the state, noting that what triggers the increased wave in the state is the influx of people to the state, ""which coincides with the big holidays.""He further explained that in anticipation of the new wave that would come in the Christmas holidays, the state government is putting in place two things; a mass vaccination campaign, where the state government would embark on 8,000 dose vaccination which is four million people before the holidays.He remarked the campaign has already started, while pointing out that they have engaged the private sector to join the campaign because delivering the amount of vaccine involved requires collaboration of public and private sector.He added that the state government is recruiting 100 private sector facilities to participate in the state vaccination campaign.He affirmed that the vaccination would remain free in the public sector, but in the private sector, they need to recoup their cost for administering the vaccine, you are not buying the vaccine, ""but if you go to the private sector would pay for the syringe and manpower, it is a small amount.""\l"

U.S. climate envoy John Kerry will attend a wider Middle East green summit Riyadh is hosting on Monday.Prince Mohammed said the Saudi Green Initiative aims to eliminate 278 million metric tons of carbon emissions per year, up from a previous target of 130 million metric tons.Saudi Arabia in March pledged to reduce carbon emissions by more than 4% of global contributions through initiatives including generating 50% of its energy needs from renewables by 2030 and planting billions of trees in the desert state.Fellow Gulf OPEC producer the United Arab Emirates earlier this month announced a plan for net-zero emissions by 2050.Saudi Arabia has been criticized for acting too slowly, with Climate Action Tracker giving it the lowest possible ranking of 'critically insufficient'.WATCH NOWVIDEO10:35What a future without oil looks like for the Gulf countriesThe kingdom's economy remains heavily reliant on oil income as economic diversification lags ambitions set out by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.Saudi officials have argued the world will continue to need Saudi crude for decades to come.And experts say it is too early to tell what the impact of Saudi's nascent solar and wind projects will be. Its first renewable energy plant opened in April and its first wind farm began generating power in August.Megaprojects, such as futuristic city NEOM, also incorporate green energy plans including a $5 billion hydrogen plant, and Saudi state-linked entities are pivoting to green fundraising.Some investors have expressed concerns over the kingdom's carbon footprint. Others say Saudi Arabia emits the least carbon per barrel of oil and that de facto ruler Prince Mohammed is serious about economic diversification.'Obviously the carbon footprint is an issue. However, we would highlight that realistically carbon is going to be slow to phase out, and oil is here for some time yet,' Tim Ash at BlueBay Asset Management said in emailed comments.\l"
"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria424","Can Africa end deforestation by 2030?","The Nation (Nigeria)"," ","SIR: It is no longer news that 104 participants including Nigeria have given their words at the COP26 World Summit on climate change in Glasgow of Scotland to put an end to sweeping deforestation by 2030 in their countries and achieve a net-zero target by 2060.This pledge by the world leaders reminded me of the words of the British former model, media personality, businesswoman, and activist, Heather Anne Mills who once said,' Eighty per cent of global warming comes from livestock and deforestation'. Prince Charles, who is the British Queen's eldest son, also once said,' Forests are the world's air-conditioning system, the lungs of the planet and we are on the verge of switching it off'.According to the European Space Agency, 25 to 35 percent of climate-changing greenhouse gases come from biomass burning that mostly occurs in the African continent. Some activists have also pointed out that tree-planting may not be the ultimate solution for vehement fight against desertification and climate change in Africa unless authorities provide cheapest clean-burning fuels to the pernicious firewood, kerosene and charcoal for the poorest people of the continent.If one traverses across the continent, he will definitely witness men inside its captivating forests demolishing trees that purify our earth's environments and atmospheres. These trees are burned to make charcoal and sold to illegal charcoal traders here and abroad. African leaders should not pretend to be committed to applying themselves to combating global warming earnestly when majority of their penniless citizens and rural communities are decimating their continent's most gorgeous forests for domestic fuels and illegal charcoal export. So, what sorts of effort are African leaders making to end deforestation and bring alternative to fossil fuels, charcoal and fire-woods?President Buhari-led administration should be commended on the provision of the CBN's N250 billion Intervention Fund for the National Gas Expansion Programme (NGEP) to finance the establishment of gas processing plants, gas cylinder manufacturing plants, Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), CNG primary and secondary compression stations, micro distribution outlets, LPG wholesale outlets and service centres of LPG sales with a view to providing choice for the fuel of transportation, power generation making LPG as the fuel for domestic cooking.The Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) popularly known as cooking gas is considered as the superlative cleanest green form of energy or clean-burning fuel compared to the perilous far-reaching fuels. I was in high spirits when Nigeria's government had announced that its LPG's expansion programme will reach 30 million households by 2025.Nigeria is blessed with a number of hydro-dam projects with huge potential for hydroelectric power generation across the country. These are major sources of renewable energy but are unfortunately neglected. These abandoned hydropower dams include Kafin-Zaki dam, Mambilla dam, Jebba dam, Kiri dam, Oyan River dam, Ikere Gorge dam, Shiroro dam, Dadin-kowa dam, Tiga dam, Challawa Gorge dam, Goronyo dam, Zobe dam, Jebi dam, Obudu dam, Guau dam, Jibiya dam, Bakolori dam, Omi-Kampe dam, to name but a few. When completed, these overlooked multipurpose hydroelectric dams will definitely rejuvenate Nigeria's electricity and galvanise low-income households to migrate from firewood to electric stoves.Nigeria should accelerate the projects of its National Agency of the Great Green Wall (NAGGW) in affected 11 states of the northern part that includes Adamawa, Borno, Kano, Jigawa, Gombe, Bauchi, Katsina, Zamfara, Kebbi, Sokoto and Yobe. The NAGGW was created to halt climate change, reverse land degradation or desertification in those states by 2025. The restoration is expected to cover 1,500km square across those affected 11 states in the North.I call on African leaders to create special corps to fight against illegal tree logging in the forests to rescue them from shrinking. Nigeria should lift taxes on the LPG and strive to make it an available and cheapest commodity for impoverished people across the country. As pledged by President Buhari, the abandoned hydro-dam projects should be completed on the spot with a view to invigorating electricity and migrating to electric stoves.\l"

But a report issued in September by the UN noted climate commitments were so weak that even if pledges are fulfilled temperatures will still rise about 2.7C this century.This would unleash far more devastating effects than those already hammering countries around the world, from raging floods to out-of-control wildfires and super-storms.""The world is on a catastrophic pathway to 2.The cash part of that slogan is particularly tricky. Rich countries failed to deliver on a promise made at a previous climate summit to pay poorer ones $100 billion a year in climate finance by 2020 -- an amount that covers neither the costs of adapting to changes nor greening economies.Delegates from poor and vulnerable countries, some of whom are reportedly unable to attend the summit because of coronavirus restrictions and the cost of travel, are also calling for rich polluters to pay for losses and damages from climate change-fueled weather extremes they have done little to cause.Read also:COP26: Success for Africa is holding rich nations to their climate finance pledgesThis is all we hear from our so-called leaders -- words that sound great but so far have not led to action,"" said climate activist Greta Thunberg at a pre-COP event in Italy last month. Our hopes and ambitions drown in their empty promises.""Time is running outAccording to a report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the world has less than 10 years left to avoid potentially catastrophic impacts of a warming planet.""The next 10-20 years will be critical to the survivability of the human species on the planet,"" the report notedAbout 70 countries so far have indicated they plan to achieve carbon neutrality goals by 2050.However, the report noted that the world's biggest economies responsible for 80 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions must lead the way in taking urgent action to avoid climate catastrophe.""Saving this and future generations is a common responsibility. We are on the verge of the precipice. Wake up. Unite,"" UN chief Guterres told world leaders in September.Reasons for hopeWhile the grim reality of the climate emergency continues to become ever clearer, there is optimism its worst effects can still be avoided.""The recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was a code red for humanity. But it also made clear that it is not too late to meet the Paris Agreement 1.5-degree target. We have the tools to achieve this target. But we are rapidly running out of time,"" said Guterres.\l"

Communities are planting resilient and hardy tree species such as the Acacia senegal, providing gum arabic, widely used as an emulsifier in food and drinks and the Gao tree or Faidherbia albida, which helps to fertilise soil for the cultivation of such staples as millet, and for animal fodder.With technical support from FAO, more than 500 communities have seen improved food security and income generation opportunities. The total area the GGW programme encompasses remains limited, with only 4 million hectares out of a targeted 100 million, according to the study.A total of some 20 billion dollars has been pledged internationally to support the scaling up of the Great Green Wall programme, including USD 14.3 billion at a One Planet summit for biodiversity held in Paris in January this year and USD 1 billion from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos at the just-concluded COP26 climate conference.Concrete details of how these funds can be accessed are yet to be clearly mapped out, says Sacande, adding that unless some of the funding is delivered urgently, it could be too late for planting to catch the limited rainfall expected in June and July.With its potential for carbon sequestration and restoring biodiversity and its emphasis on the socio-economic benefits to the impoverished communities inhabiting the region, the GGW straddles the key areas of climate mitigation, adaptation and resilience. It also addresses Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1 (No poverty), 2 (No hunger), 13 (Climate action), 15 (Life on land) and 17 (Partnerships)) in the UN's Agenda 2030.The armed conflicts pervading the region have long made some wary about its potential. And the study finds that about 50 per cent of the land area involved is currently inaccessible for security reasons. But even taking this into account, land restoration interventions still represent a viable business proposition, the authors say.FAO's contributions to the Great Green WallSupport for the implementation of GGW forms a key part of FAO's Action Against Desertification work, which is active in 10 GGW Sahel countries and involves establishing basel"

The Environmentalist spoke at the 2021 World Habitat Day with the theme, ""Accelerating Urban Action for a Carbon-free World, organised by the Nigerian Institute of Architects, Akwa Ibom State Chapter.He lamented that unbridled flaring of associated gas poses threats to the climate, environment, human health, and agricultural production, adding that oil spillages equally add to the crisis through the dumping of highly volatile hydrocarbon products into the environment.""It is often stated that cities are responsible for some 70 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions with transport, buildings, energy, and waste management accounting for the bulk of urban greenhouse gas emissions.COP26 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the world has been regaled with a vision of a ""net-zero"" carbon future.""While making supreme effort not to jump into the carbon-neutral or net-zero arguments at this point, it is pertinent to state that the concepts require considerable unpacking as they centre on needed climate action and are embedded in the theme of the Day.""Besides carbon dioxide, other gases of concern in the atmosphere are methane and nitrous oxides. Ozone is also a greenhouse gas but is found mostly in the stratosphere and is useful in absorbing and preventing harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun from reaching the earth.""Global warming occurs due to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Heat comes from the sun in long waves, but when bounced off the earth they go up in short waves. Whereas the short waves pass through the atmosphere without resistance, the greenhouse gases trap some of the long waves trying to exit the atmosphere. This means that we do need greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, otherwise we would freeze. The trouble is that when the concentration of the greenhouse gases gets higher than they ought to be, we set the stage to be roasted.""Also, the Chairman, Akwa Ibom State Chapter of Nigerian Institute of Architects, Dr Enobong Ekwere, said that the event was organized to set the ball rolling for public discourse on how to accelerate action for a carbon-free world in our own local space.Ekwere added that the discussions would give direction on how professionals in the built environment can participate on ensuring the reduction of carbon footprints in our localities.

Fr. Andrew Obiyan, in his sermon at the interdenominational service, declared that no other being could take the place of God, while maintaining that God remains the Almighty, and he urged the people not to despise God.Okunbor, a 1984 graduate of UNIBEN, who is an indigene of Edo State, said in his 15-page lecture: 'I believe oil and gas will remain in the energy mix for some decades to come. This is partly a consequence of the time needed for renewables to reach the necessary level of materiality. In part, it is also a consequence of the lack of substitution options in some parts of the economy.'The world will need to meet its energy needs, at the same time as it tackles climate change. Not only do we require increasing levels of energy, due to our population increase, industrialisation and economic goals, we also generate over 90 per cent of our external foreign exchange earnings from the sale of oil and gas resources.'The planned, gradual and global transitioning, away from oil and gas, is therefore cause for quick strategic thinking and collective action.'Okunbor also stated that the ongoing energy transition, as with other transitions, would be a journey that would involve multiple approaches, collective action and undoubtedly present new challenges and opportunities.He said: 'Nigeria is well positioned to ride the wave of the current energy transition with its abundance of natural fossil fuels and renewable solar energy. We need to move with a greater sense of urgency and a clear sense of direction.'World leaders have just signed a climate pact at the recently-concluded United Nations Climate Change Conference () in Glasgow, United Kingdom. This underscores how very topical and critical the energy transition is.'The impact of energy is far reaching, affecting every single human being. Energy goes hand in hand with economic activities. It lights, heats and cools our homes and places of work. Energy transports and connects people and goods through various modes of transportation. It is also useful in agriculture and in the manufacture of steel, cement, plastics and medicines, among others. The current energy transition drive will be the single largest technological revolution known to mankind.'Okunbor also pointed out that UNIBEN, as one of the foremost universities in Nigeria, had played significant roles in research, education and advocacy, but challenged the higher institution to deepen the roles in this era of massive investments in low-carbon energy options and the rapid build-out of technologies that had never been deployed in the country.Shell chief stressed that he looked to see the academia and graduates of UNIBEN who would build low-carbon technologies and lead Nigeria into the emerging decades, where renewable energy would take a more prominent role in the energy mix, thereby creating more economic opportunities for Nigeria and Nigerians.The newly-installed tenth substantive Chancellor of UNIBEN, Prof. James Ortese Lorzua Ayatse, the Tor Tiv, in his closing remarks, described the higher institution as an excellent university that had carved a niche for itself nationally and internationally.The first-class monarch, who is a two-time Vice-Chancellor of two Nigerian federal universities and Chancellor of a state university, admonished Nigerians and friends of the country to always seek God, the owner of the universe; pray continually and be team players.The10th Vice-Chancellor of UNIBEN, Prof. Lilian Salami, who is also the Co-Chairperson of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors of Nigerian Universities, and the newly-elected Vice-President of the Association of African Universities, earlier in her welcome address, described the higher institution as the best university in the world.Mrs Salami, who is the second female helmsman of UNIBEN, after Prof. Grace Alele-Williams, also disclosed that God used great men and women to pilot the affairs of the institution that was established on November 23, 1970, describing the managing director of SPDC as a successful alumnus of UNIBEN.\l"

All G7 countries have committed to enhance contributions in the next five years, including scaling up finance for adaptation and nature. At the G7 Summit in June, new pledges amounting to $4 billion per year in additional finance were made by major economies.With fewer than 50 days to go until the UK-hosted COP26 Summit, the Prime Minister will ask world leaders to build on the work that has already been done and get public and private finance flowing so that the climate finance target can finally be met. The leaders attending today's meeting, both virtually and in-person, are from both the world's richest economies and those countries most vulnerable to climate change.The UK has already committed \£311.6 billion in international climate finance over the next five years, twice the previous five-year commitment.

It is an opportunity to talk, to engage and I think that we really need to engage. I think we need to just change the direction of the conversation, especially as it affects Africa and then talk in concrete terms about what the implications of net-zero emissions by 2050 or whenever, will mean for Africa and the world.""We drew up an energy transition plan and we are probably one of the few developing countries to have drawn up a plan and try to cost the plan; this is why we have the figure of 400 billion dollars. If you look at what can work, we are looking at Nigerian Climate Change Finance Facility. There's one which we are working on at the moment with the African Finance Corporation (AFC), and ARM Harith; we are trying to create that facility. We think that we could mobilise up to 10 billion dollars to finance local green projects.""Osinbajo further said that the federal government was also on the verge of operationalising InfraCo, a N15 trillion Infrastructure Fund.According to him, the fund could have a dedicated green finance component as well as projects to reduce emissions from main pollutant activities in Nigeria.""There are other initiatives that we are working on, and one of those is being able to exploit our gas resources for as long as it is possible because it is an important issue for us and thereafter, a diversified economy, especially around technology. That would help us a great deal in being able to secure a significant amount of money,"" he addedIn his submission, former UK Prime Minister, Tony Blair, called for a new partnership with Africa on Climate Change.He noted that it is going to be necessary to use gas as a transitional fuel, and doing that is essential, not only for development, but also for the environment.According to him, the partnership will also help put the projects for clean energy and development in Africa on an investable footing.His words: ""The partnership will also help put the projects for clean energy and development in Africa on an investable footing. When people invest in Africa, the rates of returns are very good and the risks are not as great as people think they are. It is an important forum to talk about what we really could do in concrete terms. I really like the idea of a new partnership with Africa on climate change because a lot of the conversations going on about climate change are over the heads of many of us in Africa because the issues that concern us are not on the table.""\l"

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria438","Amid planned petrol subsidy removal, Obasanjo says Nigeria must commit to renewable energy","November 27, 2021 Saturday","The Punch","Kayode Oyero Published 26 November 2021Amid the unpopular plans by the Federal Government to raise electricity tariff in December and remove petrol subsidy next February, former President Olusegun Obasanjo has said that Nigeria must commit to generating power from renewable energy and clean carbon-free sources.He stated this on Friday in his remarks at the formal inauguration of the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library 2MW solar power project in Abeokuta, Ogun State.Nigerians mainly generate power for domestic and industrial use through electricity supplied by the distribution companies, which has been epileptic for years. The use of petrol and diesel to fuel generating sets has been an option adopted by many in the face of the monstrous power challenges confronting Africa's most populous nation with over 200 million people.However, the Federal Government recently announced its plans to remove subsidy on Premium Motor Spirit popularly called petrol beginning February 2022. The government also disclosed that it would pay N5,000 each to 40 million Nigerians to cushion the effect of fuel subsidy removal, a move that has been widely criticised.According to the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited, Mele Kyari, petrol would sell for between N320 and N340 per litre from February 2022.The current pump price of petrol at filling stations is between N162 and N165/litre, although the product is mostly sold at the upper N165/litre rate due to recent challenges in the downstream oil sector.Similarly, the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission has said that it would review the country's power tariffs by next month, barring any unforeseen. This means electricity users would pay more when this is implemented.Many Nigerians have lamented the untold hardship and reactionary inflation the development would bring as the Nigeria Labour Congress and other pressure groups have voiced their grievances but the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has been unyielding despite the public outcry.At the launch of the solar project on Friday, Obasanjo, who was Nigeria's democratically elected President from 1999 to 2007 and military head of state between 1976 and 1979, said renewable energy is cheaper and good for the environment.He said, ""Today, I am speaking to you in a facility powered by the sun \- solar energy. It is the way of a future Carter envisioned all those years ago. It will help build the future we want. The Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library solar power project is a reflection of our commitment to clean and renewable energy and is the single largest investment this not-for-profit organization has made.""As large an investment as it is, it is remarkably cost effective. It costs less than two and half years supply of diesel to power our generators. So in diesel terms it pays for itself in less than 3years. So in effect the electricity it produces after three years is almost at no cost.""In addition, because it is not emitting any green houses gases that diesel generators do, it has the potential to earn carbon credits which are currently priced at US$ 40/ton.""Based on estimated annual production of 2,307,000 kilo Watt hours per year, we can expect to earn nearly US$39,589 in carbon credits per year.""By monetizing this facility with strategic sponsorships and marketing alliances we will be able to generate revenue.""Combined, this solar facility can generate electricity, generate revenues that contribute to the upkeep of the library, help save the planet making a small contribution to climate mitigation and adaptation, provide shade for parking, and be an inspiration for future generations. Who says you can't make a profit out of saving the planet?""Obasanjo, 84, said that he is a responsible steward for nature, adding that the ""facility marks one of the enduring personal legacies I am proud to be call my own.""Continuing, the ex-president said, ""The recently concluded UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) was attended by over 1,000 universities from 68 countries, who witnessed powerful speeches and renewed commitments to reach Net Zero emissions by 2050, in some cases 2060 and in Nigeria's case 2070. This is the best time for all Nigerian universities to sign-up to the United Nations' Race to Zero campaign, and commit to reducing their carbon emissions to zero by 2050 at the latest.""We hope that by committing to consume renewable energy we inspire others to follow and still inform others to do their bit for the environment. Our great nation also needs to commit to producing our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon-free sources. This goal is achievable, affordable and transformative. It represents a challenge to all Nigerians \- in every walk of life, to our political leaders, entrepreneurs, innovators, engineers, and to every citizen.""This is a generational moment. I'm asking each of you to join me and build this future. Our success depends on our willingness as a people to undertake this journey. We have a duty of care to the planet and to every person upon it. We must fulfill it by making our energy system clean, efficient, affordable and sustainable.""\l"

Adesina has highlighted the importance of stopping desertification in Africa's Sahel and turning the region green.Adesina spoke at a high-level side event held on Monday 1 November, on the Great Green Wall initiative during the ongoing UN global climate conference, COP26, in Glasgow, Scotland. The event was co-hosted by His Royal Highness Prince of Wales, French President Emmanuel Macron and Mauritanian President Ould Ghazaouni.The African Development Bank is a major partner in this bold project, which involves building an 8,000 km long and 15 km wide swathe of trees, grasslands, vegetation and plants across the Sahel. It will restore degraded land and help inhabitants of the Sahel produce food, create jobs and promote peace. Yesterday's gathering focused on marshalling efforts to scale up implementation of the project as a critical nature-based solution to climate change in Africa.Adesina thanked HRH The Prince of Wales for what he said was the Prince's global leadership and lifetime commitment to safeguarding nature and the environment.He also also commended French President Emmanuel Macron for his passion and leadership on climate issues, especially in Africa, and for appointing him as a Global Champion for the Great Green Wall initiative, to help mobilize financing for it. He said the French president's leadership in convening the One Planet Summit for Biodiversity earlier in the year and his call for commitment to accelerate actions had been a turning point for the Great Green Wall for the Sahel and the Sahara.The African Development Bank chief applauded the leadership and commitment of all African heads of state on the Great Green Wall.""The Great Green Wall is not a wall that divides. It is a wall that unites  uniting livelihoods, resilience, and adaptation against climate change,"" Adesina said.Adesina said desertification, obliteration by sand dunes, and droughts, had continued to pummel vast areas of the Sahara and the Sahel. ""Life is unbearable, so people migrate, populations are displaced, conflicts are aggravated as previously co-existing communities of farmers and herders engage in relentless battles over declining communal resources,"" he explained. He said that for the millions of people in the region, it was either they adapt or see the disappearance of Sahel.The African Development Bank has committed to mobilize $6.5 billion towards the Great Green Wall initiative, by 2025. This is 45% of the $14.5 billion that development partners committed to the initiative at the One Planet Summit in Paris. It also represents 20% of the $33 billion needed to deliver on the 10-year priority investments of the Great Green Wall by 2030.The Bank chief said his institution was delivering on its commitment through several projects, including $2 billion for the Desert-to-Power program to deliver universal access to electricity in the G5 Sahel countries (Niger, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Burkina Faso) via solar power. The Green Climate Fund recently approved $150 million towards this project. The Bank is also mobilizing $2 billion for digital climate advisory services, as part of the African Adaptation Acceleration Program. And yet a third is $1 billion from the Bank's Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation to deploy climate resilient technologies at scale to millions of farmers.Distributed by APO Group on behalf of African Development Bank Group (AfDB).Media Contact:Richard UkuCommunication and External Relations DepartmentAfrican Development Bankemail: [email protected]About the African Development Bank Group:The African Development Bank (AfDB) Group is Africa's premier development finance institution.

On behalf of the entire US Mission, I extend our warmest wishes for a healthy, peaceful, and joyous holiday season.'At the outset of 2021, we all had high hopes of controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, another variant has come to the center stage of global concern. However, thanks to renewed global health collaboration efforts, vaccine development and distribution are gradually making headway.'At the US Mission, we are fortunate to have dozens of our staff working side by side with our Nigerian counterparts to monitor and respond to the pandemic. The strength of our support is reflected in the over $130 million we have contributed towards the COVID-19 health response and the hard work of staff who provide expertise, technical assistance, and logistics support. So far, we have pledged 36 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine to Nigeria  of which 18 million have been delivered to date, and the balance of 18 million will be shipped in the coming weeks. The pandemic has shown us how interdependent our world is. No one is safe until everyone is safe. Through robust global dialogue and ingenuity, we will continue to build global health security in the new year together.'I firmly believe that, together, the world will overcome COVID-19, the same way that we have overcome other global health challenges. Together, we have brought HIV/AIDS to a point where epidemic control is within our reach. We achieved the eradication of the wild poliovirus as all of Africa is now certified as wild poliovirus-free. In Nigeria, the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) has invested more than $6 billion in the national HIV/AIDS response, where measures of our success include more than 1.6 million men, women, and children currently on HIV treatment. In partnership with the Federal Ministry of Health, we remain committed to completing the task of placing all people living with HIV on treatment and strengthening capacity and commitment at all levels.'In fact, we have many reasons to remain positive about the progress made this year toward our shared goals. This past year, I had many opportunities to engage with Nigerians from all walks of life, from Kebbi to Akwa Ibom, and Ife to Jos. One common theme inevitably prevails \- Nigerians seek a more secure living environment to raise and educate their children, earn a decent living, and strengthen their communities. We have done our utmost to address these concerns through a variety of mechanisms.'Countering violent extremism in Nigeria remains a top priority for both our countries.

In fact, the Ministers noted, that as the global economy moves from under the shadow of the coronavirus pandemic, the resulting shortage of gas from Europe to Asia demonstrates the need for further investments in natural gas as a cheap, abundant, and flexible source of energy to achieve energy equality for all parts of the world in a sustainable manner.The Ministers commended the heightened interest in natural gas at the recently-concluded Conference of Parties (), where several world leaders backed gas as the harbinger to their nations' economic and sustainable development. As an Observer to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the GECF had urged the international community in Glasgow to look to gas as the solution to achieve the right balance between post-Covid-19 economic and social requirements and environmental constraints.Furthermore, the GECF Members acknowledged that decarbonisation of economies should be approached with careful consideration to hasty acceleration of greening of economies lest the climate agenda turns into an energy crisis. While noting that high gas prices are not in the interest of buyers or the sellers, the Ministers reiterated the fundamental role of long-term gas contracts and the gas pricing based on oil/ oil products indexation to ensure stable investments in the development of natural gas resources.In his opening remarks, HE Franklin Molina Ortiz shared his vision for the gas industry's development as well as the increasingly crucial role of the GECF as a platform for dialogue between producers and consumers of gas and all other stakeholders of the global energy system.HE Yury Sentyurin, Secretary General of the GECF, presented the traditional Management Report of the Secretariat, which included the plethora of activities undertaken in the past 12 months in order to realise the spirit and actions of the 2019 Malabo Declaration, the GECF Statute, its Long-Term Strategy, the 5-Year Working Plan, and the 2020 and 2021 Programmes of Work.The Ministers received a preview of the 2021 edition of the GECF's flagship publication, Global Gas Outlook 2050, which will be unveiled on the sidel"

Globally, the practice has persisted since oil production started over 160 years ago. Nigeria is a leading offender, despite gas flaring being illegal since 2005.The toxic fumes cause many environmental and health problems, and the practice increases the risk of global warming. ''Gas flaring occurs due to poor regulation and commitment to tackle the problem. Both characterise Nigeria's oil-rich Niger Delta region'', says the security expert.According to Ojewale, ''recent gas flaring satellite\\xa0data reveals that Nigeria has remained one of the top seven countries since 2012. These states produce 40% of the world's oil each year and account for 65% of global gas flaring.''Between 2016 and 2020, Nigeria flared 1 252.26 trillion cubic feet of natural gas into the atmosphere, according to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation's monthly oil and gas\\xa0reports. ''In 2005, Nigeria's courts ruled that oil companies stop flaring gas in the Niger Delta. The judgment was made in a case filed by the Iwherekan community against Shell Petroleum Development Company, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and Nigeria's Attorney General. The court held that gas flaring was unconstitutional as it violated people's right to life and dignity.''Gas flaring is the\\xa0second most destructive environmental pollutant in the Niger Delta after oil spillage. The crude combustion process of illicit gas flaring releases substantial greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.''Engineering techniques or scientific controls that could break down the hydrocarbon gas levels and lessen environmental harm aren't used. The health and livelihoods effects have been most\\xa0severe for the poor and politically marginalised communities in the Niger Delta.''Continuing, the ISS expert says around two million people\\xa0live within a 4 km radius of gas flaring sites, exposing them to cancer, asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, neurological and reproductive health challenges, and deformities in children.''Agricultural production in the Niger Delta is also impeded by gas flaring.

Titled ""From Pollution to Solution: A global assessment of marine litter and plastic pollution,"" the report shows that there is a growing threat across all ecosystems, from source to sea.But it also shows that there is the know-how to reverse the mounting crisis, provided the political will is there, and urgent action is taken.The document is being released 10 days ahead of the start of the crucial UN Climate Conference, COP26, stressing that plastics are a climate problem as well.Addressing solutions to the problem, the authors highlighted chances of recycling out of the plastic pollution crisis.They warned against damaging alternatives, such as bio-based or biodegradable plastics, which currently posed a threat similar to conventional plastics.The report looks at critical market failures, such as the low price of virgin fossil fuel feedstocks (any renewable biological material that can be used directly as a fuel) compared to recycled materials, disjointed efforts in informal and formal plastic waste management, and the lack of consensus on global solutions.The assessment calls for immediate reduction in plastic production and consumption, and encourages a transformation across the whole value chain.It also asks for investments in far more robust and effective monitoring systems to identify the sources, scale and fate of plastic, a shift to circular approaches and more alternatives are necessary.Executive Director of UNEP, Inger Andersen, said ""this assessment provides the strongest scientific argument to date for the urgency to act, and for collective action to protect and restore our oceans, from source to sea.""She said that a major concern is what happens with breakdown products, such as microplastics and chemical additives, which are known to be toxic and hazardous to human and wildlife health and ecosystems.""The speed at which ocean plastic pollution is capturing public attention is encouraging. It is vital that we use this momentum to focus on the opportunities for a clean, healthy and resilient ocean,"" Andersen said.Currently, plastic accounts for 85 per cent of all marine litter.By 2040, it will nearly triple, adding 23-37 million metric tons of waste into the ocean per year.

That's not a bad thing. However, it makes us less aware of our environment. We can't see how much climate change is taking place right before us. We move past the subject because it does not interfere with our daily city life or has yet to interfere significantly. However, many are already suffering the negative impacts of climate change.As the world recovers from the unsettling effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the agricultural sector should be a beacon of hope to the 490 million Africans living in extreme poverty. But unfortunately, climate change threatens smallholder farming on the continent. According to a UN International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) report, climate change could reduce staple crops by 80 per cent in eight African countries by 2050. In simple English, we will have less food if we do not address climate change.Smallholder farmers in Africa and South Asia suffer the most from climate change, despite contributing the least to it. These farmers produce about one-third of the world's food and up to 80 per cent in some parts of Africa and Asia. Burundi and Congo (DRC) top the list of countries with food insecurity while having near-zero carbon emissions. Today, less than two per cent of global finance supports these farmers.In an interview with Ventures Africa, Enock Chikava, interim Director, Agricultural development at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, explained the reason for this shortfall. ""Africa has a lot more people involved in agriculture. More than 50 per cent of its population are into farming,"" said Chikava. ""For example, 92 per cent of Burundi's population depends on agriculture; 65 per cent of Ethiopia and 42 per cent of Malawi. Compare that with Australia, where only 2.6 per cent of employment comes from agriculture, or the USA where it's 1.4 per cent. Most funding comes from these Western countries where smallholder farming is not as widely practised.""Enock ChikavaAccording to a report by Nature, 75 per cent of the climate finance has gone to projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These mitigation projects should align with projects helping people adapt to climate change. The UN estimates that developing countries already need $70 billion per year to cover adaptation costs and will need $140 billion\- $300 billion in 2030. ""This is why we raise awareness on the centrality of agriculture"", said Chikava. ""Particularly, for hundreds of millions of farmers whose lives and economies depend on agriculture. Climate change is affecting agriculture, livelihoods and economic progress. When you think like that, you'll want to do something about it.""When crop yields decl"

This would help achieve our collective climate goals, and bring stability and fairness for cross-border business.""Unfortunately, we are not yet there,"" adding that leaders gathering in Glasgow next month for the United Nations' climate conference should make solving this problem a priority.She also tasked the WTO, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), to work together to find solutions that could mitigate the impact of global warming in the absence of globally accepted agreement by offering governments their, ""insights on a common methodological approach to carbon pricing.""""We also have a responsibility to address the needs of least developed and developing countries, to enable a just transition towards environmentally sustainable economies and societies. Joining forces to propose a common approach to global carbon pricing is the way forward. We owe it to the planet and its people. We have no time to waste,"" the WTO boss added.Furthermore, Okonjo-Iweala noted that there were different ways to price carbon and acknowledged that competing ideas and approaches would spur learning and innovation.She, however, warned that, ""fragmentation risks generating trade frictions and unpredictability for businesses seeking to decarbonise. Worse, it could weaken the effectiveness of global efforts to mitigate climate change.""The director-general also highlighted the concerns of developing countries, especially their fear that border carbon adjustment could become a pretext for protectionism aimed at their exports when they are not the core problem.She illustrated this concern by noting that Africa contributed roughly three per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, adding that this perspective has made poor regions of the world see the calls for, ""border carbon adjustment measures"" as unfair.She also observed that the prevailing notion was that raising the price of carbon in one market risked shifting investment and production to places where carbon prices are lower or non-existent. ""The fear is that carbon-constrained countries would suffer job and industry losses, with global emissions unchanged because polluting production is simply occurring elsewhere.""This is no argument against carbon pricing. In every sphere of our economy, production and consumption are guided by price signals. Unfortunately, carbon has too often been an exception, though this is starting to change. Indeed, more than 60 different carbon pricing schemes already exist globally, though they cover only 22 per cent of total emissions.""The challenge comes from the inconsistency of carbon pricing systems. Prices vary from less than $1 per tonne of CO2 in Ukraine to more than $130 per tonne in Sweden. Each subnational, national, or regional system works differently and has different sectoral coverage. Prices are often too low, considering the estimate by the Stern-Stiglitz Commission on Carbon Pricing that somewhere between $50 and $100 per tonne of CO2 is required to meet Paris Agreement temperature targets,"" she said.\l"

How can we cultivate and nurture understanding amongst the people? How can we drive implementation at the grassroots, especially for those that are most affected by climate change? How can we coordinate an implementation platform for both state and non-state actors?It will be recalled that on Thursday, November 18, 2021, the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), signed into law the Climate Change Bill, which was passed by the National Assembly, having earlier promised the world \- at the UNFCCC COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland \- that Nigeria was committed to a net-zero carbon target by 2060. This piece of legislation will have far-reaching multi-sectoral impact because it is set to provide the legal framework for achieving Nigeria's long-term climate goals including a net-zero carbon emissions target, national climate resilience, requisite climate finance, inclusive green and sustainable economic development and the adoption of climate action into national governance priorities.David Michael, Executive-Director of GIFSEP and moderator of the workshop, reiterated the position of the CSOs. ""For us, we are looking at those areas where we can come in and assist and be partners with the government. We are very happy with the government for taking the bold step to sign the climate change bill into law. It is a bold step that will help to combat climate change in Nigeria, so we are here not just celebrating but we are here to look at the law itself and see how best we can be part of it. Also, how we can step it down to the state and local communities, as we know that most things are being done at the federal level.""At the state, we believe that many people don't even know that climate change has become law and so we hope that all the other state governments can also domesticate the law as it should be. Climate change affects everyone not just in Abuja, even in the state so the need to domesticate the law as soon as possible is important.

The summit will help address many of today's global challenges, in particular on COVID-19, where today the UK has announced it will donate 100 million vaccination doses to global efforts to overcome the pandemic, as part of an overall G7 commitment to share one billion doses.""I also look forward to the Summit further strengthening international cooperation on climate change, and to taking action to ensure that every girl in the world can access at least 12 years of quality education. Improving girls' access to education is a fundamental building block for growing Nigeria's economy and workforce and to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals.""\l"
"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria456","The climate crisis will not be fixed by causing an energy crisis in Africa","Business Day"," ","Dire warnings of the end of the world are as old as civilization itself. But each year as the countdown to the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP) begins, they grow in volume and intensity. Recently, senior United Nations officials raised the alarm of ""world conflict and chaos"" and mass migrations and institutional collapse should greenhouse gas emissions remain unchecked for much longer.Mankind has a duty to act on these dangers. But because of their seriousness we must not do so rashly. It is an inconvenient truth, but energy solutions proposed by those most eager to address the climate crisis are fuel for the instability of which they warn.5 billion by 2050--by 2100 Nigeria alone is projected to have the second largest population on the planet--this ""great doubling"" (for Nigeria, quadrupling) has the right to more dependable electricity than their forebears.Without extra and stable power, we cannot build the factories that will transform Africa from a low-job, extractives-led economy to a high employment middle-income continent. Children cannot learn for longer and better by battery light any more than by candlelight. No more than the Africa of today, the Africa of tomorrow cannot advance using energy production that intermittently delivers. Wind and solar, the most fashionable of modern energy technologies, are flawed by their reliance on back-up diesel generators or batteries for when there is no wind for the turbines or sun for the panels.It also seems unnoticed that in our global rush for electric cars we risk replacing the last century's scramble for fossil fuels with a new global race in lithium for batteries. Where significant deposits are to be found, such as in Africa, this could endanger geopolitical stability. This makes the economic migrations the U.N. warned of more likely.But there are certain things we can and must do--starting with transitioning to cleaner, but consistent, energy production. Fossil fuel power generation that can provide electricity 24 hours a day in all conditions can be re-tooled to be greener through carbon capture and the conversion of coal and heavy fuel oil power stations to biomass. We can bring forward new technologies such as mini-hydro power plants which can operate and produce power day and night along shallow waterways without damaging the aquatic life on which local communities are sustained.We can also invest in nuclear energy. Though not renewable it is carbon neutral and capable of producing base load, constant electricity production on which sustained economic progress can be built. Nigeria is among a handful of African countries exploring nuclear power, with a research reactor already operational.nd we can also learn from our friends in Europe and America who do not always practice what they preach. We call on them to lift the moratorium they have placed on fossil fuel investments in Africa. Nigeria has pledged to eliminate illegal gas flaring by 2030--a by-product of our oil industry--and harness it for electricity production. Our intention to end Nigeria's single greatest contribution to greenhouse emissions may stall without it. Yet there are no such limitations on investment in natural gas power in the West where it is considered a transitional energy source.There is a deal to be done at COP26, but none without the agreement of the nations of Africa. The climate warnings we hear them. We live them. But no one has the right to deny the advancement of our continent. Yet unless the developed world wakes up, we run the risk of trying to fix the climate crisis with an energy crisis.Muhammadu Buhari is the President of Nigeria.\l"
"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria457","Except Buhari, Other Nigerian Leaders Interfered in NNPC Operations, Says Kyari","October 23, 2021","This Day (Lagos)","After working with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) for roughly three decades, the Group Managing Director of the national oil company, Mallam Mele Kyari, has disclosed that aside from President Muhammadu Buhari, other Nigerian political leaders in the past interfered in the corporation's operations.Speaking at the 17th All Nigerian Editors' Conference which was held in Abuja, where he was Special Guest of Honour, Kyari described the development as historic, stressing that it was the first time the corporation was being allowed to operate professionally.Buhari was Nigeria's Military Head of State between 1983 and 1985 and was Minister of Petroleum in the late 70s, a position he currently retains even as civilian president. The NNPC was established in 1977, about 44 years ago.A statement by Spokesman of the corporation, Mr. Garba Muhammad, indicated that Kyari spoke at the event which held at the NAF Conference Centre organised by the Nigeria Guild of Editors (NGE) themed: 'Media in Times of Crisis: Resolving Conflicts, Achieving Consensus'.On the NNPC's refineries and the role they play in ensuring energy security for the country, the GMD said the NNPC management under his leadership was keen on changing the narrative and getting the refineries back on stream.According to him, this will be made easier by taking advantage of the ""free-hand"" given to the management by the president to ""do the right thing"".""This is the first time in history that NNPC and its subsidiaries are allowed to do things the way things should be done. Now, I can confirm to you that we have taken responsibility and we will fix the refineries.""We have started the process, contractors have been mobilised to the Port Harcourt refinery; while the same process for Warri and Kaduna refineries will conclude by the end of this year,"" he declared.On the menace of crude oil and products theft, the NNPC CEO said much progress had been made through collaboration with security agencies and called for the support of the editors and other stakeholders towards reducing insecurity within the oil and gas industry.On the issue of energy transition, ahead of the commencement of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties () in Glasgow, Scotland next week, the GMD advocated the consideration of what he described as ""energy justice"" in the implementation of the transition.Discussions on countries transitioning to less carbon-intensive energy sources have been gaining momentum in the last few years, with global leaders calling for a shift away from fossil fuels as a critical action towards tackling the climate crisis.Kyari argued that wholesale execution of energy transition without regard to the peculiar socio-economic conditions of various countries would cause dislocations that could exacerbate security challenges in developing nations.Speaking on: 'Insecurity as it Affects the Oil and Gas Sector', the NNPC boss maintained that his concept of energy justice was to allow each country, especially developing nations, to progress at their own pace while leveraging on their hydrocarbon resources for smooth transition to Net Zero by 2050.""Talking about energy transition, it is my very well-considered view that there must be energy justice, which means that countries should develop at their own pace while taking into consideration the realities that they face,"" Kyari stated.According to him, individual nations should be allowed to transit on the basis of their contributions to carbon emission to the point that ultimately, there will be justice for all by 2050.""Energy justice would ensure that as we transit, we are allowed to develop at a pace and in a manner that is just,"" Kyari added.Kyari also urged the media industry and other stakeholders to champion the cause of energy justice in the global quest for cleaner energy, stressing that gas development remained the only option for Nigeria to achieve energy transition.Earlier in his welcome address, the President of the NGE, Mr. Mustapha Isah, said the purpose of the conference was to find solutions to the various security challenges facing the country.Isah also called on all stakeholders to rise up to the insecurity challenge by giving their best in defence of the nation.\l"

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria461","Who will write the unbiased history of Nigeria","December 2, 2021 Thursday","The Sun (Nigeria)","My last week's article entitled ''Africa, the Dark Continent'' prompted a lot of discussions and conversations amongst my readers in Nigeria and even those outside the shores of this country. The article focused on when explorers from other continents found out the richness of the Dark Continent and its obliging people which led to the Scramble for Africa. One after the other, Western powers decided to invade, occupy, divide and colonize the continent: some brought their diplomats while others brought their weapons. Either way, resistance wasn't tolerated.The present generation is unaware of our old mode of government because we were told that they were barbaric, fetish, primitive and uncivilized. The unwritten history of our religion, government and people is in the art which were taken away under the guise of denouncing our gods. The little that we know has been through visits to some museums in Italy, Germany, Holland and UK.Many of my readers implied that some Nigerians do not know about their nation and what it's been through so I was made to hold brief for the Nation but ended up asking myself some questions hence the title of today's article. The questions and answers made for a very interesting, historical and educative interaction which I must share in today's essay for the sake of our children, grandchildren and the generation that is to come. I have read books written by British historians and British journalist of the past and I've also read those written by Nigerian historians.Somehow, I ended up in a big confusion especially when I compare all these histories with those written from stories told by our fore fathers. My take therefore comes from a conviction that we are taking so much from the country over the Century without replenishment and we must start the process of writing the unbiased, the un-political, the unreligious and the unadulterated history of Nigeria. In addition, we must start the building of archives all over where to store the different stages of our developments; both the past and present, because it is very important to know where you have come from to be able to determine and chart the course for where you want to go to.One thing that becomes increasingly clear to me over time is that the planet earth is very angry with us for the way we have neglected our past. We must therefore go back a little maybe a few hundred years to find answers for the above, some of the answers may not be that good for today's history but we must start to build from there. We have to take stock of what we have done to Nigeria in 61 years and that will take me back to a question I have once asked in this very column. The question goes thus: What did our Founding Fathers tell the British they were going to do with independent Nigeria during our journey to Independence? The answer to this question would help us draw a comparison between what they intended and what we are today.I was there and I know that most Nigerians could not wait to see the back of heads of those British Colonial governments. Those Nigerians old enough like me know that mistakes were made but we have learned nothing from the mistakes since we keep repeating the same mistakes. We keep sweeping our problems under the carpet instead of confronting and finding answers to the problems.We have seen wonderful Nigerians in Science, in Sports, in Politics and in Industries making the heights in global stages but only when they go away from Nigeria. We must find answers to all these before we restructure so that we do not build a new Nigeria on a quick sand. Some Americans and Europeans of Nigerian origin have recently been part of the space development that the whole world is moving to because of the immense opportunities that are abound in these new technologies such as renewable and clean energy. And some emerging nations that started after Nigeria are in competition with the rest of the world because of the use of artificial intelligence and innovations abound in such development.Recently, I saw the impressive presentation made by Nigeria on Global Climate Change in Glasgow Scotland during the negotiations but now, how can we be negotiating adaptation and mitigation towards carbon neutrality when millions of our generators are pumping tons of carbon-dioxide into the atmosphere, our forests being depleted as we speak, our water bodies receding and disappearing, our grazing fields gone as our Sahara remains the only untamed desert in the world?I wrote last week that we cannot continue to play catch up with other countries that keep leaving us behind. However, without a solid knowledge and understanding of our beginning and foundation that's all we will ever manage as unfortunately, the rest of the world will not wait for us to catch up with them. Most of the raw material and human resources that were used to grow and develop the wealthy countries that we look up to were gotten from this continent. The atomic and nuclear bombs that are being used to intimidate us were tested in our Sahara and the desert today remains the only active desert in the world.History isn't preserved and taught to cast aspersions of play the blame game. Instead, it gives us a clear picture of how various aspects of society worked in the past so we can understand how it came to work the way it is now. Only through the study of history can people really see and grasp the reasons behind the changes (or lack of) and understand what elements of an institution or a society continue regardless of continual change. History provides us data that can be analysed and used in building a nation's identity and righting its wrongs.After so many centuries, the point is not to go back to our old ways, but we must begin to re-educate ourselves with a combination of the old and new ways alike; not as we were taught by the so called explorers. We will need to go further than the history we were told as the people of Nigeria though scattered across kingdoms and called differently didn't start to exist only on the arrival of the foreigners. So once again, I ask: who will write the unbiased, un-political, unreligious and unadulterated history of Nigeria?\l"

This year, Urban October opened with World Habitat Day on 4th October. The theme for this year, ""Accelerating urban action for a carbon-free world"" highlights how cities and towns are at the core of climate action to keep the 1.5 degrees goal within reach. According to the United Nations report, cities are responsible for some 70% of global carbon dioxide emissions with transport, buildings, energy, and waste management accounting for the bulk of urban greenhouse gas emissions.The Department of Political Affairs, Peace and Security participated in the 2021 World Habitat Day Celebration, which was held in hybrid format, i.e. in person and virtually, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The continental commemoration was attended by ministers and heads of delegations from Africa Public Service Day (APSD) champions among AU Member States, African Union Commission, academia and media, among others.H.E. Amb. Bankole Adeoye, Commissioner for Political Affairs, Peace and Security of the African Union Commission, in his statement, said that the theme chosen for the celebration of the Habitat Day of this year 2021 in Yaound\'e9 is in sync with the very strong alert given by the experts of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on the climate emergency. The Commissioner noted that although Africa has not contributed to the current situation, it is nevertheless experiencing serious consequences of climate change.Amb. Bankole Adeoye further stated that as UN scientists have shown, millions of Africans have already experienced unprecedented heat waves, extreme precipitation events, and rising sea level-changes that affect livelihoods, exacerbate food insecurity, intensify competition for resources, deplete water supplies, and accelerate migration. He then gave Cyclone Idai and Kenneth as examples.The Commissioner highlighted key actions undertaken by the AU under the auspices of the Commission:The mobilization of the African Union at the highest level on these issues through the African Heads of State Committee on Climate Change (CAHOSCC) and at ministerial level through the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN);The approach to work on climate issues by major geo-climatic basins in order to better contextualize climate issues according to the dynamics of settlement and ecosystem evolution, and to better calibrate the responses to be provided in the face of the challenges, namely: the Congo Basin; the Sahel; the Mediterranean region; and the Ocean basin.Three (3) commissions regrouping African countries following the geo climatic logic were set up in Marrakech, Morocco in November 2016: the Congo Basin Commission, the Sahel Commission, and the Indian Ocean Island Countries Commission.The Virtual capacity building seminars provided to AU Member States on the implementation of the African Regional Implementation Framework for the New Urban Agenda in Africa, which gives emphasis on the role of local and regional authorities in the development of greenhouse gas reduction plans in African urban centersThe creation of a joint Department of Political Affairs, Peace and Security (PAPS) and the Department of Agriculture, Rural Development, Blue Economy and Environmental Sustainability (ARBE) Climate and Security Working Group.The 31st Virtual Ordinary Meeting of the Bureau of the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN), held on 7th June 2021, recognized that COP26 will provide an opportunity for African countries to increase their ambition in the fight against climate change and encouraged the African Group of Negotiators on Climate Change to continue to advocate for the continent.The World Habitat Day is also marked by social events and exhibition of showcase by the Government of Cameroon.Distributed by APO Group on behalf of African Union (AU).\l"

The project aims to expand energy access to 25 million individuals via 5 million new household connections in rural areas through solar home systems and mini-grids.Under the programme, long-term, low interest credit is to be extended to pre qualified solar home system distributors and mini-grid developers, as well as to manufacturers and assemblers of solar components.The intent is to raise local content in solar manufacturing and assembly, with import substitution possibly worth $10 million per year. The government hopes to incentivise the creation of 250 000 jobs. The target for the first year is 750 000 connections and 37 500 new jobs (Sunday, 2020).Other impact investors including All On, the African Development Bank and the Bank of Industry have also played a key role to provide early stage grant and single-interest financing players in the sector.Read also:Soaring energy prices pose economic risks for Nigeria ; World BankOther high ranked countries are Brazil, India, the United States, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Colombia, and members of the European Union.br Renewable energy's ability to create jobs and meet climate goals is beyond doubt.

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria467","Climate Crisis Can't Be Fixed By Causing Energy Crisis in Africa - Buhari","October 31, 2021","This Day (Lagos)","President Muhammadu Buhari has stressed that climate crisis will not be fixed by causing energy crisis in Africa.Buhari who gave the assertion in an opinion titled ""The Climate Crisis Will Not Be Fixed By Causing Crisis In Africa"" in the latest edition of NEWSWEEK Magazine, said unless the developed world wakes up, they run the risk of trying to fix the climate crisis with an energy crisis.The President, while making reference to a statement by senior United Nations officials who raised the alarm that world conflict and chaos and mass migrations and institutional collapse should greenhouse gas emissions remain unchecked for much longer, said mankind has a duty to act on these dangers.Buhari said, ""Dire warnings of the end of the world are as old as civilization itself. But each year as the countdown to United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP) begins, they grow in volume and intensity. But because of their seriousness we must not do so rashly. It is an inconvenient truth, but energy solutions proposed by those most eager to address the climate crisis are fuel for the instability of which they warn. No more clearly can this be seen than in Africa. For today's 1.3 billion Africans, access to low-cost and reliable energy is the highest of all possible concerns. Estimated to rise to 2.5 billion by 2050--by 2100 Nigeria alone is projected to have the second largest population on the planet--this ""great doubling"" (for Nigeria, quadrupling) has the right to more dependable electricity than their forebears. Without extra and stable power, we cannot build the factories that will transform Africa from a low-job, extractives-led economy to a high employment middle-income continent. Children cannot learn for longer and better by battery light any more than by candlelight.""No more than the Africa of today, the Africa of tomorrow cannot advance using energy production that intermittently delivers. Yet in our rush to address climate concerns, and for western aid agencies and investors to burnish their green credentials, we rush to install the most alternative of energy sources which are often the most unreliable. Wind and solar, the most fashionable of modern energy technologies, are flawed by their reliance on back-up diesel generators or batteries for when there is no wind for the turbines or sun for the panels. It also seems unnoticed that in our global rush for electric cars we risk replacing the last century's scramble for fossil fuels with a new global race in lithium for batteries. Where significant deposits are to be found, such as in Africa, this could endanger geopolitical stability. This makes the economic migrations the U.N. warned of more likely. We must think carefully whether our dash to terminate the use of fossil fuels so swiftly is as wise as it sounds.""There is no single ""green bullet"" that can be deployed either in Africa or the world that solves concerns of environmentalists while simultaneously offering the power to fuel hope of greater wealth and progress for the extra 1 billion citizens of our African future.But there are certain things we can and must do starting with transitioning to cleaner, but consistent, energy production. Fossil fuel power generation that can provide electricity 24 hours a day in all conditions can be re-tooled greener through carbon capture and the conversion of coal and heavy fuel oil power stations to biomass. We can bring forward new technologies such as mini-hydro power plants which can operate and produce power day and night along shallow waterways without damaging the aquatic life on which local communities are sustained.""We can also invest in nuclear. Though not renewable it is carbon neutral and capable of producing baseload, constant electricity production on which sustained economic progress can be built. Nigeria is among a handful of African countries exploring nuclear power, with a research reactor already operational. And we can also learn from our friends in Europe and America who do not always practice what they preach. We call on them to lift the moratorium they have placed on fossil fuel investments in Africa. Nigeria has pledged to eliminate illegal gas flaring by 2030--a by-product of our oil industry--and harness it for electricity production. Our intention to end Nigeria's single greatest contribution to greenhouse emissions may stall without it. Yet there are no such limitations on investment in natural gas power in the West where it is considered a transitional energy source. There is a deal to be done at COP26, but none without the agreement of the nations of Africa. The climate warnings we hear them. We live them. But no one has the right to deny the advancement of our continent.""\l"

But earlier this year, Mr Biden restored America's commitment to the Agreement.Mr Osinbajo said Nigeria is happy with the development.""We are happy that the U.S. is fully on board with climate change and back to the table on this issue. One has to commend the drive this U.S. administration has put behind climate change,"" he said. Mr Osinbajo also reiterated Nigeria's position on transition from fossil fuels to clean energy, ahead of the net-zero emissions 2050 target.""We are concerned about what has been going on, especially around gas as an effective transition fuel and how many Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) and some countries are insisting that gas projects should be defunded.""This is of principal concern to us. It is one that we have made central to our advocacy and it is one of the issues that we intend to promote at the COP26.Mr Osinbajo said Nigeria looks forward to participating in the Democracy Summit President Joe Biden would be hosting later in the year.He also thanked the U.S. government for donating over 3.5 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to Nigeria.Earlier in his remarks, Mr Finer said the U.S. plans to partner with Nigeria on the G-7 Infrastructure Programme - Build Back Better World, which Mr Biden has made a priority.Mr Finer was accompanied to the event by the American Ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Leonard, and other U.S. senior government officials.Earlier on Monday at a media roundtable he held with some Nigerian editors in Abuja, Mr Finer pledged the assistance of the United States to Nigeria in its fight against banditry.""We'll provide technical assistance for justice programming, much of which is dedicated to help Nigeria get a turnaround at this time of banditry challenges, and we will continue to provide programmes like that to help the country,"" he said.He said, however, that the Nigerian government also stated that military action is not the only tool it is using to fight insecurity around the country.Mr Finer said the Biden administration approved of the sale of Super Tucano fighter jets by the Trump administration to Nigeria to support the counterterrorism war in the country.""We are pleased to be able to deepen our security cooperation with the Nigerian government in this way,"" he added in reaction to the controversy around the transaction.He disabused fears that the Nigerian government may deploy the fighter jets against secessionists in parts of the country. He said Nigeria was aware of the 'expectations' of the American government that they would be only for ""security use, particularly in the North-east.""I think we've made clear our expectations on how the fighter jets are going to be used. We are confident they will be used in the right way.""We have those basic concerns and that is true of all our security partners around the world.""Specifically on the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mr Finer said his delegation had discussed the issue with the Nigeria Government and emphasised the need to address the underlying problem that gave birth to the group.He said discussions between the delegation and Nigerian officials also covered ""counterterrorism, maritime and the piracy issue taking place here.""Mr Finer said there was also conversation on ""hopefully deepening economic relationship, democracy and human rights.""The conversation we had was quite frank about how they are making progress and how we can deepen the cooperation we have in many other areas.""Also at the roundtable was the American ambassador, Mrs Leonard, and the senior director for Africa at the National Security Council, Dana Banks.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Premium Times.

"COP26","Nigeria","COP26_Nigeria471","Why We Need African Energy Banks. Now","January 5, 2022 Wednesday","News Chronicle (Nigeria)","For more than a year, the African Energy Chamber has been pushing back against steadily building pressure to halt new foreign investments in Africa's oil and gas industry.To prevent catastrophic climate change, environmental organizations, financial organizations, and governments across Europe and North America have insisted that developing nations, including those in Africa, must immediately transition from fossil fuel production and usage to renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydrogen. Mind you, the majority of those making these demands are based in industrialized nations that were built on fossil fuels  oil and gas fueled their economic engines  yet they are unwilling to allow less developed nations to use fossil fuels to the same end. Even more troubling, the African countries these groups are taking aim at have a wealth of natural resources under their feet, resources that can be used to deliver reliable power, to grow economies, and to build a better future.These are a few of the reasons that the Secretary General of the African Petroleum Producers' Organization, Dr. Omar Farouk Ibrahim, has rightly pointed out that it would be a mistake for Africans to abandon their abundant petroleum resources. Turning our backs on approximately 130 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves and over 15 trillion standard cubic meters of natural gas, to pursue expensive, unreliable energy sources, would not be a wise course of action.The African Energy Chamber has stated, over and over, that Africa still needs its oil and gas sector. And, we've tried to explain the important role that international oil companies (IOCs), foreign governments, and investment institutions play in building the kind of oil and gas sector that will truly benefit Africans. IOCs, for example, engage in knowledge sharing and provide opportunities for Africans to build valuable job skills. What's more, foreign oil and gas investments generate revenue that can be used to build and improve energy infrastructure  for both fossil fuels and renewables. And, by supporting natural gas projects, investors create a path for gas-to-power projects that help minimize the continent's widespread energy poverty.In July 2021, when it became apparent that reasoning was not yielding results, the chamber went so far as to employ the same tactics the international community used against our members. We called for boycotts against financial institutions that discriminated against the African oil and gas industry.But the calls to stop financing African oil and gas have only grown louder and more insistent. Most recently, during the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, more than 20 countries and financial institutions pledged to stop public financing for overseas fossil fuel projects.For those of us who care about Africa's oil and gas industry, it's time to face facts: We need to find a way to save it ourselves. The African Energy Chamber is calling upon African states and the private sector to establish energy banks focused on funding African energy projects. The idea is to create funding sources for all types of African energy  from oil and gas exploration to solar and hydrogen operations  that will not depend on foreign support. No more begging for aid that only would be awarded on the condition that we abandon fossil fuels.We can do this, and we must. Too much is at stake. We can't afford not to capitalize on such recent discoveries as the light oil found offshore Angola, the oil in Namibia's Kavango Basin, the shale gas in South Africa's Karoo Basin, or the oil and natural gas off the coast of C\'f4te d'Ivoire. Those are only a few of the important discoveries that occurred in 2021, and each represents critical opportunities for everyday Africans.Pressing Needs Call for Definitive ActionThe call for Africa to save its oil and gas industry alive is not based on greed, on making money for an elite few. We're not placing economic objectives above our people or the climate. On the contrary, we are convinced that harnessing our oil and gas is the best way to meet some of our people's most pressing needs. And we believe that pursuing our oil and gas opportunities is not the environmental catastrophe that some have suggested it is.As OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo has said, addressing energy poverty in Africa is an urgent matter that must take priority over abandoning oil and gas. Barkindo described the devastating impacts of energy poverty during African Energy Week in Cape Town. (Incidentally, that meeting was organized after London-based Hyve Group/ Africa Oil Week moved from Capetown to Dubai. Imagine talking about African energy somewhere other than in Africa? Seems like that's another example of the West holding our energy industry in low regard.)""The unfortunate reality for developing countries is that a staggering 759 million people worldwide did not have access to electricity in 2019, with around 79% of them located in Africa,"" Barkindo said. ""Moreover, there were roughly 2.6 billion people or 34% of the global population who did not have access to clean cooking fuels and technologies  and this includes a massive 70% of Africans who have no access, exposing them to high levels of household air pollution.""The energy poverty numbers for Africa are stark,"" Barkindo continued ""And to add in one further number, Africa accounts for only around 3% of global emissions.""As the chairman of the African Union, President Macky Sall of Senegal, has said, African states are open to embracing renewable energy sources: The problem comes when we are bullied into giving up our fossil fuels, and the opportunities they represent, on others' timetables.""Our countries cannot achieve an energy transition and abandon the polluting patterns of the industrialised countries without a viable, fair and equitable alternative,"" Stated Sall . ""Our countries, which are already shouldering the crushing weight of unequal trade, cannot bear the burden of an unfair energy transition.""President Sall is right and so is South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who said, ""We must contend not only with these primary dangers (of climate change), but also with potential economic and social damage should the global community fail to deal with the crisis in a way that works for developing as well as developed markets.""Developing African energy banks is a way to protect our countries from those social and economic dangers. China might be a credible partner to Africa in building these unique financial infrastructure.We Can Do ThisYou may be wondering if African energy banks are a realistic goal. How can a continent that is struggling to bring many of its people out of poverty raise capital for energy projects? I believe it can be done. To begin with, African governments can set aside a percentage of their oil and gas revenues for new project funding. In our report, Africa Energy Outlook 2021, the African Energy Chamber projected that African governments' earnings from royalties, profit oil, and other taxes in 2021 would reach USD 100 billion. Even 5% of that amount would produce $50 million that could be leveraged for exploration, development, or infrastructure.We can also raise capital by investing African pension funds in African energy projects. According to Capetown-based investment firm RisCura, local pension funds collectively manage around USD 350 billion of assets in sub-Saharan Africa, and they are actively looking for new places to invest. Why not encourage them to add oil, gas, and renewables projects to their list? Investing pensions in the energy sector is hardly a new practice. Some of America's largest pension funds are invested in fossil fuel producers and pension funds around the globe are investing in green energy projects. This would not be a giveaway: Investing in fossil fuels, especially gas projects and developing marginal fields, provides a large return on investment. And millions of Africans would be participating in our growth and our future.Our options for raising capital don't end there. We also should seek the support of wealthy Africans who want to invest in a better African future. As of December 2020, total private wealth in Africa totaled approximately USD 2 trillion. That's not even including the African diaspora. Imagine what can be done if we just unite.Not only do we have pathways for raising capital, we also have an example of the kind of bank(s) Africa needs to finance its own energy projects, one that goes back decades. I'm talking about the African Export Import Bank (Afrieximbank). In 1993, African governments worked with public and private investors to create a bank that would finance, promote, and expand intra-African and extra-African trade. They succeeded. In 2020, Afrieximbank received the Africa-America Institute's (AAI's) Institutional Institution of Excellence Award for its commitment to the creation and implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) and its ongoing dedication to investing in education. AAI noted that between 2015 and 2019 alone, Afrieximbank disbursed more than $30 billion in support of African trade, including more than $15 billion for the financing and promotion of intra-Africa trade.Afrieximbank, by the way, recognizes the importance of protecting Africa's oil and gas industry.""The way we see it at the bank, Africa produces less than 4% of greenhouse gas. We are not the problem of greenhouse gases. We are the victims. We are asking for balance,"" Afrieximbank President and Chairman of the Board Benedict Oramah said.I say, let's build on Afrieximbank's model. And not only that, let's cultivate a pool of investors who understand and appreciate the importance of oil and gas to Africa. Capital from foreign countries and companies will always be welcome  as long as it isn't predicated on phasing out fossil fuels on their timel"

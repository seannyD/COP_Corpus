"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE2","Oil producers move from feeling ""unwanted at COP26"" to ""superheroes"" ahead of COP27: report","April 11, 2022 Monday","ArabianBusiness.com","Oil producers have always been an easy target at the United Nations' annual climate summits. This year, with the Russia-Ukraine conflict boosting demand for fossil fuels, they're preparing to fight back, Bloomberg reported.As Western economies desperately seek alternatives to Vladimir Putin's exports, many are working to increase supplies of energy &mdash; whether it's clean or not.US President Joe Biden has ordered an unprecedented release of emergency crude, while Poland has signaled it wants to use coal past the European Union's 2050 date to reach net-zero emissions. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson travelled to Saudi Arabia to ask for an increase oil production.The UAE Energy Minister Suhail Al-Mazrouei summed up the industry's change in fortune at a conference in Dubai last month.""Oil producers felt unwanted in COP26, felt like we were in a corner,"" Al-Mazrouei said. ""Now, we're like superheroes.""The UK banned oil companies from sponsorship deals at the gathering in Glasgow last November, saying that their net-zero targets weren't credible, according to Bloomberg.It was a victory for green campaigners who had criticized Poland for allowing coal companies to plaster their branding all over the COPs it hosted in 2013 and 2018.The decision also struck a nerve with oil executives, including Shell chief executive officer Ben van Beurden, who complained about not feeling welcome ahead of the talks last year.It's unlikely the industry will face the same resistance this year. Egypt, which will oversee COP27 in the resort town of Sharm El-Sheikh this November, has historically aligned itself with a group of developing countries that's resisted pressure to do more to cut emissions.It's argued that African countries shouldn't be deprived the opportunity to exploit their oil and gas reserves, and stressed that the priority of this year's meeting should focus on getting rich countries to pay more to help them transition to clean energy, the Bloomberg report added.While the UAE &mdash; the hosts of 2023's meeting &mdash; has been a relative frontrunner within the region on climate policies, becoming the first oil producer in the Arabian Gulf to set a net-zero goal last October, it's still squarely in favour of continuing to use fossil fuels.The country wants to shift the COP narrative so hydrocarbons are seen as part of the solution, instead of the problem, according to a person familiar with the nation's strategy. Officials from the UAE and Egypt are already working closely to make sure the two conferences are aligned, the person said.There are also signs that the next two COPs risk being co-opted by oil interests because of the close relationship between Saudi Arabia and the host countries. Saudi Arabia has pledged $15 billion to support Egypt as its economy comes under pressure from the war in Ukraine, depositing the first $5 billion last month.""The Saudis have perennially been a spoiler in this process since the beginning,"" said Alden Meyer, a COP veteran and senior associate with research group E3G.There's a long list of complaints from scientists and diplomats about the country's pushback on global agreements to cut emissions and reports from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change summarising latest scientific findings.Meyer says the Saudis led the fight to downplay a groundbreaking 2018 IPCC report that stated the devastating impacts of warming beyond 1.5C.Experts say efforts should focus on cutting emissions first. In a recent submission to the UN, the kingdom warned rich countries that reducing fossil fuels could backfire by cutting prices and boosting demand in developing nations.Saudi Arabia's energy ministry didn't respond to questions. The nation announced its own net-zero target soon after the UAE did, though it aims to neutralise planet-warming emissions a decade later, by 2060.The UN doesn't count emissions generated outside a country's borders, so both nations could continue to export fossil fuels while technically achieving their goals.The Saudi government has said it will invest more in solar and wind energy and rely heavily on carbon capture technology.At the same time, the kingdom has said oil demand will remain strong for decades and it is spending billions of dollars to boost the country's production capacity.OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo has also urged Egypt and the UAE to redefine the conversation on oil.""These two COPs have the potential to address these challenges &mdash; energy inclusiveness and investment,"" he said. The meetings can be a ""reset"" and show that oil and gas production and climate change goals aren't ""mutually exclusive,"" he said.But the risk is that boosting fossil fuel supply locks in production beyond the current crises, says Joeri Rogelj, a member of the EU Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change.That will make it harder to reach the Paris Agreement's stretch goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels, a target that's already in jeopardy.And there's another way of looking at the situation. While the war will force nations to take a more hard-headed approach to tackling climate change, it should also help them realise that their national security depends on switching to homegrown clean energy, says Christiana Figueres, an architect of the 2015 Paris Agreement.""What I expect to see as of this year, and the rest of the decade, is a change in tone that is really about national security, even for the West,"" she said.Still, the current geopolitical environment means there's a low chance that November's COP meeting will end with consensus on the need to phase out unabated oil and gas consumption, according to Meyer from E3G. All countries have to agree on the final document at the end of the summit, meaning any single nation can derail the entire process.Al-Mazrouei, the UAE minister, underscored how challenging it will be for other nations to convince oil producers to get on board in light of recent events.""At COP26, they asked financial institutions to limit the financing of new oil and gas projects,"" he said, ""and six months after that, they're asking for more oil.""For all the latest business news from the UAE and Gulf countries, follow us on Twitter and Linkedin, like us on Facebook and subscribe to our YouTube page, which is updated daily. \l"

In his speech, Kofe stressed that the eight islands of Tuvalu were ""sacred"" to its 12,000 people, stating, ""They were the home of our ancestors, they are the home of our people today and we want them to remain the home of our people into the future.""In his speech at the COP26 World Leaders Summit on 2nd November, Palau President Surangel Whipps, Jr. also highlighted the importance of maintaining the average global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of this century.""Frankly speaking, there is no dignity in a slow and painful death,"" he said.Overall, Pacific island nations have sent fewer high-level government officials and civil society representatives to COP26 than in previous climate summits, a fact that climate activists stressed has made it more difficult to attend every meeting and pressure some of the world's major polluters, including the U.S. and China.\l"

The UAE also announced an ambitious target of reaching net zero emissions with AED600 billion ($163 billion) invested in clean and renewable energy sources by 2050, becoming the first Middle Eastern country to commit to a net-zero emissions target. The UAE development model will take into account the net-zero goal with all institutions working as a team towards this goal.Tom De WaeleWhile the policy work continues, many senior executives of UAE corporations will raise the question, &ldquo;What do we do after ?&rdquo;The first thing they will have to do is recognise that with all the attention on climate change this year, things are speeding up in some key areas.&bull; Regulations. Carbon-taxation and emissions-trading schemes will expand, and the price of carbon will probably rise. Governments will also promise more subsides to spur change, such as initiatives designed to reduce the cost of green hydrogen.&bull; Financial disclosure. Companies will face more requirements to report on their climate risks, through a set of common reporting standards and climate-change disclosures, for example.&bull; Science-based targets. More companies will set ambitious decarbonisation targets and sign onto initiatives to track these goals and will aim to include Scope 3 emissions in their plans.&bull; Scrutiny from investors. Sustainability, and climate change in particular, will become even more important for investment decisions. Fund managers are starting to respond: the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative brings together 128 fund managers with $43 trillion under their care in a pledge to make investment decisions that support the goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 or sooner.&bull; Customer expectations. Pressure from customers will lead more companies to look beyond their own operations and across their supply chains and use of their products. BMW plans to reduce carbon emissions across the entire life cycle of its vehicles, from production through ownership, by at least 40% by 2030.Torsten LichtenauMost importantly, the focus is going to shift from setting targets to delivering results. Until now, executives may have been rewarded just for stating goals; from here on, they will need to show real reductions. Here areMake carbon transition a pillar of strategy. Too often, sustainability and carbon transition come as afterthoughts, but they should be baked into the strategy practice. The risks and opportunities of climate change should shape decisions about new products and how to improve operations. For example, UK supermarket leader Sainsbury&rsquo;s is making carbon reduction a cornerstone of its strategy, with pledges to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions to net zero by 2040, and to cut Scope 3 emissions by 30% by 2030. Among many changes, it has switched to energy-saving lithium-ion pallet trucks.Get more bang for your net-zero buck. Companies are pushing their carbon transitions as rigorously as any other business initiatives, which means improving efficiency while reducing cost. German engineering and technology firm Bosch has been carbon neutral in Scope 1 and 2 emissions since 2020, thanks to greater energy efficiency. It is also about finding opportunities to monetise investments in sustainable technologies. Mexican cement producer Cemex sells a l"

The Glasgow pact is at least a start, one where there has finally been movement on coal. COP28 can at least begin to accelerate that momentum now that coal has started to shift.It continued, ""Since the Paris Agreement six years ago, providing a financial incentive to poorer nations to reduce dependence on fossil fuels, adapt renewable energies, change their environmental outlook and subsidise their development, is part and parcel of the fight for that 1.5 degree limit.""Financing remains an issue, with just half of the money promised at Paris paid. Developing nations want to see more and more urgently.

Nevertheless, there has been limited progress to date across the region on decisive emissions reductions, with many pledges insufficient to reach a warming limit of two-degrees Celsius. Only the UAE and Saudi Arabia have made net zero pledges of 2050 and 2060 respectively, the organisation said.Consulting group and WCA member A3 & Co estimates that there is potential for companies in the region to reduce their CO2 footprint by as much as 30% with no investment required.WCA sees this as an opportunity for cement producers across MENA to take the lead and embark on their decarbonisation journeys today, which will both contribute to emissions reductions and save on operational costs, including energy and fuel, said a top official from the organisation.""There has been a lot of discussion in Europe and North America about decarbonisation roadmaps for the cement industry and good work has been done to start on this journey. However, 90% of the world's cement is produced and used in developing countries; to impact overall industry emissions we must include these stakeholders. Cement companies in the Middle East have some low hanging fruit to take advantage of, which will lower costs at the same time as reducing CO2 emissions.

But it will require funding.While climate change initiatives were still billions short of the promised $100 billion a year for poor countries to finance green growth, it was now evident that trillions of dollars are needed, much of it from the private sector, in addition to sovereign wealth funds and government spending.Sharma highlighted the UAE's leadership on climate action, which includes investing billions in renewables in the UK and a number of other countries. Sharma visited Abu Dhabi last April where he attended the Regional Climate Dialogue led by the UAE's special envoy for climate change, Dr Sultan Al Jaber.Asked if the current fallout from climate change could be a source of peace, uniting people in conflict, particularly in the Middle East, Sharma replied: ""People have understood that climate change is an issue which does not respect borders. And I would make the case that from a security perspective, climate change is the biggest security risk for the world. Whether it is rising sea levels, food availability or forced migration. That's why it's vitally important that every country steps up to the plate at Cop26.""Cop26 (Conference of the Parties) in November, regarded as the most important since the Paris Agreement on climate change.The key achievement in the 2015 deal was to restrict temperature rises to 1.5 degrees C. ""People have also talked about '1.5 to stay alive',"" said Sharma during the interview at his office in 9 Downing Street. He then reeled off a series of numbers required to keep 1.5 C ""within reach"" as carbon emissions continue to rise.""We have to cut emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 and that tells you how stark the situation is,"" he says. ""It needs everyone to act. Every single nation has to come forward with ambitious plans to cut emissions by 2030, but then also set out net-zero commitments by the middle of the century.""""We want to ensure that we close off all the final rules from the Paris Agreement, there are a number of outstanding issues after six years and we really need to resolve it"".Renewable energy was central to getting emissions down and Sharma praised the UAE for its policies that included signing a Memorandum of Understanding on climate action with the UK last Friday.Both government and private sector investment were key in helping developing nations decarbonise while growing their economies.""How do you support these countries to transition to renewables, rather than going down the fossil fuel route?"" he said.""I know that the UAE has been supporting countries as part of making that energy transition, in addition to sovereign wealth funds investing also. That is what we need to drive forward and make the case of green growth.""Britain had also demonstrated that ""green growth is possible"" in expanding its economy by 80 per cent yet cutting emissions by 40 per cent in the last three decades. Much of that was through massive investment in the offshore wind sector, which with the UAE's investment would quadruple in size by 2030 as the biggest in the world, leading to a welcome ""tumble"" in consumer prices.A similar boost could happen in the fossil-fuel-reliant Middle East.""It has been incredibly encouraging what the UAE has been doing in terms of solar,"" he said. ""There is a real opportunity for Gulf nations to lead this renewable energy transition because they have a lot of sun and wind,"" said the MP, who also holds a place in the Cabinet.""The UAE has shown leadership in the region because they set out an all-economy NDC [Nationally Determined Contribution] at the end of last year"". NDCs embody efforts by each country to reduce national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate changeSharma was careful not to voice a position on the UAE's bid to host to the Cop28 climate change 2023 conference in Abu Dhabi, given his position as president of Cop26.""We're neutral on this but of course we're very happy to share our experiences in attaining Cop26 with the UAE,"" Sharma responds with an encouraging smile. ""I wish well to any country that is looking to host a Cop. It's a huge undertaking and the UAE did actually very successfully and at very short notice host a first regional climate meeting this year which I attended. We had very, very good discussions, so I think the UAE has demonstrated that it is able to organise these events.""The UK is optimistic about getting tangible results from the Cop26 meeting, but it will be a tall order. Getting all countries to commit to net zero by the middle of the century would be a key achievement for Cop26, with more than 70 per cent having already signed up.Despite the frosty relationship between Britain and China, the Cop26 president said he has been able to have ""candid and constructive"" discussions with Beijing about ending its significant coal emissions.""We have now got to the point where the G7 countries have signed up to say that they will not finance any international coal projects from this year. Of course, we would like China and the others as well to do the same,"" he said diplomatically, then praised its clean energy projects.""China has a third of the world's renewable capacity and that's what we want to see encouraged around the world.""While the British government has invested ?12bn in renewables, its projects will only become viable if the private sector stumps up three times that amount.

The ISM business survey is due and may cement expectations of the Federal Reserve having to hike rates sooner than expected (Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) now sees the first hike as early as July next year). China's economy sends out mixed signals but the real estate crisis is - at best - grinding on. The COP26 climate conference seems set to be an anticlimax after G20 leaders failed to agree on how to accelerate the phase-out of coal, and oil prices are pushing higher ahead of this week's OPEC+ meeting. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, 1st November.1. Dollar firm as Goldman warns of faster rate hikesExpectations of tighter monetary policy are front and center in investors' minds at the start of a week that is likely to see landmark decisions to wind down the stimulus that sustained the economy through the pandemic.The U.S. Dollar is consolidating close to the highs it posted on Friday after data showed prices for personal consumer expenditures \- the Federal Reserve's favored measure of inflation \- rising at 4.4% annually, the fastest in years. Two-Year U.S. bond yields topped 0.5% for the first time in 19 months in response, while analysts at Goldman Sachs moved up their forecast for the first Fed rate hike by a year to July 2022.The PCE basket showed that price increases, which had been confined to a few sectors earlier in the year, had broadened significantly.\~ Those data may or may not be corroborated by the ISM manufacturing survey, due at 10 AM ET (1500 GMT).The Fed's two-day policy meeting begins on Tuesday, and is expected to end with an announcement on phasing out the central bank's bond purchases, which are currently running at $120 billion a month. 2. China's PMIs send mixed signals; real estate crisis grinds onTwo closely-watched Chinese business surveys sent out mixed signals, with the official purchasing managers index suggesting that manufacturing activity had contracted in October under the weight of fuel shortages, anti-pollution measures and ongoing Covid-19-related disruptions to production.The private-sector Caixin PMI, however, rose to 50.6 from 50.0 in September, offering some reassurance. Even so, junk bond yields rose to their highest since 2009 and Iron ore Futures fell as much as 4% amid continuing fears for the outlook of the real estate sector.Another top-20 developer by size, Yango Group, said on Monday it was looking to extend payment on three of its dollar bonds, sending its shares down 9% in Shenzhen.Elsewhere in Asia, the Nikkei rose over 2% in response to an emphatic election win for Japan's new Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who promptly promised a large-scale stimulus program. South Korea's trade numbers showed exports up 24% on the year, a little less than expected.3. Stocks set to open higher; Coke, American in focusU.S. stocks are set to open at new record highs later, on broad-based optimism about the economic recovery - albeit volume may be lower than usual due to the shadow cast by the approaching Fed meeting.By 6:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), Dow Jones futures were up 154 points, or 0.4%, while S&P 500 futures were also up 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.3%Stocks likely to be in focus later include Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), after The Wall Street Journal reported that Coke is to buy out the rest of sports drink maker BodyArmor, upping its efforts to challenge the dominance of Pepsi's Gatorade.

The report nonetheless indicated that the long-term transition to low-carbon energy systems continues to see strong momentum and, in several respects, acceleration.Leading up to COP26, a total of 64 countries, covering more than 89 percent of global emissions, have pledged or legislated achieving net zero in the coming decades.To keep up with these net-zero ambitions, the global energy system may need to significantly accelerate its transformation. The report projects a rapid shift in the global energy mix, with the share of renewables in global power generation expected to double in the next 15 years while total fossil fuel demand is projected to peak before 2030, depending on the scenario.However, even with current government commitments and forecasted technology trends, global warming is projected to exceed 1.7&deg;C by 2100, and therefore reaching a 1.5&deg;C pathway is increasingly challenging.""However, even if all countries with net zero commitments deliver on their aspirations, global warming is still expected to reach 1.7&deg;C.

Credibility criteria used to assess the objectives, measurement and reporting of net-zero pledges.Processes for verifying progress towards net-zero commitments and decarbonization plans.And, a roadmap to translate standards and criteria into international and national regulations.He noted that the Group of experts was gender-balanced and geographically diverse, ""with deep experience across government, business, the global financial system, civil society and academia.""They will be working in a personal capacity, ""and I expect them to consult widely, extensively and transparently to hear the perspectives and views of all stakeholders"", the UN chief concluded. He praised the commitment being made at Thursday's meeting to create a new brains' trust to make the commitments on net zero, a reality, in the form of the new advisory High-Level Expert Group.At COP26""Today we take a step towards meeting that need and ensuring the highest standards of environmental integrity and transparency. To avert a climate catastrophe, we need bold pledges but matched by concrete, measurable action.""He stressed that net-zero standards at every level of activity, and strengthened accountability around implementing those goals, would deliver real and immediate emissions cuts.\l"

It has been confirmed that COP27 will take place in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, in November 2022 and that the UAE will host the COP28 International Climate Conference in 2023. Playing host for the next two International Climate Conferences is significant for the Middle East as it isthe world's hottest, driest, and most water-scarce region. It presents the opportunity to raise awareness of critical issues such as climate adaption and help the world navigate through the energy transition. In the next few years, the Middle East may prove to be a vital staging ground for the global battle against climate change.""Business leaders in the region have big decisions to make on their organization's role on climate change. The demand for climate change counsel from communications practitioners is rising with the need to be able to clearly communicate the importance of new sustainability goals and inspire stakeholders and customers to follow suit,"" says Abdulrahman Inayat, Co-Founder, and Director of W7Worldwide. ""The urgent need to address climate change is now part of the COVID-19 recovery narrative and companies that do not have a strategy in place that supports a sustainable future will be left behind,"" added Inayat.W7Worldwide has produced a guide with &lsquo;7 Post COP26 Communications Strategies to Build Back Sustainably from COVID-19' to help business leaders and organizations future-proof their sustainability strategy. The report advises that communicators need to educate themselves on the goals that underpin COP, as these will start to become more specifically aligned to the communications strategy of many companies and sectors. COP26 decisively set the new sustainability agenda, and this respectively will shape communications strategy and output.It's reported that 67% of the public believe businesses should lead on tackling climate change, so businesses must act. Companies with relevant and impactful sustainability strategies will attract customers and public support. More and more citizens recognize that some crises are too big to solve alone. Brands can show that, like COVID-19, tackling the climate crisis needs everyone's efforts as part of their social responsibility and commitment to the planet.Now is the time for brands and organizations to articulate and tell their sustainability story. The sustainability story must be one of the key pillars of the corporate communications plan to show what it means to the business. Organizations are looking to engage more people, and to make sustainability accessible and understandable for everyone, they need to work closely with the media to ensure their message lands. Millions of people know that climate action is urgent. To convince others, communicators need to drop the jargon and produce more relatable content. They also need to provide a compelling call to action that is hard to argue against and will bring in social and environmental benefits.Climate anxiety is thought to be at an all-time high - particularly among young people. There is a fine balance between communicating the gravity of the situation and fuelling fear. It is important therefore to sell the positive of sustainability, not the negative and talk about the solutions a business brings. In sharing more and more stories about achievements and challenges, sustainability will become a vibrant part of an organization's culture and strategy.\l"

Yet, experts have stated that the discourse around energy transition in the region needs shift into more inclusive and balanced territory.Speaking to Arabian Business on the latest episode of AB Talks, Dr Ahmed Ali Attiga, the chief executive officer of the Arab Petroleum Investments Corporation (APICORP), said: ""An energy transition that is balanced, pro-active, and inclusive, requires the dialogue to be much wider between all the stakeholders than what has taken place. For example, at COP26, the oil producers were not even invited.""The region in particular, sits at the intersection of both sides of the transition. It's one of the largest hydrocarbon producers, but at the same time, it has embraced and started the implementation of serious measures to diversify the energy mix. This is how the energy transition needs to be looked at. It's not a zero-sum game where one side wins and the other side loses. The objectives of the energy transition should not be mutually exclusive, but rather an integrated process of diversifying the energy mix and making all elements of the mix greener and cleaner.""Another part of making energy diversification more inclusive will revolve around enhancing private sector partnership in energy transition. Earlier this year, APICORP and Saudi-based Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) started the 'Infra Initiative' - a $1bn private sector-focused financing initiative.Commenting on the need for more such initiatives, Attiga added: ""Partnerships between multilateral financing institutions can help in accelerating the energy transition in a balanced direction, while mobilising additional funding for projects and transactions that are required to move in this direction.""Over the past few years, the participation of the private sector in executive energy and infrastructure projects have grown by 20-25 percent. By using different vehicles and schemes such as private-public-partnerships, private equity, and project financing such initiatives can help countries that are coming out of a conflict or are in the middle of a transition.""Meanwhile, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has caused volatility in commodity prices, while oil prices have lingered above $100 per barrel for more than a month.""The uncertainties in the world have taken a very dangerous turn globally, with the Russia-Ukraine war that unfortunately started a few weeks ago,"" Attiga said.""The early warning signs in terms of supply chain disruptions, inflation, and other macro- and micro-economic effects are very worrying. We hope that matters don't escalate and that containment limits the damage that this crisis has caused. Given that Russia is a key member of the OPEC+ alignment it is hard to predict what will happen in the oil markets going forward. The fact that the OPEC+ remains resilient, and has kept to its framework agreements through this crisis is what has kept the market from severe fluctuations.""Catch more insights from Dr Ahmed Ali Attiga in the AB Talks video above, where he details the challenges facing the energy sector, and the untapped opportunities that lie ahead in 2022.(Source: ArabianBusiness YouTube channel)For all the latest business news from the UAE and Gulf countries, follow us on Twitter and Linkedin, like us on Facebook and subscribe to our YouTube page, which is updated daily. \l"

""COP26 has kept the 1.5 degrees alive. But its pulse is weak and it will only survive if we keep our promises and translate commitments into rapid action,"" said Alok Sharma, President for COP26.Every industry needs to take accountability to innovate sustainable processes and ensure implementation has an impact, including a set of nonfinancial criteria like diversity, business ethics, wellbeing, and shareholders rights.For the architecture, engineering, and construction industries, it has become a priority in order to respond and prepare for the future, with the pandemic being the catalyst for this change in thinking. To change what we create, we must change how we create, with sustainable, equitable and resilient outcomes in mind.As these industries are notably major contributors to pollution and waste, with the construction industry generating over a third of global waste, with volume expected to double by 2025, a key factor in making this shift is digital transformation through actionable information and digital tools that help achieve sustainable outcomes. This is already seen as a top priority, with 69 percent of Autodesk industry customers currently supporting the UN Sustainable Development Goal 13 regarding climate action.The future of sustainability has many avenues however we focus our efforts to advance positive outcomes across three primary areas: energy and materials - maximising energy efficiency and lower carbon emissions from materials used to make the supply chain more sustainable; health and resilience - building safer, healthier, and more sustainable infrastructure; and work and prosperity - aiming to have an impact on the entire workforce by advancing access to learning skills of the future.Digital transformation will, therefore, need to be the partner for the new possible, with tech and software transforming industries. Reshaping the processes and developing the tools needed to meet the intensifying industry demands of today can propel the industry towards a more sustainable world that benefits everyone.These industries need to be unified in their approach, with industry-focused solutions, such as the Autodesk Forge platform, empowering customers with data and insights, as well as delivering total carbon solutions to help these industries to get the insights that will allow them to design and develop products in a more sustainable, equitable and resilient way.Notably, rethinking business plans, design, and manufacturing of products is no small task. While many companies understand the importance of digital transformation, the process of transitioning entire processes and securing the necessary buy-in is a colossal effort.A significant impediment is that many digital tools are too complex and too siloed, making change unnecessarily difficult. However, through innovative software enhancements, such as through Autodesk Fusion 360, it is fulfilling its mission of providing leaders, innovators, and designers of tomorrow with the digital tools and the knowledge needed to address some of the biggest challenges.In a global research project by Altimeter and Autodesk conducted in July 2021, the research surveyed approximately 750 software buyers and users across key geographies, job titles, and company types.Ultimately, the research confirmed that the past two years had made digital transformation critical, with 65 percent saying digital transformation had disrupted the industry to a moderate or great extent (69 percent for D&M, 58 percent for AEC). It then increased to 71 percent when respondents were asked if digital transformation will disrupt industries in the next two years to a moderate or great extent (D&M 75 percent and AEC 65 percent). Businesses reported a myriad of benefits for digital transformations, including improved efficiency and reduced costs as key components.Convergence to play a key role in digital transformationTo develop sustainable digital transformation processes, convergence is ultimately the solution, meaning the blending of previously separate technologies, processes, and data to create new combinations of products, services, and experiences that reshape industry structures. Companies are now anticipating and preparing for the next wave of digital convergence disruption.It is notable that 95 percent of all respondents said convergence of some kind was already affecting their industry today and 73 percent agreed that their organisation approached convergence as a competitive advantage for their company. Through the process of convergence, it benefits organisations first, translating into improved efficiency and reduced operating costs.To put it into context from an industry standpoint, it is common to find technologically obsolete wastewater network infrastructures and an increasing number do not meet the standards of being in a state of good repair. Updated processes are integral to the health and wellbeing of community residents and critical to improving society and protecting the environment. However, to understand the condition of the network, teams need the tools and resources to manage, inspect, and respond to risk before it becomes a problem.An example of how digital convergence is assisting in sustainability can be seen through Afsluitdijk - a 32-kilometre dam with a sustainable infrastructure has been at the forefront for Dutch hydraulic engineering. The project has focused on protecting and preventing damage to the dam and its surroundings, whilst offering ecological and recreational mechanisms.The planners rely on the latest technology so each team can work collaboratively and efficiently, allowing them to strengthen the enclosure dam, increasing the capacity for it to discharge water, as well as construct pumps to move water into the sea.Another instance comes from the late 19th century when scientists began to recognise urban heat islands through the discovery of the city of London often being a few degrees higher than the surrounding rural areas. A few degrees difference can impact thermal comfort, caused in part by the process of concrete, asphalt, brick, and other materials absorbing and re-emitting heat during the day and cooling more slowly at night. This isn't just a comfort issue, but rather it is also a sustainability issue.The US Environmental Protection Agency estimates an increase of just 2&deg;F may increase the use of air conditioning by 1-9 percent - powered mostly by electricity produced by fossil-fuel-powered plants. Through microclimate analysis tools, real estate developers, urban planners, and architects can evaluate the thermal comfort of outdoor spaces.While methods of calculating the urban heat island effect already exist, they're often accessible only to expert users, take hours to run, or do not visualise the data. New microclimate analysis programmes, such as Spacemaker, are fast, intuitive, and highly visual. For the first time, the entire site planning team can quickly see the impact of design decisions on thermal comfort, specifically in this case heat islands, and resolve any issues efficiently and effectively.Buildings generate nearly 40 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. A combination of processes can therefore help meet emissions reduction targets set by the Paris Agreement - and reinforced by Glasgow Climate Pact - such as the Autodesk Total Carbon in beta.Combining Revit data with open-source energy analysis and material carbon data in the cloud, Total Carbon provides real-time, accurate, and reliable total carbon analysis. Tools such as this give users the insights they need to create sustainable designs in Revit, making it easier for them to design for environmentally friendly outcomes from the start.It is safe to say that new solutions and the convergence of current software processes have been key in unlocking the insights and unleashing the innovation that is needed to help industries design more sustainable buildings, construct more resilient cities, and make a better future for all. What we build must be paired with how we build, and digital transformation for sustainable outcomes is undeniably at its core.By industries accepting and working together to develop new processes, it allows for sustainable goals to be met and most importantly, become the industry standard that is needed to ensure a sustainably led future.\l"

Naturally, the Internet did its thing and ran amok with memes, sarcastic comments and quick-witted criticisms.On Reddit, one user wrote: ""You know what's better than luck? Effort."" Another wondered why US President Joe Biden was missing from the picture. ""Where's Joe? Taking a nap?"" The ridicule and ensuing controversy may have been warranted if the narrative for the picture had been true.But world leaders weren't tossing coins into the Trevi for good luck fighting the climate emergency; they were participating in a photo-op to mark a centuries-old Roman tradition. Throwing a coin into the fountain  with your right hand over your left shoulder  means you will return to Rome, according to ancient legend.Yet, underlining how fake news and misguided narratives are born, the Internet was quick to associate it with a false climate change narrative instead.Then again, that's understandable. Everywhere you turn, one statement is clamouring for attention, blaring louder than others  world leaders aren't doing enough. Other variations, inspired largely by climate activist Greta Thunberg's spirited protests, are also commonplace.They've turned a blind eye to climate change for decades. They would rather profit from environmental destruction than leave behind a habitable Earth for the next generation. They  with their private jets and premium leather Oxford shoes  simply don't care. In other words, everything they've spewed thus far is just a spate of ""blah, blah, blahs.""Thunberg and other activists are far from off-base; climate change is indiscriminately wreaking havoc all over the world.Satellite images show that wildfires around Lake Baikal in southern Siberia have left burn scars that can be seen from space. Coastal cities in the Gulf could drown as sea levels rise. The Maldives, a tourism hotspot, is predicted to disappear by the end of the century. Just last year, the UK recorded some of the highest temperatures and rainfall. Of course, the time to take action is now, but no one  rich, poor, empathetic or tactical  was going to be able to trounce the crisis in two weeks.Long before the summit ended, Thunberg declared COP26 a failure. For the most part, it was, especially because emerging economies didn't get the funding they deserved. But even if fell short in many ways, we can't forget that it was a spark that ignited global action.The world has known about the climate crisis for decades. In 1988, Nasa scientist James Hansen told the US Congress that the greenhouse effect had arrived. His words marked the beginning of the end of the world as we know it, spurring the US to become a founding member of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. But more than 30 years went by and world powers showed little interest in tackling the climate emergency. At least we can say with some confidence that things have changed since then. COP26 brought climate change to the forefront  thanks, in part, to activists such as Thunberg. Some of the efforts may be too little, too late, but the summit did make a few waves.For the first time, the Glasgow Climate Pact struck a deal to ""phase down"" coal, which contributes to about 40 per cent of annual carbon dioxide emissions. The very mention of fossil fuels in a climate agreement is a win for the COP26 presidency, even if the spirit had to be watered down.An earlier draft of the pact included a commitment to phase ""out"" coal, rather than phase ""down."" But India led the opposition, with climate minister Bhupendar Yadav questioning how developing countries could promise to phase out coal when they ""still have to deal with the development agendas and poverty eradication.The last-minute amendment had Alok Sharma, the British president for COP26, fighting back tears as he told delegates he was ""deeply sorry"" for how the events had unfolded.Apparently, leaders, even the ones who are criticised, do care and understand the gravity of fighting the climate crisis. In his address, Sharma acknowledged that the win was a fragile one. ""The hard work starts now,"" he said.Ultimately, the world is making a more concerted effort now than it has in decades. In particular, the UAE, which is set to host COP28 in Abu Dhabi in 2023, has stepped up to the plate.Dr Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and Special Envoy for Climate Change, summarised the UAE's climate goals best when he told the Atlantic Council that the country views green energy not as a threat, but as a ""unique opportunity"" to capitalise on its strength and financial expertise.What really matters, despite all the talk about COP being ""blah blah blah"" is that there are no quick fixes, especially when you consider the intrinsic link between climate and sustenance. With billions still reeling under poverty, unilateral solutions are simply impossible.Thunberg and others are not wrong to fight for urgency, but the world cannot just halt fossil fuel burning like closing a tap.When the UN Sustainable Development Goals' first priority of ""zero hunger"" still remains unaddressed, what we need is a ""solutions COP"" of practical climate action linked to poverty and hunger eradication. The UAE's promise to work towards that, therefore, makes headl"

There's dread, fear and a volcano of frustration all over the world that little's being done to save the world from a climate apocalypse. We hear them but livelihoods are at stake in the developing world as newer, cleaner technology taking longer to reach them. The pandemic may have changed the way we work and commute, albeit briefly, but that's not enough to reverse climate disaster, proclaim the experts.The West, meanwhile, is taking its green lessons seriously and is attempting to keep things cool in their part of the hemisphere that has seen the full extent of the Industrial Revolution. We are now in a phase of history that's been called the Fourth Industrial Revolution where virtual technology rules. However, virtual tech has serious environmental issues: it involves producing more electricity that could, in turn, warm the earth further. It's a cycle we cannot ignore because the future depends on how we deal with and mitigate the impact of climate change. Now, let's go back to who's responsible for the most emissions since 1750. Our World in Data shows the US has emitted 410.2 billion tonnes of carbon. China comes in second but has emitted half that amount of the gas. Russia, Germany and the UK follow have also done their part to raise CO2 levels. India and others follow suit but these carbon emissions are a fallout of recent growth spurts.The trouble with conclaves like COP26 is that there's a lot of talk and no concrete action. Development goals are in open conflict with green statements; temperature targets are unlikely to be met. Human activity has been blamed for a warmer world and must be curtailed to keep temperature rise below 1.5C under the previous Paris climate deal. But countries are prone to flouting these limits as they draw up growth plans post the pandemic. How do you hold them to account? Punitive action is ruled out. Setting temperature limits, while showing intent, does little to prevent a warmer planet. The result could be devastating for future generations who deserve a better, safer life. It's important to dig deeper to reach a consensus on the dangers of climate change. Rich countries have a moral obligation to help the developing world with green technology.

Green hydrogen is one form of hydrogen that is being developed, and is used to describe hydrogen that is created using renewable, climate-friendly energy, such as, in this case, waste.&ldquo;We are excited to be creating the first waste-to-hydrogen solution in the region and support the UAE government in its hydrogen economy ambitions, energy diversification and decarbonisation efforts,&rdquo; Khaled Al Huraimel Group CEO of BEEAH said in a statement.Non-recyclable waste wood and plastic will be processed at the plant using Chinook RODECS gasification and pyrolysis technology. The plant will produce 18,000kg of green hydrogen a day when operating at full capacity.&ldquo;The technology breaks down hydrocarbons from waste through advanced thermal treatment to release and recover green hydrogen. Then, when the green hydrogen is used in vehicles, it emits only water as a by-product,&rdquo; he added.The UAE already has a stated aim to become a global hydrogen hub. At the COP26 UN Climate Conference last November, the country said that it is targeting a 25 percent share of the global low-carbon hydrogen market by 2030. The new plant will not only produce green hydrogen, but will host a hydrogen fuelling station, producing enough fuel cell grade hydrogen for &ldquo;several large trucks and buses every day,&rdquo; according to the statement.&ldquo;BEEAH has always recognised the value of energy recovery from waste, and this new project will not only showcase the potential of waste-to-hydrogen, but it will also support a circular economy across multiple fronts throughout the region,&rdquo; Al Huraimel added.In attendance at the signing was also Simon Penney, Her Majesty&rsquo;s Trade Commissioner for the Middle East and Her Majesty&rsquo;s Consul General for Dubai, who noted that the agreement is another example of collaboration between the UK and UAE.&ldquo;The partnership between Chinook Sciences and BEEAH Energy to develop the region&rsquo;s first Waste-to-Hydrogen plant is a fantastic example of UK and UAE innovation and ambition, contributing to the sustainable economic growth of both nations,&rdquo; he said.For all the latest business news from the UAE and Gulf countries, follow us on Twitter and Linkedin, like us on Facebook and subscribe to our YouTube page, which is updated daily. \l"

She is currently in Glasgow as part of the UAE delegation to the 26th UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) that ends on November 12 .Khaleej Times asked her about the young nation's efforts to become a game changer in global climate action.Edited excerpts from the exclusive interview:What's been the UAE's stand on climate change?The UAE views climate change as the most serious threat to the future of our planet. The nation's journey in climate action started with its accession to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1995. In 2015, the UAE became the first country in the GCC region to sign the Paris Agreement that seeks to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Last month, the nation reaffirmed its climate leadership by launching the UAE Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative as the first country in the region to pursue a net-zero pathway.The UAE is also a prime convener of global climate action, having staged events such as the Abu Dhabi Climate Meeting in 2019, the UAE Regional Climate Dialogue in 2021, Climate and Biodiversity Week at Expo 2020 Dubai, and the annual Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week. Earlier this year, the country announced its bid to host COP28 in Abu Dhabi in 2023.What is the UAE Vision 2021? How can it bring about sustainable development?Sustainable environment and infrastructure is one of the six national priorities under the UAE Vision 2021. The National Agenda of the UAE Vision 2021 focuses on improving air quality, conserving water resources, boosting the share of clean energy in the country's energy mix, increasing the percentage of treated waste out of the total waste generated, and implementing green growth plans in sectors such as infrastructure, telecom, logistics and housing.How has the UAE integrated climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning in light of the National Climate Change Plan of the UAE 2017-2050?The Plan charts the UAE's path forward in climate change mitigation and adaptation. Within its framework, the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE) is implementing the National Climate Change Adaptation Program that aims to strengthen the country's climate resilience. As part of the program, we have assessed climate risks across key sectors \- energy, infrastructure, health and the environment \- and are working to prepare sectoral adaptation action plans. The Ministry is also currently developing the region's first climate change law.How has the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) evolved as the heart of the clean energy revolution?IRENA was established in 2009 \- at a time when the development and deployment of renewables was accelerating, but many barriers remained.Since then, the Agency has emerged as a credible source of knowledge on all aspects of renewables \- from science and policy to technology \- and is an authority on national and global information and trends in this domain. Its role involves national capacity building on renewable energy, facilitating renewables finance, helping countries map their renewables potential, and identifying market trends and enablers.IRENA works with other relevant international agencies to advance the global clean energy transition and climate action.As the host country and key supporter of IRENA, the UAE is proud of the Agency's achievements.How is the UAE committed to developing a healthcare system resilient to climate change?In July 2019, the UAE Government launched the UAE National Framework for Action on Climate Change and Health 2019-2021 in partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO).

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE81","Climate justice requires women's leadership","March 30, 2022 Wednesday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","The world is well aware that the climate crisis is one of the main stumbling blocks to sustainable development. And yet, despite the dramatic evidence of the lethal consequences of climate change, and despite possessing the knowledge, technologies, and resources to fix it, we continue on the same high-carbon path that threatens our survival.We also know that climate stabilisation depends on a whole-of-society response, and thus on all citizens' equal and fair participation in governance. That has not happened, either: Women have been under represented in climate decision-making. And while this trend has slowly been reversed, much more needs to be done to advance a gender-sensitive response to climate change. Three imperatives stand out: women's leadership, indigenous rights, and education.Efforts to improve gender parity in climate governance have been ongoing for nearly a decade. In 2014, delegates to COP20 adopted the Lima Work Programme on Gender to encourage the inclusion of more women in climate-change negotiations. But five years later, at COP25 in Madrid, 60 per cent of government delegates and 73 per cent of heads and deputy heads of delegations were men.This imbalance led to the adoption of the Enhanced Lima Work Programme and Action Plan on Gender. Under the enhanced plan, the parties to global climate talks pledged to appoint and provide support for national gender and climate-change focal points for climate negotiations, and for project implementation and monitoring. Even so, from 2019 to 2021, women occupied only 33 per cent of all leadership positions in climate-change negotiations and expert mechanisms.But efforts to include women in these discussions continue. The final agreement issued at the close of last November's in Glasgow included gender equality and women's leadership as central components of climate policy and action strategies. This represents clear recognition that the transition to net zero will be possible only through active citizenship, with women playing a vital role.Women are disproportionately affected by the climate crisis, but they are also important agents of change. Giving women a seat at the decision-making table and using a gender lens to shape low-carbon development strategies will go a long way toward making progress on efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change.The transition to carbon neutrality requires a radical change in production systems and consumption patterns across all sectors. Women must be part of the process to develop effective policies. The task is daunting, but there are examples to follow.Costa Rica, for one, has set a clear path toward net-zero carbon dioxide emissions. Since 2014, more than 98% of the energy generated in Costa Rica has come from renewable sources. And in 2021, the country was awarded the Earthshot Prize for its conservation model, according to which local citizens are paid to preserve and restore natural ecosystems, including rainforests. Costa Rica's success can be attributed largely to the commitment of its citizens to sustainable development and the involvement of indigenous and rural women in climate adaptation, knowledge production, and efforts to strengthen resilience.Indigenous and rural women in particular are the most vulnerable to climate change and environmental degradation. The inclusion of these women in creating sustainable practices is thus central to ensuring the effectiveness of climate-related decisions. Initiatives such as Club de Madrid's Shared Societies approach emphasize that indigenous communities have the right to be involved in these discussions, and acknowledge that local communities are more likely to support and implement conservation plans when they are fully invested in their development.Education is also a crucial component of inclusive climate decision-making. In 2021, UNESCO called for environmental education to be a core curriculum component in all countries by 2025. The Berlin Declaration on Education for Sustainable Development states that environmental education must be available to girls and boys alike from an early age to ensure that future generations have sufficient knowledge to respond to climate change. Emphasizing gender equality and non-discrimination in access to climate knowledge and skills will boost the ability of young people to effect change.The recent all-male ""CEO lunch"" convened at the Munich Security Conference shows that women are still missing from the highest levels of global decision-making. Yet women's leadership is needed to respond effectively to shared global challenges. Without the active and meaningful participation of women and girls in local, national, and global climate strategies, a carbon-neutral future will remain out of reach.Laura Chinchilla, a former president of Costa Rica, is vice-president of Club de Madrid.

Increasingly frequent extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, storms and floods, kill thousands and disrupt millions of lives, while threatening healthcare systems and facilities when they are needed most. Changes in weather and climate are threatening food security and driving up food-, water- and vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, while climate impacts are also negatively affecting mental health.The WHO report states: ""The burning of fossil fuels is killing us. Climate change is the single biggest health threat facing humanity.

Over the course of 50 years, the country has undergone significant transformation, establishing itself as a key global destination for business, trade and tourism.Environmental protection has been a key pillar in this journey thanks to the wise guidance of our leaders continuing the legacy of the UAE's late Founding Father - Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan.An influential figure, who was devoted to conserving our nature with a clear vision to shape the future of the country, Sheikh Zayed once said that 'the environment is an integral part of our country, our history and our heritage'.Today, thanks to his inspiring words we are surrounded in our cities by natural greenery. The local parks are regularly visited by hundreds of people every week - whether meeting with friends or taking part in a recreational activity - surrounded by plenty of trees and plants which can be seen from most of the major roads and highways of the city.At the Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi (EAD), we have been at the forefront of driving positive change in the UAE's capital, ensuring Sheikh Zayed's vision remains strong and exemplifies his values of conservation.For example, climate change is the biggest environmental impact we need to address via the creation and implementation of proactive policies and legislations but this is not the only one. Additional issues include pollution, waste disposal and loss of biodiversity, which are threatening our planet with every passing day. With these growing concerns, it is clear that the world will not be the same in the next 10 or 20 years unless action is taken now.This is why the EAD recently launched BAADR, a unique, simple and user-friendly smartphone application that incentivises users and places residents and citizens in the UAE at the forefront of driving positive change. By participating in eco-friendly tasks across seven key themes - Reuse, Switch, Grow, Initiate, Conserve, Join and Move - the app aims to improve our understanding of our impact on the environment and encourage users to think about their actions.More importantly, BAADR can help us behave in a more environmentally conscious manner by making minor changes to our everyday lives. It will enable people to realise how much water or energy they can save, be being more eco-friendly and feel proud of their actions. This can lead them to inspiring others to change their mindsets and make a positive impact - all of which will help create a better future for ourselves and our children.Both in the short and long-term, BAADR will not only benefit Abu Dhabi and the UAE but also the world. There are measures that are being implemented by various countries following last year's COP26 assembly in Glasgow.These include the agreement on finding ways to further cut emissions of carbon dioxide, and over 100 nations pledging to cut their methane emissions by at least 30 per cent by 2030 - all of which shows that we are going in the right direction. The responsibility lies within all of us to play a crucial role in providing a cleaner planet and, more importantly, we need to understand the impact our actions are having on the environment.BAADR can be a catalyst in solving the challenges that we currently face. It can be the answer in helping reduce the amount of solid waste in Abu Dhabi - 9.9 million tonnes in 2018 - or encouraging UAE residents away from single-use plastics, with a current average of 450 plastic water bottles consumed per capita every year in the emirate.We will not see major changes overnight. It will take time but as things stand, if we do not take action, then future generations will also be affected. Together, we have a duty to ensure Sheikh Zayed's legacy continues by making those small changes and integrating with BAADR to make our planet a better place that will improve the lives of fauna, flora, wildlife and human beings. With every passing day, we can make a difference and there is no better time than now to download the App and start using it.Khansa Ibraheem Al Blouki is Director, Environmental Outreach, Environmental Information, Science & Outreach Management at Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi\l"

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE89","India And China To Be Most Exposed Due To Stranded Assets","April 5, 2022 Tuesday","Arabian Post","By Dr. Gyan PathakIndia and China would be the most exposed countries in the world to shutting down of fossil-fuel infrastructures in the mitigation pathways to climate change, and if the existing units would continue to be operated as historically, they would entail CO2 emissions exceeding the carbon budget for 1.5 degree C, a new flagship UN report on climate change released on April 4 has warned. It insisted that global greenhouse gas emission would have to peak ""before 2025 at the latest, and be reduced by 43 per cent by 2030.""The option before the world is therefore limited, whether to shut them down or to continue with them. The report of the Working Group III (WGIII) contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change (IPCC) has indicated that harmful carbon emissions from 2010-2019 have never been higher in human history. It has been even cites by the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres as a proof and warning that the world is on a ""fast track"" to disaster, with scientists arguing that it's 'now or never' to limit global warming to 1.5 degree C. Unless governments everywhere reassess their energy policies, the world will be uninhabitable, he warned.IPCC has been insisting that all countries must reduce their fossil fuel use substantially, extend access to electricity, improve energy efficiency and increase the use of alternative fuels, such as hydrogen. Unless action is taken soon, some major cities of the world will be under water, heatwaves to reach unprecedented high level, terrifying storms will hit, there would be widespread water shortages, and millions of species of plants and animals would face extinction.And this horror story would not be a fiction but realty. It is indicated in the report, if the world continue with the current energy policies. We are on a pathway to global warning of more than double the 1.5 degree Celsius limit agreed in Paris in 2015. However, climate promises were broken, and a yawning gap exists between the implementation and the pledges.Now we need concrete action since there already exists a substantial and growing carbon lock-in today, as measured by committed emissions associated with existing long-lived infrastructure. If we are to mitigate the adverse effects of the climate change, the owner-operators of fossil-fuel infrastructure and societies many choose to retire many of them earlier than in the past, and committed emissions are thus contingent on the competitiveness of non-emitting alternative technologies and climate policy ambition. Therefore, in this mitigation pathways, some fossil-fuel infrastructure may become stranded assets, ie ""assets that have suffered from unanticipated or premature write-downs, devaluations or conversion to liabilities.""A systematic map of the literature on carbon lock-in has synthesized quantification of stranded-assets in the mitigation pathways which show first that the coal power plants are the most exposed to risk of becoming stranded. Secondly, if mitigation action is delayed, it would further increase stranded assets. And thirdly, sectoral distribution and amount of stranded assets much differ between countries.It should be kept in mind that there is high agreement that existing fossil fuel infrastructure would need to be retired earlier than historically, used less, or retrofitted with CCS, to stay within the remaining carbon budgets of limiting warming to 1.5 to 2 degree Celsius.Studies estimate that cumulative early retired power plant capacities by 2060 can be up to 600 GW for gas, and 1700 GW for coal. Only 42 per cent of the total capital stock of both operating and planned coal-fired power plants can be utilized to be compatible with the 2 degree C target. Moreover, Coal-fired power plants in scenarios consistent with keeping global warming below 2 degree C or 1.5 degree C will have to be retired one to three decades earlier than historically has been the case.After coal, electricity production based on gas is also projected to be phased out, with some capacity remaining as back-up. It has been estimated that USD 541 billion worth of stranded fossil fuel power plants could be created by 2060 with China and India the most exposed, the new flagship UN report says.It has also been suggest by some studies that stranded long-lived assets may be even more important outside the power sector. While stranded power sector assets by 2050 could reach up to USD 1.8 trillion in scenarios consistent with a 2 degree C target, there could be USD 5-11 trillion worth of stranded assets in the buildings sectors. Another study has estimated the potential value at risk for global real estate assets up to USD 21 trillion. More broadly, the set of economic activities that are potentially affected by a low carbon transition is wide and includes also energy-intensive industries, transport, and housing.The mitigation pathways following the current NDCs until 2030 do not show a significant reduction of coal, oil, and gas use compared to immediate action pathways. The report says, if action is not taken now, but delayed, there would be higher stranded assets and the societal, economic, and political strain of strengthening action. Carbon lock-in can have a long-lasting effect on future emissions trajectories after 2030. Immediate action is the only cost-effective pathway to mitigation of climate change.The risk of stranded assets has implications for workers depending from those assets, asset owners, assets portfolio managers, financial institutions and the stability of the financial system. Since India is likely to be two of the most exposed countries in this regard, the government obviously should plan its strategy now and look afresh on its commitment and prepone the actions that it has pledged during COP26.

This was demonstrated by a 17.7 percent increase in the UAE, a 36.2 percent increase in Bahrain, and a 37.7 percent increase in Kuwait from April to December 2021. Combined sedan sales increased by nearly 62 percent as compared to the same period last year.Through customer surveys, we've recorded a 17 percent increase in our Customer Happiness index across our digital platforms in FY21 compared to FY20. We continue to listen to our customers and cater our products and offerings to meet their evolving needs by working closely with our partners across the region which has led to a 40 percent increase in our leads to sales conversion within a single year.What are the main challenges facing the sector (especially chip shortages and supply chain problems) and how did Nissan address them?Businesses across a variety of industries have been navigating unprecedented challenges, especially in the past two years since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, which was augmented by supply chain disruptions and most recently a global shortage in semiconductors, all of which have had a cascading effect on the global automotive industry and the consumer technology industry amongst many others.With experts predicting the end of the semiconductor shortage as global production ramps up, the near future remains uncertain, and with that, we at Nissan continue to adapt to unexpected changes, while keeping customers our top priority in doing so.Over the past two years, we have adjusted production schedules within our manufacturing operations, and continue to work closely with our global teams and local partners to minimize the disruption of vehicle deliveries to our dealers and customers. Guided by the Nissan NEXT global transformation plan, we have also managed to maintain profitability and business continuity despite the challenges.How would you describe your transition to the production of electric cars?As the need for greater connectivity and technology in automobiles increases, we are dedicated to building cleaner and greener vehicles that are more connected than ever before.As we place electrification and autonomous driving at the center of our long-term strategy, we harness innovations being made on a global scale and are proud to see this taking shape in the form of the Nissan Ariya, the brand's first all-electric crossover that was showcased for the first time in the region at Expo 2020 Dubai. Serving as a symbol of what is to come, the Ariya is the epitome of Nissan Intelligent Mobility and demonstrates the brand's direction and vision for the future of mobility.As part of our Ambition 2030 plans, we plan to invest over 2 trillion yen ($17.6 billion) over the next five years and aim to launch 23 new electrified models, including 15 new EVs in key global markets by 2030. A few of our latest concepts include Nissan Chill-Out, a next-generation crossover EV that utilises the CMF-EV platform for high levels of comfort and driving excitement, as well the Nissan-Hangout, a utility vehicle that changes the perception of mobile space, all with the goal to democratize technology and accelerate the road to electrification through mass adoption.How important is the UAE market to Nissan, and how would you describe your performance in it?The UAE and the wider Middle East remains a key region of opportunity for Nissan, and our presence in the UAE dates back over fifty years. In 1994, Nissan was also the first Japanese carmaker to establish its regional headquarters in the UAE. Thanks to the deep-rooted heritage of Nissan in the region, and despite the challenges brought about by Covid-19, the last two years have seen us introduce new products to the market, increase sales, and elevate innovation in the products and services we offer customers across the region.The UAE's ambition continues to be met with its relentless dedication to future-readiness, demonstrated through its Net Zero 2050 Strategic Initiative announced ahead of the UN's COP26 summit last year. This comes in parallel with Nissan's 2050 carbon neutrality goals, becoming the first Japanese automaker to join the UN-backed Race to Zero campaign, with commitments to move beyond vehicle emissions to actively implementing innovative sustainability process along the entire supply chain, to reduce carbon footprint on a larger scale.For all the latest business news from the UAE and Gulf countries, follow us on Twitter and Linkedin, like us on Facebook and subscribe to our YouTube page, which is updated daily. \l"

Since the 2015 Paris Agreement, many countries have made commitments on climate action and many have committed to reach Net Zero emissions by 2050.Most of the global community have agreed to work together to limit global warming to well below two degrees, and to adapt to the impacts of a changing climate and to make finance available to assist with the transition from fossil fuels to alternative energy sources. The International Energy Agency predicted that carbon emissions would reduce by just 40% by the middle of the century based on current progress.Significant investment is required to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy. Scaling up investments to finance the transition from fossil fuels to renewables, as well as smart power networks, energy efficiency measures, and electrification in sectors including transportation, buildings, and industry, will be required to transform the world's energy systems.According to the International Energy Agency, worldwide energy investments are currently over $2tn per year, or 2.5% of global GDP (IEA). To achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050, this must climb to $5tn, or 4.5% of GDP, by 2030 and remain there until at least 2050. The bulk of this money will go towards decarbonising electricity generation and infrastructure and to make power networks better suited to much higher volumes and variability of renewable energy.Without a global climate policy and a joint commitment by all, today's minor emitters will develop into significant emitters as their populations and incomes rise. These are also the countries that are typically most hit by the effects of climate change, making transition costs more difficult to bear due to rapidly rising energy demands and limited financial flexibility to finance green projects.Green or climate finance to fund emissions reduction investments in developing countries would allow the burden to be more evenly shared and help the global economy achieve net zero emissions.China, the EU, Japan, Korea, and the United States have all pledged to achieve net zero emissions by the middle of the century, yet the current energy crises in some of these regions suggest that the transition from fossil fuels will not happen in time. Investment in renewable energy projects is essential if the Paris Agreement commitments are to be achieved.As the world starts to recover from the pandemic, it must now tackle climate change and make the commitment to change for everyone's future.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE101","Cut activism at climate summits, we want results","November 27, 2021 Saturday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","There were no winners at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow on Saturday. The world has a long way to go before climate targets are met and celebrations can begin. Ten years; 20; 30? Countdown to catastrophe? We will know soon. World leaders won't wager a bet yet. They may be in agreement to cool the planet and ensuring temperatures do not rise above 1.5\'baC in the medium term. How do we get there is the question. Some deal, any deal was the objective as discussions went cold after assembled protesters and activists had dispersed or made statements from the virtual havens. Climate regulars from Gen Z and Y like Greta Thunberg blamed politicians and governments for failing future generations and the planet. We've heard that before. Let's move on. The venue may have been different but the script remained the same. Former US president Barack Obama also made an appearance but offered little by way of solutions.A watered-down agreement was finally reached on Saturday evening which fell way short of what needs to be done to reverse the effects of climate change while saving lives and the planet. All this was happening as floods continued to wreak havoc in India as the monsoons extend into the winter months. Forecasters are unable to predict the trajectory of the rains this year and the result is disaster for global cities like Chennai in south India. It is normal to cast the blame on climate change, though unchecked human development on water bodies and farmland is the primary reason for our cities being flooded. The truth is: we are unprepared for these changes in weather. The air and our oceans are getting warmer. Our landmass is parched or flooded. We are swinging between extreme weather which makes our world inhabitable.So what did the just concluded COP26 climate summit really achieve, high-profile billing notwithstanding? It succeeded in renewing commitments on reducing emissions but was largely ineffective in enforcing its writ on governments. Such groupings, in fact, lack executive teeth. The question, therefore, arises: why should sovereign governments listen and be bound by these deliberations or agreements. Even the UN hasn't been able to enforce any agreement, forget prevent war. Climate justice for the poor is what the moral goal should be while battling social inequality. In principle, countries agree that climate change is real. Combatting it together demands political will. To reach any agreement, the developed world must provide incentives and funds to developing countries to swiftly make the shift to green technology. Funds must be earmarked for this purpose and spelt out before any deal can be reached. Until that happens, climate summits will serve no real purpose even as activists and lobbyists have a field day.\l"

The Week's activities attracted over 15,000 participants from 40 countries around the world who attended in person and virtually. It also attracted 500 global speakers and experts, including ministers and officials from the government and private sectors, and climate champions, in addition to officials from UN climate organisations. Over four days, the MENA Climate Week featured over 200 panel discussions, workshops and ministerial roundtable sessions. The event was hosted by the UAE Government, represented by the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE), the World Green Economy Organization (WGEO), and Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA), in collaboration with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and the World Bank Group. It was supported by regional partners, including the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the League of Arab States Secretariat, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for West Asia (ESCWA), and the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB).Successful ClosingThe closing ceremony was held at Atlantis The Palm, Dubai. HE Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, Minister of Climate Change and Environment; HE Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Chairman of the World Green Economy Organization, and MD&CEO of DEWA; and James Grabert, Global Head of the UNFCCC Regional Collaboration Centres, gave speeches at the closing ceremony, which was attended by a large number of officials and climate action pioneers.Upscale Climate ActionHE Mariam Almheiri, Minister of Climate Change and Environment, said, ""The urgent need to upscale climate action in the region was the focus of MENA Climate Week. We have reaffirmed our continued commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, especially SDG13: Climate Action, and aligned our efforts to achieve our common climate goals. We have agreed that climate action goes beyond a simple energy transition. We must take a holistic, cross-sectoral, economy-wide approach with multi-stakeholder engagement to the transition of societies and economies to a more sustainable future.""HE Almheiri added, ""With the next two COPs taking place in the Middle East and North Africa, the eyes of the world will be on our region. We are dedicated to keeping up the momentum until COP27 and beyond, and working closely with Egypt to deliver a successful event.""A major milestone in climate actionIn his speech at the closing ceremony, HE Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Chairman of the World Green Economy Organization, and MD&CEO of DEWA, commended partners and organisers of the MENA Climate Week for their valuable contribution to its success. Over four days, the event served as a major milestone in global climate action, and particularly in the region, which has seen a significant increase in climate initiatives. It is also getting ready to host COP27 and COP28.""The timely MENA Climate Week served as the first event focusing on the international climate agenda for 2022. It built on the momentum of the Paris Agreement and the COP26 last year in Glasgow, UK. It is a driving force for regional and international stakeholders to collaborate to implement recommendations and the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2030. The MENA Climate Week took place at the beginning of a critical decade in terms of climate protection and combating global warming. The event has galvanised regional support and collaboration among regional government entities, private organisations and civil society to pave the way for hosting COP27 in Egypt this year and COP28 in the UAE next year,"" said HE Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Chairman of the World Green Economy Organization, and MD&CEO of DEWA.""Holding the event in Dubai has enabled us to share our ambitious national vision and success in supporting global efforts in climate change mitigation. Dubai has implemented strategic projects that resulted in its increased use of clean and renewable energy resources and reduced carbon emissions by 22% in 2019 and 33% in 2020, which were above the set targets. The MENA Climate Week has emphasised the need for stronger regional and international collaboration to address climate change, promote sustainability, and build a better future for humanity. As we conclude this event, I express my gratitude to all participants, partners, sponsors, and supporters of the MENA Climate Week 2022 and a special thanks to UNFCCC and its team. The success of this event further increases our confidence and perseverance to help boost global climate action as well as strengthen cooperation to achieve climate goals, which are key priorities for all world countries and an urgent need as we continue to experience the growing impact of climate change,"" added Al Tayer.Key recommendationsKey recommendations of the MENA Climate Week included calling on all stakeholders to continue providing a constant, multi-sectorial and multi-layered assistance towards achieving carbon-neutral targets, which can contribute to creating sustainable economies, increased employment, social security and prosperity. While recognising the urgent need for climate finance to be made available for mitigation but also for adaptation purpose, there is an urgency for national governments to establish policies and regulatory frameworks to de-risk private sector investments, to mobilise finances and to guide investors. When setting the new collective quantified goal on climate finance, the international community should consider climate finance in a manner that addresses the needs and priorities of developing countries, and also the quality of finance to ensure climate finance is accessible. Planning and development of long-term low emission development strategies which currently involve the Ministries of Environment and/or Climate Change should be extended to Ministries of Economy, Finance, Energy and others to truly unlock the potential of this process and consider the establishment of macro-economic roadmaps of just transition and accompanying policy options, involving all relevant Ministries and breaking down of silos.Three TracksThe Week's activities focused on three tracks; the first was 'Raising Ambition: National actions and economy-wide approaches.' The second was 'Tradition meets Modernity: Integrated Approach for Climate Resilience.' The third track was 'Accelerating Implementation in this Critical Decade.'Source: Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, Government of UAE[Category: Power, Events, ESG]\l"

Still, the economic shock could be averted if those members of Opec + that possess extra reserves deploy them, the Paris-based agency said.The UAE and Saudi Arabia are the two oil producers with the most spare production capacity.On the other hand, Opec maintained its outlook for oil demand in 2022 but said there is an &ldquo;upside potential to the forecast&rdquo; as global economies continue to recover strongly from the coronavirus pandemic-induced headwinds. The group maintained its oil demand forecast for this year at 4.2 million barrels per day, unchanged from the previous month's forecast.The IEA said those risks of oil supply tensions and more volatility, which will have broad economic implications, could be reduced if producers in the Middle East with spare capacity were to compensate for those running out.Saudi Arabia holds the bulk of the group's spare capacity. It has so far resisted the idea of tapping those reserves more quickly, contending that the individual quotas set by the Opec+ agreement should be respected.Oil market experts said major oil producers appear to be in no hurry to increase supply. &ldquo;What is perhaps more important is governments are increasingly walking back their commitments to an energy transition agreed to at COP26.

This bold commitment from the world's biggest emitter has been labelled as a game changer by observers and will inject fresh momentum for action. In addition, the US's return to the Paris Agreement under President Joe Biden's administration will be key to shifting the world's largest economy onto a net-zero footing for 2050.Regionally, the UAE has been leading climate efforts and setting a benchmark for climate ambitions. The launch of the UAE Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative in early October 2021 was the outcome of extensive and ongoing work of the nation's institutions, and represents an opportunity to advance the country's economic diversification to develop new industries, technologies, skills, and jobs while protecting the environment.Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, Minister of Climate Change and the Environment, said, ""With the unprecedented rise in the frequency and scale of climate change impacts seen today, net zero has become a necessity, and countries can either sink or swim. Being the first country in the region to take such a step will give us a first-mover advantage to become a regional leader in the low-carbon economy. We will bring all hands on deck and leverage our net-zero drive to boost green economy. We strongly believe in the gains from becoming climate-neutral, therefore we have committed to investing US$160 billion in clean and renewable energy projects by 2050.""The UAE Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative saw the light of day after the completion of a comprehensive government accelerator programme. The programme was specially designed to integrate the work of key government and private sector entities to prepare and implement an inclusive sustainability plan for all sectors that will set the course for net zero without compromising the country's economic potential.The Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MoCCAE) is leading and coordinating efforts to execute the initiative and ensure collaboration at national level to fulfil this objective. Stakeholders in vital sectors, such as energy, economy, industry, infrastructure, transport, waste, agriculture, and the environment, will update relevant plans, strategies, and policies, and implement projects to achieve net zero by 2050 in l"

Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, will lead the UAE's delegation at the pivotal global climate talks in Glasgow, ensuring the nation plays a key role in discussions with world leaders and national negotiators on measures to address climate change.The meeting \- COP26 (the 26th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)) \- represents the latest opportunity for the 197 parties that signed the UNFCCC treaty to discuss and formalise plans to cut global emissions to ""net zero"" by 2050.The 197 signatory countries' representatives will convene in Glasgow, the United Kingdom (UK), on October 31 to take coordinated action on climate change. Hosted by the UK in partnership with Italy, the summit runs for two weeks until November 12. The UAE's participation at the event is further highlighted by its offer to host COP 28 in 2023.His Highness Sheikh Abdullah said: ""We look forward to working with the international community to build the path to a lower carbon economy to safeguard the environment and reduce emissions, as well as create lasting economic opportunity. We remain a committed partner in the world's efforts to mitigate climate change and find inclusive practical climate solutions that will deliver sustainable economic growth.""Sheikh Abdullah said: ""Should we be confirmed as hosts, our goal will be to make COP 28 as inclusive and action-oriented as possible, a COP that brings together developed and developing countries and unites all sectors - public, private, academic and civil society - around a focus on tangible solutions.""His Highness added: ""At a time of rapidly rising climate risk that threatens all countries, we approach this important responsibility with humility and also with determination to support the international community in our pursuit of a practical agenda that is focused on implementation, has ambition, highlights opportunity and drives change.""""As we celebrate our Golden Jubilee year, we aim to build strong partnerships that are central to economic progress, environmental action and solving global challenges,"" added H.H. Sheikh Abdullah. Unwavering focus on positive climate action.The UAE is leveraging the path to a lower carbon economy to safeguard the environment, drive down emissions and create lasting economic opportunity. An unwavering commitment to reducing emissions \- bolstered by the recent launch of the UAE Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative \- has led to a number of global and regional firsts for the nation. As part of its net-zero strategy, the UAE plans to invest AED600 billion in clean and renewable energy sources by 2050.Dr. Sultan Al Jaber, UAE Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and UAE Special Envoy for Climate Change, said: ""Over the last 15 years, the UAE has invested heavily in clean technologies that help us both mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change while diversifying our economy, developing new industries and generating positive economic impacts for our people. We are focused on accelerating commercially viable clean technologies and cutting-edge solutions to enhance resource management and food and water security. This closely aligns with the UAE Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative, which defines the next phase of our national development, creating new knowledge, new skills and new jobs.""Highlighting the nation's offer to host COP 28, he added: ""We would leverage our experience as a global convenor focused on global challenges to bring together all stakeholders in order to accelerate climate solutions that make good sense for our environment and also simply make good business sense.""Further building on the nation's commitment to energy transition, the state energy company Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) announced a significant step in decarbonising its operations. Starting January 2022, ADNOC will source up to 100 per cent of its grid power from domestic solar and nuclear energy after an agreement inked with Emirates Water and Electricity Company, supporting the national UAE Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative.Mariam Almheiri, UAE Minister of Climate Change and Environment, said: ""The UAE has always addressed global challenges as a constructive global citizen, and we believe partnerships are the key to progress. This bold approach has underpinned our commitment as a first mover in climate action in the region. In fact, we are now building on our strong track record of climate innovation to drive sustainable economic growth.""A constructive global citizen.The UAE was the first country in the GCC region to sign and ratify the Paris Agreement. This 2015 agreement commits signatories to work together to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2030. Furthermore, the UAE was the first country in MENA to commit to an economy-wide reduction in emissions.As a result of this forward thinking, the nation is now home to three of the largest and lowest-cost solar plants in the world \- including Noor Abu Dhabi, the world's largest stand-alone operational solar power plant, located in Sweihan, Abu Dhabi, featuring 3.2 million solar panels and producing 1.2 gigawatts of electricity.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE118","In now-or-never urgency, world looks to EU to lead climate war","October 27, 2021 Wednesday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","There is now an urgency in the mission as climate change becomes a real and present danger. It's the most important conference on climate change ever held. As leaders, scientists and activists gather in Glasgow, Scotland starting next week for the COP26 UN-sponsored forum, even sceptics are aware that extreme weather events are hitting with greater frequency globally.And with all the previous and preliminary meetings laying the groundwork, COP26 is the time and place for real tangible action. There is now an urgency in the mission as climate change becomes a real and present danger. Glasgow is also the setting for the 27-member European Union to show its true strength as it leads the battle against climate change through its own measures, for example as a role model and ability to leverage others.In the lead-up to COP26, the EU Parliament approved a common negotiating position for one of the bloc's toughest ministers \- Dutchman Frans Timmermans \- to advocate as he leads the charge.And make no mistake: The EU is leading the way as the world's most prepared and determined centre of power in the fight against climate change. Before the pandemic hit, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had already placed climate change as the No. 1 priority and marshalled the funding and players to back it up.Central to the effort is a plan for trading in carbon emissions that has serious economic disincentives for any non-compliant producer globally. And it is underpinned with specific target goals that reach just five years into the future, not some theoretical horizon decades hence.Similar to how its privacy and data protection laws affected the global internet, the EU's carbon rules will impact manufacturers and energy consumers worldwide. As the wealthiest region in the world and the biggest trader in goods and services, if you want to do business internationally, you will have to meet EU rules. It can truly set the global standard.Tasked by their own voters and consumers, European leaders and manufacturers are clear they intend to implement a bold move away from the old carbon-based paradigm for power and production. A measure of how deep that runs is an announcement last week by Volkswagen, the world's biggest carmaker, that it will no longer build vehicles in Europe with internal combustion engines by 2035. Given the deep tradition and long history of the engines that powered the world for more than a century, it was a historic announcement.And the EU knows it must step up now because other superpowers cannot or will not fully commit to firm action in the near future.Although US President Joe Biden has re-engaged the international effort there is no clear program on how the US proposes to transform its own economy and move away from carbon-emitting production. And to get his budget through Congress, Biden appears to be scaling back even the cautious level of ambition in his clean energy program.For his part, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged that China would stop funding new coal plants abroad but rolling blackouts in October have put Beijing's timetable for ending the use of coal at home into question. Power outages in northeastern China plunged millions of homes into darkness and triggered factory shutdowns. Even the state-run Global Times newspaper termed the electricity cuts ""unexpected"" and ""unprecedented"".At the same time, near-panic about soaring gas, oil and electricity prices in Europe and elsewhere \- though unrelated to the transition away from carbon \- has put the need for renewable energy in the spotlight.But even with its advantages, how can the EU ensure something tangible emerges from Glasgow by the time the summit ends on Nov. 12? The EU Parliament tasked Timmermans to be a ""bridge-builder"", a job that includes bringing wealthy nations together with the less affluent, a strategy it said helped achieve real results at past climate negotiations.In such a new global effort combining science, diplomacy and action, the learning curve has been steep. At one of the first real summits on climate change, held in Copenhagen in 2009, major greenhouse gas emitters arrived with few if any concrete proposals. When the conference was over, they mostly continued on as before.By 2015, the threat seemed more immediate than before and the EU had learned how to better operate in the new diplomatic dynamic. At the landmark meeting in Paris, the EU helped form an informal group of developed and developing countries committed to supporting the common goal of a real transition to a green economy. The target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius relative to pre-industrial levels was established, and developed countries pledged to help fund efforts by the poorest countries.So the Paris Agreement was signed. But in the six years since, global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to climb, even in the pandemic-stricken year of 2020. Wealthy nations also have not kept their promise to provide $100 billion a year to poor countries to help fund the green transition. The EU will need to exert real pressure on the US and others to deliver their share.Discussion of the climate crisis was once considered a rather arcane debate over something that sceptics said was not even real, or perhaps just a theoretical calculation made by eccentrics and otherworldly scientists. It seemed far away for many, more akin to the periodic announcements on the behaviour of black holes in deep space.Yet today, Germans and Belgians are continuing to rebuild following catastrophic floods last summer and another ""bomb cyclone"" threatens the western US at the very moment final preparations are underway in Glasgow for COP26.The challenge is real and the EU says it is equally serious about getting real plans in place. Considered hobbled at times by the self-interest of member nations, the EU knows it must now lead and force others to follow. The time has come for a shared solution to a shared global threat.Jon Van Housen and Mariella Radaelli are veteran international journalists based in Milan\l"

Reaching the milestones laid out over the next few years will be crucial after COP 26 [Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)], he pointed out.""The ideas and methods that made us prosperous are no longer the answer. We need smarter, more sustainable economies. There is no easy solution to the climate change problem, but also there is no other option but to take up the challenge,"" Rutte emphasised.Citing The Netherlands pavilion at Expo 2020 Dubai as an example, he said it highlighted three crucial requirements for life, water energy and food. The Prime Minister said they were not treated as separate themes with their own individualistic solutions, but instead the Pavilion took a holistic approach, each linked with one another.Rutte said that the new way to address climate change issues is ""joint-up-thinking"". The Pavilion that extracts water from air to grow plants, and once Expo ends, its every scrap of material will be taken down and given a new purpose, is an example of this new way of thinking, he noted.The Dutch leader hoped ""this small scale demonstration of circularity provides a small demonstration of how innovation can help address the climate crisis"".Rutte pointed out that ""climate change is not simply an economic crisis, it's also a social crisis"". He said the world's poor are being hit hardest, leading to greater inequality.In his closing remarks, the Prime Minister added that ""we need to be even more ambitious than we have been. Thanks to demographic changes, economic development and international trade, demand for fresh water, energy and food can only increase, so we need to align our policies and technologies around the natural nexus of water, energy and food"".He concluded that ""we need to be more ambitions and lead to a world sustainable future for all"".ADSW 2022 is the first major sustainability event after the COP26 climate change conference, and acts as a global catalyst for COP27, which will be held in Egypt in 2022, and COP28, which will be hosted by the UAE in 2023.\l"

We welcomed seven new government partners - six countries and the European Commission (EU) - to our coalition, which means we now have over 140 government and non-government partners.In addition, we launched AIM for Climate Ideations - a new way for our partners to support the initiative through hosting events and activities focused on advancing its objectives.IBM has introduced our ninth innovation sprint - IBM Sustainability Accelerator - a pro-bono social impact programme that will see the company provide technology and expertise to deliver key insights on agriculture to farmers, community leaders and conservationists.We also announced our innovation sprint focal areas for 2022 - smallholder farmers in low-and middle-income countries, methane reduction, emerging technologies and agroecological research - and heard from guest speakers on the first two topics.What are innovation sprints?Innovation sprints are investments in specific, impactful, expedited efforts by our non-government partners. Our innovation sprints for 2022 will be launched at COP27. Proposals can be submitted at HYPERLINK mailto:info@aimforclimate.orginfo@aimforclimate.orgWe are planning to host Ideation events for each of the focal areas to facilitate discussion and networking towards the creation of innovation sprints.Who can support AIM for Climate and how?In addition to governments, our coalition is open to non-government partners from the ranks of international organisations, non-profits, academia, technology, and food & beverage (F&B) companies, and farmers' associations. They can support AIM for Climate as innovation sprint partners or knowledge partners.I have already explained what innovation sprints are. Also, knowledge partners, such as private research and education institutions, international organisations, companies, or non-governmental organisations (NGOs), amplify agricultural innovation through insight sharing, innovation collaboration, coordination, institutional capacity building, or demonstration and deployment.Our current non-government partners include the United Nations' (UN) Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Economic Forum (WEF), the UN Foundation, the Foundation for Food & Agriculture Research (FFAR), CGIAR, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and CropLife International, just to name a few. Among the most prominent representatives of the private sector are PepsiCo, BASF, Bayer, IBM, and Nestl&eacute;.Hosted by Expo 2020 Dubai, the dinner was an amazing experience that brought together leaders from diverse backgrounds and cultures, each bringing a unique perspective, united through food. The guest chefs used their knowledge and experience to curate and narrate a dinner aligned with the SDGs and the eight thematic areas of the Chefs' Manifesto that aims to inspire those who are the closest to food and offer them a pathway to building a world with zero hunger through simple, practical everyday actions.Each table of guests had their own personal chef, who prepared a menu that was relevant to their personal story. The chefs used food grown locally at Emirates Bio Farm and sustainably sourced ingredients from the UAE, supported by ingredients from their home countries.When it comes to food, whether we're ministers, heads of organisations, chefs, or members of civil society, we all have an essential role to play in helping end world hunger and building a better future for the next generations. The dinner provided us with an ideal opportunity to have real conversations about how we can work together to achieve this noble mission.Uniting the world for a food-secure future, the inaugural edition of the Summit in the MENA region served as the definitive platform for dialogue aimed at driving positive change in regional and global food systems. The event drew the participation of over 100 global leaders, 140+ exhibitors and more than 50 innovative start-ups from over 60 countries.The summit comprised several key tracks, including the Global Leaders' Symposium that convened international ministerial delegations and leading executives from non-profit organisations worldwide to explore new solutions to global food security challenges.Also, part of the event, the MENA Agri-Food Innovation Days aspired to enhance engagement of the public and private sectors, academia, and civil society in driving the transformation of the region's food systems through providing a forum for exchange of knowledge and best practices and highlighting the latest innovations and technologies.The Making it Happen conference focused on innovation and technology-enhanced agriculture and supply chain, with some of the most influential local, regional, and global brands discussing their roles in enhancing food security and safety.The event also featured the Generation Food stage, hosting a range of workshops on various topics related to food for the future global population, and a farmers market showcasing the best food products grown and made in the UAE.Helping countries integrate nutrition into their national food security and climate plans, the VGFSN bring all relevant sectors under one umbrella to build sustainable food systems.

The initiative, which is led by the Danish and Costa Rican governments and was launched at COP26 in Glasgow on November 11, has called for ""bold and tangible action, not talk"" to move beyond oil and gas. The alliance is supported by 11 governments and views an end to oil and gas production as a key component of meeting the Paris Agreement's 1.5-degree target. ""The IPPC has sounded a code red for humanity, because there is no future for oil and gas in a 1.5-degree world,"" said Danish Minister for Climate, Energy\~and Utilities Dan Jorgensen ""The fossil era must come to an end."" The alliance is the first state-led initative to bring the phasing out of oil and gas production into the international area. The alliance currently features: Denmark; France; Ireland; Sweden; Wales; Iceland; Costa Rica; Quebec; New Zealand and California. Italy supports the alliance as a friend. The group does not feature any major oil and gas producers, and crucially does not feature the UK, the COP26 host. Denmark is taking the lead by setting 2050 as the date for the end of oil and gas production, and has committed to ceasing immediately all oil and gas licensing. ""Our goal is not small, our ambition is not modest. We hope that today will mark the beginning of the end of oil and gas,"" said Jorgensen. ""The science has spoken and the time for O&G has run out,"" he said. The body features countries that have committed to ending oil and gas production by a certain date.

Governmental consent was initially provided two decades ago to conduct field exploitation at the location, some 78 miles offshore in one thousand-meter-deep waters.According to a 2021 ministerial announcement, oil drilling parties will be allowed to continue to conduct exploration activities in the North Sea in pursuit of new reserves.\l"

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE128","Putting public finance on the right side of world history","October 5, 2021 Tuesday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","The economics of renewable energy have improved beyond recognition. Solar power is now the cheapest form of electricity in history. Over 90 per cent of power-generation capacity added around the world last year was in renewables. But to stand a chance of limiting global warming to 1.5\'b0 Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the world's energy systems must transform even faster. And that requires governments and public financial institutions to stop supporting fossil fuels and instead emphasize international support for the clean-energy transition.The science is clear. To meet the 2015 Paris climate agreement's 1.5\'b0C target, the global energy transition needs to progress 4-6 times faster than it currently is. Fossil fuels still supply 84 per cent of the world's energy and account for over 75 per cent of global emissions. The International Energy Agency's Net Zero by 2050 roadmap shows that global energy systems must be fossil-fuel-free by 2040. Yet since the Paris agreement was concluded, G20 governments have provided more than three times more public finance for fossil fuels ($77 billion) than for renewables every year.This year's catastrophic storms, floods, and wildfires have shown why we need climate action now, not later. And because future prosperity lies in clean energy investment, there is also a clear economic development case for redoubling our efforts. Wind and solar are now cheaper than new coal and gas power plants in two-thirds of the world. The dramatic cost reduction over the past decade has transformed global energy options, particularly in the very poorest countries, where renewables-based mini grids offer real opportunities to alleviate energy poverty and provide energy access.Boosting investment in renewables is also vital to creating jobs, driving economic growth, and reducing air pollution. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, deploying renewables at scale could help create 42 million jobs worldwide by 2050. This additional employment will be crucial for delivering a resilient, green recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, especially in countries with young, fast-growing populations.But, of course, jobs will also disappear as we abandon fossil fuels. We therefore must take steps to ensure that every community benefits from the transition. This will require carefully designed policies to support a managed shift away from older forms of energy generation. Global solidarity will be critical. We must do much more to provide everyone with the necessary technologies, expertise, investment support, and financial strategies.Fortunately, we already have solutions to the problem. At the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow in November, governments and financial institutions must commit to supporting cheaper, cleaner, no-regrets energy, and to ending all international support for fossil-fuel-based power. This should not be too difficult, given that many legacy energy investments will inevitably become stranded assets.We are already starting to see significant progress in this direction. In May, G7 member states committed to cease all of their international financing for coal projects by the end of 2021, and to ""phase out new direct government support for carbon-intensive international fossil fuel energy."" Moreover, South Korea, Japan, and now China \- the world's largest providers of international coal financing \- have also agreed to stop funding coal projects overseas.Equally important, more than 85 countries (plus the European Union) have submitted updated national climate pledges, as outl"

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE132","How to manage energy crises in an age of climate disruption","December 13, 2021 Monday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","A recent report by Goldman Sachs reached a surprising conclusion: Over the past eight years, financial markets have been increasing the cost of capital for big, long-term, high-carbon investments in sectors such as offshore oil and liquefied natural gas. But when it comes to renewable projects, the ""hurdle rate"" \- the minimum rate of return required by investors \- has been declining. The difference is significant, translating into an implied carbon price of about $80 per tonne of carbon dioxide for new oil developments and $40 per ton of CO2 for LNG projects.Capital markets seem finally to be internalising the message that high-carbon investments should carry a significant risk premium. This insight has not emerged spontaneously. It is the result of many years of in-depth research, targeted analyses by groups like Carbon Tracker and the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, pressure from investor alliances, hard-hitting NGO campaigns, and divestment decisions by foundations, churches, universities, and pension funds.The shift in capital-market sentiment has been reinforced by political action. At last month's United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, nearly 40 countries and institutions pledged to end public finance for oil, gas, and coal projects overseas. In addition, Denmark and Costa Rica spearheaded a group of 12 countries and regions that launched the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance.These efforts, though still partial in their coverage and insufficient, are to be welcomed as a sign that financial flows are now starting to align with the goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, as mandated by article 2.1(c) of that treaty. But the implicit carbon price demanded by capital markets so far covers only the supply side: the oil, gas, and coal fields, refineries, and transport infrastructure that feed fossil fuels into the global economy.Unfortunately, similar progress on the demand side for coal, oil, and gas has been lacking. Despite much talk of green recoveries from the COVID-19 shock, huge government stimulus programs have largely failed to discriminate between green and dirty economic activity, and have thus stabilized the global economy on the old growth path.Moreover, these interventions have created significant consumer demand as the economy bounces back. Movement profiles point to renewed car use and air travel, while energy-intensive industries like cement, steel, plastics, and chemicals are again fueling demand for electricity, gas, and coal. Significantly, China's economic stimulus has focused far too much on the highly carbon-intensive building sector, instead of undertaking the long overdue reorientation of the country's growth model in l"

AIM for Climate has already garnered a strong coalition of support, including more than 30 countries and around 50 non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and mobilised $4 (Dh14.69) billion of increased investment, with $1 (Dh3.67) billion pledged by the UAE.Another feather in the UAE's cap was the launch of the Energy Transition Accelerator Financing (ETAF) platform in partnership with the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). The new global climate finance platform intends to fast-track the shift to renewable energy in developing countries. The UAE committed $400 (Dh1,469.24) million in funding, provided by Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD), for the initiative that seeks to secure $1 (Dh3.67) billion in total.Managed by IRENA from its Abu Dhabi headquarters, ETAF will help mitigate investment risks and finance renewable energy projects in developing countries that may otherwise struggle to secure Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, Minister of Climate Change and Environment, was part of the UAE delegation to the global gathering, led by Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE's Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, and comprising representatives of leading government and private sector entities.Almheiri attended multiple high-level events and bilateral meetings at the conference, where she highlighted the UAE's endeavours to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change, protect its environment, and enhance its food and water security. She also made several important announcements on behalf of the country.Khaleej Times spoke to the minister about the outcomes of the summit and the way forward.Edited excerpts from the interview:What are your thoughts on the honour for the UAE to host COP28 in 2023 and the Arab League's support for the young nation to host such a momentous event?We appreciate the support of the international community for our bid, and are proud of the UNFCCC's vote of confidence that reaffirms the UAE's climate leadership. At a time of rapidly rising climate risks that threaten all countries, we welcome the responsibility of hosting COP28. We seek to leverage our solid track record as a global climate action convener to deliver a productive event with high youth engagement that builds a strong economic case for climate action, and mobilises countries to increase the scale and pace of their efforts to address climate change. We are committed to driving multilateral diplomacy aimed at preserving our planet for the next generations and building a better future for all humankind.Why does the UAE believe climate action is an opportunity to achieve sustainable economic growth?As a result of climate change impacts, governments bear costs in healthcare, disaster relief and rebuilding damaged infrastructure that amount to billions of dollars, and businesses face risks ranging from disrupted supply chains and higher insurance costs to labour challenges. Meanwhile, people \- particularly disadvantaged and vulnerable populations \- are affected by food and water insecurity, higher food prices, lost incomes and livelihoods, adverse health effects and displacement. According to UN estimates, every dollar spent on preparation for climate disasters could save seven dollars in disaster relief costs. In addition to the savings, tackling climate change through innovation creates new knowledge, new industries, new skills, and new jobs that fuel economic growth. So, it's clear that climate action makes good business sense and provides valuable opportunities for sustainable development, on which we shouldn't miss out.What measures are being undertaken to implement the UAE Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative?Federal and local government authorities have joined forces to issue policies and strategies and launch projects and initiatives aimed at cutting down on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These include expanding the deployment of clean energy solutions, planting millions of trees, developing the country's carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) network, shifting to a green economy across priority sectors \- industry, energy, transport, and the environment \- and increasing reliance on advanced technologies and AI.The Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE) is working with private sector entities nationwide to devise plans and implement projects that will help them shape a low-carbon development path.How would the UAE promote inclusive climate negotiations?Inclusivity will be the guiding principle of COP28. We understand that each region and country have a different starting point and might move at its own pace. The event will provide an ideal opportunity to learn from our peers which path is working under what circumstances. We will ensure that the voice of every nation \- whether developed or developing \- and every stakeholder is heard, and that the specific geographic, climatic and socio-economic conditions of every country are considered when charting a global roadmap to a climate-resilient future. We are keen to promote a just and inclusive transition to a sustainable way of life that truly leaves no one behind.How is COP28 an opportunity to 'bring the world together to explore effective solutions to the most pressing challenges our planet faces'?If we want to achieve the objective of the Paris Agreement to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius (C), we need all hands on the deck. And as the home of IRENA and an experienced host of high-profile international events, the UAE provides an ideal venue to convene world leaders to tackle climate change on a global level.COP28 is particularly important because it will provide a platform to present the results of the first global stock taking of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that aims to assess the world's progress in reducing GHG emissions. We plan to focus on advancing climate change adaptation, raising our collective climate ambition and stepping up global climate finance commitments.How is the UAE planning to 'work closely' with John Kerry, the US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate?In addition to collaborating on AIM for Climate, the UAE has endorsed the US- and EU-led Global Methane Pledge that aims to reduce global methane emissions by 30 per cent by 2030. We also seek to jointly identify opportunities for strategic investment in the clean energy transition worldwide, develop and scale clean energy technologies, and work to enhance climate security.During his previous visits to the UAE, Mr Kerry toured our clean energy projects and participated in the UAE Regional Climate Dialogue. He praised the country's efforts to lead other nations in the search of new technology to address the global climate challenge.Data shows that the UAE already has about 60 million mangroves, and aims to increase the number by 50 per cent. What steps are being taken to increase the mangrove cover?The UAE has always been a pioneer in leveraging nature-based solutions to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change. As we are a coastal country, we seek to harness the power of our blue carbon ecosystems, including mangrove forests that protect our coasts from rising sea levels and storm surges, provide critical habitats for biodiversity and serve as effective carbon sinks.In our second NDC, we pledged to plant an additional 30 million mangroves by 2030 \- the 50 per cent increase that you mentioned. And at COP26, we stepped up our ambition by raising this target to 100 million. The move will bring our total mangrove forest area to 483 square kilometres and boost the CO2 sequestration rate to nearly 115,000 tonnes per year. We are working closely with NGOs and the private sector to achieve our goal. A prime example of such collaboration is the Dubai Mangrove Forest, an initiative of Emirates Marine Environmental Group (EMEG) sponsored by P&G.How is the UAE improving global water security through cloud-seeding technology?To explore the significant unrealised potential of rain enhancement, the National Center of Meteorology (NCM) runs the UAE Rain Enhancement Program (UAEREP). Since its inception, the program has established a network of more than 1,200 researchers from over 500 institutions around the world. UAEREP has gained a prominent position in the global quest to address water security challenges through innovation, and placed the UAE at the international forefront of rain enhancement research.Under the programme, the UAE has been one of the first countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region to use the cloud-seeding technology that modifies a cloud's structure to increase the chance of rain by adding small, ice-like particles. UAEREP's research focuses on boosting the efficiency of cloud seeding through various methods, such as leveraging nanotechnology to accelerate water condensation and using drones to minimise the environmental impact of the operations.How is the UAE becoming a key player in the hydrogen industry?January 2021 marked the inception of the Abu Dhabi Hydrogen Alliance that aims to establish our capital as a pioneer in green and blue hydrogen.We launched the first industrial-scale solar-powered green hydrogen project in the region at the Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Dubai in May 2021 while expanding blue hydrogen production to diversify our energy mix.At COP26And just a few days ago, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and Abu Dhabi National Energy Company (TAQA) have announced the formation of a new joint venture focused on renewable energy and green hydrogen.The UAE's hydrocarbon industry maintains one of the world's lowest methane intensities of 0.01 per cent. The Global Methane Pledge that we endorsed at COP26 provides us with an opportunity to share our capabilities and experience in best-in-class methane performance with the other signatories. On the home front, we aim to reduce human-caused methane emissions through domestic policy-making and developing innovative solutions in sectors such as oil and gas and waste management. Our methane mitigation strategy is part of our holistic approach to climate action. HYPERLINK mailto:joydeep@khaleejtimes.comjoydeep@khaleejtimes.com\l"

This new variant could add pressure to that, so how well we react is going to be crucial.""The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 caused many factories to close, leading to a backlog in semiconductor chip production, which was then exacerbated by soaring demand, with people working from home requiring laptops and tablets.""We have a semiconductor shortage as an industry, and how we recover from that is critical,"" Uchida added.Besides Uchida's comments, Nissan has announced that its vehicle electrification strategy includes the proposed introduction of 23 electrified models by 2030, along with a goal of having electric vehicles account for 75 percent of its European sales by 2026.Earlier this year, Nissan announced an investment of \£31 billion in its Sunderland plant in the UK, to develop it as a hub for electric vehicle production.

However, at the recent COP26 climate summit in Scotland, Nissan, along with Toyota, Volkswagen and BMW, refused to join Ford and Volvo in pledging to phase out petroleum-fueled vehicles by 2040.Nissan is also investing more in developing solid state batteries, which are expected to more efficient than lithium-ion batteries, the current industry standard.\l"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE139","Why Start-ups Should Be Setting Up With Sustainability at the Heart","February 23, 2022","HealthMagazine.ae","PrintStart-up businesses are the heartbeat and future of our planet, and they therefore, must play a key role in creating sustainable businesses of the future. To elaborate more, UK TV personality and founder of sustainability platform &lsquo;Buy Smarter Buy Greener&rsquo; Kate Hardcastle MBE discusses the way forward in sustainability and small businesses.Why it mattersAccording to Hardcastle, at a time when our planet had some time to recover due to less travel during COVID-19, the leaders of the world came together for COP26 and the big brands are making their pledges to do more and be better &ndash; with net zero, reducing waste, recycling and reusing, all high on the agenda. &ldquo;It matters to our consumers more than ever too, COVID-19 has subtly, but significantly shifted consumer awareness of the relationship with the spaces in which we live, accelerating demand for living a more sustainable life,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Over the last 18 months, consumers have spent more time outdoors and in many cases had more time on their hands to appreciate our planet with 39 percent of shoppers saying they will have a more environmentally friendly mindset when out shopping as a result of COVID-19.&rdquo;Where to beginWhen we talk about sustainability, it&rsquo;s important to look at what is realistic to a business owner? &ldquo;We know that it&rsquo;s impossible to be one hundred percent green and sustainable all of the time, so it&rsquo;s essential to look at what is realisticfor you and your business &ndash; what quick switches, ideas, and changes could you implement to make a difference?&rdquo; she asks. &ldquo;Small steps make big changes. As a start-up business of 2021 and beyond, it is our duty to create a businesswhich is mindful of our planet, reducing the impact, and in an ideal world, being self-sufficient.&rdquo;Here are some areas to consider when starting your businessCreate a green culture from day one &ndash; setting out your green agenda and objectives at the same time as creating your business plan is essential &ndash; sustainability should be at the heart of your business. Think about how you could help your staff, your community, and those around you to be green, too&ndash; could you set up a &lsquo;green team&rsquo; or allocate a &lsquo;green champion&rsquo;? Empower staff to make important decisions and introduce new initiatives that will encourage all staff and customers to make more sustainable choices.Reducing your carbon footprint &ndash; many large companies have set future goals to reduce their carbon emissions and become net zero &ndash; as a startup business, how can you build this into your business plan from the word go? Think about your forecasted emissions, how could you minimize or reduce them? Look at your consumption of energy and water, can you install heat pumps or solar panels to generate your own energy from the beginning? If you can&rsquo;t avoidor reduce certain elements of energy usage, look into carbon offsetting schemes whilst you find a way to reduce your emissions further.Packaging &ndash; think about how your products are packages and distributed to your customers. What type of materials are you using to send your products out to customers? Can you reduce the amount of packaging used or reduce the amount of single use plastics used in the process?Product sourcing &ndash; take a look at the products you will use to run your business, whether this is the materials used to make your products or the tools and machinery needed in the process &ndash; can you reduce plastic usage or use recycled materials?Challenging your supply chain &ndash; take a look at your suppliers green credentials to make sure they align with your sustainable values or even simply asking them if they can source a more environmentally friendly solution for you can make a big difference.Wastage and recycling &ndash; whilst we appreciate that this probably isn&rsquo;t the most appealing job to on your to do list, reviewing your waste is an effective way to understand exactly what your business is using and what is being thrown away &ndash; as a start-up business, take a look at your forecasted wastage &ndash; how can you reduce, reuse, and recycle more in your processes?Behind the scenes &ndash; when setting up a business, there are many behind the scenes tasks that can be tackled with a green focus from day one &ndash; from the cleaning products you use to the energy consumed and even the pens in your stationery cupboard. Having a holistic approach to creating a sustainable business will help embed your green plan and cement it at the heart of the business.Consider ways to help your customers make sustainable choices &ndash; how can you help them to come on the green journey, too? Can you help them live every day in a more sustainable way? Can you educate them on how your products or services are reducing the impact on our planet? Can you give them tips or ideas to be more sustainable?Collaboration is key &ndash; we simply can&rsquo;t work alone to reduce our impact on the planet &ndash; how can you work with others to make a difference? Can you make a collective effort to reduce waste or recycle more? Can you create a green charter for the businesses around you to sign up to?Together, we can make an impact and doing so from day one in a start-up business gives the upper hand and keeps sustainability at the forefront.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE140","Raising the bar for sustainable mountain tourism","December 9, 2021 Thursday","ArabianBusiness.com","Global cooperation has been a big takeaway from climate events such as Cop26 and the Saudi Green Initiative Forum. It's clear that climate action can only be achieved through multilateral collaboration and sharing knowledge, ideas, and expertise with other like-minded peers.As a fragile mountain ecosystem that's home to thousands of wild animals, migratory birds, lavender fields, juniper trees and local communities rich in culture and heritage, protecting this environment and its inhabitants is paramount. Partnerships must be strengthened to raise awareness and promote sustainable mountain development.Humans have lived and thrived at high altitudes for thousands of years. Traces of human occupation in what we now call Soudah and parts of Rijal Almaa stretch back several millenniums; scientists have found rock inscriptions that they believe could be between 5,000 and 6,000-years-old.Desert Rock mountain resort unveiled to support Saudi tourism ambitionsWhile mountains have served as a place of human settlement for time immemorial, protecting these dynamic yet vulnerable ecosystems have only taken root in last few decades.In 1992, heads of state convened at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro and signed a plan for action called Agenda 21. Chapter 13 is entitled 'Managing Fragile Ecosystems: Sustainable Mountain Development'. This chapter launched a slow but steady process where awareness and understanding of the global importance of mountains, the vulnerability of their ecosystems and the need to protect local communities increased.It was a watershed moment. And it led to the creation of today's Mountain Partnership \- a global alliance of more than 400 members. Steered by the United Nations' Food and Agricultural Organisation, the Mountain Partnership is a vibrant voluntary alliance of governments and organisations committed to working together with the common goal of achieving sustainable mountain development.By tapping the wealth and diversity of knowledge, information, and expertise of global membership, it stimulates concrete initiatives at all levels to address threats, improve quality of life and sustain healthy environments in the world's mountain regions.Partnerships must be strengthened to raise awareness and promote sustainable mountain development.At , this organisation came together to promote the benefits of low-impact tourism and its contribution to the conservation and valorization of mountain ecosystems and their biodiversity. Helping local communities bounce back and recover from the Covid-19 pandemic can be driven by sustainable tourism. Natural resource management and climate adaption in mountain regions are issues we at Soudah Development care deeply about.Located in the southwest of Saudi Arabia on the kingdom's highest mountains, our destination is covered in green highlands, cloud-piercing clifftops and an extraordinary array of flora and fauna. Here, you can spot striped hyenas, Indian crested porcupines, native Arabian wolves, the Arabian red fox, wild cats, and the Asian garden mouse. High up on the mountaintop you may even be able to see the steppe eagle soaring across the sky or maybe a griffon vulture gliding through the air. You may spot the endangered Asir magpie.As you take one of the many serpentine hiking paths through the juniper-clad valleys, you will discover the rich culture and heritage of Soudah and parts of Rijal Almaa. It offers a chance to experience, traditional folk music, poetry, fashion.Visitors can bask in the authentic charm of the flowerman festival where locals don crowns made from vibrant flowers and grass rich in the aroma of lavender and marjoram. As you continue down these hiking trails, visitors often replenish themselves on the coffee, mountain strawberries, honey and locally caught fish (it is, after all, just 80km as the crow flies to the coastal town of Al Qahma on the Red Sea).As a business, we were established to drive the transformation of Soudah and parts of Rijal Almaa in the Asir region by creating a luxury mountain tourism destination. Sustainability is a guiding principle for everything we do.Soudah Development is committed to protecting the region's natural beauty, biodiversity, and wildlife.We are committed to protecting the region's natural beauty, biodiversity, and wildlife. Our masterplan, which we hope to launch next year, utilises only 20 of the 627 square kilometers of the project's total land area. This is part of our efforts to promote environmental integrity and protect natural resources.As part of this commitment, we recently became the first real estate developer in the Gulf to join the Mountain Partnership. We have previously spoken about setting new benchmarks in sustainability and our membership of this alliance is a demonstration that we stick to our word.It is the first of many environmental and sustainability-focused partnerships we will join to promote sustainable mountain development, empower local communities, combat climate change, and encourage low-impact tourism.We aspire to the raise the bar for sustainable mountain tourism in the region and work with partners around the world to do so.Husameddin Almadani, CEO of Soudah DevelopmentFor all the latest business news from the UAE and Gulf countries, follow us on Twitter and Linkedin, like us on Facebook and subscribe to our YouTube page, which is updated daily. \l"

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE142","Steps towards decarbonisation","February 9, 2022","Gulf Industry Worldwide","(Image: source/31/02/images/Krohne-ADSW-DSC_2945.jpg)The fourth quarter of 2021 has tried to refocus the world on its own health. We are fortunate here in the UAE to have taken a progressive leadership role in handling the pandemic to the point where we now operate in one of the most normal environments I have experienced. Whilst safety and medical care procedures, free vaccination, testing and digital data availability via next-level applications like Al Hosn remain at the forefront of our minds, the UAE is shoulder to shoulder with the best in the world. Face to face conferences have been back for some time, video calls have become optional yet again and major events such as Expo2020 Dubai have been operating without fuss, showcasing to the world what normal looks like from here on in.Janssens: hoping for a sustainable futureCOP26, the UN climate change conference, was followed by Adipec the world's most influential meeting place for the oil and gas industry. With decarbonisation and energy transition very much on the industry agenda, where can we make genuine changes for the immediate future without negatively impacting business? This is the issue on every business leader's mind today. In fact I wondered if it was possible to apply learnings from an inclusive workplace discussion I had chance to catch at Adipec to improve the ESG arena. There are three key themes to consider:LEADERSHIP BEHAVIOURDo we as leaders genuinely care about sustainability? I am heavily invested in industrial processes and infrastructure which lend themselves very well to this kind of thinking. On the other hand, I am also a father and have a deep responsibility to advocate for positive change for the next generations to come. Our company motto is ""measure the facts"" and, in terms of sustainability, we play a role in helping our customers in precise measurement across their operations so they can optimise and make informed decisions around reducing, reusing and recycling resources. Part of our engineering and process advisory role is in understanding issues and recommending efficient solutions, through which we continue to play a small but growing part in the incremental changes underway.A company like Krohne is upping its efforts to hold our supply chain as accountable as we are in responsible environmental, sustainable and governance-related choices. Our most recent Sustainability Report points to our ongoing efforts in this area, as we are well aware of our role place in the sustainability chain to make a positive change.FOCUS ON LIVED EXPERIENCEBy bringing to life the small, subtle changes around the office and our global operations we can make a difference. While we are fortunate to be regionally headquartered in a forward-looking society such as the UAE, we need to bring greener ways of working to life around the office too. Can we use less water and electricity in our everyday operations? Local GCC companies such as Dewa, ADDC, SWCC, Neom, are strong educators in this space and provide excellent case studies and proof points.It is through alchemical public-private partnership that we can combine vision and investment with expertise in innovative measurement and process optimisations solutions. The end results are greater than the sum of their parts, offering exponential positive outcomes that will likely achieve far more than was originally intended. The important thing is to bring the vision to life and showcase the benefits.BE THE MOST SUSTAINABLEBeyond workplace behaviours, this final thought can be applied across every part of our lives - do you make greener choices where you can? Most buildings and communities in the UAE offer some level of recycling facility but do we make full use of this? Where we have buildings with huge windows and natural light streaming in, are we turning off our electric lights? What do we do with our plastic Pet bottles? The choices are there to be made and they can be increasingly complicated. The decision to purchase a fully electric car over a traditional combustion engine or hybrid vehicle opens a discussion around battery technology and product lifecycle overall, when perhaps not owning a vehicle at all is the ""greener"" option for your family and the topic rolls on.As a final reflective takeaway I would ask: Does our behaviour and our consequent choices reflect this pearl of wisdom?""It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities."" - Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, J.K. RowlingAt Krohne every day we try to make the right choices both in the context of our legacy and in our ongoing mission to equip our partners with the very best innovations in measurement technology to make the right decisions for a better tomorrow. \l"

This includes healthcare and medical tourism, which has grown into one of Dubai&rsquo;s top sectors, thanks to a rapidly growing urban population as well as a high influx of medical tourists who trust Dubai&rsquo;s high-tech facilities to receive treatment.Yet the rise in this sector poses a unique challenge: in carrying out its healing mission, the healthcare sector needs to factor in challenges that will become increasingly hard to ignore, including increased fatalities and injuries due to extreme weather events and a rise in chronic health conditions like asthma, infectious diseases, and mental illness.At the recent United Nations&rsquo; Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, 45 countries including the United Arab Emirates committed to transforming their health systems to be less carbon emitting and more environmentally sustainable. Recognizing the key role that they play as one of the UAE&rsquo;s leading healthcare groups, VPS Healthcare collaborated with the ASB to host this hackathon that would enable the organization to source fresh new thinking and innovative solutions to this enormous challenge.&ldquo;The partnership between VPS Healthcare and Asia School of Business represents our commitment towards addressing what experts are calling one of the greatest public health threats of our time,&rdquo; said Dr. Shamsheer Vayalil, Founder and Chairman of VPS Healthcare. &ldquo;We believe it will take collective effort globally to mitigate and address the climate risks we face today.The MBA students of the first-ever VPS Healthcare-ASB Climate Change Hackathon proposed a number of &lsquo;hacks&rsquo; that can help create resilient and sustainable solutions for the mission-driven health systems like VPS Healthcare, and impact the health of patients and communities they live in. The evaluation criteria for the winning &lsquo;hacks&rsquo; considered the applicability of the solutions and the novelty of the ideas. Solutions identified include AI-based predictive analytics combining patient data with meteorological data and other historical data to inform capacity planning, and a real-time carbon tracking dashboard using procurement and planning data to simulate the impact of a new project or policy.&ldquo;As an industry leader within a region that is rapidly ascending to global prominence, VPS Healthcare wants to be front and center in finding solutions for the challenges posed by climate change and believe that the solutions presented by the students will help us formulate climate change&ndash;driven procedures and integrate them into policies with a sense of urgency&rdquo; added Dr. Vayalil. &ldquo;At the same time, we also want to see how we can reduce our carbon footprint and implement environmentally conscious policies, as we want to do our part in leading the way towards a more sustainable manner of delivering outstanding healthcare.&rdquo;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re extremely grateful to be able to partner with a world-class company like VPS Healthcare to address such an important challenge while providing our students with a rich, international learning experience, especially during these volatile pandemic times. We look forward to continuing our partnership with VPS Healthcare in equipping them with the knowledge and intellectual resources to carry out their commendable mission of providing world-class healthcare in a sustainable manner,&rdquo; said Sean O.

With decarbonisation and energy transition very much on the industry agenda, where can we make genuine changes for the immediate future without negatively impacting business?This is the issue on every business leader's mind today. In fact, I wondered if it was possible to apply learnings from an inclusive workplace discussion and I had chance to catch at ADIPEC to improve the ESG arena. There are three key themes to consider:Leadership behaviourDo we as leaders genuinely care about sustainability? I am heavily invested in industrial processes and infrastructure which lend themselves very well to this kind of thinking.On the other hand, I am also a father and have a deep responsibility to advocate for positive change for the next generations to come. Our company mottos are ""measure the facts"" and, in terms of sustainability, we play a role in helping our customers in precise measurement across their operations so they can optimise and make informed decisions around reducing, reusing and recycling resources.Part of our engineering and process advisory role is in understanding issues and recommending efficient solutions, through which we continue to play a small but growing part in the incremental changes underway.

While we are fortunate to be regionally headquartered in a forward-looking society such as the UAE, we need to bring greener ways of working to life around the office too. Can we use less water and electricity in our everyday operations?Local GCC companies such as DEWA, ADDC, SWCC, NEOM, are strong educators in this space and provide excellent case studies and proofpoints. It is through alchemical public-private partnership that we can combine vision and investment with expertise in innovative measurement and process optimisations solutions.The end results are greater than the sum of their parts, offering exponential positive outcomes that will likely achieve far more than was originally intended. The important thing is to bring the vision to life and showcase the benefits.Be the most sustainable person you can beBeyond workplace behaviours, this final thought can be applied across every part of our lives \- do you make greener choices where you can? Most buildings and communities in the UAE offer some level of recycling facility but do we make full use of this?Where we have buildings with huge windows and natural light streaming in, are we turning off our electric lights? What do we do with our plastic PET bottles? The choices are there to be made and they can be increasingly complicated.The decision to purchase a fully electric car over a traditional combustion engine or hybrid vehicle opens a discussion around battery technology and product lifecycle overall, when perhaps not owning a vehicle at all is the ""greener"" option for your family and the topic rolls on.As a final reflective takeaway I would ask: Does our behaviour and our consequent choices reflect this pearl of wisdom?\l"

The gathering will bring together leaders from 110 countries who work in government, civil society, and the private sector, with the officially declared purpose of developing an agenda to renew democratic government and keep democracy's ideals strong. (The guest list includes Pakistan, Ukraine, and Brazil.) As authoritarianism grows around the world, including in the U.S., the administration says it seeks practical ideas and strong alliances against its spread.But how to square this high-sounding project when just a few months ago ""America is back"" was President Biden's mantra as he met with the Group of Seven in Cornwall, NATO allies in Brussels, and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva? Biden earned widespread praise for leading a return to normality after Donald Trump's reign of error. The question is, though, what is normality, and ""America is back"" for what? Biden's emphasis in the European meetings was bolstering NATO allies for a new global face-off with Russia-and increasingly China. Despite existential threats posed by catastrophic climate change (which Biden and other world leaders inadequately addressed at COP26) and an ongoing global pandemic, Biden's new normal seems ominously leaning to a revival of Cold War politics.""We are committed to the rules-based international order,"" concludes the final communiqu from the June NATO meetings, but ""Russia's aggressive actions constitute a threat to Euro-Atlantic security China's growing influence and international policies can present challenges that we need to address together as an alliance.""

The country is the world's eighth largest emitter of CO2, yet it is one of the few countries not to ratify the Paris pact. Neighbour Turkey became the last G20 country to ratify the agreement in October. The official, Ali Salajegheh, reportedly said that sanctions were impeding Iran in areas like renewable energy. The Iranians have seen an collapse in overseas investment in their renewable energy sector in the face of US sanctions. Iran's president Ebrahim Raisi decided not to attend the ongoing UN climate change summit, COP26, in Glasgow, but the country sent a team to plead for relief from the economic blockade caused by Washington's sanctions. ""Iran has been impacted by climate change like every other place in the world,"" Salajegheh was quoted as saying. ""This has reduced our rainfall per annum and also the inflow of water into our rivers has reduced by 40% [and] this has affected our agriculture and affected our industrial and drinking water."" On the issue of the Paris climate agreement, Salajegheh was cited as saying the pact had to be a ""two-way street."" ""When you have oppressive sanctions in force it does not allow for any kind of imports even medicine which is a human fundamental right,"" he said. ""If the sanctions are removed, then we have a commitment towards the international community, it is at that time that they can transfer modern technology and finance to us especially in the area of renewable energy so we can modernise our deteriorating infrastructure,"" he told BBC News.

The reality of the vaccines' roll-out is that wealthier nations have produced and acquired far more doses of vaccines than poorer ones.

These efforts can stimulate green investments and create millions of good jobs. By sharing the sun's energy, we can help to build a more peaceful and prosperous world.&rdquo;The project will be implemented by ISA, in partnership with the World Bank Group, and aims to harness solar energy wherever the sun is shining, ensuring that generated electricity flows to areas that need it most.In doing so, the project aims to reduce reliance on non-renewable energy such as coal by enabling them to purchase affordable solar power from other countries.As the chief agency leading and delivering the project, ISA aims to help mobilise $1 trillion of funding by 2030 to assist developing countries in expanding their solar power grids to meet their energy access, energy security and energy transition needs.The initiative is widely seen as a big and bold move ahead on the ISA's solar transition roadmap and will go some way towards realising its vision for a solar energy future.Speaking at the event, the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi said: &ldquo;One Sun, One World & One Grid will not only reduce storage needs but also enhance the viability of solar projects. This creative initiative will not only reduce carbon footprints and energy cost but also open a new avenue for cooperation between different countries and regions.&ldquo;The One Sun One World One Grid and Green Grids Initiative is an idea whose time has come.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE166","Weekly Comic: Hard Decisions on Energy, Climate Change","October 19, 2021 Tuesday","Forexpros","Investing.com - By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com --\~The world has under-invested in fossil fuels because of an obsession with Climate Change.The resulting shortage of supply and the vicious squeeze in global energy prices only shows that the price of Climate Change mitigation is unacceptably high.For any further proof, witness the orgy of self-righteousness and self-congratulation that is about to explode at the climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, an event that seems doomed already to failure, for all that the politicians there will claim otherwise.Exasperation turns easily to despair when fuel bills are rocketing (everywhere), when gas stations are empty (as in the U.K.), \~when the power system responsible for keeping the lights on for 1.4 billion people is down to four days' worth of fuel supplies (as in India), and when the only country that can solve your short-term energy crisis is a repressive kleptocracy that you would prefer to keep as far away from you as possible (as in most of Europe).But despair is not inevitable and the current energy crisis \- while it may be repeated \- will not be lasting.The current squeeze \- which has introduced the global investing public to the Dutch TTF benchmark gas contract and Chinese coal futures \- is a passing phenomenon. Much of it is due to the pandemic, which depressed coal output from South Africa to China and which delayed necessary maintenance of Russia's gas installations last year. But the pandemic is fading, and so will these pressures.Looking ahead, one can also be more confident that high prices will, as usual, be the cure for high prices, and that future regulations will be drafted to provide better incentives for backup power and more redundancy in infrastructure - especially in storage, the only solution to the problem of renewables' intermittency.Most importantly, the two countries that will drive Climate Change more than any other in the coming years \- China and India \- know that they cannot afford further unbridled growth in fossil fuel consumption.For many years, the effective constraint on Chinese policy was pollution, and the public health emergencies created by smog from its coal-fired power stations. However, catastrophic flooding across various parts of the country this year has made it clear that extreme weather events are increasingly a threat to economic - and ultimately social - stability. UBS analysts point out that while 40% of the $210 billion in global climate-related losses last year were insured globally, only 2% were in China.""When we protect nature, it rewards us,"" President Xi Jinping said in a speech earlier this month, with a nod to those floods. ""When we exploit nature ruthlessly, it punishes us without mercy."" To be sure, such platitudes won't stop either China or India burning more coal in the short term. And Beijing's action this week to approve new coal mine projects in Inner Mongolia flatly contradicts President Xi Jinping's stated ambition to reach peak zero carbon emissions by 2030, raising suspicions that Beijing will yet again back off any action that threatens short-term growth.But China's latest renewables projects \- it is already building a solar farm in its western desert that will generate three times as much power as the Three Gorges Dam \- are clearly much more than just tokenism: it already has more installed renewable capacity than Japan and Germany combined. The country is heavily invested in cleaning up and greening up.The world's progress toward a more resilient, greener global energy system can't help but be chaotic, uneven and hampered at by economic competition between nations. But it is still nonetheless progress, and neither COP26, nor short-term market squeezes are likely to stop it.Investing.com offers an extensive set of professional tools for the financial markets.Read more News on Investing.com and download the new Investing.com apps for Android and iOS!\l"

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE168","A 'New World' of Workforce Data Will Drive Sustainability","January 28, 2022","Communicate","By Michael Cupps, Senior VP, Marketing at ActiveopsThe term ""net-zero"" has been on the lips of climate experts, politicians, and sustainability advocates for a while now. As a result, the need to achieve this goal inevitably occupied most of the agenda at COP26. The issues discussed during the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference had far-reaching implications, all of which have been carried into 2022. Now, as the topic continues to garner attention within the public domain, the actions needed to mitigate climate change are the utmost priority for world leaders.The scrutiny they are under has inevitably trickled down onto organizations. Now business leaders are in the spotlight and are being forced to act on it if they are to survive.Pressures to mitigate climate change intensifySocial media has made it easier for people to direct their worries. This has intensified the need for companies to focus on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Therefore, organizations that aren't are environmentally responsible, are often criticized for it.In addition, this pressure towards responsible and sustainable operations will only grow. Thereby it's imperative that all organizations, from start-ups to global brand icons, recognize that running sustainable operations is the key to unlocking a positive brand reputation in the future.Data can be the light at the end of a dark tunnelWith the Omicron variant spreading rapidly, the effects were felt globally. Organizations will need to adjust their plans to keep employees safe and comply with the law. The need for people to work from home makes hybrid working more prevalent and complicated as it demands better orchestration.While data requirements might seem burdensome at first, they can be a source of optimization. Workforce data could become the key to successfully navigate through these challenging times.Organizations today need to record real insights and implement operational changes that will promote cultural and performance consistency in this hybrid world. Many leaders will also recognize that capturing real-time data at aggregate and individual levels can allow organizations to uncover prominent trends that can drive overall business efficiency. In a global business environment that is both highly competitive and relentlessly volatile, access to real-time performance data \- or a lack of access to that essential data \- will make or break businesses.It is also crucial for organizations to measure the consequences when they can't gather data that is required to schedule workforce levels across departments. Shortage of resources, limited capacity, and backlogs affect the customer experience on the outside and decrease employee morale on the inside.Similarly, compromised coordination with employees can affect their work efficiency and subsequent engagement, leading to lower productivity even when organizations have a higher staff turnover rate.Businesses appreciate the value of having a data-backed structured approach to managing operations.The application of this hybrid work data is essential for three reasons:Managers can be aware of real-time work location, the team's productivity, and availability, meaning workload can be distributed where and when required.Location-based performance data expands planning opportunities for managers to identify areas where office capacity can be modified, meaning carbon footprint targets are more achievable.Sustainability teams now have access to historical data regarding the commuting impact of their employees, meaning businesses can reduce ineffectual travel, and increase work output opportunities.Technology's role in driving sustainable operationsIt is now possible to have a Workforce Optimization Solution (WFO) to provide sustainability managers with real-time data with respect to the location of where their employees are working and how they're performing. This will allow businesses to gather data efficiently and affordably without an extensive implementation of the whole process and help them meet their sustainability goals.Many balances need to be struck and trade-offs need to be made in the quest to minimize carbon emissions, but the goal can be fulfilled if businesses recognize what is required and act upon it promptly.A 'new era' of sustainable workingMost firms are working on reducing their carbon footprint to become more sustainable. If your business is using data to support a hybrid workforce, then you should notice a reduction in these emissions on multiple fronts. You may notice reduced emissions as fewer employees commute and those who commute less. You may see a reduced need for office lighting and heating \- not to mention a reduction in office waste \- as footfall in the office decreases.The workforce data you gather to enable all this will help demonstrate a contribution to your businesses' emission reduction program \- or could even form the basis of starting one if you have not already.Due to the ongoing effects of the pandemic, many sectors of the world's economy have accelerated their digital transformation attempts. If business leaders play their cards right, they will be able to maintain satisfactory productivity levels through uncertainty. The drive to optimize organizational efficiency and productivity should no longer center solely around performance and profit but equally, revolve around sustainability.\l"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE169","Uniting for the Greater Good","February 28, 2022 Monday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","The UAE and Israel are innovation allies in the battle against climate changeThis past summer, the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued its starkest ever warning in its comprehensive assessment of the state of our planet. The report, conducted over eight years of research by hundreds of the world's leading climate scientists, painted a grim picture for humanity.It said that if nations are unable to work together to cap greenhouse gas emissions and limit global temperature increases, the resulting widespread devastation and extreme weather will put billions of people at immediate risk.UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres did not mince words in his statement upon the report's release: ""[This] is a code red for humanity. The alarm bells are deafening, and the evidence is irrefutable.""The UAE's confirmation as the host of the UN's COP28 Climate Change Summit in 2023 is a testament to the country's deep commitment and dedication to leading the global battle against the greatest challenge of our times. In that battle, it will find no greater ally than Israel. Though relatively small in territory, both Middle Eastern countries can have an outsized impact on the chances of success due to their shared specialisation in technology - the weapon that will likely be the biggest key to overcoming global warming, barring radical changes in behaviour by people and corporations.Innovation needed to shift the needleReaching net-zero emission targets demands cooperation on a global level. It will also require the development and scaling of new technology that will enable us to maintain and advance both our economies and our everyday lives in the face of the threats. It requires virtually every industry vertical to change its ways - from the way we generate and consume electricity, manufacture products, grow food, and get around, to the way we build, heat, and cool our houses. For that reason, there is an enormous opportunity in the hands of innovators.Speaking at COP26Since then, in November, the UAE was successful in bringing Israel and Jordan together to sign the landmark Declaration of Intent - the biggest ever regional collaboration agreement to combat climate change. The plan calls for solar photovoltaic plants to be built in Jordan, with all clean power produced to be exported to Israel, and a sustainable water desalination programme to be built in Israel to supply Jordan with water for household and agricultural needs. The UAE backed initiative proves the country is just as committed to environmental benefit as it is to regional peace.Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE's Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation said: ""We demonstrate with this declaration that all nations can work together to further the energy transition and build a more sustainable future for all.""Environmental PartnershipsWith both Emirati and Israeli firms boasting strong records in sustainable development technologies, the relations between the countries are already proving to be a force multiplier in the battle to tackle this unprecedented challenge for humanity.Other agreements between the countries include a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), signed between the UAE's Ministry for Food and Water Security and Israel's Agriculture Ministry to promote cooperation in areas of food production and food supply chains, as well as research and innovation. Yet another MoU was signed with Israel's Environmental Protection Ministry aimed at funding joint research efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change and to ensure biodiversity and ecosystem conservation.These partnerships have expanded beyond governments to the private sector. Soon after the signing of the accords, UAE's Masdar and Israel's EDF Renewables announced an agreement to explore renewable energy opportunities and support the countries' clean energy objectives. Another agreement was signed to launch a joint Israeli-Emirati water research programme as part of a collaboration between the Israeli Watergen company and Baynunah, a sister company of UAE's Al Dahra Group, which specialises in food security.Emirati leaders have long been at the forefront of the movement to address the climate crisis and have been ahead in the rolling out of major investments in renewables and clean technologies. The UAE is home to two of the world's largest solar plants and is soon to break ground on a third. Abu Dhabi has the Middle East's first facility for carbon capture and storage, and Masdar City has received international recognition as a pioneer in sustainable living and is on its way to becoming a global hub for clean technology.Dr Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, the UAE's Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and Special Envoy for Climate Change, delivered an open invitation from the UAE to the world for partnerships to find sustainable solutions that will tackle climate change and create sustainable economic growth with a positive social impact. Israel is uniquely positioned to answer that call.Sourcing Climate Tech in IsraelOver the last 30 years, Israeli companies have been at the forefront of innovation technology, developing thousands of products and services in a wide range of sectors. Every year, these companies attract billions of dollars in investments and generate billions more in technological exports. Scores more of them are acquired to add value to market leaders in industries as diverse as fintech, smart mobility, cybersecurity, agrifoodtech, and digital health.The country is now putting a concerted effort into also becoming the primary global hub for climate change-battling innovation.In 2021, climatetech companies made up 10 per cent of the $26 billion in capital raised by the Israeli tech ecosystem and there is every reason to think that the sector will rise in significance as time progresses. But it's not only investors who have identified the potential. Large multinational corporations are also taking notice and collaborating with local companies that can provide them with the solutions they need to meet their sustainability goals in a wide range of climatetech areas: Nestl\'e9 working with Future Meat to bring cell-based meat to your table; UBER partnering with Tomorrow.IO to integrate real-time weather monitoring into drivers' paths; ASOS working with Kornit Digital to reduce the environmental impact of the fashion industry; Hitachi partnering with REE to scale-up electric transportation manufacturing; and many other examples.What are we doing?At Start-Up Nation Central, an NGO which supports and promotes Israel's tech ecosystem, we have long championed the potential of technology and innovation to address the global climate crisis. We are investing significant resources to highlight the role of groundbreaking technological solutions to meet the region's climate goals, connecting like-minded companies, investors, and innovators across the Middle East and beyond. We are identifying and mapping the Israeli tech startups that are developing solutions to help meet the net-zero emissions targets. Our preliminary mapping has identified approximately 600 Israeli startups already developing solutions for addressing climate challenges.To channel Israel's renowned entrepreneurial and innovative spirit into action, we are calling global players to join us for the Climate Solutions Prize, an unparalleled contest to incentivise climate-tech innovation, with annual prizes exceeding $2 million for Israeli researchers and startups. We are launching the Climate Solutions Prize in partnership with the Jewish National Fund of Canada and Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael Jewish National Fund (KKL-JNF), along with the special support of the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation, on January 25 at an in-person event with the participation of Isaac Herzog, the President of the State of Israel. The contest will run for nine months, until the winners are announced in October 2022 during the Climate Solutions Festival which will be the apex event of a major global climate-tech expo and conference.As we work to bring people together to achieve a shared vision for a zero-emission world, we believe the climate partnership between Israel and the UAE will be at the forefront of the movement to build a more sustainable planet. We urge innovators in both countries to make the connections so that we will reach COP28 with results and prove that innovation and cooperation are the keys to reaching sustainability.Yael Weisz Zilberman is the Partnerships Manager for Sustainability and Climate Tech at Start-Up Nation Central, A non-profit organisation that connects governments, corporations, and investors to the Israeli innovation ecosystem\l"

The Democrats' spending plans are moving closer to being realized, while Elon Musk grinds his teeth in chagrin. Japan's third-quarter GDP data disappoint, while China's October numbers were better than expected. Stocks are set to edge higher but there's no major data due, and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) is becoming just 'Shell' as life after the pandemic forces it to ditch a century of tradition. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, 15th November.1. When Joe (virtually) met XiU.S. President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping will talk later in what officials have briefed is likely to be their most substantial virtual meeting yet.The meeting comes only days after both leaders achieved some important domestic policy goals, Biden securing agreement for his infrastructure spending package and Xi winning what amounts to a mandate to rule for life from the Communist Party's top brass.The two are expected to discuss issues including trade, where China still lags its commitments under the deal it made with President Donald Trump, and Taiwan, which has been subjected to increasingly frequent and aggressive military patrolling by Chinese mainland aviation in recent months.One data point providing a favorable backdrop is that the yuan is trading close to its highest in three years against the U.S. dollar, despite a sharp slowdown in Chinese growth in the third quarter.2. Democrats push to pass spending bill this weekHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi is lining up a vote on the Democrats' $2 billion spending package on education, healthcare and the energy transition as early as this week, having secured enough votes for it to break the current deadlock, according to various reports.\~The smaller infrastructure spending bill is set to become law later Monday.Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk again tried to deflect blame for his substantial sales of Tesla stock on to the party at the weekend, after selling a further block of stock on Friday to meet a tax liability that is due under legislation passed by the previous Congress.Progressives have started to drop their opposition to the way the spending bill has been pruned, having been chastened by some poor performances in mayoral and gubernatorial elections two weeks ago. The likelihood of Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell - a bogeyman for the left of the party - being sacrificed as a pawn in this game of 3D chess appear to have risen, with more than one report over the weekend talking up the possibility of Biden nominating Lael Brainard to succeed him.3.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE173","Shaping conversations","February 27, 2022","Gulf Business","Former British servicemen, David Wiseman and Nathan Jones, have co-founded Peak State to destigmatise the subject of mental health and change the traditional messaging around itNathan, in 2014, a routine flight you were flying resulted in a horrific incident. What happened that day? JONES: I was flying a Voyager aircraft, an Airbus A330, from the RAF Brize Norton station to Helmand Province in Afghanistan. We were in cruise mode, flying at 33,000 feet when I decided to exit the cockpit and take a break. While I was having a cup of tea, the next thing I knew was that I was pinned to the roof. I realised we were plummeting into the sea. I had to crawl on the roof, pull myself down to my seat, and then activate a button that gave me priority on my controls [to take over the aircraft]. What happened is that the captain &ndash; I was the co-pilot at the time &ndash; was taking photos of the stars with an SLR camera and got his camera jammed at the controls. So, he moved his seat forward and it knocked the autopilot out, jamming the stick all the way forward. He was there thinking the autopilot was stuck, but instead, it was the camera jamming the controls. I was severely injured from ramming into the roof. I split the back of my head open and broke my back. From 2014, I was full-time in the defence medical rehab centre, recovering from both physical and mental injuries. David, you still have a bullet in your chest from an incident in Afghanistan. Tell us about that. WISEMAN: I was an officer in the British Army in the infantry unit. It was my second tour in Afghanistan. I previously served in Baghdad. I was embedded with the Afghan National Army, with a small specialised team of nine British soldiers with me. I was in Helmand Province in 2009, and it was a terrible year for us. Over two weeks, at the back end of October and November, we dealt with 25 different casualties. On November 15th, 2009, I became the 26th casualty. We had fought the Taliban off an area and had to push them back a little bit further that day. As we crossed into the next tactical bound, we were engaged by a position, where I didn't have cover. Essentially, an enemy sniper got us in the end. One round zipped past my head and it sounded like someone had cracked a whip, and soon after, I heard the sound of the weapon firing. That one went past my head. I didn't react quickly enough because the second one slammed into my chest. The bullet hit just below my clavicle, travelled down the length of my torso, nicking my axial artery on the way, smashing through my brachial plexus and then shredding through my lung. It shattered my ribs and came to rest in my right lung where it still sits today. My chest was filling with blood and [my team] kept me alive for long enough until an American chopper landed to take me away. In fact, I stopped breathing three times, waiting on the ground. I was moved to the back of the chopper; as they strapped me down, I stopped breathing again. That's when [the paramedic] took out a blade and cut into my chest without an anaesthetic and [inserted a tube]. All that blood seeped out onto the floor of the helicopter, and I could finally breathe again. I spent a week in intensive care in Birmingham. I left the Army in 2013 after several years in and out of the fantastic Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre at Headley CourtThe two of you also co-founded Peak State. How did that happen and what are some of its objectives? WISEMAN: After I left the army, I went to work for Prince Harry and Prince William at The Royal Foundation. I was advising them on their philanthropic involvement with supporting those who serve. There were lots of different programmes over the years, and mental health was interwoven in a lot of those programmes. But the message with mental health has always been from a negative angle. It's always been discussing depression, anxiety or trauma &ndash; and that really isn't the whole story. There's the other spectrum about it, promoting the management of good mental health. And Peak State essentially focuses on that thinking. Peak State is a collection of tools and techniques that we've taken from across the world of sports psychology to influence and help people adopt a proactive approach to the better management of mental health. JONES: I went to university to do sports science, and sports psychology was a big part of it. When you say that your mind is the most important muscle in your body, it couldn't be more relevant now with what we're doing with Peak State. The issue with all these learnings are that the marginal gains of sports psychology are only being afforded to professional and elite athletes. It's not really being spoken about among the general public and those who arguably need it the most. What we're trying to do is destigmatise the conversation around mental health. We're giving people the option to do so through a library of tools and techniques, and we understand that it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. We've packaged something, knowing that everyone stays on this spectrum of mental health &ndash; whether they're an elite sportsperson, biohacker, or if even if they've never focused on it before &ndash; and we help them with tools such as breathwork to activate their parasympathetic nervous system, sleep nutrition and nutrition. We help them develop their knowledge to use these daily to become higher-performing individuals. By doing so, they're putting on different bits of armour. So, if something does arise, and they get stressed or anxious, they have these tools in their arsenal as coping mechanisms. Why send a soldier into battle without the armour just because you know that there's going to be someone with a plaster at the other end to fix that wound?You were at the Expo 2020 recently. What are some of the discussions you've had here in the UAE on the subject of mental health? JONES: We had a fantastic lecture at the Dubai Exhibition Center at RewirEd. I think people [here] are open to this idea of mental fitness. I think what we're offering with Peak State is exciting and isn't just for elite athletes. It isn't just for executive coaching. It is for everybody. We've got programmes running in Australia, the US, and are about to launch in Greece. We would love to do something in this region. JONES: The reason why we're here is that we created this bespoke content for different communities. It's pointless for someone here in the UAE, for example, to watch a video that was created for Australian.communities. So, we create content that is bespoke for a community, region, or nationality. One of the areas that we're now working on is youth empowerment. We've spoken at COP26 and a string of conferences on this subject. What can we expect from you in 2022? WISEMAN: If we could get our tools and techniques into the schools in this region, we're going to have some extraordinary young people becoming adults. There's this climate of anxiety. The youth are our future leaders, so you need to get this in place now &ndash; otherwise, you're just putting bandages in the future. In 2022, what we would like to do in this region is for Peak State tools to be inserted into the UK personal, social, health and economic school curriculum, supported by our app, which is coming out this year. When you have brands such as Bremont backing initiatives like Peak State, how does that help further your cause? WISEMAN: You know, people might think that Bremont makes luxury watches, so what's that got to do with [Peak State]? Well, it is about values and a crossover of those values. We see that their adventurous, forward-thinking and progressive spirit is exactly what's needed, and that's the kind of crossover we're looking at with Peak State. Bremont's tagl"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE174","Russian invasion of Ukraine sparking more outrage than any other war","March 3, 2022 Thursday","Big News Network.com","Surprise and horror have defined the reaction to the Russian military intervention in Ukraine. That's likely because although the intervention has followed the contours of a modern land war, it has also marked a break with the past in a number of ways. The world has become used to military interventions by the United States. This is, however, not a U.S. intervention. That in itself is a surprise - one that has befuddled reporters and pundits alike.Even as we deplore the violence and the loss of life in Ukraine resulting from the Russian intervention (and the neofascist violence in the Donbas), it is valuable to step back and look at how the rest of the world may perceive this conflict, starting with the West's ethnocentric interest in an attack whose participants and victims they believe they share aspects of identity with - whether related to culture, religion, or skin color.White WarsWar in Ukraine joins a sequence of wars that have opened sores on a very fragile planet. Wars in Africa and Asia seem endless, and some of them are rarely commented upon with any feeling in media outlets across the world or in the cascade of posts found on social media platforms. For example, the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which started in 1996 and which has resulted in millions of casualties, has not elicited the kind of sympathy from the world now seen during the reporting on Ukraine. In contrast, the startlingly frank comments from political leaders and journalists during the conflict in Ukraine have revealed the grip of racism on the imaginations of these shapers of public opinion.It was impossible recently to get major global media outlets interested in the conflict in Cabo Delgado, which grew out of the capture of the bounty of natural gas by TotalEnergies SE (France) and ExxonMobil (U.S.) and led to the deployment of the French-backed Rwandan military in Mozambique. At COP26, I told a group of oil company executives about this intervention - which I had covered for Globetrotter - and one of them responded with precise accuracy: ""You're right about what you say, but no one cares.""No one, which is to say the political forces in the North Atlantic states, cares about the suffering of children in Africa and Asia. They are, however, gripped by the war in Ukraine, which should grip them, which distresses all of us, but which should not be allowed to be seen as worse than other conflicts taking place across the globe that are much more brutal and are likely to slip out of everyone's memory due to the lack of interest and attention given by world leaders and media outlets to them.Charlie D'Agata of CBS News said that Ukraine ""isn't a place, with all due respect, like Iraq or Afghanistan, that has seen conflict raging for decades. This is a relatively civilized, relatively European - I have to choose those words carefully, too-city, where you wouldn't expect that, or hope that [a conflict] is going to happen."" Clearly, these are the things one expects to see in Kabul (Afghanistan) or Baghdad (Iraq) or Goma (the Democratic Republic of the Congo), but not in a ""relatively civilized, relatively European"" city in Ukraine. If these are things that one expects in the former cities respectively, then there is very little need to be particularly outraged by the violence that is witnessed in these cities.You would not expect such violence in Ukraine, said the country's Deputy Chief Prosecutor David Sakvarelidze to the BBC, because of the kind of people who were caught in the crossfire: ""European people with blue eyes and blond hair being killed every day."" Sakvarelidze considers the Ukrainians to be Europeans, although D'Agata calls them ""relatively European."" But they are certainly not African or Asian, people whom - if you think carefully about what is being said here - certain world leaders and international media outlets expect to be killed by the violence unleashed against them by the global great powers and by the weapons sold to the local thugs in these regions by these great powers.Worst War?On February 23, 2022, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres - in a heartfelt statement about the Russian military intervention in Ukraine -said, ""In the name of humanity do not allow to start in Europe what could be the worst war since the beginning of the century."" The next day, on February 24, with Russia launching ""the biggest attack on a European state since World War II,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen condemned this ""barbaric attack"" and said that ""it is President Putin who is bringing war back to Europe."" ""Bringing war back to Europe"": this is instructive language from Von der Leyen. It reminded me of Aim Csaire's Discourse on Colonialism (1950), where the great poet and communist bemoaned Europe's ability to forget the terrible fascistic treatment of the peoples of Africa and Asia by the colonial powers when they spoke of fascism. Fascism, Csaire wrote, is the colonial experiment brought back to Europe.When the United States invaded Iraq in 2003, neither the United Nations secretary-general nor the president of the European Commission came forward to make any immediate condemnation of that war. Both international institutions went along with the war, allowing the destruction of Iraq, which resulted in the death of more than a million people. In 2004, a year into the U.S. war on Iraq, after reports of grave violations of human rights (including by Amnesty International on torture in the prison of Abu Ghraib) came to light, then UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan called the war ""illegal."" In 2006, three years after the war had begun, Italy's Prime Minister Romano Prodi, who had been the president of the European Commission in 2003, called the war a ""grave error.""In the case of the Russian intervention, these institutions rushed to condemn the war, which is all very well but does this mean that they will be just as quick to condemn the United States when it starts its next bombing campaign?War StenographyPeople often ask me, what's the most reliable news outlet? This is a hard question to answer these days, as Western news outlets are increasingly becoming stenographers of their governments (with the racist attitudes of the reporters on full display more and more often, making the apologies that come later hardly comforting). State-sponsored outlets in Russia and China now increasingly find themselves banned on social media sites. Anyone who counters Washington's narrative is dismissed as irrelevant, and these fringe voices find it hard to develop an audience.So-called cancel culture demonstrates its limits. D'Agata has apologized for his comment about Ukraine being ""relatively civilized, relatively European"" compared to Iraq and Afghanistan and has already been rehabilitated because he is on the ""right side"" of the conflict in Ukraine. Cancel culture has moved from the chatter of social media to the battlefields of geopolitics and diplomacy as far as the Russian-Ukraine conflict is concerned. Switzerland has decided to end a century of formal neutrality to cancel Russia by enforcing European sanctions against it (remember that Switzerland remained ""neutral"" as the Nazis tore through Europe during World War II, and operated as the Nazi bankers even after the war). Meanwhile, press freedom has been set aside during the current conflict in Eastern Europe, with Australia and Europe suspending the broadcast of RT, which is a Russian state-controlled international media network.D'Agata's reliability as a reporter will remain unquestioned. He ""misspoke,"" they might say, but this is a Freudian slip.Calculations of WarWars are ugly, especially wars of aggression. The role of the reporter is to explain why a country goes to war, particularly an unprovoked war. If this were 1941, I might try to explain the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor during World War II or the Japanese assumption that the Nazis would soon defeat the Soviets and then take the war across the Atlantic Ocean. But the Soviets held out, saving the world from fascism. In the same way, the Russian attack on Ukraine requires explanation: the roots of it go deep to various political and foreign policy developments, such as the post-Soviet emergence of ethnic nationalism along the spine of Eastern Europe, the eastward advance of U.S. power-through NATO-toward the Russian border, and the turbulent relationship between the major European states and their eastern neighbors (including Russia). To explain this conflict is not to justify it, for there is little to justify in the bombing of a sovereign people.Sane voices exist on all sides of ugly conflicts. In Russia, State Duma Deputy Mikhail Matveev of the Communist Party said. soon after the Russian entry into Ukraine, that he voted for the recognition of the breakaway provinces of Ukraine, he ""voted for peace, not for war,"" and he voted ""for Russia to become a shield, so that Donbas is not bombed, and not for Kyiv being bombed.""Matveev's voice confounds the current narrative: it brings into motion the plight of the Donbas since the U.S.-driven coup in Ukraine in 2014, and it sounds the alarm against the full scale of the Russian intervention.This article was produced by Globetrotter.

World leaders to send on Rome for a G 20 summit, but remain far apart on forging a consensus on climate policy ahead of next week's COP26 meetings. They're closer together on the issue of global tax. Eurozone bond yields hit the highest in over a year on fears that the ECB will dial down stimulus. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) confirmed it will rebrand as Meta, and Big Oil dominates the days earnings roster. Here is what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, October 30.1. Apple, Amazon DisappointApple and Amazon both disappointed with their quarterly earnings after the closing bell on Thursday, sending both stocks lower in premarket trading.Apple's sales were hit by supply chain problems, and CEO Tim Cook warned that the coming holiday quarter may be even worse in this regard. \~The issue had been flagged previously in unconfirmed reports.Amazon's problems were concentrated in higher input costs, notably for labor, which hurt profit margins at the core e-commerce business.Amazon Web Services, by contrast, continued to churn out money at a decent rate. Even so, earnings per share where some 25% below analysts' forecasts, in a rare and marked disappointment one of the market's heavyweights.2. PCE Prices, Personal Income and SpendingThe last inflation- related economic data before the Federal Reserve's next policy meeting are due at 8:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), how long with figures for personal income and personal spending in September.Core prices for personal consumer expenditures are expected to have risen by 0.2% in September down from 0.3% in August and a peak of 0.7 in April. The annual rate of core PCE inflation is expected to have fallen risen to 3.7% from 3.6% a month ago.The PCE Price index is the feds preferred measure of inflation. The numbers come a day after further signs of labor market strength, as initial jobless claims fell to a new post pandemic low of 281,000.3. Stocks likely to open lower as Big Tech drags; Oil majors eyedUS stock markets are expected to set to open lower later, amid disappointment at the earnings from Apple and Amazon (and also Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), whose revenue also fell short of expectations).

G20 to sign off on tax dealWorld leaders converge on Rome, Italy, for an annual summit of the G 20 group of industrial and emerging nations. At least, some of them do \- Chinese president Xi Jinping is not attending.That alone should ensure that nothing of great substance is achieved politically, especially as regards forming a consensus on climate change ahead of the COP26 meeting next week, although the group will likely sign off on a global deal to ensure a minimum corporate tax rate of 15%.That new minimum rate is a key plank of U.S. Democrats plans to raise taxes on corporations to pay for what is now a heavily pruned spending bill. President Joe Biden said on Thursday he had agreed a framework for the bill which leaves its overall price add around $1.85 trillion, having shed much of the party's list of election promises.5. Eurozone bonds get the jittersEurozone government bond markets got the jitters, on perceptions that European Central bank president Christine Lagarde, in her press conference on Thursday, had pushed back only half-heartedly against suggestions that interest rates may have to rise next year.The 10-Year Italian government bond yield rose 16 basis points to 1.15%, hitting a new 14 month high. Benchmark Greek bonds followed suit, Highlighting the degree to which markets have been supported by extraordinary levels of ECB support for the last 18 months.Sentiment wasn't helped by a sharp overshoot in Eurozone consumer prices in October: preliminary data showed inflation running at 4.1% on the year, up from 3.4% in September and above the 3.7% expected.Investing.com offers an extensive set of professional tools for the financial markets.Read more News on Investing.com and download the new Investing.com apps for Android and iOS!\l"

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE178","Biden doubling down on Trump's ""destabilizing"" foreign policies","January 20, 2022 Thursday","Big News Network.com","President Biden and the Democrats were highly critical of President Trump's foreign policy, so it was reasonable to expect that Biden would quickly remedy its worst impacts. As a senior member of the Obama administration, Biden surely needed no schooling on Obama's diplomatic agreements with Cuba and Iran, both of which began to resolve long-standing foreign policy problems and provided models for the renewed emphasis on diplomacy that Biden was promising.Tragically for America and the world, Biden has failed to restore Obama's progressive initiatives and has instead doubled down on many of Trump's most dangerous and destabilizing policies. It is especially ironic and sad that a president who ran so stridently on being different from Trump has been so reluctant to reverse his regressive policies. Now the Democrats' failure to deliver on their promises with respect to both domestic and foreign policy is undermining their prospects in November's midterm election.Here is our assessment of Biden's handling of ten critical foreign policy issues:1. Prolonging the agony of the people of Afghanistan. It is perhaps symptomatic of Biden's foreign policy problems that the signal achievement of his first year in office was an initiative launched by Trump, to withdraw the United States from its 20-year war in Afghanistan. But Biden's implementation of this policy was tainted by the same failure to understand Afghanistan that doomed and dogged at least three prior administrations and the U.S.'s hostile military occupation for 20 years, leading to the speedy restoration of the Taliban government and the televised chaos of the U.S. withdrawal.Now, instead of helping the Afghan people recover from two decades of U.S.-inflicted destruction, Biden has seized $9.4 billion in Afghan foreign currency reserves, while the people of Afghanistan suffer through a desperate humanitarian crisis. It is hard to imagine how even Donald Trump could be more cruel or vindictive.2. Provoking a crisis with Russia over Ukraine. Biden's first year in office is ending with a dangerous escalation of tensions at the Russia/Ukraine border, a situation that threatens to devolve into a military conflict between the world's two most heavily armed nuclear statesthe United States and Russia. The United States bears much responsibility for this crisis by supporting the violent overthrow of the elected government of Ukraine in 2014, backing NATO expansion right up to Russia's border, and arming and training Ukrainian forces.Biden's failure to acknowledge Russia's legitimate security concerns has led to the present impasse, and Cold Warriors within his administration are threatening Russia instead of proposing concrete measures to de-escalate the situation.3. Escalating Cold War tensions and a dangerous arms race with China. President Trump launched a tariff war with China that economically damaged both countries, and reignited a dangerous Cold War and arms race with China and Russia to justify an ever-increasing U.S. military budget.After a decade of unprecedented U.S. military spending and aggressive military expansion under Bush II and Obama, the U.S. ""pivot to Asia"" militarily encircled China, forcing it to invest in more robust defense forces and advanced weapons. Trump, in turn, used China's strengthened defenses as a pretext for further increases in U.S. military spending, launching a new arms race that has raised the existential risk of nuclear war to a new level.Biden has only exacerbated these dangerous international tensions. Alongside the risk of war, his aggressive policies toward China have led to an ominous rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans, and created obstacles to much-needed cooperation with China to address climate change, the pandemic and other global problems.4. Abandoning Obama's nuclear agreement with Iran. After President Obama's sanctions against Iran utterly failed to force it to halt its civilian nuclear program, he finally took a progressive, diplomatic approach, which led to the JCPOA nuclear agreement in 2015. Iran scrupulously met all its obligations under the treaty, but Trump withdrew the United States from the JCPOA in 2018. Trump's withdrawal was vigorously condemned by Democrats, including candidate Biden, and Senator Sanders promised to rejoin the JCPOA on his first day in office if he became president.Instead of immediately rejoining an agreement that worked for all parties, the Biden administration thought it could pressure Iran to negotiate a ""better deal."" Exasperated Iranians instead elected a more conservative government and Iran moved forward on enhancing its nuclear program.A year later, and after eight rounds of shuttle diplomacy in Vienna, Biden hasstill not rejoined the agreement. Ending his first year in the White House with the threat of another Middle East war is enough to give Biden an ""F"" in diplomacy.5. Backing Big Pharma over a People's Vaccine. Biden took office as the first Covid vaccines were being approved and rolled out across the United States and the world. Severe inequities in global vaccine distribution between rich and poor countries were immediately apparent and became known as ""vaccine apartheid.""Instead of manufacturing and distributing vaccines on a non-profit basis to tackle the pandemic as the global public health crisis that it is, the United States and other Western countries chose to maintain the neoliberal regime of patents and corporate monopolies on vaccine manufacture and distribution. The failure to open up the manufacture and distribution of vaccines to poorer countries gave the Covid virus free rein to spread and mutate, leading to new global waves of infection and death from the Delta and Omicron variants.Biden belatedly agreed to support a patent waiver for Covid vaccines under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, but with no real plan for a ""People's Vaccine,"" Biden's concession has made no impact on millions of preventable deaths.6. Ensuring catastrophic global warming at COP26 in Glasgow. After Trump stubbornly ignored the climate crisis for four years, environmentalists were encouraged when Biden used his first days in office to rejoin the Paris climate accord and cancel the Keystone XL Pipel"

The initiative seeks to promote solutions that help address climate change and biodiversity loss.The launch of the initiative coincides with Earth Overshoot Day \- the date when humanity exhausts all ecological resources the planet can regenerate during an entire year.The 100 days referenced in the initiative's name mark the time left until the start of the 26th annual UN Climate Conference (COP26), when government officials from around the globe will gather in Glasgow, Scotland, to try to agree on effective actions to combat climate change.The solutions highlighted by the project underpin its key message: Companies, governments and individuals can act now \- there is no need to wait for decisions to be made at COP26.Opportunities and solutions across all sectors will be revealed each day leading up to COP26 at 100DaysofPossibility.org These will highlight the many ways that everyone can #MoveTheDate of Earth Overshoot Day. Examples include proposals for 100% renewable power grids, smart homes and food waste reduction.Schneider Electric, named world's most sustainable corporation by Corporate Knights Global 100 Index \~showed its support of the initiative by submitting six of its climate solutions to the ""100 Days"" list. Other partners in the project include the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and Drawdown Europe.One of the scalable solutions Schneider has contributed is the integration of a microgrid with an electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure in a Maryland-based smart energy bus depot in the US. It will be the first of its kind and help #MoveTheDate of Earth Overshoot Day by reducing carbon emissions by 62% among other benefits.Another example is with Schneider's office building, IntenCity, in Grenoble, France. IntenCity demonstrates how public and private sectors have joined forces to build cleaner and healthier communities. The building is designed to consume 7 kilowatt-hours per square meter each year  nearly 10 times less energy than the average European building consumes. Rooftop solar panels, two onsite wind turbines, the use of groundwater, and smart technology solutions enable the complex to consume and produce equal amounts of electricity over one year. A unique microgrid partnership facilitates energy sharing and coordination with the surrounding community.Another contribution is Schneider's recent agreement with the Egyptian Electricity Holding Company, the country's national utility provider. It will be the Middle East's first ever country-wide smart grid and help Egypt meet future energy demands while advancing its sustainability strategy.All three solutions will be highlighted during the launch of the ""100 days"" initiative and Schneider's remaining three contributions will be featured throughout the project.About Schneider Electric Our mission is to be your digital partner for Sustainability and Efficiency.We drive digital transformation by integrating world-leading process and energy technologies, end-point to cloud connecting products, controls, software and services, across the entire lifecycle, enabling integrated company management, for homes, buildings, data centers, infrastructure and industries.We are the most local of global companies.

The findings from the Middle East CEOs, revealed today, painted a rosier picture than last year with more than 8 out of 10 CEOs feeling the confidence, higher than the global average, and up 10 per cent on the year before.Indeed, nearly two-thirds of bosses in the region (64 per cent) are either 'extremely or very confident about their company's revenue growth prospects in 2022', markedly higher than the global survey average of 56 per cent.Hani Ashkar, Middle East senior partner, PwC Middle East, told Arabian Business: ""In last year's survey, we noticed that there was increasing optimism across CEOs and that trend towards more optimism has increased this year.

The nation has shown unwavering commitment towards investment projects aimed at mitigating and adapting to climate challenges, and more importantly, creating a positive economic impact for its people.A critical player in the region, the UAE is now calling for bolder action. This October, it launched the Net Zero by 2050 Strategy, an ambitious national drive to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.In addition, the UAE is determined to support the international community and find practical ways to implement and drive change. It is also calling for closer analysis of future climate-related risks and ""anticipatory action"" \- a humanitarian model that releases resources in advance of reliably predicted climate disasters.Dr. Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and UAE Special Envoy for Climate Change, said, ""COP 28 will be especially significant as the first stocktake of national commitments after the Paris Agreement. Our goal will be to make COP 28 as inclusive and action-oriented as possible; a solutions COP that brings together developed and developing countries and unites all sectors - public, private, academic and civil society - around a focus on tangible solutions.""Investments in clean energy projectsThe use of renewable energy has been integral to the UAE's multifaceted strategy to reduce emissions and ward off the worst effects of global warming. These initiatives include solar power, carbon capture, and hydrocarbon energy. In recent years, UAE has invested an estimated US$17 billion in clean energy projects in 70 countries, with a focus on developing countries.In 2021, the UAE organised the regional climate dialogue, and participated in the Leaders Summit on Climate, where it extended its commitment to sustainable agriculture and farming. Recognising that food systems account for almost one-quarter of all global carbon emissions, the UAE partnered with 39 other countries to launch the Agriculture Innovation Mission (AIM) for Climate.The UAE is home to three of the world's largest and lowest-cost solar plants. Whether achieving the world's lowest-cost solar power, introducing biodiversity conversation targets,deploying commercial-scale carbon capture technology, running a zero-carbon nuclear power plant, and pursuing hydrogen energy, the UAE has been a pioneer of significant climate initiatives in the region.Further supporting the UAE Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) has announced that it will decarbonise its power grid at scale through nuclear and solar clean energy sources, starting January 2022, marking a global-first by a major oil and gas company.A holistic approach to climate actionMariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, UAE Minister of Climate Change and the Environment, is keen to build on the UAE's strong track record of climate action, and says the nation wants to help create the right ecosystem to scale up innovation. This will require an equal focus on investment capital, R&D, technology commercialization and project delivery.""We will leverage our natural and competitive advantages as a producer of the least carbon-intensive hydrocarbons for as long as the world relies on a diversified energy mix. We will use this experience as a centre of excellence to become a destination for innovation across the sustainable energy value chain,"" she said.Since the UAE first ratified the Vienna Convention for the protection of the Ozone layer in 1989, it has joined the UNFCC (1995), signed the Paris Agreement (2015) and ratified the Kyoto Protocol (2005), as well as organised the Abu Dhabi Climate meeting two years ago.Moreover, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) officially inaugurated its permanent headquarters at Masdar City in Abu Dhabi, a low-carbon urban development featuring innovative solutions in energy and water efficiency, mobility and waste reduction.\l"

The brand will match every donation to make a positive difference to the people and the planet.This will be followed by interactive elements in the app that will engage and help to educate and encourage customers to lead a more sustainable life. By doing this Virgin Mobile is committed to taking the brand Carbon Negative in 2022.Marking this key milestone for the brand, Rob Beswick, Managing Director for Virgin Mobile UAE said: ""Climate change matters and it's clear that brands have a responsibility to put sustainability at the centre of their strategy. We stepped into 2021 with a heightened sense of conviction that we must challenge ourselves to think bigger and do much more in partnership with others to take care of the planet we share. Last month, Virgin Mobile UAE turned its operation Carbon Neutral. Our next step is to work towards being Carbon Negative and we hope that by launching this new digital app feature we can achieve that together with our customers. By committing to match every contribution our customers make we want to demonstrate how together we can build a better future. With these new innovations and creative ideas, we are confident that we can make Virgin Mobile UAE the first truly Carbon Negative mobile brand globally, by the end of 2022.""As the leading first fully digital customer focused mobile brand in the UAE, Virgin Mobile achieved net zero carbon emissions this year through investments in multiple business and community projects in partnership with the Dubai Carbon Centre of Excellence.With the help of Dubai Carbon Centre of Excellence, Virgin Mobile UAE received critical insights into total emissions across all elements of its business. Emissions calculations were used to create and implement wide-ranging sustainable processes for the reduction of Virgin Mobile UAE's overall operational emissions including new ways of working related to business travel, reduction and reuse of materials, energy efficiency, and sustainability awareness and education initiatives. This led Virgin Mobile to create a new app feature that allows customers to make a small contribution to offset the carbon emissions that are produced when they use their Virgin Mobile plan, for data and voice consumption.Furthermore, the organisation supports local community projects through investment and partnerships such as the first landfill gas (LFG)-to-energy project in the Middle East, located in Dubai.

The federal minister for Transport Nitin Gadkari recently said the cost of electric vehicles would come down over the next couple of years. Right on cue, the government's policy think tank has brought a proposal to make them cheaper.Niti Aayog has given a proposal to bring institutional lending to purchase electric vehicles under the priority sector ambit. Simply put, this means banks loans for buying electric vehicles could become cheaper. As of now, the loans are extended under auto retail category --- among the high interest categories in India.India's central clearing bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), is now considering the proposal and a decision on this is expected after confabs with other stakeholders.Tata Motors to launch 10 new electric vehicles by 2026Ather Energy ups the ante - ramps up its EV production with a new plantDelays expected in Ola Electric scooter deliveriesNiti Aayog chief thinks there is a clear case The financial daily Economic Times has quoted Niti Aayog chief Amitabh Kant as saying ""The inclusion of EVs under PSL (priority sector lending) would not only reduce cost of finance but also provide finance to more people, thus increasing penetration of EVs in India.He added: ""Our view is that there is a case for this in the context of the impending climate change crisis and India's recent commitments at COP26 in Glasgow.""India has committed itself, at the Glasgow Climate Change Conference last month, to a target of lowering the total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes by 2030 and cutting emissions to net zero by 2070.EV manufacturers have also written to the RBI for extending priority sector lending to them. As it happens, non-banking financial lenders are also looking at the sector with keen interest.But, are the banks keen enough? While the think tank and the transport ministry are pushing the envelope to make electric vehicles cheaper in India is one thing, the banking sector, on the other hand, may not be all that warm to the idea. Lending for purchase of vehicles is among the high-risk list in India. To reduce bank lending rates is to invite more danger is the general thinking of the bankers.Banking norms mandate that 40% of lenders' total credit must be made to those branded as 'priority sector'. Currently, these include agriculture, small businesses, export credit, education, housing, social infrastructure and renewable energy.Will the RBI ride rough shod over the apprehensions of the banks? Well, it is a question that has no easy answers.Kant himself has claimed that the process for inclusion of EVs under PSL requires extensive deliberations and consultations to have a targeted outcome of increased access and reduced cost of finance to this sector.According to recent stats, electric cars saw a staggering growth of 234% in the six months of April to September 2021. During this period over 6261 personal electric vehicles were sold in the country. This number is already way more than the total number of electric car sales for the entire FY2021. In the first half of the current fiscal, in all, EV sales more than tripled to 118,000 units.But the sobering perspective is, during the same part of the fiscal year, 13,87,714 PVs were sold in the country and EVs are a mere 0.45% of the total market size.So EVs could do with priority sector lending.Best electric scooters you can buy in India right nowWant to know about the latest happenings in tech?

By 2050, cities will host another 2.5 billion urban dwellers, making the world's population 80 per cent urban. Net Zero City, the region's first book on the transition to Net Zero, has signalled the urgent wake-up call for swift corrective action.The book - authored by Farah Naz, a climate strategist and Lead of Specialist Services, Sustainable ESG Solutions for AECOM Middle East, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Africa and a Dubai resident since 2015, and Langdon Morris, a globally renowned author, consultant and a speaker on innovation and sustainability- is a detailed, definitive, and action-orientated roadmap to guide any city in the transition to this critical new approach.The book will be launched in Dubai, which will host the Middle East Climate Week, supported by United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), between March 28 and 31.Khaleej Times spoke with Naz ahead of the launch of the book.Morris and I shared a great concern about climate change and its impact on people and cities.The project started as a research project by Morris in the London School of Economics in 2020, where I was his industry supervisor/ partner.Globally climate and biodiversity were announced in 2019, which means a situation in which urgent action is required to reduce or halt climate change and avoid potentially irreversible environmental damage resulting from it.The effect of climate change is already causing severe disruptions in how we live, work, and play. In future, it may cause more disruptions. As we both started working together, we saw that while cities produce significant amounts of greenhouse gases, there did not seem to be a comprehensive guide that showed how cities could take an Integrated approach to reaching net zero transition from governance to technical solutions. So, we set out to write one.Work started summer of 2020 and was completed in autumn of 2021.What we have discovered through our research is that there is a tremendous amount of material available on the topic of net zero, many fine examples and initiatives to reduce greenhouse gases from all over the world. But they are point solutions, so, perhaps, our biggest challenge was coming up with an overall strategy and roadmap that integrates all the information, numerous case studies and examples into a coherent action plan.This was one of our key goals for the book, and it took quite a long time. We interviewed people globally and engaged with students and researchers to identify the path to least resistance. Even though both of us authored the book, we are only the messengers. The book encompasses a comprehensive approach to Net zero transition for cities covering five key areas: Governance, Urban Design, Circular Economy, Energy (Food energy water nexus and Energy Infrastructure), Innovation and Data Science.Finally, we were able to develop a comprehensive framework that seems to be quite useful. In the book we present a 10 Year Transformation Roadmap for cities. We believe cities can adopt a ""Climate Smart Master plan"" that addresses the Net Zero Transition as an underlying Urban Framework. This framework would enable the city to establish and better understand the Carbon emissions from key sectors like:This book addresses this very topic. We present a 10-year Transformation Roadmap for cities, providing multifaceted pathways to overcome the Climate Emergency by attaining Net Zero. This book is an open call for action for the global community to rise up to the challenge, and shows how we can choose a new way of thinking and doingHow long have you been living and working as an engineer in the UAE?Since arriving in Dubai in 2015, I have been steering a sustainability and innovation agenda in the built environment across the Middle East. I have led the sustainability and innovation strategy at the Museum of the Future, Louvre Museum in Abu Dhabi, Bee£h HQ in Sharjah, Masdar Eco Housing, and the Expo 2020 Sustainability Pavilion, including liveability and energy strategy for key master planning projects across the region.While based in the United Kingdom, I was involved in creating the energy strategy for the country's first zero-energy building, Ashmount Primary School, which won the 2015 Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Sustainable Buildings Award.As an innovator, I focus on implementing best practices in the built environment by applying systems thinking related to the Food-Energy-Water Nexus, biomimetics, Capital model of Sustainability, Liveability, and Inclusive Integrated Innovation Frameworks, which I believe build the foundation of our cities and communities.What kind of initiatives is the UAE taking towards a transition to Net Zero?Last November, before the COP-26 summit, the UAE announced their commitment to becoming net-zero by 2050. The UAE Net Zero 2050 strategic initiative aligns with the Paris Agreement, which calls on countries to prepare long-term strategies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and limit the rise in global temperature to 1.5 C compared to pre-industrial levels. The Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE) will lead and coordinate efforts to execute the UAE Net Zero by 2050 strategic initiative and ensure collaboration at the national level to fulfil this objective.The following actions have been taken by the UAE to date:- An innovation Centre to support the demonstration, commercialisation, and adoption of sustainable energy technologies- A development company focused on the commercialisation of emissions reduction and clean development mechanism solutions as provided by the Kyoto Protocol- A special economic zone to host institutions investing in renewable energy technology.In the last six years, the concept of Smart Cities have evolved into Climate-Smart Cities EXPO 2020 is a Micro Scale innovation of Lab of a Futurist Climate-smart city.In Expo, we are experiencing - Inclusive Integrated Innovation, where people display and talk about Technical Innovation, even how the pavilions are built their architecture; engineering is a testament to this technical innovation.Entrepreneurs express business innovation, and businesses focus on the commercial and business development of the products and ideas to live, as well as social innovation is taking place with all the learnings and awareness.Terra Pavillion - the exhibitions inspire an individual to question his/her role in this planet and inspire a child to think outside of the box.I believe, as humans are not defined by the vision of the future, we are left with old decisions of the past. Past is important to know our roots, but it also should work as a catalyst to create the blueprint of the future. This is what I see the UAE has done. They have jumped orbits in creating a vision for the future, and now, with Net Zero Agenda and Climate-smart cities we would be experiencing another orbital jump in establishing a Climate Smart City.How serious is the climate change threat to the UAE like the rest of the world?The challenges to the natural environment today are immense. The UAE faces the impact of rapid development and the effects of climate change and global warming. Protection of the environment and sustainable development are key topics that receive great attention from the UAE Government.The UAE's rapid economic development made the country face serious environmental challenges that arise from the high pace of population growth, the increase in the demand for energy and water and the fast-paced urban development accompanied with high levels of GHG and other emissions in the UAE.According to the Living Planet Report 2010 by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the UAE was rated number one in the world for having the biggest ecological footprint. The ecological footprint is a measure of a country's sustainability that compares the use of natural resources per person per capita, which is expressed by a unit of bio-productive land called the 'global hectare' (gha).Key environment threats include: Invasive SpeciesLimited water resource OverfishingAir and water pollutionWaste generationLand degradation and desertificationWhich country and city in the region is most equipped to emerge as Net Zero?Most countries in the Middle East are facing the impacts of extreme weather conditions and climate change. There is no doubt now that there really is a climate emergency, but there is a lot of uncertainty about what we must do to address it. The COP 26 meeting in Glasgow in November 2021 clearly highlights the difficulties we have as a global society in coping with systemic problems of this magnitude. In Glasgow, there was essentially no disagreement about the nature and scope of the problem, but a lot of dithering about what to do.There is now no doubt that the destiny of humanity lies in our cities. The human population crossed the halfway point around 2010 on our journey toward becoming a fully urbanised civilisation, and each day the populations of our cities continue to increase while rural populations decl"

After the recent conclusion of COP26 in Glasgow, the torch is in fact being passed to Egypt and the UAE as hosts of COP27 and COP28 respectively.Sustainability is broader than climate change. It is about enabling a society where future generations can thrive, and everyone needs to contribute their fair share.Nameer Khan, Chairman and Founding Board Member of MFTA said: ""We are extremely excited to be launching the Sustainable Fintech Alliance as part of MFTA's core initiatives. We see momentum picking up in the region and, as an Association that brings together stakeholders from across the region, with excellent relationships with central banks and regulators, MFTA has a key role in supporting the transition towards a more sustainable society. We want to help Fintechs embrace sustainability as part of their organizations' culture and values, and ensure they have access to high quality knowledge and resources. Problem-solving is built into the DNA of Fintechs, and we believe they are also uniquely positioned to think creatively and collaboratively to bring sustainability front and centre in consumers' lives. I am personally invested in harnessing technology and innovation to reimagine financial services from the lens of sustainability, and I am committed to making this a core priority of MFTA's engagement with Fintechs and regulators going forward.""By joining the Alliance, members commit to gradually implementing credible and transparent sustainability strategies within their organisations, which contribute towards the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and also the Net Zero pledges made by several countries across the region.Companies are at different levels of maturity when it comes to embed sustainability within their organisations, and Fintechs are no different. This is why education and awareness will be central to achieving the Alliance's mission.The Sustainable Fintech Alliance is therefore committing to a phased, three steps approach:EducationAs a first, critical step in this journey, MFTA is working with institutional and academic partners to design a robust educational programme that will equip Fintechs with the knowledge base they need to develop solid sustainability strategies that are right for them. This will be based on international best practice and will be delivered with support from leading experts, as well as a knowledge exchange platform between members.ImplementationHaving obtained the right knowledge and learnt about leading global standards, Fintechs will be able to set credible sustainability and climate-related goals that align to their company's values and customers' expectations, while making a positive contribution towards the achievement of the SDGs. At this stage, members can publicly disclose their strategy and commitments.RealisationTransparency is critical in order to gain people's trust. So once the strategy and commitments have been communicated, these will need to be consistently followed up and measured. At this stage, members will feel confident to track the progress made and, through the Alliance, they will have continuous access to all the help and support they need.MFTA passionately believes that the Fintech community has a critical role to play in finding solutions for the most urgent issues we face as a society. This is why, in addition to helping members embrace sustainability within their organisations, the Alliance will also enable collaboration between the Fintech community and policymakers within the financial sector and beyond, with the aim of putting technology at the service of purposeful change.Christian Kunz, Head of Group Strategy and Innovation at DIFC Authority, and Chair of the Dubai Sustainable Finance Working Group said: ""We are proud to be member of this founding group and a part of the Sustainable Fintech Alliance, aiming to create a positive impact with the help of the different partners, beginning with education.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE205","Youth have a greater role to play in climate campaign","October 19, 2021 Tuesday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","Climate activists hold a protest at the US Chamber of Commerce in Washington, DC. \- AFPAt the beginning of the summer, I noted how the climate-change narrative had changed in recent years, thanks to tremendous technological progress that has made green energy more competitive and often less costly than older carbon-based technologies. This is certainly true for new power investments, although for a while it will still be cheaper to produce electricity from older assets with sunk costs than to build new green plants. But in the medium term, I argued, ""the new win-win story"" implies that ""national gains and commercial profit can now drive progress"" toward a green transformation.The climate debate is thus no longer only about the costs of mitigation and how to share them in an equitable and politically feasible way. Instead, as Nicholas Stern has said in his report to the G7, ""the transition to a zero-emissions and climate-resilient world provides the greatest economic, business, and commercial opportunity of our time"".With the crucial United Nations climate-change summit (COP26) in Glasgow less than two weeks away, the positive developments in green energy certainly provide grounds for optimism. But an important caveat is in order.It would be easy but incorrect to interpret the recent advances in green technologies as making emissions reduction less of a global public good (GPG). This GPG is measured by reductions in atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations due to human activity. Less accumulation of these gases due to mitigation efforts remains a pure GPG: the benefits are non-rival and not excludable. Technological changes do not alter that fact. The ""addition"" to the GPG is the lowering of total greenhouse-gas concentrations due to a country's own mitigation, and a given amount of mitigation anywhere will produce the same global benefit.At the same time, the net benefit of an isolated mitigation action \- the difference between its benefits and its costs \- will vary across countries. In the past, technological constraints meant the net benefit in terms of GDP was negative. It is quickly becoming positive for many countries, making a green transformation increasingly feasible.The point is necessary to bear in mind because the recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change made clear that the aggregate result of countries following their own most profitable development strategies would not provide enough global mitigation to limit climate change to an acceptable level. The damage and risks associated with global warming have become greater and more imminent, with broader and more volatile effects. In particular, the frequency and severity of extreme weather events directly linked to climate change has increased substantially. Moreover, the imminence of the threat means that frontloading mitigation \- including earlier decommissioning of old power plants, among many other measures \- is crucial.If every country chose its preferred development strategy, the resulting non-cooperative outcome would result in unacceptably risky levels of emissions. The incentive problem has not disappeared. Yes, in many countries, technology will increasingly allow positive economic gains from mitigation. But these countries will still not have the incentive to mitigate with the same intensity and urgency that they would if the global benefits were part of their cost-benefit calculation.So, while the emergence of net national economic benefits from emissions-reduction efforts is certainly a welcome development, an optimal global solution will require more and earlier mitigation than would result if each country responded only to its own incentives. In fact, the latest IPCC report suggests that the gap between the sum of national strategies and a globally optimal approach may even have increased.The IPCC report should temper the optimism fuelled by recognition of green energy's profitability. It should foster broad acceptance of the need for multilateral efforts to provide sufficient incentives for climate-change mitigation, and to mobilise financial resources to enable all countries to make large green investments that are profitable in the long term. As for incentives, some form of carbon pricing is a powerful spur, and together with regulations \- such as banning the production of cars powered by internal combustion engines after a certain date \- can set expectations and drive the necessary shift in investments.Fortunately, an important feature of the new climate narrative \- not related to the economic cost-benefit analysis concerning mitigation \- should facilitate the cooperative solutions that are still needed. This is the stronger support for ambitious climate policies, rooted in ethical considerations, from civil society around the world.For many, the preservation of the planet as we know it, including its species and biodiversity, is a near-absolute ethical imperative. A lot of people in green movements in developed countries not only support frontloaded mitigation at home but also seem ready to commit some of their income to finance the green transition in poorer countries.We don't know exactly how many would be willing to give up how much, but climate ethics has become a significant political force, particularly among young people. This should help make possible the ambitious climate policies required, including the mobilisation of resources for developing countries in support of early mitigation measures.In an age shaped by the re-emergence of populist nationalism, green internationalism may provide an increasingly influential counterweight. The COP26 gathering will provide a telling indication of its current strength.  Project SyndicateClick/tap here to subscribe to Khaleej Times news alerts on Telegram.\l"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE206","Planet needs circular economy. Are businesses listening?","January 10, 2022 Monday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","Having spent a fair amount of time in a remote village, I had a revelation of sorts. This wasn't some Eat Pray Love moment. But something rather mundane. I had piled up a significant amount of plastic waste despite my attempt to lead a simple life. Ironically, Amazon delivery could reach where a municipal truck could not. So, every time I ordered some bare necessity, like food or hygiene products, I essentially ordered more plastic. It's when the municipal truck does not roll in that the full magnitude of the plastic waste problem becomes apparent. It just keeps mounting. The challenge of treating plastic waste in an environmentally safe manner became an obsession for me. I could fully appreciate the importance of transitioning to a Circular Economy (CE).Studies show that the shift to renewable energy can only fix 55 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions; the balance 45 per cent comes from how we make and use food, clothes, cars, and products of daily use. Circular economy offers a clear path out of the climate mess.It has been more than nine months since I first wrote about Circular Economy. Since then, the chatter on adopting CE practices has grown, signalling strong gusts of change. The year 2021 saw an unprecedented momentum for CE and not the least because of Cop26 held in Glasgow late last year. Goals were set, pledges made, reports published, and conferences attended.Yet, did words translate into action? Have businesses started to build regenerative systems to design out waste? What does the CE scorecard look like for businesses?Early signs include a sustainability report and the appointment of a CE manager. The job role tells you the general intent of the organisation. The Circular Economy paradigm demands a rethinking at a fundamental level. The task ahead appears daunting because we need to transform production and consumption mechanisms; how we create and how we use; how we build and how we consume, how we treat and reuse our waste.A widespread adoption of CE practices is yet to happen. In each industry vertical, a few companies, possibly leaders have embarked on a CE journey. But CE can become mainstream only if entire supply chains make a transition.Sociology suggests that organisational isomorphism occurs because of coercive, mimetic, and normative forces. Coercive pressures typically come from regulation, compelling companies to take action to avoid penalties. Current regulations have forced organizations to recycle, treat effluents, and adopt clean energy. Nearly a fifth of 2,000 public companies globally have committed to net zero, which involves reducing or offsetting emissions by green initiatives. The targets set by these companies are not always backed by the 'how'. This attracts criticisms of green washing.Agri-food businesses are doing away with single use plastic for consumers. Yet, while Amazon delivered my food items in cartons and brown paper, the individual food items came in plastic bags. I wish I could have returned the packaging through the delivery person for the seller to reuse. Can food containers be designed for reuse? Can the customer be incentivized to use reverse logistics? This will happen when normative and mimetic pressures come into play.Normative pressures come from social norms. Consumer expectations borne out of climate change awareness is one such example. Some industry verticals have an influential customer segment that advocates affirmative action against climate change. They buy brands that behave responsibly and are vocal about their choices. Industries such as fashion have taken small steps to address take-make-waste practices. It is not uncommon to find tags on clothes stating the percentage of the product that came from recycled or reused material.Energy companies are already being pressured by investor and climate activism because of a disproportionate reliance on fossil fuel, especially coal. Energy companies have, however, largely focused on plastic waste management as opposed to transitioning to renewable energy. Some are merely looking to spin off their coal assets rather than dealing with them responsibly. Recent acquisitions of Synova by Total suggests that Tech Startups will play a major role in helping energy companies transition to CE.These are still baby steps because normative pressures are not strong enough. Not all customers are open to used products. Consumer attitude towards used products could range from strong aversion to mild hesitancy, especially when the pandemic hasn't ended. However, consumer mindset is shifting from ownership to usage and performance. Imagine buying 1,000 wash cycles in a washing machine. Bosch is educating customers to use its DIY tools to upcycle old material into garden fixtures.Lastly mimetic pressures involve imitating industry best practices borne out of shared concepts and beliefs. Once companies begin to feel mimetic pressures, we will see a more widespread adoption of CE practices.Why would businesses take the trouble to cooperate in transitioning to CE? While currently institutional pressures outweigh other drivers for a vast majority of businesses, economic drivers will provide the major force for an industry-wide shift. Unless it makes business sense, companies are not going to budge. A key economic driver is to extract maximum value out of products by keeping them in use. Additionally, companies are looking at extracting maximum value from materials such as aluminum, steel, lithium, even after reaching product end of life. This reduces risks related to material price volatility and supply chain disruptions.Businesses need to take a long hard look at the problem of waste. The goal set by the Paris Agreement on climate change requires Circular Economy. Many factors need to converge for Circular Economy to go beyond a conceptual framework. When the perfect storm arises, no company would want to be left behind.Shalini Verma is CEO of PIVOT technologies, a Dubai-based cognitive innovation company.\l"

This research found that nearly 70 percent of people trust climate scientists, up from 57 percent in 2019The Climate Progress Survey: Business and Consumer Worries and Hopes, a global study of public opinion published by the World Economic Forum in collaboration with SAP and Qualtrics, finds that while trust in climate science has surged, optimism is in short supply.Most participants felt a strong personal responsibility to the environment, even as they felt businesses and governments could do more to make a difference. The majority of respondents felt that everyone should work together to tackle climate change.This research found that nearly 70 percent of people trust climate scientists, up from 57 percent in 2019, when this poll question was first asked. In Eastern Europe and Central Asia, the jump was particularly dramatic, with trust nearly doubling, from 38 percent in 2019 to 65 percent in 2021.74 percent of respondents agree climate change is caused by humans, a number that rose from 67 percent in 2020. This question has been settled within climate science for some time (99 percent of climate research agrees that climate change is man-made) but the question remains a topic of political circles. Most people (59 percent) felt their governments could do more to protect the environment and only around a fourth trusted business sustainability claims.Respondents in the Middle East & North Africa are fairly neutral compared to other regions as they neither lead nor lag on any major KPI. 71 percent trust scientists, believe climate change is mostly human-caused and feel extremely or very personally responsible for addressing climate change. Around half are optimistic about the progress needed to reduce emissions. Among corporate respondents, 53 percent face notable risk from climate change and 59 percent of those who use ESG metrics say they are extremely or very useful.The global study asked more than 11,000 people in 28 countries about their experience with climate change. Around 70 percent of its respondents represent the global population with the remaining 30 percent representing the corporate world (those working at least 40 hours per week for for-profit companies).The study reinforces the World Economic Forum's message that the climate crisis will require urgent cross-sector collaboration using every mechanism available to make meaningful action possible, including policy, finance, technology and education.The report's findings align with other recent World Economic Forum reports that drive home a critical reality: leaders do not need to choose between the economy and the climate.The Climate Progress Survey's release coincides with COP26, a critical global climate summit held in Glasgow, Scotland.\l"

If the government does nothing, tomorrow there will be a steel crisis,"" he added, as quoted by The Times.Conservative MP Craig Mackinlay, head of the Net Zero Scrutiny Group of more than 40 Tory MPs, said the plan should be ""discounted and discarded immediately,"" as the UK is already experiencing ""energy poverty.""The conservative wing of the Tory Party also called for the opening of the North Sea to the fracking industry, to make the country less reliant for energy on Russia and the Middle East.Due to claims of drilling causing earthquake tremors, a moratorium was placed on the fracking industry in England in 2019.Despite the government's previously supporting fracking, calling it a potential creator of jobs and a solution to the nation's energy problems, Johnson is now focusing on green alternatives to meet the goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.But his net-zero plan could cost the UK over \£33 trillion, or \£3100,000 per household, according to a Global Warming Policy Foundation report released in February 2020.\l"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE213","Analysis: COP 28: Global recognition for UAE' anti-warming efforts","November 12, 2021 Friday","Emirates News Agency (WAM) - Business (English)","By Mohammed Jalal Al Rayssi, Director General of the Emirates News Agency (WAM) ABU DHABI, 12th November, 2021 (WAM) -- The UN's decision in Glasgow on Thursday night to accept the UAE's bid to host the 28th UN global climate talks in 2023 translates in no uncertain terms the international confidence in the country's decade-long anti-global warming efforts and its forward-thinking vision for economic growth. ""There being no objections; it is decided,"" so declared COP26 President Alok Sharma the UAE's win of hosting the highly significant session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 28) in 2023. The successful bid comes to corroborate the UAE's determination to ""working with the international community to accelerate global efforts to address climate change & environmental protection & create a more sustainable economic future,"" as His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, put it. In a report echoing the UAE's anti-warming efforts, CNBC said that ""playing host for COP28 would be an achievement in the climate sphere for the Middle East the world's hottest, driest and most water-scarce region. By 2030, temperatures are expected to increase more than twice the global average. ""The UAE plans to increase its oil production capacity to more than 5 million barrels per day by 2030, and is constructing a coal fired power plant. Nevertheless, its pitch to host COP28 seeks to elevate its efforts to make climate action a pillar of its domestic and foreign policy and national economic strategy, according to a 19-page official document reviewed by CNBC."" This global recognition of the UAE's climate action had been accentuated before by the man steering the helm of this pressing file in the United States, Mr John Kerry, the United States Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, who led congratulations from world leaders and prominent environmental policy-makers to the UAE for its Net Zero 2050 Strategic Initiative, calling it an ""incredibly important"" step in combating climate change. It goes without saying that climate action has become a burning issue for the future of humanity at large, and therefore the UAE has adopted a forward-looking vision decades ago to address it in the best possible manner. The ambitious Net Zero 2050 Strategic Initiative announced in October meant AED600 billion will be invested in clean and renewable energy sources in the next three decades. The groundbreaking move came in unison with the longstanding vision of the UAE and its people to make a significant contribution to global sustainability efforts while supporting economic and human development both at home and around the world. Not to mention the track record UAE boasts in organising key global events. After winning the UN's approval to host this global conference, the UAE will continue to forge ahead with its endeavours to ensure collective climate action and take advantage of the opportunities up for grabs to help protect key natural resources for ours and future generations. The UAE ushers into its next 50 year-journey with high ambition and determination to make a paradigm shift in international response to climate change challenges in order to turn them into promising opportunities for sustained growth and prosperity. The UAE is now a land of opportunities where creative minds come together for the service, benefit and welfare of humanity.\l"

The first Chromebook to use Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c, you can expect plenty of flexibility thanks to that adjustable display that flips between laptop and tablet mode, and over 12 hours of battery life.Not only that, but just using the Spin 513 over a laptop or desktop computer will also allegedly help the pledge to better support the environment.Acer reports that PX3, an IT consulting company specializing in sustainability in IT, benchmarked the ACER Chromebook Spin 513 LTE to see how it would compare against over market-leading notebooks and found that it was 84% more energy efficient than a legacy desktop PC.Partnering with Ecology UK is yet another way to help cut carbon emissions that result from manufacturing and transportation, with the green charity having a clear and transparent ethos on its website on how it helps to plant trees, both in the UK and across the world. If there's any doubt, you can check the Ecologi Public Impact and Operations Ledger for yourself.You can purchase the Acer Chromebook Spin 513 for \£3399 from popular high street retailers like Argos, John Lewis and Currys, but remember to register your device on the Acer website to get those trees planted.(Image credit: Acer)We're seeing a lot of tech companies getting on board with campaigns aimed to reduce environmental impact, and for good reason. Outside of COP26, concerns have been raised for years on the effect that our devices are having, from greenhouse gases being produced as a result of manufacturing, to human welfare in regards to collecting and creating the required components to build them in the first place.Companies like Apple have also previously been criticized and investigated for 'planned obsolescence', allegedly having built-in redundancy to encourage customers to purchase new devices rather than retain and update existing hardware.It's difficult to see what is and isn't an attempt at 'greenwashing'. With consumers now being more eco-conscious than ever, having a good environmental policy is a big selling point. It's not always clear what's a genuine campaign or a marketing gimmick, but thankfully many brands do seem to be taking things very seriously these days.With the inclusion of an outside consultancy and a well-established and transparent charity, this effort to plant 100 trees does feel refreshing and genuine, especially when you consider that Acer has the recently released Vero l"

Governments largely ignore livestock's contribution to climate change, terrified of taking on the powerful vested interests that drive expanding global consumption of meat and dairy.The report reveals that: -The livestock sector is responsible for 14.5% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.-The food system is responsible for one third of all GHG emissions - 75% of agriculture's emissions are from livestock.-To meet the Paris Agreement targets, all sectors need to reduce their emissions. However, if global meat and dairy consumption continues at the same rate, emissions from food and agriculture will rise significantly, and meeting the Paris Agreement targets will be very difficult.-Changes to our diets could contribute up to a fifth of the mitigation needed to meet the Paris Agreement targets.In order to turn the tide on the crisis, governments and policy makers must act urgently in several key areas, according to the charity. This includes reducing meat production in industrial monogastric farming (for example, pigs and poultry) and the feedlot cattle sectors. Most meat and dairy should come from farms where animals are able to graze on well-managed biodiverse grassland, and the amount of land devoted to livestock should also be reduced to support natural climate solutions like restoration of forests and peatland.The report highlights that policies developed to solve the issue must integrate key considerations including: food security, resource efficiency, biodiversity loss, deforestation, detrimental impacts on soils and water, and animal welfare, as well as the use of antimicrobials and the risk of future pandemics.Finally, in order to ensure action is taken, governments must encourage and incentivise reduced levels of meat and dairy production and consumption, other than in countries where levels are already low.Author of the report and Chief Policy Adviser at Compassion in World Farming, Peter Stevenson, said: ""The central role that food and agriculture plays in the climate crisis has been virtually overlooked by world leaders.""Today, we're breaking the taboo and saying what has to be said through our new report \- that livestock production is a major driver of the climate crisis. Without an urgent and dramatic global reduction in meat and dairy consumption we will be unable to meet the Paris Agreement targets needed to avert a climate catastrophe. Are we really prepared to risk destroying the planet simply because we cannot curb our excessive consumption of meat and dairy?

The UAE welcomes the opportunity to share its capabilities and experience in best-in-class methane performance with signatories to the EU-US led initiative that aims to cut global methane emissions by 30 per cent by the end of the decade. The UAE has long acted as a regional leader in methane reduction. Over five decades, the country has successfully reduced the volume of natural gas flared in the domestic energy sector by more than 90%. In turn, the UAE's hydrocarbon industry today holds one of the world's lowest methane intensities of 0.01%. The UAE will build on this foundation of ultra-low methane intensity in the energy sector to further improve its methane performance. The UAE aims to achieve the Oil & Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 ""gold standard"" by deploying advanced technology from drones to satellites, and to decarbonise natural gas to create low carbon blue hydrogen for industry. Dr. Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, UAE Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and Special Envoy for Climate Change, said: ""We are delighted to join the Global Methane Pledge, in this special year celebrating the Golden Jubilee of our nation. The UAE has continued to lead firsts in methane, since the UAE's founding father, the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, set up the first LNG production company in the Arabian Gulf, reduced flaring and achieved one of lowest methane intensities, still leading today."" He added: ""The UAE is also turning methane into opportunity with our ambitions to convert waste to energy. Together, this makes the UAE a unique leader in methane stewardship. We are delighted to help others, to share our experiences with the world, and commit to the Global Methane Pledge."" Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, UAE Minister of Climate Change and the Environment, expressed appreciation to the US and EU for leading the call to the Global Methane Pledge that will mobilise tangible actions in endorsing countries. She also thanked the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) for their work on the Global Methane Assessment report, published in May 2021. The document shows that reducing human-caused methane emissions is one of the most cost-effective and impactful strategies to slow down the rate of global warming. She added: ""The UAE is a keen supporter of the global efforts to address climate change. Recognising the urgent need for multilateral cooperation in this regard, we are proud to join the Global Methane Pledge and reaffirm our commitment to cutting down on methane emissions through domestic policy-making and developing innovative solutions."" The Global Methane Pledge acknowledges that ""readily available cost-effective methane emission measures have the potential to avoid over 0.2 degrees C of warming by 2050 while yielding important co-benefits, including improving public health and agricultural productivity."" The nation's methane mitigation strategy is part of a holistic approach to climate action. Recognising that agriculture contributes to global emissions, the nation has also partnered with the US and over 30 nations to launch the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate, a global initiative aimed at accelerating investments in R&D for climate-smart agri-tech. \l"

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE226","UAE keen to seize economic opportunities of energy transition: Sultan Al Jaber","January 17, 2022 Monday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","DUBAI, 17th January, 2022 (WAM) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is keen to seize the economic opportunities presented by the energy transition, according to Dr. Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology, Special Envoy for Climate Change and Chairman of Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company (Masdar).Dr. Al Jaber made the remarks during the opening ceremony of Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ADSW) and awards ceremony of the Zayed Sustainability Prize at Expo 2020 Dubai, in the presence of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai.Delivering the opening address at the first major global sustainability event after COP26 (the UN Climate Conference), Dr. Al Jaber appreciated the wise leadership's keenness to ensure the safety of UAE citizens, visitors and residents. ""Thanks to the efforts and vision of the leadership, the UAE has become the most vaccinated country against COVID-19 in the world, and we have also strengthened our resilience while extending a helping hand to more than 135 countries in need."" Speaking to a live audience that included heads of states, ministers and policymakers, Dr. Al Jaber went on to detail how the UAE's Founding Father, the late Sheikh Zayed, laid the foundation for the country's progressive approach to climate change and sustainability and explained that the country is well-positioned to capitalise on the opportunities created by the energy transition.""As the UAE celebrates its Golden Jubilee, we have seen 50 years of incredible progress. Our founding father, Sheikh Zayed, invested the wealth of a nation in the health of a nation. He balanced economic development with environmental responsibility. He believed that sharing made good nations great and guided the UAE to become one of the world's leading humanitarian donors. And, more than this, he taught the people of this nation to aim for the stars, so that one day we would explore Mars, Venus and beyond.""Dr. Al Jaber noted the world has also been transformed for the better over the last 50 years but this has posed fundamental questions of how to keep moving forward, while turning back the clock on emissions and how to enhance global prosperity.""Finding the answers to these questions has been the mission of the Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week and the Zayed Sustainability Prize. A mission that builds on the UAE's position as a pioneer in clean energy. When we began investing in the renewables space more than 15 years ago, our leadership had a theory of the future that has been proven right over time. Today, the UAE is home to the largest and lowest cost solar plants in the world.""Dr. Al Jaber added, ""Globally, we see a bright future for the renewable energy sector as at least $3 trillion will be invested in renewable energy over the next 10 years. Through Masdar, we have invested in solar and wind energy projects in 40 countries around the world. Last month, under the direction of His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, three of the largest energy companies in the UAE entered into a strategic partnership to consolidate Masdar's position and turn it into a global leader in the field of clean energy.""Thanks to this partnership, Masdar doubled its total renewable energy capacity, and our ambition is to build on these solid foundations and reach 100 gigawatts, and then double it to 200 gigawatts. This represents a massive opportunity, and the UAE and Masdar extend an open invitation to all our partners, public and private, to join us on this ambitious journey. This growth will contribute to creating job opportunities, new sectors and skills, and opening a new door of hope for present and future generations."" As the first country in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region to announce a Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative, the UAE is adopting a low carbon pathway to a high growth destination and is keen to accelerate progress on this journey as hosts of COP28, according to Dr. Al Jaber.Expanding on COP28, which is set to be held in Abu Dhabi in 2023, Dr. Al Jaber took the opportunity to thank President Moon Jae-in of the Republic of Korea and the Asia Pacific Group for their support in confirming the UAE as hosts. He went on to provide an insight into the UAE's approach.""The UAE is looking forward to playing its role as host of COP28 and we take on this role with humility and a sense of great pride and responsibility. We will work closely with the COP presidencies of the UK and Egypt and build on their momentum. We will take a practical approach, that moves from pledges to action, focused on commercially viable climate solutions.""We will give an equal voice to the developing world, align the public and the private sector, academics and engineers, civil society and industry. And that means all industry, including the hydrocarbon industry. Because, if there is one thing that the history of every energy transition tells us, it is that they take time. You cannot simply flip a switch,"" stressed Dr. Al Jaber.""To successfully navigate a complex transition to the energy system of tomorrow, we can't just unplug from the energy system of today. We must remain pragmatic, while being progressive. We should look for the solutions where the energy expertise exists. And we should always remember that our goal is to hold back emissions, not progress.""While the world still needs oil and gas, the UAE is committed to making the current energy system work more efficiently with much less carbon, according to Dr. Al Jaber. He highlighted that ADNOC produces one of the least carbon intensive hydrocarbons in the world and, as of 17 days ago, 100 percent of ADNOC's grid power now comes from zero carbon energy sources.Dr. Al Jaber added that this is a first for the oil and gas industry and it is reducing emissions at scale, shaping the market for clean energy and making a direct contribution to the UAE's net zero push, not tomorrow, but today.Concluding his remarks, Dr. Al Jaber highlighted the importance of the Zayed Sustainability Prize, the UAE's pioneering global award in sustainability.""Fifty years ago Sheikh Zayed instilled in the UAE a commitment to inclusive sustainable and humanitarian development that continues to this day. In honour of this legacy, the Zayed Sustainability Prize has helped turn this commitment into concrete action. The prize has not only contributed to building a better world by addressing global challenges, but also engaged the younger generation in re-imagining our future. It has improved the lives of more than 370 million people to date in 150 countries and counting. This year we received a record 4000 prize entries. And I am really looking forward to seeing how this year's finalists and winners will continue to drive our sustainable future.""Creating that future is the reason we are all gathered here at this place at this time. We understand the challenges, but we know that behind every challenge lies a greater opportunity. Let us focus on what's practical to produce real progress. Let us use the same determination that brought us here today to drive the solutions of tomorrow. And in the spirit of Expo, let us use the time we have together to connect minds and create an inclusive and sustainable future for all.""Held annually since 2008, ADSW is a global platform for accelerating global sustainable development. It brings together a unique fusion of world leaders, policymakers, industry specialists, technology pioneers, and the next generation of sustainability leaders. This 2022 edition is taking place from 15th-19th January.\l"

The survey, conducted among 3,400 in face-to-face interviews with Arab youth aged 18 to 24 in 50 cities in 17 states in the Middle East and North Africa region from June 6 to 30, 2021, was released to coincide with the COP26 in Glasgow.Sunil John, president, Mena, BCW and founder of Asda£ BCW, said: ""In 2008, during the inaugural Arab Youth Survey, just 11 per cent of youth surveyed felt climate change and the environment were the biggest challenges facing the world.""Fast forward 13 years, and climate change dominates the youth agenda, with 56 per cent saying they are concerned by the issues. This is an eye-opener for governments and private enterprises in the region on the urgent need to embrace positive climate action.""Technology can help overcome climate challenge""If we view the survey as a barometer of sentiment, it seems the aspiration of young Arabs is one of encouraging governments and businesses to take a strong stance on sustainability,"" he said.Youth in the GCC show far more faith in meeting climate change challenges using technology than their counterparts in the Levant and North Africa, who expect climate issues to be addressed by changing the way we live our lives.Confidence in government actionAround 43 per cent of survey respondents feel Arab governments should be doing more than other countries to address climate change, and therefore take a leading position on the world stage to address the important issues.Further, 37 per cent of youth think their governments have the same responsibility as others globally, and only 20 per cent say their government should be doing less than others.An overwhelming majority of 79 per cent of youth in the GCC strongly feel their government is capable of driving effective climate change mitigation measures, while in North Africa, 43 per cent of people feel their governments will be capable of dealing with climate change issues.ALSO READ:However, only 26 per cent of those surveyed in the Levant region believe their government is up to the task of dealing with climate change, showing wide disparities in the region.Further, in the GCC, some 44 per cent of respondents said Arab nations should be doing more than other nations. In North Africa, 39 per cent expect strong leadership action, compared to 45 per cent in the Levant - suggesting it is a regional imperative to show global leadership on climate issues.\l"

Paper and glass could be the next industries to face supply disruptions, they said.Producers of chemicals, dyes, furniture and soymeal have also been affected.Rationing has been carried out during peak hours in many parts of northeastern China since last week, and residents of cities, including Changchun, said power outages were occurring sooner and lasting longer, state media reported.On Monday, State Grid Corp pledged to ensure basic power supplies and avoid electricity cuts. Meanwhile, the National Energy Administration has told coal and natural gas firms to guarantee that sufficient energy supplies are maintained to keep homes warm during the coming winter.China has vowed to cut energy intensity - the amount of energy consumed per unit of economic growth - by around 3 percent in 2021 to meet its climate goals.Its focus on energy intensity and decarbonization is unlikely to abate, analysts said, ahead of COP26 climate talks, which will be held in November in Glasgow when world leaders will lay out their climate agendas.The fallout of the power shortage has prompted some analysts to downgrade their 2021 growth outlook.Morgan Stanley analysts said production cuts, if prolonged, could reduce China's GDP growth in the fourth quarter by 1 percentage point.Last week, major coal producers in China met to try and resolve shortages and curb price increases.China, the world's largest energy consumer and source of climate-warming greenhouse gases, has said it aims to bring carbon emissions to a peak by 2030 and then decl"

Meanwhile the year ended with discussions of the metaverse and what role mobile communications can play in making this vision of an immersive, inter-connected future a reality.In the current climate it feels more difficult than ever to make any predictions with a degree of certainty. Covid-19 and an ever-changing technological landscape make sure of that. But that doesn't stop us trying. Here are five things to look out for in 2022.5G adoption will rise but handset shortages will persistThe first prediction is hardly one that would have required the alleged skills of Nostradamus, but 5G coverage will continue to expand during 2022 and adoption will rise. Ericsson says there will be 600 million 5G subscribers by the end of the year, boosted by operator rollouts, strong demand in China and North America, and the availability of cheaper compatible handsets.However as has been repeatedly stated by various industry observers in recent years, 5G is the first generation of mobile infrastructure where network availability is more prevalent than handset adoption. Although the pandemic has had an inevitable impact on network construction, the global chip shortage is having longer-lasting effects.The smartphone market showed some signs of recovery in early 2021 but a lack of key components contributed to a decl"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE232","Why sustainable engineering is good business","December 22, 2021 Wednesday","ArabianBusiness.com","COP26 saw nations come together and make new environmental pledges, including a US-China agreement to boost cooperation in combating climate change, India's pledge to achieve net zero by 2070 and 23 countries committing to phasing out coal.However, we all know that it will take more than government pledges to keep the global temperature rise below 1.50 Celsius.Industry has a key role to play in fighting climate change, which is why we're seeing the prioritisation of environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals growing across all sectors, with many organisations making a pledge to achieve net zero by 2040.Investors now focus on sustainable outcomesThis is, of course, the right thing to do, but it's also becoming a business necessity as investors turn their back on investments that don't support sustainable outcomes. Investment and asset management firm BlackRock, for example, has made commitments to extend funding exclusively to companies that demonstrate progress against their specific ESG initiatives.Today, moving towards greener capital projects and operations isn't only to gain regulatory approval, it's also needed to secure access to funding. And investors aren't doing this out of the kindness of their heart. They understand that sustainable engineering and operations aren't just ethically commendable, they're good business, too.Sustainable engineering and operations offer financial gainsThere's a growing body of evidence pointing out that higher sustainability performance converts into a better financial performance. An impressive 90 percent of studies on the topic found that high ESG standards reduced companies' capital costs and that 80 percent show a positive correlation between stock price performance and good sustainability practices.One of the easiest ways to discover potential sustainability gains is through digital transformation.The latest technologies can help you design sustainable plants more quickly, and also build and run them more efficiently. According to Deloitte, digital transformation can provide a 5-10 percent reduction in build costs and a 10-20 percent reduction in operational costs.Digital transformation also benefits existing brownfield sites by enabling improved decision-making and real-time performance optimisation. Driving both efficiency and sustainability initiatives forward simultaneously, benefits can include reduced energy consumption, waste and emissions.This is achieved through the use of technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), process simulation, cloud computing, big data analytics and digital twins to operate assets sustainably by understanding their performance, and predicting future behavior.The insights provided can help reduce operational and maintenance costs by approximately 20 percent, dramatically reduce fuel costs by 28 percent, significantly improve asset safety, efficiency and reliability, and drive productivity, all by providing fast and accurate data about what is happening across the business.Sustainability is driving digital transformationTwo thirds of organisations believe the ability to share data sets across teams in real time will have the greatest impact on sustainability, while significant sustainability gains can also come from solutions such as data monitoring. Digital solutions like cloud computing, machine learning, AI, and digital twins will be needed to achieve these capabilities.Take multinational business Henkel, for example. The laundry and homecare giant used an energy monitoring system to analyse and lower energy use by 16 percent year-on-year, saving it EUR37 million to date and playing its part to shape a more sustainable future.Another example of digital transformation's effect on sustainability comes from Covestro, which used process simulation to improve the energy efficiency, and therefore sustainability, of its Germany-based brownfield sites.""Process simulation can directly determine the optimal energy efficient process by simulation-based optimisation. When comparing the optimal process with the actual energy consumption directly it reveals the inefficiencies of our processes and opportunities for improvement,"" said Christian Redepenning, Covestro's Global Technology Expert, at a recent AVEVA webinar on building a sustainable chemical industry.Then there's Aker Carbon Capture's implementation of a single engineering platform. This helped develop new sustainable processes such as carbon capture by breaking down data silos and increasing engineering and design efficiency. Using integrated engineering and project execution technologies on the cloud, Aker was able to improve collaboration between teams, resulting in increased engineering efficiency which allows them to deliver new carbon capture facilities 50 percent faster.David Phillips, head of UK and investor relations at Aker Carbon Capture.""Working in the cloud has meant that our people have been able to engage much more easily across projects and geographies and we've been able to optimise the way we work together,"" said David Phillips, head of UK and investor relations at Aker Carbon Capture.""As a company we're really focused on accelerating the uptake of carbon capture and to do that we need to reduce the cost of the process and end product we'll supply our customers. We've found digital transformation has helped us standardise our processes and improve efficiency and we've been able to reduce our engineering man hours dramatically.""Sustainability's good for businessAs organisations focus on sustainability and look for ways to accelerate their path to net zero, they're discovering more and more that sustainable engineering and operations isn't just good for the environment, but also for their bottom l"

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE236","Greening the hardest sectors is crucial","September 29, 2021 Wednesday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","ReutersWorld leaders are making increasingly ambitious commitments to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and limit the catastrophic effects of climate change. But to convert commitments into results, more must be done to decarbonise all sectors of the global economy rapidly.This process will be relatively easier for sectors like electricity and passenger cars, where clean-energy solutions are ready for deployment at scale. But it will be much more difficult for aviation, cement, shipping, steel, and other ""hard-to-abate"" sectors.Achieving net-zero emissions in these sectors requires the rapid commercialisation of technologies that are not yet quite ready for deployment at scale; and commercialisation, in turn, will require coordination across industries. Suppliers of products such as steel need to align with their customers, financial partners, policymakers, and other stakeholders to agree on a decarbonisation pathway for their industries.Such a consensus is necessary to ensure that everyone understands which technologies are progressing and at what pace. With that knowledge, everyone can align on the process of investing in low-carbon assets with long life cycles, such as steel mills, cement factories, ships, and airplanes. Achieving this level of alignment across global industries is not easy, but it can be done. Consider the shipping industry, which has already developed a global decarbonisation pathway under the leadership of the Global Maritime Forum's Getting to Zero Coalition. This four-step alignment process, enshrined in the Poseidon Principles, is now being replicated across other hard-to-abate sectors under the leadership of the Mission Possible Partnership.The MPP is a global coalition of industrial and climate leaders focused on supercharging efforts to decarbonise some of the world's highest-emitting industries in the next ten years. Its immediate priority this year is to shine a spotlight on the leading hard-to-abate sectors at the COP26 climate-change conference in Glasgow this November.While the previous United Nations climate-change conferences have focused primarily on national commitments and policymaking, additional mechanisms need to be activated to accelerate the pace of emissions reductions. Ambitious climate targets will not be within reach until the leaders of the industries that produce the most emissions have decarbonised their entire global supply chains. As my former colleague Paul Bodnar of BlackRock likes to say, ""The real economy is not a side show"". Elevating industry to the same level of importance as national governments is critical.A few key technologies will be essential to decarbonisation efforts across all hard-to-abate sectors. Chief among these is green hydrogen produced with renewable electricity and electrolysers. Efforts to scale up green hydrogen production are already underway with programs such as the Green Hydrogen Catapult and the US Department of Energy's recently announced Hydrogen Shot, which is modelled after the successful SunShot programme that rapidly brought down solar-panel costs. Moreover, there are early signs of rising industrial demand for the low-emissions products that green hydrogen enables. The automaker Volvo, for example, has announced that it will source fossil-fuel-free steel from the Swedish green-steel venture HYBRIT.Technologies to improve efficiency are another key (though less exciting) ingredient in decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors. Whether it means deploying lightweight aircraft or constructing buildings with less steel, the less energy an industry uses overall, the easier the process becomes. A recent analysis from the Energy Transitions Commission (ETC) shows that the first step to building a net-zero global economy by 2050 is simply to use less energy, followed by scaling up and universalising clean-energy sources.The ETC also highlights the importance of carbon capture and sequestration, which will be needed not only to offset industrial processes that cannot be fully decarbonised, but also to reduce the level of carbon dioxide already emitted into the atmosphere. Accounting for historic emissions is a complex process that most industrial leaders have yet to consider fully. But they had better start thinking about it now, because any realistic pathway to keep global warming within 1.5\'b0 Celsius of pre-industrial levels will have to include reducing atmospheric CO2.Not only do we need to remove massive quantities of CO2 from the atmosphere; we also must find long-term storage solutions to keep it locked away for hundreds or even thousands of years. This is where the gap between the net-zero objective and existing technologies is the largest.Who should bear the costs of tackling this problem? Certainly, many argue that the countries and companies responsible for the largest share of historic global emissions should assume a corresponding responsibility for CO2 removal. In an upcoming article, the World Economic Forum's Global Future Council on Net-Zero Transition will explore this issue and describe different approaches for how we might reach a consensus on responsibility for historic emissions.As we look towards COP26, we must pay ample attention to all these challenges. National governments and global industries alike need to act immediately to reduce emissions; merely committing to act in the future is no longer acceptable. The longer we fail to lock in more sustainable development pathways, the harder it will be to keep global temperatures at a safe level. Even if we do reduce annual emissions somewhat, it is the cumulative amount of CO2 in the atmosphere that matters. If that is still growing, the problem will not be solved.We need global leaders everywhere to understand the scale and urgency of the crisis we face. Radical collaboration and coordinated action are required right now, from everyone. It is not just future generations that are depending on us. So too are the tens of millions of people already suffering in terrible heatwaves, fires, floods, droughts, and storms. From California and Texas to entire regions of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, the catastrophic consequences of the climate crisis are compounding. While the costs of reducing emissions are significant, they are negligible compared to the costs of failing to do so.- Jules Kortenhorst is CEO of RMI.Click/tap here to subscribe to Khaleej Times news alerts on Telegram.\l"

Next week, world leaders will congregate in Glasgow for the COP26 summit, with mixed hopes among billions across the globe of what the event will eventually achieve in terms of global warming and climate change. But keeping with the event's aspirations, one aspect has already been decided: plant-based dishes will dominate the menu, with 80 per cent of the food seasonal and sourced in Scotland. Overall, 95 per cent of the food will be from the United Kingdom, focused on the idea that sustainability should be at the heart of catering for the summit, reducing emissions and promoting environment-friendly food production. Campaigners wanted a 100 per cent vegan menu to be served, but the fact that most of the dishes will be plant-based at such a high-profile international event is music to their ears.Each item will have an estimate of its carbon footprint, helping delegates make climate-friendly choices. Items will include Edinburgh's Mara Seaweed, which is abundant, sustainable, does not require fertiliser, fresh water or soil to grow, as well as Benzies carrots and potatoes that use wind turbines to power their cool storage, biomass to provide heating and actively recycle the water they use. Cups used to serve drinks will be reusable, washable 1,000 times; it is estimated that this approach will save up to 250,000 single-use cups. Says Alok Sharma, Cabinet minister in the Boris Johnson government and COP26 president: ""There will be a tremendous amount of work to be done at COP26, with many hours of negotiations and long days, so the choice of food that we serve our visiting delegations, staff and all our volunteers is very important. It is exciting to see such innovation in the menus that will be on offer and to understand the thought and effort that has gone into making dishes both healthy, sustainable and suitable for different diets and requirements. We very much look forward to giving our international visitors a flavour of the wide-ranging cuisine the UK has to offer.""This focus on a plant-based menu at the Glasgow summit seems inevitable given the growing momentum in Britain in recent years to switching to a vegan diet, which is a step further than a vegetarian diet, since it excludes dairy products ('vegan' was coined from the first three and last two letters of 'vegetarian' in 1944, when The Vegan Society was formed with just 25 members). According to the society, ""A vegan is someone who tries to live without exploiting animals, for the benefit of animals, people and the planet. Vegans eat a plant-based diet, with nothing coming from animals  no meat, milk, eggs or honey, for example."" The momentum is driven by philosophical, religious and other reasons, but mainly by widely-publicised scientific research that animal agriculture and animal products are disastrous for the planet, and that cutting out animal products from the diet is the single-most effective action an individual can take to help fight climate change.A vegan supply chainFrom the United Nations calling for a wider global uptake of plant-based diet in 2010, to a host of studies and mass awareness drives by campaign groups subsequently, veganism has gone mainstream, with superstores, restaurants as well as manufacturers of cosmetics, medicines, toiletries, fashion and textiles making it known that their food and goods are vegan, catering to a growing niche customer base. Coffee lovers can now enjoy a flat white with soy, oat, coconut or almond milk instead of whole milk, besides a large number of dishes that earlier used dairy products. Cadbury hit the headl"

It was only when they started to diversify their economies away from oil and engage in economic transformation, they raised prospects for sustainable growth.For instance, Saudi Arabia, following the launch of its national transformation programme Vision 2030, five years ago, increased investment and government resources into putting the country on a more environmentally sustainable footing.However, a surge of new net zero pledges from the Middle East's oil producing nations, last month, has raised expectations ahead of the United Nations COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow starting October 31.MEGA PLANSThe world's top oil exporter Saudi Arabia announced late last month that it would aim to reach net zero emissions by 2060 by investing more than $186 billion into a green economy over that time - or roughly one to two years' worth of its current oil revenue, reported Reuters.Saudi Arabia estimated that revenue at SR412 billion ($110 billion) in 2020, and expects to rake in SR770 billion ($205 billion) this year as oil price recover.Bahrain made the same net zero commitment, just days after the United Arab Emirates said it would hit that target by 2050 and invest $163 billion in renewable energy.The three nations - along with fellow crude exporters Qatar and Kuwait - are among the world's top 10 carbon dioxide emitters per capita, according to the World Bank.In his speech at the Middle East Green Initiative Summit, His Royal Highness Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman said the kingdom, which is the world's top oil exporter, would contribute 15 per cent of the funds and would work with other states and development funds on the funding and execution of the initiatives.""As part of the kingdom's leading role in developing energy markets, it will work to establish an investment fund for carbon circular economy solutions in the region and an initiative to offer clean energy solutions to help feed more than 750 million people worldwide,"" he said.When plans for the Middle East Green Initiative were first announced in March, the prince said it aimed to reduce carbon emissions in the region's hydrocarbon industry by 60 per cent and reverse desertification in one of world's most water-stressed regions by planting billions of trees.No investment figure was provided for the Middle East Green Initiative. Saudi Arabia has said its own Saudi Green Initiative programme would involve investments of over SR700 billion ($190 billion) by 2030.In his speech, Crown Prince Mohammed said the kingdom would work to establish a regional early storm warning center.He also announced that a regional center for climate change would be established, a regional center for carbon capture and storage would be developed and the establishment of a regional center for the sustainable development of fisheries and a regional cloud seeding program as well as the establishment of the ""Green Initiative Foundation,"" a non-profit organization to support the summit's work in the future.Last March, Saudi Arabia announced the launch of the Green Saudi Arabia and Green Middle East initiatives to improve the quality of life by increasing reliance on clean energy, neutralising the effects of oil and protecting the environment.Notably, these initiatives aim to plant 50 billion trees in the region and reduce carbon emissions by more than 10 per cent of global contributions.Emissions are mostly produced by burning fossil fuels and achieving net zero means a country emits no more greenhouse gases than it can capture or absorb.Saudi Arabia would help create the necessary infrastructure by working to establish a regional carbon capture and storage centre, a regional early storm warning centre, a regional cloud seeding programme and a hub for climate change, Crown Prince Mohammed said.Wealthy Gulf Opec members like Saudi Arabia and the UAE are investing in renewable and clean energy while also stressing the continued importance of hydrocarbons for global energy security at a time of growing calls for a shift away from fossil fuels.Gulf states, whose economies still rely heavily on oil income, have also increased focus on food security in a region heavily reliant on imports. \l"

The forum convened governments, companies, financial actors, and non-state leaders to raise ambition on forests and land use in a way that delivers for the climate, people, economic development, and biodiversity.Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, Minister of Climate Change and Environment, said: ""When forests are lost and land is degraded, we are at a risk of losing the countless services these vital ecosystems offer, such as providing critical habitats for biodiversity and acting as natural carbon sinks to regulate climate at the forefront. We believe in the multilateral process as key to solving global challenges. Therefore, the UAE has endorsed the Glasgow Leaders' Declaration on Forests and Land Use, and will work with other like-minded nations to end and reverse forest loss and land degradation worldwide. We urge all leaders to join forces in the global transition to sustainable land use.""In the fight against land degradation, the UAE reinforces its blue carbon ecosystems \- coastal vegetation such as mangrove forests, saltmarshes, and seagrass meadows. Mangrove forests serve as powerful carbon sinks that sequester CO2 and enhance environmental resilience, thus offering considerable climate change mitigation and adaption benefits as well as providing critical habitats for biodiversity.To expand its blue carbon ecosystems, the country has committed to planting 30 million mangroves by 2030 in its second Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC).The UAE has rolled out the National Blue Carbon Project that aims to enhance understanding about carbon storage and other services provided by the coastal ecosystems in the country. The project provides options for integrating these learnings into policy and management, leading to the sustainable use of these ecosystems and their services, and their preservation for future generations.The UAE is employing modern technologies and innovative solutions in its efforts to combat land degradation, including leveraging drones to map agricultural areas and sow tree seeds to reduce sand encroachment. Drones have helped disperse 6 million acacia seeds and 250,000 ghaf seeds across 25 sites nationwide.In addition, the UAE is leveraging highly innovative drone planting technology to sow mangrove seeds. This goal is supported by the ambitious Plantation Rehabilitation Program that involves the rehabilitation of all types of plants, especially rare species and those on the brink of extinction.The country is currently establishing the Abu Dhabi Plant Genetic Resources Centre (Gene Bank) that will be the largest in the region with a capacity to store 20,000 samples once completed in 2022. The facility aims to preserve plant biological diversity in the UAE and the wider region, and to help reproduce it in nature.Recognizing that protected areas play a key role in conserving endangered species and their habitats, the UAE has 49 protected areas that account for 15.5 percent of the country's territory.To guide the country's efforts to protect and restore its natural environment, the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE) is updating the National Strategy to Combat Desertification that focuses on preserving ecosystems and mitigating the effects of desertification.To boost community participation in the government's drive to protect and restore the natural habitats of indigenous flora, MOCCAE launched the Gheras app, offering the public access to a complete database of local plant species and ways to care for them.The Ministry is also working on the UAE Smart Map of Natural Capital using remote sensing that will inform policies and decision-making on land use, investment, and business improvement in l"

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE248","The IMF's misstep on climate finance","December 15, 2021 Wednesday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) seems determined to dilute one of the best examples of global cooperation in response to the economic disruptions induced by the Covid-19 pandemic and climate change. It must change course now, before it is too late.The IMF's allocation of $650 billion in special drawing rights (SDRs, the Fund's reserve asset) in August was long encouraged and widely welcomed. Given the IMF's tight rules, it was clear from the start that the vast majority of SDRs would go to countries that did not need them.As a result, G7 leaders pledged to re-channel upwards of $100 billion of their allocations to ""countries most in need of pandemic [support to] stabilise their economies, and mount a green and global recovery  aligned with shared development and climate goals"".While these moves seem small compared to the $17 trillion that rich countries have spent to support their economies during the pandemic, they were nonetheless significant. In October, just two months after the allocation, the G20 backed a plan by the IMF and the World Bank to develop and implement a Resilience and Sustainability Trust, which would allow wealthy countries to channel their allotments to low- and middle-income countries vulnerable to economic shocks. Because the RST could be used to address risks related to climate change, it would fill a glaring gap in international finance. The IMF announced that it would have a proposal ready for its 2022 spring meetings.But will it be enough?Extreme weather events like floods and hurricanes can trigger financial instability in vulnerable countries as they wipe out capital stock and sources of foreign exchange. Likewise, countries dependent on fossil-fuel exports face fiscal uncertainty as demand for oil and gas decreases to meet climate goals. In both cases, spillover effects can negatively affect trade.Countries confronting such conditions must undertake a structural transformation of their economies. But many low- and middle-income countries lack access to the cost-effective, flexible financing they need.A well-designed RST would make the IMF criteria for resource allocation and country eligibility more adaptable. Unfortunately, five design flaws in the IMF's approach would render the planned RST ineffective for most climate-vulnerable countries.The first flaw concerns eligibility. IMF programmes discriminate on the basis of income, but climate change does not. While the G20 explicitly called for the establishment of an RST covering low-income and climate-vulnerable middle-income countries, the IMF has adopted a narrow interpretation according to which middle-income countries would be eligible only if they do not exceed a certain income threshold.But traditional measures of income are a poor criterion for determining eligibility. The IMF must adjust its thinking to actual circumstances and ensure that eligibility is based on climate vulnerability. It should not be controversial to integrate into the criteria simple measures such as susceptibility to physical climate risks like floods, droughts, and hurricanes, or economic factors like the share of fossil-fuel exports in total foreign-exchange earnings.Second, there is a problem with the terms and accessibility of the funds. Developing countries lack the fiscal space to mobilize domestic resources to address the structural changes their economies need. Many also lack access to external resources on reasonable borrowing terms.But the IMF is proposing that RST users be charged the SDR interest rate (currently five basis points and on the rise) plus a margin of up to 100 basis points. These rates are not very different from what the Fund currently charges middle-income countries. More problematic is the access limits, which would be 100 per cent of quota, or less than the SDR equivalent of $1 billion. These guidel"

They are a cleverer version of the timer switches homeowners used to use to turn lamps or radios on and off in a bid to convince would-be burglars there was someone at home.Thanks to rising household bills and the focus on climate issues with the recent Cop26 summit in Glasgow, Scotland, energy consumption is at the front of our minds, right now. And this is where smart plugs can help.There's much more to them than disguising the fact your home is temporarily unoccupied. Many smart plugs also offer a way to keep tabs on how long electricity-hungry appliances are switched on for and just how much they're costing you.If you're certain you want to get your hands on the best smart plugs now, rather than read on to find out if they can save energy, then check out these great deals for some of the best on the market. So, can smart plugs save energy? The simple answer is yes \- indirectly, many models can make you more aware of the energy you're using, how much it's costing you and where you could be saving money. Smart plugs from brands such as Eve Energy and TP-Link will monitor how much energy the appliance connected to them is using.Some even let you input your electricity supplier's prices, so when you open the app you can see in black-and-white just how much running that appliance is costing. For some of us, this may be enough to make us more conscious of switching these devices off when you're not using them.Keeping track of how much energy we use isn't the only way they can help. You are probably aware that keeping devices on standby accounts for a chunk of totally unnecessary energy use. By having items such as your TV, set-top box, and games console on standby, or charging your laptop and tablet all the time they're not in use, you're continuously using electricity. In fact, the Energy Saving Trust believes the average UK home wastes \£335 ( around $50 / AU$65) per year through appliances left on standby.However, for many of us these appliances, home entertainment equipment in particular, may not be easy to switch on and off at the wall socket regularly. However, a smart plug ensures you can use your smartphone, rather than fiddling about behind furniture trying to find the switch.If you're forgetful and prone to leaving the house with appliances still switched on, whether that's a steam iron, hair straighteners, or even the coffee maker, plugging it in via a smart plug will ensure that it doesn't need to be left on all day, wasting energy. Nor does it require you to make yourself late by returning home simply to switch it off. Instead, you'll be able to use your smartphone to turn the appliance off, even if you're not at home. It's safer too.What is a smart plug, and how it can stop your fear of leaving the coffee maker on?Do smart plugs slow down Wi-Fi, and why this shouldn't stop you from investing in one Find out if Matter will put an end to laggy smart home devices(Image credit: TP-Link) Setting schedules can help tooMany of the smart plugs on the market have the ability to create schedules when they should be switched on or off, while others feature a sleep timer that can automatically turn off after a set duration has passed. If you know you tend to nod off when watching late-night TV, activating the sleep timer can ensure it's not blasting away while you're enjoying 40 winks.If you have an energy tariff that offers cheaper electricity at night rather than during the day, you can also use a smart plug to set the tumble dryer to turn on and off between these times, rather than having to wake up and set it going. This ensures you're keeping costs as low as they can be, while still doing your bit for the environment.Check out the best smart home device deals Future Publishing Limited Quay House, The Ambury, Bath BA1 1UA.\l"

The Secretary-General warned of the threat posed by the ""global vaccine gap"" as the coronavirus mutates.""Pledges of doses and funds are welcome \- but they are not enough,"" he said. ""We need at least eleven billion doses to vaccinate 70 percent of the world and end this pandemic."" The UN chief repeated his call for a Global Vaccine Plan that would double production and ensure equitable distribution of doses through the COVAX solidarity mechanism.Finance Ministers and Central Bank chiefs were also urged to support a new $50 billion investment roadmap, announced last month and to be led by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), aimed at ending the pandemic and driving a fast recovery.As many developing countries are ""teetering on the verge of debt default"", the Secretary-General encouraged the G20 to channel unused Special Drawing Rights, a type of foreign reserve asset developed by the IMF, to the Fund's new resilience and sustainability plan for these nations.""Special Drawing Rights also need to be considered as additional funding, not deducted from Official Development Assistance,"" he added.With the world still struggling to keep global temperature rise to the 1.5 degree target under the Paris Agreement, the UN chief stressed the need for action to reduce emissions as the latest UN climate change conference, known as COP26, draws closer.""If COP26""Developing countries also need reassurance that their ambition will be met with financial and technical support,"" he added.The Secretary-General recalled the commitment richer countries made more than a decade ago to mobilize $100 billion annually for action towards climate mitigation and adaption in developing countries. However, this agreement has not been kept.""A clear plan to fulfil this pledge is not just about the economics of climate change; it is about establishing trust in the multilateral system,"" he said.Developing countries will also need help in transitioning from fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, to renewable energy sources, he continued. Here, support from development banks will be essential, he said, but now large scale private financing is also available through a global alliance of more than 160 financial firms committed to the net-zero goal.""To reinforce these efforts, the G20 must set ambitious, clear and credible climate policies, and ensure the private sector has the framework it needs through mandatory climate-related financial disclosures,"" he said, adding ""and we need all financiers to commit to no new international funding for coal, by the end of 2021.""\l"

Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, said: ""We are pleased and honored by the UNFCCC decision to select the United Arab Emirates to host the UN Climate Change Conference in 2023 and commit ourselves as a nation to supporting the entire international community in accelerating our combined efforts to overcome the very real threat of climate change.""The founding father of the UAE had the highest regard for the environment, and it is his legacy which has inspired the progress we have made over the past 50 years to diversify our economy \- and will continue to inspire us as we strive to safeguard the well-being of present and future generations.""COP28 in 2023 will and must be a 'solutions COP' \- and I am confident that the rich experience of this young, inclusive nation in advancing practical, viable and shareable solutions to the world's most pressing challenges will again come to the fore as we host the world for the UN Climate Change Conference in two years' time.""The UAE Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative, announced earlier this year, shows our own unwavering commitment to promoting climate action. Further, through new investment commitments and partnerships, we are illustrating our determination to support the world in addressing climate change.""We look forward to welcoming the world at COP28. The voice of every nation and stakeholder will be heard, ensuring that, together, we not only help mitigate the effects of global warming, but also unlock new opportunities to realize greater prosperity and a better life for future generations."" A holistic approach for economic progress Dr Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, UAE Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and Special Envoy for Climate Change, said the decision to host COP28 in the UAE is a direct result of the vision of its leadership and the commitment of its founding father, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan to sustainable development. He added that the decision is a direct reflection of the nation's decades long commitment to progressive climate action.He said: "" We very much look forward to the opportunity of uniting the world in an effort to raise ambitions for climate action and to advance progress for humanity. COP 28 will be a crucial global stock-take, measuring how far we have come, and how far we still need to go, to fulfill the Paris Agreement. Our guiding principle for COP 28 will be inclusivity. We want to reflect the views and invite the contribution of both developed and developing countries, the public and private sectors, academics and civil society. The UAE adopts this approach, because we truly believe that partnership promotes progress.""Highlighting the UAE focus on promoting an inclusive approach, Dr Al Jaber added: ""In this spirit, everyone will have a seat at the table. Developed countries alongside developing nation, the public alongside the private sector, scientists alongside civil society and also. importantly the voices of youth. It is together that we will succeed.""Dr Al Jaber congratulated the Arab Republic of Egypt for being announced as host of the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties, highlighting that the UAE will cooperate with partners everywhere to identify lessons learned in order to achieve effective results. He added that the UAE will work to ensure that all segments of society are part of this great effort to allow humanity to change course to a better future; extending an open invitation to the world to advance real climate action through inclusion, transparency and responsibility.Turning challenges into opportunities Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, UAE Minister of Climate Change and Environment, said: ""At a time of rapidly rising climate risks that threaten all countries, we welcome the responsibility of hosting COP28, and are determined to support the international community in pursuing a practical agenda that focuses on implementation, ambition, opportunities and transformation.""She added: ""Due to our wise leadership's vision and foresight, the UAE has become an internationally acclaimed driver of collective climate action. In 2023, world leaders will convene to tackle climate change on a global scale \- and where better to do so than the United Arab Emirates, the home of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and a country that has a strong track record in hosting high-profile international events.""At COP28, we will address the planetary and economic aftermath of climate change as two sides of the same coin, exploring solutions that put us on a path towards limiting global warming to 1.5 C and are economically viable at the same time. We are keen to share our successful approach of turning challenges into opportunities to leave a healthier planet to our children.""""We firmly believe in young people's right to have a say in shaping their future, and are dedicated to supporting the highest levels of youth participation in delegations and formal proceedings at COP28.""Path-breaking initiatives at COP-26At COP26The UAE has pledged US$1 billion of increased investment as part of this initiative, which aims to increase and accelerate agricultural and food systems innovation in support of climate action. AIM for Climate is focused on leveraging high-potential economic returns and job creation from innovation investment in a sector that employs over 2 billion people and feeds the world's growing population.The UAE also joined the Global Methane Pledge building on its position as one of the least methane intense nations in the world. The nation will share its capabilities and experience in best-in-class methane performance with signatories to the EU-US led initiative that aims to cut global methane emissions by 30 per cent by the end of the decade. The UAE has long acted as a regional leader in methane reduction.Over five decades, the country has successfully reduced the volume of natural gas flared in the domestic energy sector by more than 90 per cent. In turn, the UAE's hydrocarbon industry today holds one of the world's lowest methane intensities of 0.01 per cent. The UAE will build on this foundation of ultra-low methane intensity in the energy sector to further improve its methane performance.Further, IRENA and the UAE announced the Energy Transition Accelerator Financing (ETAF) Platform, a new global climate finance facility to accelerate the transition to renewable energy in developing countries. The UAE committed US$400 million in funding provided by the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD) toward the platform's goal of securing a minimum of US$1 billion in total funding.The UAE, represented by the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure (MOEI) also announced the Hydrogen Leadership Roadmap, a comprehensive national blueprint to support domestic, low-carbon industries, contribute to the country's net-zero ambition and establish the country as a competitive exporter of hydrogen.The Hydrogen Leadership Roadmap comprises three core objectives: unlocking new sources of value creation through exports of low carbon hydrogen, derivatives and products to key importing regions, fostering new hydrogen derivative opportunities through low-carbon steel, sustainable kerosene as well as other priority UAE industries and contributing to the UAE's 2050 net zero commitments.Moreover, the UAE has raised the mangrove-planting target in its second Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement from 30 million to 100 million by 2030. The move consolidates the nation's position as a global leader in nature-based climate change solutions, and will expand local mangrove forests to cover 483 square kilometers, sequestering nearly 115,000 tons of CO2 per year.A testament to the UAE's 30 years of positive climate action The road to COP 28 is a testament to the positive climate action initiated by the UAE for over three decades. The UAE was the first country in the Middle East & North Africa to ratify the Paris Agreement and commit to lowering its carbon emissions. It was also a pioneer in setting the region's first renewable energy and biodiversity conservation targets to match its climate ambitions.Among many sustainability achievements, the UAE has brought the cost of solar energy below that of all other electricity sources and built one of the world's first large-scale carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) facilities. It has invested close to US$17 billion in solar, wind and battery storage projects across six continents worldwide, including in 27 climate-vulnerable island nations.The Barakah Nuclear Power Plant, which started commercial operations in April this year, will eliminate almost a quarter of the greenhouse gas emissions of the UAE's power sector once its four reactors are operational. The UAE was the first country in the Middle East & North Africa to announce a Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative \- a national drive to make the country carbon-neutral by mid-century.Following the Strategic Initiative's launch, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) vowed to decarbonise its electrical grid at scale, starting January 2022. This bold move makes ADNOC the first oil & gas company to source up to 100 per cent of its grid power requirements from solar and nuclear energy.The UAE's long history of commitment to climate change started in 1989 when it first ratified the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone layer. Since then, it has joined the UNFCCC (1995) and ratified the Kyoto Protocol (2005). Two years ago, the UAE hosted the Abu Dhabi Climate Meeting, attended by the United Nations Secretary-General Ant?nio Guterres.\l"

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE254","Where are the green sovereign funds?","August 9, 2021 Monday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","ReutersInstitutional investors are increasingly embracing the effort to achieve net-zero greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. Some are already implementing portfolio measures and incorporating climate factors into their decision-making. The United Nations-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (which one of us chairs) has already welcomed 46 members, comprising pension funds and insurance companies representing some $6.7 trillion in assets under management (AUM).The steps taken this decade will be decisive as regards hitting the mid-century target. Of the Alliance's members, 23 have publicly issued GHG-reduction targets for 2025, which means they are committed to acting immediately. The remaining five members that are required to set targets this year will declare similar interim goals soon. Net-zero initiatives are also being established in the investment-management and banking industries, representing $43 trillion and $37 trillion in AUM, respectively. And yet, sovereign wealth funds (SWFs)  representing AUM totalling around $10 trillion  are conspicuously absent, even though some are owned by governments that have adopted ambitious climate objectives.Under existing international agreements, GHG emissions are measured at the country level, which understates the potential climate impact of countries with large foreign-asset holdings. For example, the Norwegian SWF's total asset holdings are three times the size of Norway's economy, and its equity-portfolio carbon emissions are around twice the country's own total emissions.Norway is not alone. A recent report by the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds (IFSWF) shows that SWFs around the world are lagging behind. About three-quarters report having less than 10 per cent of their holdings in climate-related strategies, while only 14 per cent have made divestment decisions related to climate or environmental targets. While 24 per cent of SWFs consider climate action part of a broader ESG (environmental, social, and governance) framework, only 12 per cent have an explicit climate-change policy.To be sure, IFSWF's own Generally Accepted Principles and Practices (the ""Santiago Principles"") do not specify sustainability requirements for SWFs. But governments of countries that have SWFs should view the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (COP26) in November as an opportunity to commit fully to the net-zero programme.There are several reasons why they should do this. For starters, 2050 net-zero targets are becoming a mainstream expectation for all large institutional investors. If a government chooses not to commit its SWF to this goal, it will be free riding on the growing share of the private financial sector that is already going green  a paradox of climate finance if there ever was one. The domestic focus of international climate agreements should not be interpreted as a free pass for emissions associated with foreign investments. Instead, governments should be using their SWFs' financial weight to drive climate action internationally. Last but not least, the transition to a low-carbon economy represents the biggest investment opportunity in decades. Shifting from ""brown"" to ""green"" will require changes on the scale of another industrial revolution; those who create new markets or enter them early stand to reap massive returns.As one of the few SWFs with an explicit emissions-reduction objective, the New Zealand Superannuation Fund has already begun to seize these new opportunities. Between 2017 and 2020, the fund's low-carbon benchmark portfolio, which comprises 40 per cent of its total assets, generated returns that were 0.6 per cent higher than its standard benchmark portfolio. By contrast, Norway's SWF missed out on $126 billion in potential returns during the same period, because it invested in oil and gas instead of green stocks.Because many countries with SWFs have historically been heavily dependent on their oil and gas sector, the transition away from fossil fuels exposes them to larger economic risks. But governments can mitigate these risks by aligning their SWFs with climate targets. Countries like France, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, and Singapore are well placed to lead a global SWF movement towards net-zero commitments at COP26. If they do, other funds with large investment teams and sophisticated operations may soon follow, and those with fewer resources would, one hopes, be close behind them.Most SWFs were established as savings vehicles for future generations. It stands to reason that these funds should contribute to the conservation of the climate on which those generations will depend.

The Global Manufacturing and Industrialisation Summit (GMIS) Week today heard how the two nations have a thought leadership role to play in helping the global manufacturing, aerospace, and construction sectors decarbonise by leveraging Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies and developing innovation ecosystems.Following the 26th UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow earlier this month, around 90% of the world economy is now covered by a 2050 net-zero commitment, Simon Penney, UK Trade Commissioner for the Middle East and UK Consul General in Dubai, told the audience at the UAE-UK Conference during the GMIS Week. But net-zero goals ""will not be met unless government and industry work together,"" he said.Ahmed Ali Al Sayegh, UAE Minister of State and UAE Co-Chair of the UAE-UK Business Council, said: ""Manufacturing, engineering, and construction will need to change if we are to achieve 2050 net-zero goals. With the construction sector contributing nearly 40% of global energy-related emissions, retrofitting existing buildings and developing greener and more efficient buildings will be an important factor in keeping global warming below 1.5 C."" He added: ""I hope that today's discussion will lead to new partnerships between the UK and UAE in delivering the transformation of the manufacturing, aerospace, and construction sectors as we begin our journey to net zero."" During an opening address, Lord Udny-Lister, UK Co-Chair of the UAE-UK Business Council, said: ""We are going through a transformation of the industrial sector. Manufacturing is a key driver of the UK economy, representing half of our exports and contributing nearly US$200 billion to the economy. But many of the sectors depend on carbon-intensive processes, and collectively they represent around 12% of the UK's direct greenhouse emissions. Reaching net zero by 2050 will require much more fundamental change."" Referring to the UAE's recent US$10 billion investment in the UK, he noted that the Gulf country's investors are playing ""an increasingly important role"" in pursuing the UK's decarbonisation objective.At the conference's first session, dedicated to advanced manufacturing, Hussain Al Mahmoudi, CEO of Sharjah Research, Technology & Innovation (SRTI) Park, said: ""Governments have a big role in incentivising the private sector to adopt technologies related to additive manufacturing. The private sector doesn't want to disrupt its operations and spend money on things they don't necessarily understand. The role of the government is to raise awareness of these technologies and raise skills. Through collaboration with the UK, we can accelerate the deployment of these machines."" But new technologies and techniques need to be supported by a skilled workforce. The manufacturing sector is currently facing a significant skills shortage.In a panel discussion called 'Addressing the Skills Gap in Manufacturing', Jan Ward, CEO of Corrotherm, noted that net-zero targets in industry cannot be achieved without the constant development of skills, and stressed the need for governments to support this priority.Ali Al Marzouqi, Acting Deputy Director General of Abu Dhabi Centre for Technical and Vocational Education and Training (ACTVET) and President of EmiratesSkills, said the UAE is attracting the young generation to the manufacturing sector by ""making it exciting"". ""This is the new way, and I advise other countries to follow it. In the UAE, the interest has increased dramatically."" During a session on 'Decarbonisation of Aerospace', Mariam Al Qubaisi, Head of Sustainability & Business Excellence at Etihad Aviation Group, said: ""The lowest-hanging fruit is carbon credits."" Ana Haurie, Co-Founder and CEO or Respira, echoed her comments: ""We need to support nature because it's available to use right now. Technology will take time.""Mansoor Janahi, Deputy Group CEO of Sanad, added: ""There must be an incentive for decarbonisation. Becoming carbon-neutral will come at a cost, so there has to be a concerted effort. There has to be an offset."" In the 'Decarbonisation of Construction and Infrastructure' panel, the group of experts discussed the need for collaboration between governments, academia, and the private sector to reduce the carbon footprint of the built environment, which contributes some 39% of total global emissions. One of the key areas to address is retrofitting existing building stock, according to Jonathan Holyoak, Policy and Net Zero Programme Director at Atkins, who demanded ""meaningful regulation, not just targets"" from policymakers.Rob Jackson, Chief Growth Officer at Asite, said: ""Of the 39%, almost 75% comes from existing buildings and 25% is from the construction itself. How do we drive efficiency into that existing building stock? Technologies such as digital twins can support that."" He added: ""It would be great if all countries could adopt international standards. One of the key areas of collaboration between the UK and UAE is to establish common standards. That would help to inform investors and de-risk investments."" The GMIS Week included the two-day #GMIS2021 Summit on 22-23 November, The Green Chain Conference and The Global Prosperity Conference on 24 November, and country-focused conferences in partnership with the UK, Australia, and Italy.

Yet a major barrier stands in the way: The world's financial system actually impedes the flow of finance to developing countries, creating a financial death trap for many.Economic development depends on investments in three main kinds of capital: human capital (health and education), infrastructure (power, digital, transport, and urban), and businesses. Poorer countries have lower levels per person of each kind of capital and, therefore, also have the potential to grow rapidly by investing in a balanced way across them. These days, that growth can and should be green and digital, avoiding the high-pollution growth of the past.Global bond markets and banking systems should provide sufficient funds for the high-growth ""catch-up"" phase of sustainable development, yet this doesn't happen. The flow of funds from global bond markets and banks to developing countries remains small, costly to the borrowers, and unstable. Developing-country borrowers pay interest charges that are often 5-10 per cent higher per year than the borrowing costs paid by rich countries.Developing country borrowers as a group are regarded as high risk. The bond rating agencies assign lower ratings by mechanical formula to countries just because they are poor. Yet these perceived high risks are exaggerated, and often become a self-fulfilling prophecy.When a government floats bonds to finance public investments, it generally counts on the ability to refinance some or all of the bonds as they fall due, provided that the long-term trajectory of its debt relative to government revenues is acceptable. If the government suddenly finds itself unable to refinance the debts falling due, it likely will be pushed into default \- not out of bad faith or because of long-term insolvency, but for lack of cash on hand.This is what happens to far too many developing-country governments. International lenders (or rating agencies) come to believe, often for an arbitrary reason, that Country X has become uncreditworthy. This perception results in a ""sudden stop"" of new lending to the government. Without access to refinancing, the government is forced into a default, thus ""justifying"" the preceding fears. The government then usually turns to the International Monetary Fund for emergency financing. The restoration of the government's global financial reputation typically takes years or even decades.Rich-country governments that borrow internationally in their own currencies do not face the same risk of a sudden stop, because their own central banks act as lenders of last resort. Lending to the United States government is considered safe in no small part because the Federal Reserve can buy Treasury bonds in the open market, ensuring in effect that the government can roll over debts falling due.The same is true for eurozone countries, assuming that the European Central Bank acts as the lender of last resort. When the ECB briefly failed to play that role in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, several eurozone countries (including Greece, Ireland, and Portugal) temporarily lost access to international capital markets. After that debacle \- a near-death experience for the eurozone \- the ECB stepped up its lender-of-last-resort function, engaged in quantitative easing through massive purchases of eurozone bonds, and thereby eased borrowing conditions for the affected countries.Rich countries thus generally borrow in their own currencies, at low cost, and with little risk of illiquidity, except at moments of exceptional policy mismanagement (such as by the US government in 2008, and by the ECB soon thereafter). Low- and lower-middle-income countries, by contrast, borrow in foreign currencies (mainly dollars and euros), pay exceptionally high interest rates, and suffer sudden stops.For example, Ghana's debt-to-GDP ratio (83.5 per cent) is far lower than Greece's (206.7 per cent) or Portugal's (130.8 per cent), yet Moody's rates the creditworthiness of Ghana's government bonds at B3, several notches below those of Greece (Ba3) and Portugal (Baa2). Ghana pays around 9 per cent on 10-year borrowing, whereas Greece and Portugal pay just 1.3 per cent and 0.4 per cent, respectively.The major credit-rating agencies (Fitch, Moody's, and S&P Global) assign investment-grade ratings to most rich countries and to many upper-middle-income countries, but assign sub-investment-grade ratings to nearly all lower-middle-income countries and to all low-income countries. Moody's, for example, currently assigns an investment grade to just two lower-middle-income countries (Indonesia and the Philippines).Trillions of dollars in pension, insurance, bank, and other investment funds are channeled by law, regulation, or internal practice away from sub-investment-grade securities. Once lost, an investment-grade sovereign rating is extremely hard to recover unless the government enjoys the backing of a major central bank. During the 2010s, 20 governments \- including Barbados, Brazil, Greece, Tunisia, and Turkey \- were downgraded to below-investment grade. Out of the five that have since recovered their investment-grade rating, four are in the EU (Hungary, Ireland, Portugal, and Slovenia), and none are in Latin America, Africa, or Asia (the fifth is Russia).An overhaul of the global financial system is, therefore, urgent and long overdue. Developing countries with good growth prospects and vital development needs should be able to borrow reliably on decent market terms. To this end, the G20 and the IMF should devise a new and improved credit-rating system that accounts for each country's growth prospects and long-term debt sustainability. Banking regulations, such as those of the Bank for International Settlements, should then be revised according to the improved credit-rating system to facilitate more bank lending to developing countries.To help end the sudden stops, the G20 and the IMF should use their financial firepower to support a liquid secondary market in developing-country sovereign bonds. The Fed, ECB, and other key central banks should establish currency swap l"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE260","America's big oil problem puts climate goals on slippery path","September 8, 2021 Wednesday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","ReutersThe latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is unambiguous. Humanity has already emitted enough greenhouse gases to raise the atmospheric temperature by at least 1.5\'b0 Celsius above pre-industrial levels. This will cause extreme and irreversible climate change over the next two decades.There is still time to prevent catastrophic global warming, but it will require reducing carbon dioxide emissions 80 per cent by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2050. And while United Nations Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres has called the latest report a ""code red for humanity"", an effective response remains far from guaranteed.As it stands, the UN's annual Emissions Gap Report 2020 shows that the rich OECD countries are not reducing their emissions fast enough, and developing economies are on track to continue increasing theirs. In advance of November's UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, world leaders are rushing to agree on more ambitious emissions-reduction goals  so-called nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Recognition of the need for climate action has never been stronger.Nonetheless, the plans under consideration remain grossly inadequate, and the political will needed to change that is sorely missing. This ""gap between rhetoric and action,"" the International Energy Agency (IEA) warns, ""needs to close if we are to have a fighting chance of reaching net zero by 2050 and limiting the rise in global temperatures to 1.5\'b0C"". Success will require ""nothing short of a total transformation of the energy systems that underpin our economies"".The IEA has proposed a roadmap for getting the global energy sector to net-zero emissions by 2050. The IPCC report also charts several pathways to creating a net-zero world. Unfortunately, the world's largest historical emitter, the United States, is not following any of them.Consider the $1 trillion infrastructure bill that the US Senate just passed. It was supposed to include a number of climate-related provisions, such as creating a clean electricity standard, funding zero-emissions public transit, building a national electric-vehicle charging infrastructure, and establishing a Civilian Climate Corps. But over months of contentious negotiations, those provisions were largely removed, resulting in a policy that, if passed in the House, would support outmoded fossil-fuel energy and transportation systems.Senate Democrats are hoping to make up for this loss with a $3.5 trillion budget plan, which would support climate action and significantly expand the social safety net. But the bill itself has yet to be written; that is a job for congressional committees. And many elements of it  particularly with regard to climate  are likely to be lost or watered down as it works its way through each committee.This does not bode well for US Democrats, who rely on the electoral support of younger voters, for whom climate change is a high priority. If Democrats lose power  say, in next year's midterm elections  the chances that the US will take effective action to protect the planet will be further diminished. Even now, pressure from the fossil-fuel industry lobby and from Republicans is so strong that US President Joe Biden's administration has not only failed to curb petroleum production on public and tribal lands, but has approved over 2,100 drilling permits.Americans want stronger climate policies. In one recent poll, 53 per cent of registered voters said that global warming should be a high or very high priority for the government, and 66 per cent said that developing sources of clean energy should be a high or very high priority. Another poll showed that roughly two-thirds of likely voters  including almost half of Republicans  think oil and gas companies have too much power.They are right. For decades, the oil industry has produced manipulative studies and funded major marketing campaigns to convince the public that oil and ""natural"" gas were essential for economic growth and not harmful to the planet. It has also spent liberally to influence lawmakers at the national and state levels, including in California, a climate leader, thereby blocking climate-related legislation and policies.US lawmakers must start listening to voters, escape the grip of oil and gas lobbyists, and enact policies that recognise the scale of the climate crisis. This means lowering the country's carbon-equivalent emissions drastically. Although national emissions have lately grown more slowly than output, the IEA warns that the US economy's carbon intensity remains much too high. The decoupling of emissions and economic growth needs to accelerate sharply.The US has the technology and resources to create a modern, clean-energy economy. It simply lacks the political will. This has far-reaching implications. As the world's largest economy, with the highest per capita CO2 emissions, the US is vital to the success of COP26.For decades, Big Oil has wielded more power than US voters have. The IPCC's latest report shows unequivocally why this must change.To keep our planet habitable, popular majorities in favor of climate action  beginning with Americans  must come together and demand that their government do what is needed.Clair Brown, Professor of Economics and Director of the Center for Work, Technology, and Society at the University of California, Berkeley, is the author of Buddhist Economics: An Enlightened Approach to the Dismal Science.Click/tap here to subscribe to Khaleej Times news alerts on Telegram.\l"

The move is said to demonstrate the UAE's progress in transitioning to cleaner energy sources, rapidly decarbonising the power sector, cutting carbon emissions, and increasing power supply to meet the growing electricity demand.According to a statement, Unit 3 has now been handed over for operational readiness activities and is on track to start up and deliver clean electricity in 2023, joining Unit 1, which is fully operational. Unit 2 is connected to the UAE grid and undergoing testing while raising power levels, ENEC explained.As the UAE's bid to host COP 28 in 2023 is endorsed by the member states of the UN's Asia Pacific group, the tangible efforts the nation is making in cutting carbon emissions as part of its climate commitments and the recently launched 2050 Net Zero Initiative are clear. This milestone means that the Barakah Plant will soon deliver yet another 1,400MW of zero emissions electricity, highlighting the UAE's leading role as a clean energy leader, ENEC stated.""With Unit 1 already commercially operating and Unit 2 recently connected to the UAE grid, Unit 3 construction completion demonstrates the steady progress we are making with the development of the Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant. As the world gathers at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, the need for concrete actions to tackle climate change is indisputable and urgent. The Barakah Plant, with its rapid decarbonisation of the power sector, is delivering climate solutions today and with Unit 3 construction now complete, we are progressing smoothly towards supplying a quarter of the UAE's electricity needs completely carbon free,"" commented Mohamed Ibrahim Al Hammadi, MD & CEO of ENEC.With Unit 3 completing construction, ENEC is said to be demonstrating the significant progress made in delivering climate solutions today, and fulfilling the UAE's promise of clean energy using nuclear technology to provide the baseload clean electricity needed to support intermittent renewable energy sources.By 2025 it is projected that the Barakah plant will have cut Abu Dhabi's carbon emissions by 50%, demonstrating the significant abilities of nuclear energy in producing baseload electricity without generating carbon emissions. The focus of Unit 3 in the next phase will shift to complete the operational readiness preparations, testing, regulatory inspections, and international assessments required to obtain the Operating License for Unit 3 from the UAE's independent nuclear regulator, the Federal Authority for Nuclear Regulation (FANR), the statement noted.Al Hammadi added, ""By developing nuclear energy in the UAE, ENEC is enabling sustainable growth and prosperity for the Nation through the provision of abundant, 24/7 clean electricity, whilst underpinning intermittent renewables and creating a bridge to other clean energy technologies like green hydrogen. We are tackling climate change directly today and will do for the next 60 years to come. We thank our Leadership for the vision in diversifying the UAE's power sources 15 years ago, and their unwavering support as we deliver the four units of the Barakah plant and make history in this year of the UAE's Golden Jubilee.""ENEC said that Unit 3 has already successfully completed several individual and combined system tests, including Cold Hydrostatic Testing (CHT), the Structural Integrity Test (SIT), and Integrated Leak Rate Test (ILRT), and the Hot Functional Test as part of the first phase of its Initial Testing Programme (ITP). The ITP aims to ensure that the Unit's systems operate in accordance with the highest industry standards and will continue to do so during the operation of the plant over the coming decades.Prior to granting such approval via the issuance of the Operating License for Unit 3, FANR is carrying out detailed inspections and reviews of all aspects of the plant and the operating organisation.

And now, the Middle East is showing it wants to not just be part of the solution, but a home for it, too. The latest example came on Thursday, when it was announced that the UAE will host Cop28, scheduled to be held in 2023.""The UAE's leaders congratulated the country for winning the bid to host the ""most important"" of meetings.""His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, tweeted after the announcement that the UAE would put everything towards making Cop28 a success.His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, said the UAE looked forward ""to working with the international community to accelerate global efforts to address climate change and environmental protection and create a more sustainable economic future"".After the decision, H.H. Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, offered a reminder that it was the late Sheikh Zayed, the Founding Father of the UAE, who has inspired ""us as we strive to safeguard the well-being of present and future generations"".""Cop28 in 2023 will and must be a 'solutions Cop' - and I am confident that the rich experience of this young, inclusive nation in advancing practical, viable and shareable solutions to the world's most pressing challenges will again come to the fore as we host the world for the UN Climate Change Conference in two years' time,"" he said, according to Wam.""The UAE Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative, announced earlier this year, shows our own unwavering commitment to promoting climate action. Further, through new investment commitments and partnerships, we are illustrating our determination to support the world in addressing climate change,"" he added.The editorial continued, ""Choosing the UAE to host Cop28 is also another huge moment for the environmental movement in the region, which will follow in the footsteps of Cop27, to be held in Egypt. ""Having back-to-back conferences in the Middle East and North Africa is a sign of how the event is changing. Its early years were confined to Europe, when the foresight of countries such as Germany spotted the need for it as far back as the 1990s. But, as the global significance of the issue at hand becomes clear, Cop has been held all over the world. Now, it is very much in its Middle Eastern phase.""And that has much to offer the world. In the most basic sense, the region is an early example of the dangers ahead. It is the most water-stressed part of the planet, with a rising temperature double the global average. This burden will be borne by some of the most fragile societies, made up of people who often have known few of the highly polluting luxuries for which the developed world is largely responsible.""But reconfiguring this conversation is not just about the UAE's efforts; the successful bid would not have been possible without the backing a number of other countries, including all member states of the UN's Asia-Pacific Group and the Arab League. It is this ability to rally global support that will also make Cop28 one to watch. At this year's meeting, the atmosphere between the world's biggest emitters has not been easy, something that may stop the event reaching its full potential. Agreement may become easier as the conversation shifts to new geographies.And Cop is not just about getting governments on board, but industry, too. Earlier this month, The National spoke to Claire O'Neill, managing director of climate and energy for the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. Discussing the prospect of upcoming conferences in the Middle East, Ms O'Neill said, ""I think the next Cop cycle will be a new chance to amplify those of the world's most sustainable businesses who are committed to net zero by 2050, nature positive and committed to reducing inequality and total transparency in reporting.""The National added in its editorial that ""a hub for international business, the UAE would also be a particularly strong location for major industries to discuss how they might contribute to fighting climate change outside western contexts. After all, a corporate sustainability strategy that works in the US or Scandinavia might well not work in the Middle East or the rest of the world. We are already seeing this mixing of expertise at work at Expo 2020 Dubai, where a number of countries and companies from all over the world are providing sustainable engineering for the UAE's desert location.""As part of its commitments under the 2015 Paris Agreement, the UAE recently announced it has stepped up its plans to plant mangroves, and now aims to plant 100 million by 2030.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE266","How Dubai played a leading role in helping to reshape chambers of commerce","November 29, 2021 Monday","ArabianBusiness.com","How did the 12th World Chambers Conference (12WCC) explore ways to turn digital disruption into opportunities?There were various fascinating ways in which the 12WCC examined this crucial topic during a very useful exchange of ideas and meeting of minds.Held under the theme 'Generation Next: Chambers 4.0 \- Transforming Disruption into Opportunity for Global Business', the Congress provided a tremendous opportunity to share valuable insights and unique perspectives on what Chambers 4.0 means to chambers of commerce from around the world, offering a glimpse into what the chambers of the future will look like.One of the true highlights of the Congress was a new white paper released by Dubai Chamber, which noted that governments need to enact reforms that incorporate digital requirements in trade agreements, with digitally-enabled trade shown to provide significant economic benefits, efficiency gains and environmental rewards.Digitalisation \- alongside automation and data intelligence chains \- was also highlighted as being essential to modernise and boost the efficiency of supply chains, the vulnerabilities of which were exposed during the Covid-19 pandemic.Meanwhile, the Digital Fitness Test \- a new and innovative tool designed to test the digital fitness of chambers of commerce \- was launched at the 12WCC to great acclaim from everyone who attended. During a very fun and interactive session at the Congress, titled 'Fit For Digital: Know Thyself', participants took the Digital Fitness Test comprising a 12-question self-assessment via a QR code, meaning that virtual attendees at the congress could also participate.Test criteria for chambers included the presence of unified and comprehensive digital strategies; organisational cultures with digital mindsets; disaster-recovery plans; and documented programmes to identify security breaches.What compelling objectives were discussed to maintain chambers' roles as trusted and relevant leaders in the 21st century?Among the key ones were that chambers must work to cultivate an entrepreneurial ecosystem to support small and medium-sized companies that will continue to play a vital role in the global economy; environmental, social and governance principles will be key drivers of business in the future; and businesses must orientate themselves towards the challenge of achieving net-zero carbon emissions.In 2021, it is obvious that the world is at a crossroads.We strongly advise, therefore, that governments and businesses must adapt to the new normal and learn to navigate a world in which workplace habits have been completely upended.The climate crisis has become more pressing than ever, too, as the United Nations' 26th Climate Change Conference () recently showed, and threats to international trade and global cooperation still persist.As such, we firmly believe it is the responsibility of chambers of commerce to navigate trade in a world of disruption and innovate in order to remain relevant to their members.Otherwise, a panel discussion at the 12WCC revealed that chambers of commerce around the world are looking to younger generations for inspiration as they adopt new innovation-focused strategies. I would stress that it is imperative that business leaders pay serious attention to major trends and defining traits of the young generation, and how their voice can enable chambers to stay relevant. After all, young people are the lifeblood of any successful organisation with their abundant energy and ideas.How do you think technology can help in terms of boosting collaboration and strengthening connections?Well, it is obvious that technology is already revolutionising the global trading system and reshaping the way we do business. Collaboration and open, constructive dialogue are essential to ensure the success and prosperity of future generations.I think that has become abundantly clear during the Covid-19 pandemic when people rallied together in the face of adversity and discovered that communication has become more important than ever. As new technologies emerge, so do new challenges and opportunities.I was delighted that a report launched at the 12WCC explored how the next generation of chambers of commerce can help businesses harness new technologies to continue the digital transformations that were accelerated during the Covid-19 pandemic.The report examines how small and medium-sized enterprises have had to adapt since the onset of the pandemic, and how 'Generation Next: Chambers 4.0' can continue supporting this core pillar of the global economy.How can chambers promote innovation within their strategies to enhance their competitiveness and preparedness in the post-Covid era?Among the key recommendations of the whitepaper on Chambers 4.0 released during the Congress was the need for chambers of commerce to realign the services they provide their members to remain effective advocates of businesses in the post-pandemic era.Examining the state of innovation in cities around the world during a time of unprecedented turmoil and change, the latest edition of the Dubai Innovation Index states that at the start of a new era, the global exchange of knowledge and learning is more important than ever.Key takeaways from this year's index are that digitalisation underpins the transformation and success of the most innovative cities; governments in top innovative cities do more to promote innovation than just set policies, oversee regulations and provide incentives; and the collaboration that has resulted from the pandemic has accelerated innovation by offering innovators enhanced opportunities for knowledge sharing, market access and funding.Chamber Model Innovation was one of the most important initiatives launched at this edition of the World Chambers Congress, it was universally agreed. CMI was designed to fast-track chamber-led innovation around the world and guide chambers as they adopt a more customer-centric approach.This model has been piloted by several chambers from around the world, which saw promising results and major benefits. I am confident that many more chambers will adopt it with the end goal of fostering a culture of innovation within the global chambers community.For all the latest business news from the UAE and Gulf countries, follow us on Twitter and Linkedin, like us on Facebook and subscribe to our YouTube page, which is updated daily. \l"

""The technology can accommodate burning hydrogen, then you can decarbonise depending on the level of the blend, then you will decarbonise to different levels.""Benamar notes that by decarbonising using hydrogen technology, investment is maximised in the long term, in contrast to gas technology which, while attractive currently, will not be able to completely decarbonise in the future.Hayes explains that in terms of efforts to decarbonise, hydrogen investment represents the biggest ""bang for your buck,"" given the opportunities to use the technology to decarbonise markets that are difficult to electrify.The flexibility of how hydrogen can be developed and used is a key advantage of the technology, Hayes adds.""In theory, you could go all the way from having hydrogen injecting into your existing gas pipel"

Looking to the future of their relationship, Spain and the UAE agreed to establish a strategic partnership in various fields, ranging from upgraded political consultations to an enhanced framework for investment and economic cooperation; increased collaboration in sectors such as health, the environment, renewable energy, scientific and educational cooperation, sports and culture; and to open new chapters of cooperation in areas such as cybersecurity, climate action, and industry.2.

The Spanish pavilion, through its theme ""Intelligence for Life"", has focused on accounts of Spanish history, culture, and ties to Arab civilization as well as the sustainable practices Spain has undertaken and galvanized. Through their participation at Expo, Spain's programming has been rich and diverse with a variety of cultural events.3. President S?nchez congratulated the United Arab Emirates on the fiftieth anniversary of its founding in 1971, and for having recently celebrated its Golden Jubilee. This auspicious historical occasion is marked by the extraordinary achievements in social and economic progress the United Arab Emirates has made in the last 50 years, and also by the stature and prestige the United Arab Emirates has deservedly gained in regional and world affairs, including the United Arab Emirates' hosting of the Expo 2020 Dubai.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE278","A human-rights approach is key to tackling global challenges","July 14, 2021 Wednesday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","ReutersThe Covid-19 pandemic has recast the world for millions of people. Or, more correctly, the pandemic has exposed and aggravated deep inequalities of race, gender, and class across societies, and highlighted the inability of many political systems to respond in ways that protect individual human rights and dignity. The world will neither rebuild from this crisis, nor have any chance of tackling wider existential threats such as climate change, until we can once more instill a sense of hope in political and civic life.Fortunately, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a roadmap already exists to help humanity chart a path forward. The declaration, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948, is as relevant today as it was amid the physical and moral devastation caused by World War II.Article 1 of the declaration states an abiding truth with resounding clarity: ""All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights."" To realise this vision today, we must push leaders to go beyond warm words and commit to meaningful, feasible, and measurable actions. In particular, they need to ensure equitable global distribution of Covid-19 vaccines and provide adequate financial support to countries most vulnerable to the ravages of climate change.For starters, high-income countries must take steps to achieve the Gavi Covax Advance Market Commitment target of providing at least one billion vaccine doses to the world's poorest countries no later than September 1, 2021, and more than two billion doses by mid-2022.It is both morally unjust and  in health and economic terms  myopic for rich countries to hoard Covid-19 vaccines for their own populations. The longer the coronavirus persists and mutates in poorer countries with fewer resources, the further away humanity as a whole will be from fully vanquishing the threat to lives and livelihoods.In the same spirit, G7 and G20 leaders should support calls at the World Health Organisation and the World Trade Organisation for voluntary licensing and technology transfer for production of vaccines. Failing that, they should back an immediate waiver of certain intellectual-property rights under WTO rules  a move that US President Joe Biden recently supported.Sadly, at their recent summit in the United Kingdom, G7 leaders failed to show an understanding of the scale of their responsibility to address the inequalities exacerbated by the pandemic. More broadly, Covid-19 has exposed the shortcomings of narrow nationalism and populist policies that disdain scientific evidence and empathy. No country, regardless of its power or size, can tackle the public-health threat effectively on its own.It is essential that leaders learn from their mistakes and heed the recommendations of the expert Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response. Only properly financed, integrated, and organised health systems will be able to withstand future pandemics and health emergencies.As matters stand, however, the rich world's failures in tackling Covid-19 have increased the trust deficit between the Global North and South. This, in turn, will make it more difficult to reach an agreement at the next critical international diplomatic gathering: the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November.All countries need to ratchet up their near-term emissions-reduction targets ahead of COP26, and we are still waiting for the major emitters to do so. In addition, rich countries must rebuild trust by showing how they will increase their climate finance contributions \- including a greater share for adaptation \- to deliver the long-pledged $100 billion per year to help developing countries combat global warming and its effects.Two common threads run through the shared challenges we face in defending human rights, overcoming the pandemic, and tackling the climate crisis: the need for vigilance against complacency, and the responsibility to act for the greater good. In these testing times, we can all draw inspiration from a leader who never wavered in his commitment to human rights and justice: Nelson Mandela.It is a historical irony that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted in the same year that South Africa established its apartheid regime. But Mandela immediately saw the declaration's power and potential. Speaking in 1997 as president of South Africa, he reflected: ""For all the opponents of this pernicious system, the simple and noble words of the Universal Declaration were a sudden ray of hope at one of our darkest moments.""Today, more than ever, we need to rediscover and reassert the declaration's principles of solidarity and common endeavour that Mandela so powerfully articulated throughout his life. Our task now is not to ""build back better"", because we cannot build back from a status quo ante that produced inequitable and dysfunctional systems. Rather, we must ""build forward better,"" marshaling our efforts with hope, discipl"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE279","Is buying refurbished tech the best way to find Black Friday deals?","November 13, 2021 Saturday","TechRadar","Even with the discounts, we're likely to see thanks to upcoming Black Friday deals, the latest tech rarely comes cheap. On the hunt for a bargain, your eyes might have been drawn to the reduced price of refurbished tech, but should you steer clear of these tempting offers or not?Refurbished, used and like-new devices may be less expensive than their out-of-the-box counterparts, but they also come with a degree of uncertainty - is the item just a little scuffed or are we paying out for a plastic brick?Thanks to our experience with buying tech secondhand we're here to highlight why the refurbished tag shouldn't immediately scare you away, but also what you need to look out for when buying something used.Old to them, new to you The reduced cost of refurbished tech is likely the biggest draw, attracting those on the hunt for reasonable prices. Even outside of Black Friday you can typically find savings of around 10-20% on gadgets that might be only a few months old.During Black Friday the deals will often get even sweeter as the sale prices on new products are carried over to their secondhand counterparts; with the refurbished discount being added on top you can potentially save a significant amount compared with the device's usual RRP.We've had success buying second-hand games consoles, webcams, smartphones, and more - all of it at a much lower price than we would have otherwise paid. We further compounded the savings by trading in our own old tech at the same time, sometimes paying nothing to get our hands on the device we were after.Savings aren't the only draw though, with another driving force being that secondhand purchases reduce electronic waste.(Image credit: Shutterstock / Morten B)Following the recent COP26 conference, climate change, its effects, and what we can do to prevent the situation from worsening have been on the minds of citizens across the globe. One way we can do our bit is by buying up older but usable tech rather than sending it to landfill.Recent efforts are only starting to make electronic waste easier to recycle - the UK's Royal Mint unveiled its high-tech solution very recently - so for now we need to find other ways of keeping our old technology out of the trash and using it for as long as we can.While this won't convince as many people to buy used as the discounts available, the feeling that you're doing the right thing is an added benefit that you won't get from buying new.One person's trash is another person's... trash Before you head straight for the secondhand sites you need to be careful though, as not all refurbished and used items are equal. Like all things, tech components will get worn out with use, and if you aren't careful you could end up buying a gadget that's more worn down than its age might have you believe.With any piece of secondhand kit you expect the odd scuff or scrape on the outer shell - but it's the internal components (the ones you can't see) that you need to worry about.If you're looking to save more over and above the best Black Friday OLED TV deals that are out there then a refurbished offering can seem like a good bet - especially given how expensive these screens can be.Unfortunately, we'd recommend you steer clear of second-hand OLEDs unless you can see them in action or they're from a retailer with quality guarantees. That's because OLED screens can be damaged by an effect called burn-in - where an image has been on display for too long and becomes permanently branded into the screen.Manufacturers say that - especially with newer OLED screens - burn-in is much less of a concern than it used to be and isn't something that the average user should worry about. However, it's the kind of damage that might make someone else want to abandon their TV and get a new one - potentially leaving the damaged tech with whichever sucker buys it off them.Customers after a high-end PC that takes advantage of Black Friday gaming laptop deals should be on the lookout, too. Cryptocurrency mining has become massive these past few years, causing most of the best components to be sold out almost instantly - laptops using GPUs like the RTX 3080 and equally powerful processors have also been snatched up quickly.Mining is an intensive process that puts strain on these components though, and eventually, they'll be too worn out to function properly. At this point, a shady character might decide to sell them on as 'used', offering them up for a very reasonable price onl"

MPCs allow a producer to sell instruments representing zero methane emission natural gas production.As part of the inaugural launch, Macquarie Energy Canada, Ltd. a wholly owned subsidiary of Macquarie Group (""Macquarie""), arranged the first MPC trade between Pacific Canbriam and industrial gas customer Skeena Bioenergy Ltd, a manufacturer of wood pellets exported to the UK, EU, and Japan, displacing coal in electricity generation.S&P Global Platts and Xpansiv, the global marketplace for ESG commodities, worked together to launch this innovative new way to measure and price methane performance in natural gas production. Pacific Canbriam and other natural gas providers who qualify will issue MPCs that register the carbon intensity of their natural gas, proving that fugitive methane emissions fall below strict, quantifiable thresholds.The MPCs evidence the stringent environmental standards in B.C. and the low methane intensity of Pacific Canbriam's natural gas. Only natural gas produced below a threshold of 0.1% methane emissions intensity (MEI) qualifies under the S&P Global Platts protocol. This standard reflects the market value of low methane emissions in natural gas production.Pacific Canbriam Energy is a world-leader in minimizing methane leaks and vents in its operations, and its natural gas involved in this transaction is well below the 0.1% Platts threshold; the number of MPCs are calculated relative to an average methane emissions rate for North America[1]. Pacific Canbriam Energy is part of Pacific Oil & Gas, which is a member of the Singapore-based RGE group of companies founded by Sukanto Tanoto.""With increasing focus on where energy comes from, Pacific Canbriam Energy is proud that the origin, energy content, and methane intensity of its natural gas has been externally verified as being responsibly sourced,"" said Paul Myers, President of Pacific Canbriam Energy. ""This is proof that our product is produced according to the highest standards of environmental and social responsibility. We're excited and proud to supply MPCs to Skeena that demonstrate the exceptionally low methane intensity associated with the development of our natural gas.""With global attention on climate change in the run-up to COP26, upstream energy carbon intensity is being closely watched and has prompted investors, consumers, and producers to seek new ways to reduce their carbon footprint. This has created an increased demand for low-carbon fuels.""We chose to purchase Methane Performance Certificates from Pacific Canbriam Energy to voluntarily reduce the supply chain methane emissions intensity associated with our natural gas,"" said Skeena President Roger Keery. ""It's an important step forward in lowering our overall GHG footprint.""MPCs are registered, issued, transacted, and retired in accordance with the Xpansiv Digital Fuels Program to eliminate double counting. Xpansiv's DF Registry maintains a complete record of the MPC and its associated environmental claims, ensuring data quality.""MPCs allow the market to reward producers like Pacific Canbriam with low methane leakage, creating a clear market price related to fugitive methane emissions,"" said Andrew Pisano, Head of XRegistries at Xpansiv. ""We're pleased to support natural gas market participants on their path to reach their ESG targets and climate commitments, and hope this incentivizes other producers to make similar measurable progress.""Last month, Pacific Canbriam announced it had become the second natural gas producer in Canada to achieve an EO100 Standard Certification from Equitable Origin.

In a speech at the gathering, he said: ""Japan will realise this goal under our newly adopted long-term strategy. I assure that Japan aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 46 per cent in the fiscal year 2030 from its fiscal year 2013 levels, and that Japan will continue strenuous efforts in its challenge to meet the lofty goal of cutting its emissions by 50 per cent.""At a webinar with Khaleej Times, Daisuke Suginoo, Assistant Director, Energy Strategy Office, Policy Planning and Coordination Division, Commissioner's Secretariat, Agency for Natural Resources and Energy, The Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI), talked about why Japan is taking preventative measures to counteract carbon emissions.Suginoo says: ""Japan emits a large volume of CO2 every year. As critical conditions arise due to climate change, it is paramount that Japan takes corrective measures. 90% of all the CO2 emissions is energy related. Keeping that goal in mind, the new Strategic Energy Plan announced in October 2021, aims to show the path of the energy policy to realise carbon neutrality by 2050 and new GHG emission reduction target in FY2030. The new plan indicates the overall direction of the country's policy. The message also includes that not only dealing with climate change is important but ensuring security and stability of the supply is also important, that the prices must be affordable in order to ensure international competitiveness as well as maintaining the livelihood of those involved in the supply chain.The Energy Mix Vision for 2030Suginoo adds: ""Another important theme is to overcome the challenges Japan's energy supply-demand structure faces. On the major premise of safety, efforts will be made for energy security and economic efficiency of energy while promoting climate change countermeasures (S+3E). In the new plan, in the power sector, the country expects to lower themal power ratio on the major premise of its stable power suply, and move to new energy mix that includes more than doubling renewable energy supply (FY'19 - 18 per cent to FY'30 -36 to 38 per cent) as well as positioning hydrogen and ammonia (FY'19 - nil to FY'30 - 41 per cent) as fuel.Hydrogen is key for carbon neutralityHydrogen is increasingly being viewed as an important tool for reducing carbon emissions, because the use of hydrogen for energy generates no direct carbon dioxide emissions.Hiroki Yoshida, Deputy Director, Hydrogen and Fuel Cells Strategy Office, Advanced Energy Systems and Structure Division, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Department, METI, adds: ""We are trying to make cleaner power generation and the renewable energy is also being expanded including solar power and wind, but renewable energy is intermittent and inconsistent. In this case, hydrogen can be stored as power storage and/or can be used for power generation. By using hydrogen, we believe that the potential of the RE can be leveraged to the maximum.""With regards to the contribution of hydrogen, it can be used for operating power plants and in other areas where it is difficult to decarbonise such as industry or modern commercial sectors which mainly depend on fossil fuels.Currently in Japan, there are 167 hydrogen stations, including 12 under construction. Most of them are in Kanto region, followed by Chukyo, Kansai & Shikoku, Chugoku & Kyushu, Hokkaido & Tohoku and Hokuriko. Japan's target is 320 stations by 2025, 1,000 stations by 2030.""At the moment we are trying to expand the use of hydrogen in Japan but expanding the consumption means, supply has to be expanded as well,"" Hiroki adds.The Fukushima Hydrogen Energy Research Field (FH2R), a renewable energy-powered 10 MW-class hydrogen production unit, is currently the largest facility. Going forward if Japan enters a full-fledged hydrogen-based society then larger facilities of the same scale will be required, adds Hiroki.Now, Japan's annual consumption of hydrogen is 2 million tonnes, and by 2030, by the virtue of supply and demand, the expected consumption will rise to 3 million tonnes. By 2050, the target is to be 20 million tonnes a year. On the road to 'Beyond Zero'Naoto Okura, Deputy Director, International Affairs Division, Commissioner's Secretariat, Agency for Natural Resources and Energy, METI, said that Japan takes its energy policies very seriously. In October 2020, Japan declared the goal of realizing a carbon-neutral, decarbonised society by 2050. To achieve this goal, Japan will lead decarbonization globally by establishing and implementing innovative technologies and mobilising all measures toward the ""Beyond Zero"" initiative, whose goal is not only global carbon neutrality, but also retroactive reduction of CO2 emissions through the stock base approach.He added: ""This year, from October 4 to 8, METI held the Tokyo Beyond Zero Week with eight conferences - onl"

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE291","KT Long Read: The Attenborough effect on plastic pollution","December 9, 2021 Thursday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","One of the key aspects of Media Studies I used to teach during my previous life in academia is 'media effects': the idea that the media can influence people's behaviour, attitudes and actions. But the degree of that influence, as well as who is most impacted, when, how and why, has been the subject of much debate among scholars for nearly a century; for example, does violence on television and films lead to violence in society? The jury is still out, but there is some consensus that the 'media effects' need not be overt  they can be subtle, whose influence on action and behaviour may not be clear immediately.I did not have to look far to find a good example of 'media effects': my home. At one point, I was closely following the documentary series Blue Planet (2001) and Blue Planet II (2017) on BBC, marvelling at their production values and the less known world of issues facing oceans and endangering marine life, narrated brilliantly by the iconic natural historian David Attenborough.One evening, while unpacking after returning from the supermarket, I realised the extent of packaging that came with items of everyday use: it almost filled the kitchen bin. Almost every item, particularly vegetables and other food items, came in attractive plastic packaging. I looked around the kitchen and the house, and saw how widespread plastic is present, and recalled episodes in Blue Planet II that graphically showed how plastic pollution kills and endangers marine life and ultimately affects the ecosystem. The documentary's 'effect' on me was clear: I soon changed shopping habits, from the supermarket to farmers' market stalls, bought plastic goods to the bare minimum, and generated less waste for the local council's bin collection, from one black bin bag in a week to one every three weeks, if not longer. Since plastic cannot be recycled in full and remains a major challenge, who knows where the discarded packaging will end up?Damage to environmentI was not alone to experience the 'Attenborough Effect'. The Blue Planet series was watched across the globe and clearly helped raise awareness of how human anthropogenic activity puts marine life and the environment in danger. Much outrage was expressed about plastic pollution after the series was broadcast. It was suddenly a hot topic and people who had never done it before started taking reusable jute, cloth and other bags to supermarkets and grocery stores, refusing plastic packaging. Several surveys showed that the vast majority of people who watched the series changed their shopping habits, if not lifestyles. The series was seen by millions across China, particularly Blue Planet II, which reportedly slowed the country's Internet at the time. When Theresa May visited Beijing as prime minister in 2018, she presented President Xi Jinping with a Blue Planet box-set, with a special message from Attenborough. As May says, ""We look back in horror at some of the damage done to our environment in the past and wonder how anyone could have thought that, for example, dumping toxic chemicals untreated into rivers was ever the right thing to do. In the UK alone, the amount of single-use plastic wasted every year would fill 1,000 Royal Albert Halls.""Delighted with Blue Planet's impact, Attenborough says: ""We hoped that Blue Planet II would open people's eyes to the damage that we are doing to our oceans and the creatures that live in them. I've been absolutely astonished at the result that that programme has had. I never imagined there would be quite so many of you who would be inspired to want change. The strength of response has not gone unnoticed in the corridors of power, or in business boardrooms. The actions of any just one of us may seem to be trivial and to have no effect. But the knowledge that there are thousands, hundreds of thousands of people who are doing the same thing  that rally does have an effect. I think we're all shifting our behaviour, I really do. I think we are changing our habits, and the world is waking up to what we've done to the planet. It is high time we turn our attention fully to one of the most pressing problems of today  averting the plastic pollution crisis.""The good, bad and ugly of plasticPlastic itself is incredibly useful. It has an excellent strength-to-weight ratio; it is durable and inexpensive, making it the material of choice for most disposable medical tools, equipment and packaging. The big problem is single-use plastics and the quantities in which they are used. A plastic bag, for example, is used on average for a short duration, but could take 100 to 300 years to fragment. But the British Plastics Federation's (BPF) position is that single-use plastics also have an important role to play in modern life. It contends that plastics packaging saves resources and, ""it is lighter, uses less energy and produces less greenhouse gas emissions than alternatives"". According to the BPF, the main benefits of plastic packaging are: resource efficient, safe, hygienic, lightweight, secure, durable and versatile.But despite much innovation and advances in recycling technology, a big question mark remains; not all plastics can be recycled, including some resins. Even for some plastics that can be partly recycled, the process can use a lot of energy, and plastic cannot be recycled indefinitely, unlike glass or aluminium. Every time plastic is recycled, its quality decreases, so on average a plastic product can only be recycled two to three times before it is no longer used. As Prime Minister Boris Johnson remarked before the COP26 summit in Glasgow, sparking a row with campaigners, recycling plastic ""doesn't work"" and ""is not the answer"" to threats to global oceans and marine wildlife. Reusing plastics ""doesn't begin to address the problem"", he said, suggesting that instead ""we've all got to cut down our use of plastic"".A large number of experts, organisations and governments across the globe are engaged in dealing with plastic pollution, producing voluminous reports and research papers. The figures are stark: every day approximately 8 million pieces of plastic pollution find their way into oceans; 12 million tonnes of plastic are poured into the ocean every year; scientists have recently discovered microplastics embedded deep in the Arctic ice; plastics consistently make up 80 per cent of all marine debris studied; there may now be around 5.25 trillion macro and microplastic pieces floating in the open ocean, weighing up to 269,000 tonnes; 100,000 marine mammals and turtles and 1 million sea birds are killed by marine plastic pollution annually; approximately 5,000 items of marine plastic pollution have been found per mile of beach in the UK; 90 per cent of plastic is produced from feedstock obtained from fossil oil and gas; producing one tonne of plastic generates up to 2.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide; plastic production has been forecast to grow by 60 per cent by 2030 and to treble by 2050; and less than a third of all plastic in the UK is recycled.ALSO READ:The Covid-19 pandemic's demand for single use plastic medical equipment has added to the pollution, as new research in the American academic journal PNAS shows. More than eight million tonnes of pandemic-associated plastic waste has been generated globally, with more than 25,000 tonnnes entering the global ocean.Most of the plastic is from medical waste generated by hospitals that dwarfs the contribution from personal protection equipment and onl"

In turn, this will support the UK's 2050 'net zero' carbon targets and could lead to increased production of clean renewable energy and even subsequent cheaper energy bills in the long run.Want to go greener with your energy? Find the best deals in your area nowSetting a positive example for other nationsThe potential of the plant's expansion was praised by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and he alluded to it being a positive example for other nations to look towards with their sustainability. He said: ""The Humber region embodies the UK's green industrial revolution, with new investment into developing the next generation of wind turbines set to create new jobs, export opportunities and clean power across the country.""With less than 100 days to go until the climate summit Cop26, we need to see more countries embracing new technologies, building green industries and phasing out coal power for a sustainable future.""This was echoed by Clark MacFarlane, Siemens Gamesa's UK managing director, who said: ""Our investment in our existing offshore blade factory, logistics, and harbour facilities in Hull has been a key driver of the growth of the UK's world-leading offshore wind industry.""This 'growth' is now set to become even more substantial as the new turbines will be used to supply and expand projects such as the new offshore wind 'Hornsea Two' development, located near the plant off the Yorkshire coast. When finished, the 1.4-gigawatt farm will be the world's largest offshore wind provider, powering upwards of 1.3 million homes with clean renewable energy.Start going green todayThe promise of increased production of renewables, additional jobs and cheaper energy bills is of course something very positive to look forward to, but it will be several years before the expansion fulfils its potential.However, if you want to reduce your energy bills and go greener now, you can carry out an onl"

Right now, we're in the middle of a global energy transition: renewable energy has undergone a huge cost reduction and become highly commercially viable. Additionally, new technologies are evolving quickly, and we must capitalise on that. We look forward to working with you on new renewable clean energy projects that will benefit local communities and allow them to actively contribute to the energy transition. An inclusive and just energy transition is an absolute necessity.""Francesco La Camera, Director General, IRENA, said: ""We come together at a critical moment in history: a crisis that once seemed far away is now on our doorstep,"" while also praising Expo 2020 for being a ""melting pot for ideas, culture and innovation, and the fitting location for addressing the pressing issues of our time.""With the target of net zero by 2050 high on everyone's agenda, La Camera stressed that aside from the additional USD60 billion needed for climate control, the world has to work hand-in-hand to bring together those key stakeholders who have championed clean energy transition by developing renewable solutions.Aminath Shauna, Minister of Climate Change, Environment and Technology, Maldives, said that island nations, including her own, were the most vulnerable to climate change. ""We depend entirely on imports, so we need to transition to an economy that is fuelled by sunshine and renewables. Although we have sunshine in abundance, we don't have the land needed to install large-scale solar panels, which is why we're also looking at renewable sources for energy. We need access that is affordable, accessible and long-term; I don't think this is a very big ask.""The crux lies in an effective electricity roadmap that reduces greenhouse emissions while ensuring that access to energy \- a basic human right \- is not at risk.""Energy poverty is a firm part of the energy-transition journey. I welcome the conversations today, and I welcome the UAE's initiatives in policy and funding to allow for implementation on-ground for vital energy projects, ensuring that no-one is left behind,"" said Damilola Ogunbiyi, CEO of Sustainable Energy for All and Co-Chair of UN Energy.The numbers, she said, speak volumes. ""There are 759 million people with no access to electricity, and 2.6 billion have no access to clean cooking. Many of our economies are based on diesel or petrol.""But Ogunbiyi insisted that developing countries do have solid, well-thought-out plans for transition, and yet in spite of this were still being denied financing. She said: ""The policies are in place, so let's stop talking and let's start acting. We have to demand this going into COP26. This is a crisis.""Highlighting the stark truth that island states contribute the least to climate change, but are disproportionately affected, Ogunbiyi added: ""I don't like the notion that these countries are asking for handouts, because they're not the ones that have caused the problems. You can't blame countries for using fossil fuels if you don't give them a clean offer. We have to be unapologetic that we are putting an emphasis on the people who need it the most \- and the UAE has an opportunity to help.""While there were different views regarding access to financing, Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi, CEO Masdar, agreed that the UAE was in a unique position to be at the forefront of the renewable movement. He said: ""After 15 years, Masdar has become one of the world leaders in renewable energy. No-one cared to talk about renewable energy back then, especially in a country where the energy is based on fossil fuel. But change is a must, and today our region is accelerating renewables. In 2019, we built the largest 10 megawatt solar farm in the region. Two years later, we are developing two-gigawatt projects \- that's how far we've come.""Affirming that the financing for developing island countries was available, Al Ramahi said it was just a matter of providing the investors with the right environment and the right opportunities: ""Masdar has already worked with 11 countries in the Pacific, at least three in the Indian Ocean, and three in the Caribbean, with seven projects under construction and seven in development \- we're providing both the funds and the technical support, this is key. We have to work hard with the host countries to deploy these opportunities and make them a reality.""Binu Parthan, Regional Head of IRENA, told Expo News: ""Today has been important, because foreign ministers and key delegates have articulated the urgency of time in addressing climate action. Solutions for addressing the climate change problems do exist, and finance needs to be made accessible.""\l"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE296","Saudi sets sights on net zero","October 26, 2021","Middle East Oil & Gas Monitor","The Saudi state and its main energy arm this week set ambitious net-zero targets but oil will remain key to the Kingdom's economy.What: Riyadh anticipates reaching net zero by 2060, with Aramco to cut Scope 1 and 2 emissions from its operations to the same level by 2050. Why: The move stops short of including Scope 3 emissions, which Aramco has not yet begun reporting. What Next: Blue hydrogen will feature heavily for Aramco and the Kingdom's energy minister said that the Jafurah gas field will be leveraged to generate hydrogen. Saudi Arabia this week announced that it would reduce emissions from the Kingdom to `net zero' by 2060, with oil firm Saudi Aramco also setting an ambitious target for emissions. Aramco's target is to reach `net zero' Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, suggesting that both goals will rely heavily on the offshoring of emissions, with Riyadh set to remain reliant on crude oil exports for decades to come. Saudi's improbable target was announced by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MbS) during the Kingdom's Saudi Green Initiative Forum ahead of the COP26 climate conference. He said that 450mn trees would be planted across Saudi Arabia amid efforts to rehabilitate large areas of degraded land by 2030 and the mitigation of 200mn tonnes of emissions. Meanwhile, a statement released by Aramco disclosed the company's ""ambition to achieve net-zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions across its wholly owned operated assets by 2050"". It added: ""This ambition is an important part of the company's focus on long-term shareholder value creation by advancing its goals through a company-wide approach [to] sustainability."" Scope 1 and 2 emissions cover direct emissions from company-owned or controlled sources as well as indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating and cooling consumed by company. Meanwhile, Scope 3 includes all other indirect emissions that occur throughout the company's value chain. The omission of Scope 3 is unsurprising, as Aramco has not yet reported these indirect emissions in the three years since it began external reporting. The company did, however, expand the reporting boundaries of Scope 2 in 2019 to include affiliates under Aramco's control, which include Saudi Aramco Jubail Refinery (SASREF), Motiva in the US and Netherlands-based chemicals specialist Arlanxeo. However, most of the company's extensive downstream slate is not included in Scope 1 and 2 reporting and it remains to be seen whether Scope 3 emissions will be covered in Aramco's long-awaited Sustainability Report when it is published in mid-2022. President and CEO Amin Nasser said: ""The road ahead will be complex, as the world's transition to a more sustainable energy future will require collective action and major technological breakthroughs. But we remain focused on delivering reliable and affordable energy, investing for the long term as our efforts to further reduce emissions gain momentum."" Hydrogen hopesAramco's strategic repositioning has been in the works for some time and despite the effort to reduce the emissions of its operations, hydrocarbons will remain firmly at the core of the business. This was highlighted during the Saudi Green Initiative Forum by Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, who said that the giant Jafurah unconventional gas basin would be leveraged to produce blue hydrogen as the country seeks to extend its leadership of the oil sector into hydrogen. ""We are the biggest adventurers when it comes to blue hydrogen,"" he said. Prince Abdulaziz added: ""We're putting our money where our mouth is on hydrogen. We have a terrific gas base in Jafurah we will use it to generate blue hydrogen."" Under its preliminary $110bn plans, Aramco intends to kick off production at Jafurah in early 2024 and achieve 2.2bn cubic feet (62mn cubic metres) per day of sales gas by 2036. It is also expected to produce around 550,000 barrels per day (bpd) of NGLs and condensates. The first phase is seen producing 1.1 bcf (31 mcm) per day of raw gas, which will be processed at a facility on-site. Aramco announced that it had received regulatory approval from the Ministry of Energy to proceed with the expansion of the Kingdom's unconventional gas production capabilities in February 2020. The main focus of the initiative is Jafurah, which holds an estimated 200 trillion cubic feet of gas (5.7 trillion cubic metres), around half of which is comprised of liquids. The field is Saudi Arabia's largest deposit of unconventional gas. The comments mark the first time either Aramco or Riyadh have put any flesh on the bones of loose plans to become a major player in the nascent hydrogen industry. In June, Aramco's chief technology officer Ahmad al-Khowaiter said: ""We're going to have a large share"" of the market. However, reiterating views aired during a company event in February, he added: ""The scale up isn't going to happen before 2030. We're not going to see large volumes of blue ammonia before then."" He added: ""From the time you make clear off-take agreements, you're talking about a five- to six-year capital cycle to invest in the production and conversion requirements ... You're talking about a pretty long timescale."" In February, he had said that Aramco doesn't ""see much growth in [the] market until 2030, when the infrastructure and policies will be in place. We think Japan and South Korea will be where the first hydrogen trading markets will begin in the end of 2020s, early 2030s."" With that said, the executive anticipates that Aramco may spend around $1bn to capture carbon for every 1mn tonnes of blue ammonia it produces, excluding the cost of gas production. The company has already dipped its toe into the emerging market with a pilot project alongside the Japan's Institute of Energy Economics (IEEJ) last year. In September, Aramco shipped its first cargo of blue ammonia to Japan to be used in zero-carbon power generation. The 40-tonne shipment was generated by Aramco and was made in collaboration with Saudi Arabian Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) and IEEJ. Aramco said that during the process of generating the ammonia, it had captured 50 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2). 30 tonnes will be used in methanol production at SABIC's Ibn-Sina facility, with the remainder to be used in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) at Aramco's `Uthmaniyah field. In a presentation, Aramco said that the production of blue ammonia had spanned the entire value chain, supporting the company's recent claims of investing in the circular economy. Natural gas was taken from `Uthmaniyah and converted to hydrogen at a dedicated facility in Jubail, with the CO2 captured at a nearby facility and returned to `Uthmaniyah and sent to Jubail Methanol Plant. Nitrogen was added to the hydrogen at the Jubail Ammonia Plant to create blue ammonia, which was then dispatched by sea to Japan, where it will be separated and used to power the 50-kW Koriyama micro gas turbine, the 2-MW Yokohama gas turbine and a co-firing boiler in Aioi. For Aramco, blue hydrogen and ammonia appear to be the perfect solution to the company's desire to reduce emissions while remaining relevant in a market that is demanding cleaner fuels. \l"

As the meeting commenced, His Highness Sheikh Mohamed extended his heartfelt condolences for Johnson and his family on the death of his mother. Johnson extended thanks and appreciation for His Highness Sheikh Mohamed's warm feelings.His Highness Sheikh Mohamed and the UK Prime Minister reviewed cooperation and the promising opportunities to enhance it in the investment, economic and trade fields and other vital sectors as part of the ambitious economic, trade and investment programme that the two countries agreed upon last year.The meeting touched on the latest COVID-19 pandemic developments, and the efforts to contain its humanitarian and economic repercussions and the importance of strengthening international solidarity during these circumstances to overcome this common global challenge. It also highlighted the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), which will be hosted by the UK next November as well as its importance in advancing global efforts to address the climate change challenge.Moreover, the two sides exchanged views on regional and global issues of mutual interest and the current developments in the Middle East region and the Mediterranean and the efforts to find a peaceful solution to the ongoing conflicts.His Highness Sheikh Mohamed emphasised that the UAE attaches special importance to its relations with the UK, is keen on developing them, especially in the economic, trade, technological domains and others, as part of implementing the ""economic, trade and investment cooperation programme"" that the two countries agreed upon in December 2020.His Highness Sheikh Mohamed said, ""One of the most important aspects of our developmental projects for the next 50 years is promoting developmental partnerships with various countries of the world, especially with the UK.""He also stressed that Britain shares historic ties and strategic interests with the Arab Gulf region and the Middle East and has a significant role in ensuring their security and stability and dealing with their issues.The UK Prime Minister emphasised that his country attaches special importance to enhancing its ties with the UAE. He also extended thanks and appreciation for the UAE's support in evacuating UK citizens, and citizens of many other countries, from Afghanistan.His Highness Sheikh Mohamed and Johnson drew attention to the importance of the ""Partnership for the Future"", which the two sides agreed to establish, and which is based on two main pillars: driving sustainable prosperity and addressing global issues, in addition to using this partnership as a launch pad to develop new mechanisms that enhance trade, investment, innovation and enhance cooperation in areas including life sciences, innovation, energy, regional issues, illicit finance, education, security, development, culture, climate, health and food security.His Highness Sheikh Mohamed and the British Prime Minister welcomed the signing of a partnership agreement between Mubadala Investment Company and the UK Office for Investment (OfI), worth ?10 billion, which aims to expand the scope of the sovereign investment partnership between the two countries.Among those who attended the meeting in the delegation of His Highness Sheikh Mohamed included H.H.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE298","UAE's SME landscape","October 31, 2021","Gulf Business","With an estimated windfall of more than $30bn in value add, Expo 2020 Dubai is forecast to have a significant impact not only on Dubai's economy but on that of the UAE and the wider Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region well into the future. In the year that the UAE celebrates the 50th anniversary of its formation as a federation, Dubai and the UAE will be front and centre of the world stage for business and innovation. This is also the year in which Dubai Plan 2021 and the UAE's Vision 2021 plan move closer to fruition \- ambitious targets, outlining optimistic and aspirational strategic goals for the economy, people and government. But what specific benefits can Expo 2020 bring, and how can it boost the SME landscape to help entrepreneurs in the UAE and beyond? BOOST TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT Expo 2020 Dubai is a big deal. This is the first time in its entire history that the event has been hosted in the MENA region. Being held amid the coronavirus pandemic, it will be the largest global gathering since 2019, with between 20 and 25 million visits expected over six months. In short, it will be a face-to-face celebration of the triumph of innovation and the power of human collaboration \- a chance to underscore the post-pandemic relevance of its three subthemes: opportunity, mobility and sustainability. This appeal is expected to bring in between $100bn and $150bn in foreign direct investment (FDI) across sectors such as financial services, tourism, hospitality, real estate and infrastructure, and construction. With the focus moving inevitably towards sustainability (COP26 opens just weeks after Expo 2020 kicks off), the event will be a chance to show off the UAE's green credentials, as it invests heavily in renewable and sustainable energy and promotes green growth. Expo 2020 itself has a target to obtain 50 per cent of its energy requirement from renewables, including the first mega-sized application of integrated solar and photovoltaic generation. Entrepreneurs and business owners keen to take advantage of the greener landscape are thus more likely to see the UAE as a natural place to seek investment for green innovation technology. And the figures speak for themselves: despite the pandemic's negative impact on FDI flows, Dubai maintained high investor confidence in 2020, with total estimated FDI capital flows reaching Dhs24.7bn, not far off the Dhs28.6bn total for 2015. How could this benefit your SME? Even if you're not currently looking for inward investment, the greater the foreign investment interested in the UAE, the greater the economic boost to the region. The entire business ecosystem and economy will be positively affected, which means that SMEs here \- both local and international \- will see a boost in activity and business. International investors have long been attracted to Dubai because it represents an increasingly favourable destination for FDI. Major legislative steps have already been taken to promote Dubai as worthy of international investment; the 2016 bankruptcy law modernised the UAE's previously unpredictable insolvency laws. And a 2018 UAE investment law has, for the first time, allowed foreign equity ownership of up to 100 per cent of onshore UAE companies in certain strategic sectors. In addition, foreign investors see it as an ideal access point into regional markets. As the gateway between east and west, and within an eight-hour flight of two-thirds of the world's population, it presents an opportunity to gain access to more than 1.7 billion consumers in MENA, Pakistan and India. This further enhances Dubai's reputation as a global platform for trade and investment. As the world focuses on Dubai and the UAE, Expo 2020 will give the region a unique chance to showcase those advantages. INCREASE IN JOBS AND THE TALENT POOL Enhanced economic activity is expected to create nearly 300,000 new jobs in Dubai and throughout the UAE, and attract an entirely new talent pool. Some predict that Expo 2020 will have a significant impact on the wider region too, with 60 jobs being generated across the MENA region for every one created in the UAE. In total, up to 905,200 job-years are forecast to be supported by the Expo between 2013-2031 \- the equivalent to approximately 49,700 full-time-equivalent (FTE) jobs per annum. How could this benefit your SME? Enhanced economic activity will attract more talent to the UAE and create more business opportunities for SME owners and entrepreneurs. Expo 2020 has awarded 4,500 contracts, more than half of which have been won by SMEs, representing an investment of nearly Dhs5bn and guaranteeing some 12,600 job-years. In addition, entrepreneurs, startups and small businesses can take advantage of the government's District 2020 strategic partnerships with Dubai SME and the Mohammed Bin Rashid Innovation Fund, to pursue expansion through the District 2020 platform. During its legacy period (April 2022 to December 2031), Expo 2020 site will be redeveloped to further ease new business set-ups; over 80 per cent is planned to be retained for District 2020, and it will eventually provide a home for a mix of corporations and SMEs. District 2020's development is designed to embody the UAE's Vision 2021 by supporting sustainable economic development and creating a business ecosystem that underpins growth industries like transport, tourism, construction and education. NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES With several companies having opened offices in the UAE in the lead-up to the Expo, more business opportunities have been created and will continue to be created over the next six-eight months and beyond. How can we be so sure? Because, even without the added boost of a World Expo, the region has been relentlessly pushing an SME agenda to encourage growth. In the UAE, the government has, for many years, been championing small businesses, with Dubai SME offering support to entrepreneurs in all phases of development. Further aid has been available from agencies such as Dubai Future Accelerators, which helps entrepreneurs to use the city as a 'testbed for creating solutions to the global challenges of tomorrow'. Initiatives like these have, over the last few years, translated into tangible benefits for SME owners, with the UAE ranking 21st out of 190 in The World Bank's Doing Business 2018 report, jumping to 16th place in its 2020 ease of doing business ranking. In addition, government-backed accelerators like StartAd in Abu Dhabi, not to mention Abu Dhabi's own Khalifa Fund,have been helping to create a flourishing ecosystem to encourage SMEs to thrive. The massive influx of investment as a result of Expo 2020 can only enhance these opportunities further. How could this benefit your SME? With roughly 25 million visits expected at Expo 2020, startups and SMEs will enjoy significantly more exposure to potential investors, partners and collaborators. It's the perfect time to leverage your products and services, and a unique opportunity for enhanced networking in an environment where people are open and willing to engage. Expo 2020 presents business owners with a unique international business platform for marketing your business to an audience of local, regional, and global consumers and investors. A reported 80 per cent of attendees are coming to Dubai expecting to be able to hold networking and collaborative events, with the ultimate aim of expanding global trade. Expo 2020 is a one-off platform for UAE business owners to expand into new markets and develop long-lasting business ties under the auspices of innovation, as well as sustainable development and growth.

Mellbin, Danish Ambassador to UAE and Qatar, told Emirates News Agency (WAM).The UAE and the USA, with support from the United Kingdom, Brazil, Denmark, Israel, Singapore, Australia, and Uruguay, announced the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for Climate) at President Biden's Leaders Summit on Climate on 23rd April 2021. It aims to increase and accelerate global agricultural innovation and research and development (R&D) over the next five years, to address climate change.The Initiative was unveiled during the remarks made by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, and Ruler of Dubai during the second day of the Leaders Summit on Climate, and leverages international cooperation on a vital challenge of global significance.The Danish envoy pointed out that Agriculture is a critical sector for the world, and more innovation is needed to successfully balance the difficult nexus between climate change, food security and sustainability.Denmark has very high ambitions for its own agricultural sector and has set a goal of reducing the sector's emissions with 0.5 million tonnes of CO2. This will be done by improving growth technologies such as more frequent leaching of manure, he said.The government is also investing in new technologies, such as pyrolysis and biorefining of grass, which may reduce CO2 emissions with as much as 5 million tonnes. ""Overall, we believe that the transition to climate-smart agriculture will benefit the sector in the long run,"" the envoy noted.""Denmark looks forward to working with our partners to advance the AIM for Climate initiative and we hope more countries will join the initiative towards COP26 in Glasgow,"" the ambassador said.As announced earlier, AIM for Climate will address the principal challenges related to the agricultural sector and climate change, including emissions, food security and water security. The sector is currently responsible for 24 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions, and as the world's population continues to grow, innovations in efficient, productive farming techniques can reduce the sector's environmental impacts, make healthy food more available and create new economic opportunities, skills and jobs.WAM/ Ibrahim Shukralla\l"

Just how big that influence is will be laid out on Monday by the IPCC, which signals its level of confidence in scientific conclusions using labels such as likely, very likely, extremely likely and virtually certain.IPCC spokesman Jonathan Lynn said the assessment, which is the body's sixth since 1990, is getting into a cutting edge area of science, where we can increasingly say to what extent climate change is responsible for extreme weather events, disasters and so on happening around the world.The last comprehensive assessment was in 2013-14, and since then Earth has experienced six of the warmest years on record.Globally, the average surface temperature is about 1.2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and barrelling towards the 1.5-degree threshold, scientists say humans must stay at or below to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change.World leaders will meet at the COP26 Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, in November, in what is being described as the most important meeting on the climate crisis since the 2015 Paris summit.In the 2015 Paris climate accord, nations set a goal of staying below 2 degrees, and preferably to 1.5 degrees, by cutting greenhouse gas emissions.If not, the consensus is that extreme weather, including droughts and flooding, will become more common, sea levels will rise higher, Arctic ice will melt more swiftly, and many plants and animals will be unable to adapt.Human action was more tightly linked to climate change in each of the previous five IPCC assessments. Although the findings set off alarm bells among environmental campaigners and in some corridors of power, the world has continued to fall behind on its climate goals.But a slew of recent disasters has once again underscored the urgency of the crisis, from the wildfires and heatwaves scorching southern Europe and North America's west, to widespread flooding in China and Germany.The document is also set to offer forward-looking assessments of our possible future world given different emissions scenarios.The IPCC does not conduct its research, rather it summarises the state of scientific knowledge on climate change.The new assessment, which will be delivered in parts until 2022, involved 234 authors from 66 countries. Their findings are bundled for political decision-makers in a paper that the 195 member countries of the IPCC then approve.The second part of the IPCC\~assessment will deal with impacts, adaptation and vulnerability to climate change, while the third looks at mitigation efforts. A final document synthesising the three earlier efforts will then be released at some point next year, said the dpa report.\l"

News, have arrived with the publication of their mid-year analysis of the energy sector. The data presented examined electricity production in 27 major EU nations across the first six months of the year and compared it to the same period in 2020, and in 2019 before the pandemic.The think tank believes that the reasons why electricity production from wind and solar is about 50% cheaper than fossil fuels stems from the continually rising cost of coal. In addition, the now increasing demand for electricity has also had an impact as Covid restrictions have eased around the world.Looking to switch energy provider? Find the best deals near youFossil fuels are being outpaced by renewablesOther notable findings from the research include how electricity use Europe-wide is now 'back to pre-pandemic levels', but the 'consistent growth' of renewables is significantly outpacing that of fossil fuels.When compared to the first half of 2019, coal generation was 16% lower, while clean energy use has also been shown to have increased in the first half of the year - as it now provides two-thirds of power to the 27 EU countries Ember analysed.More needs to be done to reduce reliance on fossil fuelsHowever, despite the encouraging data that suggests a big shift towards further production of renewables, Charles Moore, Ember's Europe lead, has still called for more to be done to 'reduce reliance on fossil fuels for energy' and reduce emissions.Speaking on the matter, Charles Moore said: ""There's never been a better time to accelerate the transition to wind and solar with the costs of sticking with fossil fuels painfully clear.""There's a clear consensus: it is no longer credible for rich nations to target net zero by 2050 without near-term plans to secure 100 per cent clean power by 2035.""Mr Moore added: ""With all eyes on the UK as it hosts the critical COP26 climate conference, the UK should make this commitment and join Biden to catalyse a new high ambition coalition on clean power.""What this might mean for consumers If this trend and preference for renewables continues with our energy creation, it may lead to a greater choice of green tariffs from energy suppliers. On top of this, these tariffs may also become more affordable as the markets become more competitive \- meaning cheaper energy bills in the long run.There will also be the wider environmental benefits from reduced emissions, plus a necessity for more supplies of renewables could mean investment in facilities and farms, creating more green job opportunities.Better still, the popularity of green tariffs has also grown in recent years and some of the best energy suppliers around are now offering these to customers.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE314","The case for a food systems stability board","August 31, 2021 Tuesday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","ReutersThe Covid-19 pandemic, rising rates of global poverty and inequality, persistent conflict, and the escalating climate and biodiversity crises are shocks and stresses that together contribute to increasing hunger, as well as growing food and nutrition insecurity. To help tackle this urgent problem more effectively and make the global food system more stable and resilient, governments should consider establishing a new, multilateral, United Nations-led Food Systems Stability Board (FSSB).Today, between 720 million and 811 million people  about 10 per cent of the world's population  go to bed hungry every night, and at least 2.4 billion lack access to a healthy and nutritious diet. Absent major international action, these trends are likely to persist. The latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change demonstrates that global warming's effects have left no region untouched, with significant implications for the food system over the coming decades.Food systems underpin the security of the global economy, as well as national security in many countries: hunger and lack of access to food have historically driven civil unrest. These systems are also among the principal drivers of ecosystem loss and climate change, with agriculture and land-use change responsible for a quarter of global greenhouse-gas emissions. At the same time, ecosystems such as forests, mangroves, and the ocean are central to humanity's efforts to adapt to the climatic changes already underway.Ensuring the long-term resilience of the global food system will require a significant multilateral collaborative effort. This should build on existing structures and institutions such as the Committee on World Food Security, the Food and Agriculture Organisation, the World Food Programme, and the World Bank. It will also demand concerted attention from heads of state and government, ministers of finance, and the leaders of multilateral financial institutions.A quartet of international meetings  the UN Food Systems Summit in September 2021, the G20 summit in October, the UN climate conference (COP26) in November, and the Nutrition for Growth Summit hosted by the Japanese government in December  offer a rare opportunity to focus international attention on the hunger and food-security crisis, and its links to the changing climate. Each of these gatherings could pave the way for the creation of an FSSB of national governments and international organisations working to address this issue. This could be part of a broader global effort to enhance food governance and achieve  in the words of the government of Indonesia, which will hold the G20 presidency in 2022  a ""just and affordable transition towards net zero"".Moreover, there is an encouraging precedent for such a body. The Financial Stability Board (FSB), established by G20 finance ministers in April 2009 with the aim of preventing a repeat of the 2008 global financial crisis, has positively contributed to global macroeconomic stability and is now an authoritative, independent, and well-respected body. Its findings directly influence the decision-making of G20 finance ministers, as well as that of the heads of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the regional development banks.In a similar fashion, an FSSB, if established, would be charged with promoting the health and resilience of the global food system, including by addressing issues such as price stability, trade, strategic reserves, and the effects of climate change on production. The board would fully respect national sovereignty, and not issue legally binding recommendations. Rather, it would give credible advice to governments on how to build a food system that is better prepared to withstand future shocks and ensure greater global access to nutritious food.While governments would decide the precise scope, structure, and composition of an FSSB, we believe the body could play a helpful role in several ways. For example, it could analyse early-warning systems and risk-modelling data on hunger, agriculture, and climate, including from the existing Agricultural Market Information System database. It could also advise the World Trade Organisation and national governments on food-related trade policies, while helping countries respond to changing market dynamics and a volatile climate.Additionally, the FSSB could support and enable countries to submit voluntary five-year food system risk assessments and resilience plans. It could also gather and share knowledge about global food-trade vulnerabilities, such as those relating to climate change, conflict, lack of crop diversity, pollinator loss, and other threats, and identify and review the regulatory, supervisory, and voluntary measures needed to address them.The FSSB could support contingency planning for cross-border crisis management, especially with regard to systemically important food crops or areas particularly affected by climate vulnerability, biodiversity loss, and/or future pandemics. Lastly, the board could collaborate with the IMF to include more consideration of risks related to climate, biodiversity, and food and land-use systems in the Fund's regular Article IV consultations with member countries.The FSSB could comprise relevant national representatives from ministries of agriculture and rural affairs, trade and commerce, health, environment, and finance, as well as international standard-setters and leading scientists in the field of global food-system risks. As with the FSB, the institution's audience would be member states, including heads of government, finance ministers, and other portfolios.The current absence of an FSSB is a notable gap in the international governance architecture required to bolster the sustainability, equity, and resilience of the global food system in the twenty-first century and beyond. At the UN General Assembly and UN Food Systems Summit  both taking place in September  governments could agree to initiate a one-year consultation process to explore the creation of such a body. By doing so, they could contribute to a better future for hundreds of millions of vulnerable people  and ensure access to food and security for all.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE315","KT edit: G7 should lead the world on a greener path","June 13, 2021 Sunday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","Our world is changing faster than we or our political class cares to admit. The changing weather across countries, warming seas, dying corals, fauna and flora are calling our attention to their dire state, yet we remain myopic in our views. Economic growth, development, older ways of life run by fossil fuels are more prized than taking a hard look at our future. Sir David Attenborough, arguably the most distinguishable voice for our planet, rightly warned humans could be ""on the verge of destabilising the entire planet"". What we need is collective action to protect life as we know it on this blue planet, and G7 is one of the strongest groups that could take the lead and influence the world in greener ways. However, the political will to tackle this most pressing issue of our times seems to be lacking.On Sunday, the concluding day for the G7 summit, the leaders of seven rich countries made a statement announcing increased funding for climate change projects. However, individual pledges on how much each nation will contribute are missing. These numbers are important. Climate financing is a sticky point and often the lack of funding, especially in developing countries, is the reason why some good projects cannot take off as envisioned. Poor countries need the support of richer nations to be able to drive growth and change without putting strain on the limited resources we have.Tackling climate change isn't only about transforming energy systems but also about adapting to our changing climatic conditions. The efforts should go beyond that. The plan should include spending on reforestation and coastal defence systems. Efforts need to be made to cut emissions at a faster pace and find ways to adapt to rising temperatures. Just as important as funding is how it is being spent. Cities and countries need transformative projects that can steer change in the way we consume energy. Installing solar plants in cities or building more hydropower facilities at a time when the world is becoming warmer and hence future flow of water could decrease drastically isn't the best option. The money should be used in diversifying energy sources. Agriculture, forest and land-related initiatives have historically struggled for funding, even when these are responsible for almost one-quarter of the past decade's emissions.The G7 has done well to announce its intentions to increase funding to tackle climate change. However, respective countries should announce their individual contributions as well and ensure that they are followed through. It is good to see that all countries, including the US, are on the same page and realise the grave challenges that we collectively face. It was the West that drove the industrial revolution, and now it is time for the bloc again to take the lead and drive change for a green revolution. The G7's 'green belt and road' plan to provide green financing to developing world is also a good step. By the time of the COP26 climate summit in November, the world's largest industrialised democracies should have a plan and structure in place to lead the world on a greener path.Click/tap here to subscribe to Khaleej Times news alerts on Telegram.\l"

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE318","Green Pakistan to fight climate change","August 14, 2021 Saturday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","Climate change triggered by the increased emissions of green-house gases is undoubtedly the biggest challenge facing humanity in the twenty first century. Admittedly the failure of the international community to check the continued rise in temperature caused by the emission of green-house gases, can lead to catastrophic consequences. Therefore, as repeatedly reiterated by the UN Secretary General it is absolutely essential to make peace with the nature, meaning thereby that there was no escape from keeping the rising temperatures below 1.5 centigrade as emphasised by the scientists and environmental experts.A report released by UN on August 8, 2021 called 'Code Red for Humanity' says that the earth was getting so hot that temperatures in about a decade would probably blow past a level of warming that the world leaders have sought to prevent.The climate change phenomenon has already started having devastating impact globally and Pakistan is among the top 10 countries which have been bearing the brunt of this climatic onslaught during the last twenty years. While the world is still indecisive  and some countries including the major pollutants are even showing reluctance to cut down on greenhouse emissions preferring industrial growth over it  the developing countries including Pakistan perforce have to devise their own strategies to minimise the impact of the climate change till such time a collective will and commitment of the global community crystallises into concrete actions to deal with the challenge.Pakistan, under the stewardship of Prime Minister Imran Khan, has given top priority to putting in place steps and measures that can be helpful in lessening the debilitating impact of the climate change. The central theme of the effort is to make Pakistan clean and green. It has launched a number of initiatives including the landmark 10-Billion Tree Tsunami which has won international acclaim, including from the World Economic Forum.Pakistan can also rightly boast about myriad of other initiatives including green economic stimulus, Eco-system Protection, Wild life management, Protected Areas initiative and Pakistan Clean Air Programme. Prime Minister Imran Khan has also inaugurated the world's biggest Miyawaki urban forest near Lahore on August 9 as part of monsoon drive under the 10-billion Tree Tsunami Project. All the foregoing steps in the words of Prime Minister are driven solely by his commitment to future generations of a clean and green Pakistan to mitigate the impact of climate change.It is pertinent to note that Pakistan besides the measures mentioned above has also launched the initiative to produce 60 per cent of all energy in the country through renewable resources by the year 2030. It has already scrapped two coal power projects, which were supposed to generate 2,600MW of electricity and replaced them with hydro-power units.Prime Minister Imran Khan has been a vociferous advocate of collective action by the world community on climate change. In recognition of his discourses at the Convention of Biodiversity, in the UN General Assembly and the nature based solutions devised by his government, UNEP approached Pakistan for hosting the UN Environment Day 2021. Prime Minister Imran Khan addressing the moot apprised the world community regarding future plans of this government to deal with climate change, including Recharge Pakistan designed to divert flood water to wetland to recharge water table and mangroves forestation, which absorb carbon besides green-house gases. Explaining the threat faced by Pakistan due to climate change, he also urged the need for the world to pay attention to reducing carbon emissions, which cause melting of the glaciers, hence posing threats to countries like Pakistan and Central Asia where rivers were fed by glaciers. He also called on the world community to assist the poor countries, including Pakistan, which were bearing the brunt of this phenomenon.Pakistan also co-chaired the multibillion-dollar Green Climate Fund, established to support climate actions in developing countries, last year. Pakistan as Vice President of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has also been playing a pro-active role in shaping the global discourse on fighting global warming.Perhaps a cursory glance at efforts at the international level to deal with the climate challenge would be quite relevant here. The first ever international Agreement on restricting emissions of green-house gases known as Kyoto Protocol was adopted on December 11, 1997. The Protocol operationalised the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change by committing industrialized countries and economies in transition to limit and reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions in accordance with agreed individual targets. Those targets were stipulated to be met in two phases. But regrettably the required cooperation from the participating countries did not come forth. New Zealand, and Russia did participate in Kyoto's first round but did not take on new targets in the second commitment period. Canada withdrew from the Protocol in 2012 and the USA did not ratify it at all.The second international agreement known as Paris Agreement, was signed on December 12, 2015 during the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's (UNFCCC) 21st Conference of the Parties. The Paris Agreement marked a historic turning point for global climate action, as the world leaders were able to evolve a consensus on its framework and goals. But regrettably President Donald Trump pulled out of the Agreement like he did in case of other international commitments by US.However, it is satisfying to note that the US President Joe Biden has announced to rejoin the Paris Agreement. Not only that, in view of the urgency involved he also convened leaders for the summit on Climate on April 22-23, 2021, attended by 41 countries including Pakistan. The Summit underscored the urgency and the economic benefits of stronger climate action. Its deliberations are considered to be a key milestone on the road to the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) this November in Glasgow.While Pakistan celebrates its 75th Independence Day this year on August 14, the nation apart from other moves initiated by the government to achieve the objectives of independence, can rightly take pride in the fact that it has not only set the ball rolling in the right direction in regards to saving the country from the vagaries of the climate change but has also made a sterling contribution to this global cause. The initiatives taken by Pakistan are surely worth emulating by the world community, particularly the developing countries.Click/tap here to subscribe to Khaleej Times news alerts on Telegram.\l"

The Agency's 1.5 C pathway foresees the creation of up to 122 million energy-related jobs in 2050, more than double today's 58 million. Renewable energy alone will account for more than a third of all energy jobs employing 43 million people globally, supporting the post-COVID recovery and long-term economic growth.IRENA's World Energy Transitions Outlook sees renewables-based energy systems instigating profound changes that will reverberate across economies and societies. Sharp adjustments in capital flows and a reorientation of investments are necessary to align energy with a positive economic and environmental trajectory. Forward-looking policies can accelerate transition, mitigate uncertainties, and ensure maximum benefits of energy transition. The annual investment of USD 4.4 trillion needed on average is high.

This step will allow the two countries to deepen their shared commitment to peace and security by working hand-in-hand on global and regional issues including Africa and the Middle East.Both sides expressed their anticipation of the UAE's Golden Jubilee celebrations and the upcoming Expo 2020 Dubai as essential milestones that will further develop the UAE-France partnership.\l"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE323","How to ensure 'Green Swans' don't change the colour","June 20, 2021 Sunday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","Steam rises from the Miller Coal Power Plant in Adamsville, Alabama.  AFPThe statistician Nassim Nicholas Taleb coined the term ""black swan"" to describe improbable, hard-to-predict events that can have a massive impact on the economy. The authors of a recent report have now introduced into the taxonomy of finance the phrase ""green swans"" events caused by climate change and biodiversity loss.The appearance of green swans is arguably more predictable than that of black swans, as climate change makes them unavoidable. But there are no historical comparisons to help us understand how climate and ecological risks such as cyclones, wildfires, droughts, and floods might affect the banking system, the insurance industry, or any number of other economic activities.As economic activity is reallocated from fossil fuels to clean energy sources, some activities will disappear, others will emerge, and the value of ""stranded assets"" will plummet. Although this process is necessary, it must be managed in a way that does not create instability in the financial system.Owing to their financial-stability mandate, central banks, supervisors, and macro-prudential authorities have a central role to play in the green transition. The recent Green Swan Conference organised by the Bank for International Settlements, the Banque de France, the International Monetary Fund, and the NGFS (Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System) points to a growing recognition of this fact, though the mobilisation remains too slow and too timid in some geographic areas.With an eye towards anticipating the effects of climate risk, the Banque de France was the first central bank to introduce a comprehensive climate stress test for banks and insurance companies. Analysing three 30-year climate scenarios devised by the NGFS (an orderly transition based on a low-carbon strategy; a disorderly, late transition; and a business-as-usual scenario), the test sought to assess banking and insurance portfolios' exposure to both physical and transition risks.This exercise showed that the French system's current exposure is only moderate (under the assumptions used). More important, the climate stress test demonstrated what it will take to improve our understanding of climate risk.There is much more work to do. For example, we still lack databases detailing the geographical conditions throughout global value chains. This information is essential to assess physical risks to production, and it would also be useful for monitoring social and environmental governance issues more broadly.The increased frequency and severity of weather-related disasters will gradually come to be reflected in insurance coverage and costs, affecting profitability and the default rates of loan portfolios in the banking sector. At the same time, bankers and asset managers will be adjusting their portfolios accordingly. And if the price of carbon continues to rise, as it should, they will move away from carbon-intensive sectors, increasing their exposure to other risk factors. These time-varying behaviours (and their knock-on effects) will matter for financial stability; but they are difficult to model. Still, a few essential policies would greatly help macro-prudential authorities and investors manage the change. First, those embarking on the green transition will need a compass: there should be a fully predictable increase in the carbon price across as wide an economic area as possible. The European Union could be on the right track here with its Emissions Trading System, wherein the price of carbon has risen from \€ 25 ($30) per tonne in January 2020 to \€ 50 per tonne today. But progress remains limited, because the ETS covers only about 40 per cent of EU emissions.As a recent G30 report shows, credible commitments to deliver a predictably increasing carbon price are needed to enable investors, regulators, and monetary policymakers to adjust their strategies in a forward-looking manner. In their absence, we will be unable to unleash public and private investment in the structural adjustments needed to reduce the costs of the broader transition. To achieve this, independent carbon councils can manage carbon-price inflation in a similar manner to how central banks manage inflation affecting the prices of goods. These institutions should have a mandate to map out a carbon-price-inflation path aligned with their respective governments' 2050 net-zero objectives. These policies must be accompanied by compensation of those most affected by a decl"

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE325","Focus must be on ways to accelerate Global Britain","June 8, 2021 Tuesday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","Sceptics have long argued that the United Kingdom is past its peak and trading largely on former glories. They point to the country's middling rankings in the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment education scores, the fact that only one British firm, HSBC, is among the world's 50 largest public corporations, compared to Germany's four, and the likelihood that Brexit will ultimately erode, rather than boost, Britain's global standing.But I disagree with this judgment. After all, the UK is one of only a handful of countries to have produced an effective Covid-19 vaccine in record time. It remains at the forefront of shaping the global green-energy transition, and it was the first major economy to enact legislation requiring it to end its contribution to global warming by 2050. Moreover, the UK retains its traditional strengths of language, location and time zone, strong universities, and deep financial markets, and it remains a standard-bearer for the rule of law.When the UK hosts the upcoming G7 summit in Cornwall, political and business leaders will want to see how well aligned the country is with the three issues that, collectively, will upend global commerce and catalyse economic growth in the coming decades: engagement with China, technological innovation, and clean energy.With respect to China, Britain has considerable scope to increase bilateral trade. UK exports to China in 2019 were \£330.7 billion ($43.5 billion), little more than one-third of Germany's total of $110 billion. In fact, 2020 was the fifth successive year in which China was Germany's largest trading partner.Britain thus urgently needs to expand its trade and investment links with China, which is set to dominate the global economy. China is already the largest trading partner and foreign direct investor for many developed and developing countries, and it is now the largest lender to emerging-market economies  bigger than the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the Paris Club of sovereign creditors.Of course, human-rights concerns and ideological differences pose an ethical challenge for Britain when dealing with China. But stepping away from engagement with the Chinese political class would limit the UK's ability to influence the regime in Beijing and risk setting back the British economy.In terms of technology, Britain's role in developing the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine underscores its strengths in medical science innovation  as evidenced by a thriving biotech and life sciences sector. And yet the UK has yet to develop a technology company of global stature and renown, and recent stock-market activity has sent mixed messages to investors. The initial public offerings of food-delivery company Deliveroo and semiconductor technology firm Alphawave were challenged: both companies' share prices fell sharply on their first day of trading and remained below their launch price weeks later.But the UK is well positioned to benefit from investments and advances in emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, that will undoubtedly transform education and healthcare in the coming years. Moreover, the country has real opportunities to help allies plug technological gaps  not least in semiconductors, where America's share of global output has fallen from 37 per cent in 1990 to just 12 per cent today.To realise its potential as a science superpower, the UK needs a technology hub that can rival Silicon Valley in its dynamism. That will require aggressively and deliberately building an ecosystem of talent and collaboration across data science, technology, and public policy.For example, the Oxford-Cambridge arc already supports two million jobs and adds \£3110 billion to the UK economy each year. But to rise to the next level, this region must become a vibrant environment for innovation, and be far more visible to leading global investors. This is particularly important given that global foreign direct investment had fallen for three consecutive years (2016-18) even before plummeting 42 per cent in the annus pandemicus of 2020.On energy, the UK has been a global front-runner in mitigating climate risk through carbon sequestration and capture, and setting a net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions target. And it has an important opportunity to bolster its credentials as an environmental and green-energy leader when it hosts the United Nations COP26 climate summit this autumn.Crucially, the UK has a chance to shift the discourse so that the green transition is not only about limiting the economic downside but also about maximising the upside. In particular, government support for larger-scale investments in solar, wind, hydrogen, biofuels, hydropower, geothermal energy, Generation IV nuclear reactors, and new battery technologies would yield massive returns.If Britain is to lead in the energy transition, new technologies, and engagement with China, it must overcome several obstacles. Above all, the currently fragmented ""Global Britain"" agenda needs to reflect much closer cooperation between the public and private sectors, and become clearer about how to track execution and measure success.The UK has a strong hand to play. But playing it well will require greater political vision. British leaders should set in motion a grand scheme that creates a long-term legacy  in the spirit of the Manhattan Project during World War II to develop the first nuclear weapons, or the US government's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which enabled the subsequent development of Silicon Valley.As the world emerges from the pandemic, the UK, as host to two major international summits this year, will find itself in the global spotlight. It must capitalise on this unique opportunity and seek to reposition itself for the twenty-first century.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE326","UAE, US Climate Envoys meet to build momentum on climate action ahead of COP 26","June 14, 2021 Monday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","ABU DHABI, 14th June, 2021 (WAM) -- The UAE and US Special Envoys for Climate met for talks Sunday in Abu Dhabi focused on leveraging climate action as an opportunity for regional and global economic growth. The United States Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, John Kerry, returned to the UAE capital on his first visit following the Leaders Summit on Climate in Washington in April to rally progress ahead of COP 26 that will be held in Glasgow in November.Sec. Kerry was greeted on his arrival by Dr Sultan Al Jaber, the UAE's Special Envoy for Climate Change and Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology.The visit is John Kerry's second trip to Abu Dhabi since he attended the UAE Regional Climate Dialogue in April, underlining the close collaborative relationship between the US and UAE and their common approach placing climate progress at the heart of domestic and foreign policies.During their meeting, the envoys reaffirmed their countries' commitment to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, aimed at limiting global warming through assertive climate action. They noted that a comprehensive approach- including investments in renewable energy, carbon capture technologies, nature-based solutions, climate-smart agriculture, and other low-carbon solutions is not only essential in this critical decade for climate, but can also act as powerful drivers for sustainable economic growth and job creation.Commenting on Sec. Kerry's return to the UAE, Dr Al Jaber said, ""Our wise leadership in the UAE gives high importance to strengthening cooperation with the international community in areas that support sustainable development, economic diversification, the welfare of humanity and preserving the environment. Hence, I am delighted to receive the U.S. Special Envoy for Climate, Kerry. His return to the Emirates reaffirms the unique partnership between our two countries and our shared commitment to transform climate action into an opportunity for economic development and diversification.""""Doubling down on investments in innovative new technologies and R&D will pay dividends both in terms of climate progress and economic growth, and as global economies fully recover from COVID-19, smart initiatives can put the world on a low carbon/high growth trajectory that meets the Paris goals.""The two envoys discussed progress on the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate Initiative (AIM for Climate) that the UAE announced alongside the US at the Leaders Summit on Climate in Washington in April. AIM for Climate is a global initiative currently supported by nine countries focused on increasing R&D investment and accelerating innovation into sustainable agricultural practices that can meet the needs of a growing global population with fewer environmental impacts. Recognising that the agricultural sector accounts for nearly a quarter of global GHG emissions, several additional country partners are expected to join the initiative in the months leading up to COP26.During his visit, Sec. Kerry welcomed the UAE's offer to host the 28th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP28) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2023, stating, ""I think it's terrific that there's interest. I think it's great. I personally can see strong arguments for the UAE's candidacy. You know it's not my decision alone or ours alone, at all, but the UAE is obviously a very strong contender for that. I think there are many reasons for the UAE presenting a very strong case.""He went on to express appreciation for the country's leading role in the region, as well as its holistic approach to mitigate the impact of climate change.""I think it is very important that an oil and gas producing nation is smart enough to see that investing in alternative and renewable energy does not detract from economic prosperity or from income. It actually builds additional and alternative sources. I think the leadership of the UAE is well aware that the planet has very serious problems, and the UAE is very busy looking at ways to abate and reduce and capture emissions. I think that's one of the reasons the UAE won a seat on the UN security council, because people see the leadership of the UAE as thoughtful and wanting to contribute to global solutions to global problems.""Sec Kerry's comments come after the joint statement issued by the UAE and the US after the UAE regional climate dialogue in April, in which both countries committed to working together to take on the climate challenge, by focusing joint efforts on renewable energy, hydrogen, industrial de-carbonization, carbon capture and storage, nature-based solutions, and low-carbon urban design.During his visit, Sec Kerry toured ADNOC's Panorama Digital Command Center, where he was shown the UAE's best in class tech-led approach to environmental responsibility within its hydrocarbon industry. Panorama uses AI, big data and blockchain to track all ADNOC's material data, including key environmental KPIs. ADNOC's established record as one of the least carbon intensive oil producers in the world is being enhanced by the expansion of its first in the region carbon capture utilization and storage facility.The UAE's multi-faceted approach to climate action cuts across innovation, climate finance and protection of natural ecosystems. As part of its multipronged approach to deal with climate change, the UAE has undertaken major conservation efforts that have brought indigenous endangered species, such as the Arabian Oryx and Hawksbill Turtle back from the brink of extinction. Over 140 square kilometres of mangrove forests along Abu Dhabi's coast have also been restored and 30 million more mangroves will be planted by 2030, further enhancing biodiversity while preventing coastal erosion and acting as powerful carbon sinks. These measures not only reduce the cost of climate impacts, but generate returns from improved human health, increasing quality of life and enhancing the UAE as an attractive place to live and work.\l"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE327","WAM Report: UAE leads on global climate action through green economy plans","June 22, 2021 Tuesday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","DUBAI, 22nd June, 2021 (WAM) -- The UAE attaches great importance to protecting the environment in its development policy, an approach it has adopted since 2012 through the 'UAE Green Growth Strategy', to transform its economy into a green economy by utilising modern technologies, knowledge, and innovation.The green and digital economy will become the starting point for recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic, the UAE has announced.The leadership considers the green economy as a tool to control economic growth and direct it towards sustainable development. It also focuses on protecting the environment, climate, natural resources and improving the quality of life. The UAE has won international leadership positions in the competitiveness indicators of the energy sector in general, and clean energy in particular, after seven international references agreed to classify it among the top 10 countries in the world with 18 sector-specific indicators in 2020.Despite the major challenges and economic slowdown worldwide in 2020, renewable energy has surfaced as a real alternative that heralds a better future.The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), stated that production capacity from renewable energy reached record levels surpassing past amounts and estimates. Some 260 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy were added globally, making around a 50 percent increase compared to the amount added in 2019. The renewable energy share has significantly increased for the second consecutive year, making 80 percent of the total generation capacity in the past year, with solar and wind accounting for 91 percent of new renewables.The UAE is among leading countries in adopting effective policies, such as the economic diversity policy which focuses on a green economy and diversifying energy sources. This is through capacity-building in clean and renewable energy, enhancing energy efficiency, transport, and sustainable urban planning. It is also at the forefront of regional countries in climate change policies since the Paris Agreement. In the beginning, it was committed to increasing its clean energy capacity to 24 percent by 2021. Later, this increased to 50 percent by 2050.The UAE adopts and shares an inspiring vision with the rest of the countries worldwide, working to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2030, and mitigate the effects of climate change and global warming. To achieve this, several federal and national strategies have been launched to consolidate sustainable development and shift to clean energy.Currently, Abu Dhabi and Dubai are making considerable advances in the generation and development of clean energy sources, mainly solar power. Recently, the world's biggest solar photovoltaic plant of 1,177MW at Sweihan in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi was commissioned on an Independent Power Producer (IPP) basis.Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) is currently implementing the fourth and fifth phases of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park. This will be the largest single-site solar park in the world with a planned capacity of 5,000 megawatts (MW) by 2030. Combining CSP and photovoltaic technology based on the IPP model, the fourth phase is the largest single-site CSP project in the world. The 950MW project has the world's tallest solar power tower measuring 262.44 metres in height and the largest thermal storage capacity in the world of 15 hours, generating power around the clock.""His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, launched the World Green Economy Organisation (WGEO) in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in 2016. We are striving to achieve this transition through the UAE Energy Strategy 2050, to increase the contribution of clean energy in the total energy mix to 50 percent by 2050, and the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050 to provide 75 percent of Dubai's total power capacity from clean energy sources by 2050. DEWA's efforts have resulted in a huge reduction of carbon emissions in Dubai,'said Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, MD & CEO of DEWA.Carbon emissions in Dubai were reduced by 22 percent in 2019, two years ahead of the target set by the Carbon Abatement Strategy to reduce it by 16 percent by 2021. Clean energy capacity in Dubai has reached nine percent of the energy mix in 2020, surpassing the target of Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050 to provide seven percent of Dubai's total power capacity from clean energy sources by 2020,"" he added.According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the demand for hydrogen as a power source has grown threefold in the past few decades, and its global production is estimated at 70 million metric tonnes annually. As a result, the costs of producing hydrogen are projected to fall by 64 percent by 2040. The country has already started pilot projects to position itself in the global hydrogen market.Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) set up the Green Hydrogen project, the first solar-powered green hydrogen production facility in the Middle East and North Africa. Located at the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, the plant is built to accommodate future applications and test platforms for the different uses of hydrogen, including potential mobility and industrial uses.Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company (Masdar) partnered with the Abu Dhabi Department of Energy, Etihad Airways, Lufthansa, Khalifa University for Science and Technology, Siemens, and Marubeni Corporation, in an initiative to support the development of Abu Dhabi's green hydrogen economy. They will establish a demonstration plant at Masdar City to explore the development of green hydrogen, sustainable fuels and e-kerosene production for transport, shipping, and aviation.DEWA is implementing a hydroelectric power station in Hatta, the first of its kind in the Arabian Gulf. It will generate electricity from a reservoir at Hatta Dam, delivering production capacity of around 250MW, with a storage capacity of 1,500MW and a life span of 80 years.As part of DEWA's space programme, Space-D will build DEWA's capabilities and train Emirati professionals to use space technologies to enhance its electricity and water networks. The programme will take advantage of Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain to exchange information with the help of satellite communications and earth observation technologies. The project features the launch of the main satellite equipped with the latest imaging and satellite communication technologies, which will take place in conjunction with Expo 2020 Dubai. The performance and efficiency of the photovoltaic solar panels at the solar park will be monitored using special cameras on the main satellite, which will also help study the impact of weather and climate change on energy infrastructure and supply.The Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MoCCAE) will host the MENA Climate Week 2022 from 23rd March, 2022, on the side-l"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE328","A global incentive to reduce emissions","June 7, 2021 Monday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","With President Joe Biden's administration recommitting the United States to the Paris climate agreement, and with a major United Nations climate-change conference (COP26) coming later this year, there is new hope for meaningful global policies to meet the challenge. But while mounting evidence of increasing climate volatility  unprecedented wildfires in Australia, droughts in California and Sub-Saharan Africa, intensifying hurricane and cyclone seasons  suggests that we must move fast in curbing planet-warming greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions, there are serious impediments to concluding any new global accord.Economists generally agree that the way to reduce GHG emissions is to tax them. But such taxes almost certainly will cause disruptive economic changes in the short run, which is why discussions of imposing them tend to run quickly into free-rider or fairness problems.For example, industrialised countries such as the US are concerned that while they work hard to reduce emissions, developing countries will keep pumping them out with abandon. But at the same time, developing countries like Uganda point out that there is profound inequity in asking a country that emitted just 0.13 tonnes of carbon dioxide per capita in 2017 to bear the same burden as the US or Saudi Arabia, with their respective per capita emissions of 16 and 17.5 tonnes.The least costly way to reduce global emissions would be to give every country similar incentives. While India should not keep building more dirty coal plants as it grows, Europe should be closing down the plants it already has. But each country will want to reduce emissions in its own way  some through taxation, others through regulation. The question, then, is how to balance national-level priorities with global needs so that we can save the one world we have.The economic solution is simple: a global carbon incentive (GCI). Every country that emits more than the global average of around five tonnes per capita would pay annually into a global incentive fund, with the amount calculated by multiplying the excess emissions per capita by the population and the GCI. If the GCI started at $10 per tonne, the US would pay around $36 billion, and Saudi Arabia would pay $4.6 billion.Meanwhile, countries below the global per capita average would receive a commensurate payout (Uganda, for example, would receive around $2.1 billion). This way, every country would face an effective loss of $10 per capita for every additional tonne that it emits per capita, regardless of whether it started at a high, low, or average level. There would no longer be a free-rider problem, because Uganda would have the same incentives to economise on emissions as the US.The GCI also would address the fairness problem. Low emitters, which are often the poorest countries and the ones most vulnerable to climatic changes they did not cause, would receive a payment with which they could help their people adapt. If the GCI is raised over time, the collective sums paid out would approach the $100 billion per year that rich countries promised to poor countries at COP15 in 2009. That would far exceed the meager sums that have been made available thus far. Better still, the GCI would assign responsibility for payments in a feasible way, because big emitters typically are in the best position to pay.Moreover, the GCI would not snuff out domestic experimentation. It recognises that what a country does domestically is its own business. Instead of levying a politically unpopular carbon tax, one country might impose prohibitive regulations on coal, another might tax energy inputs, and a third might incentivise renewables. Each one charts its own course, while the GCI supplements whatever moral incentives are already driving action at the country level.The beauty of the GCI is its simplicity and self-financing structure. But it would require one adjustment in how per capita emissions are computed. What is consumed is as important as how it is produced, so there will need to be some accounting for the portion of emissions embedded in imported goods; these will need to be added to the importer's emissions tally and subtracted from the exporter's.Also, most experts would regard a $10 GCI as too low. But the point is to start small in order to get the scheme going and iron out the kinks. After that, the GCI can easily be raised by common agreement (or reduced, if there were some miraculous breakthrough in emissions-reduction technology). But to avoid creating uncertainty after an initial period of calibration, changes might be considered only every five years or so.What about alternative proposals that have global effects? Some industrialised countries plan to impose a domestic carbon tax alongside a border-adjustment tax, effectively applying the same tax rate to goods coming in from countries that do not have a carbon tax. The border taxes might push other countries to impose their own carbon taxes, but it certainly would not improve fairness. On the contrary, they would let large importing countries impose their tax preferences on poor exporting countries and might serve as a Trojan horse for protectionism.To be sure, the bureaucrats who dominate international meetings will want to dismiss this proposal as ""interesting but simplistic"" (or words to that effect). The most powerful countries are also the biggest emitters, and few want to pay into a global fund, especially in these times of massive budget overruns.But a GCI is by far the best option available. As rich countries cast about for remedies to domestic inequality, they should spare a thought for inequality between countries, which the pandemic and the unequal vaccine rollout will only worsen. Developing countries feel abandoned today. A fair proposal for reducing emissions would go some way toward reassuring them that they do not live on another planet. And it would give everyone a greater incentive to save this one.Raghuram G.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE346","Globale Energieminister treffen sich zum ersten offiziellen COP26-Panel auf der ADIPEC 2021","Mittwoch 17 November 2021","Emirates News Agency (WAM) (German)","ABU DHABI, 16. November 2021 (WAM) -- Das erste offizielle COP26-Ministergremium seit dem Abschluss der UN-Klimakonferenz in Glasgow fand heute Morgen auf der ADIPEC 2021 statt, der gr\'f6\'dften und einflussreichsten Veranstaltung der globalen Energiebranche.Die unter der Schirmherrschaft von Pr\'e4sident Scheich Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan stehende und von der Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) vom 15. bis 18. November in Abu Dhabi veranstaltete Strategiekonferenz ADIPEC 2021 bot den perfekten Rahmen, um die Energieminister und politischen Entscheidungstr\'e4ger der Welt zu versammeln und einen klaren Weg f\'fcr die Energiewirtschaft aufzuzeigen, wie sie sich an den Ergebnissen der COP26 orientieren und die Regierungspolitik und das Verhalten der Industrie in den kommenden Monaten und Jahren gestalten kann.Die gesch\'e4tzten Energieminister aus Bahrain, Portugal, Senegal und der T\'fcrkei betonten die wachsende Bedeutung von Erdgas und die Wichtigkeit der Unterst\'fctzung von Entwicklungsl\'e4ndern bei der Energiewende als entscheidende Faktoren f\'fcr die Zukunft durch ein neues Energie-\'d6kosystem, das von Klimafragen und Emissionsreduktionszielen getragen wird.Dr. Mohamed bin Mubarak bin Daina, Beauftragter f\'fcr Klimaangelegenheiten und Chef des Obersten Umweltrates von Bahrain, sagte: ""Wir haben uns verpflichtet, unsere Emissionen bis 2060 auf Null zu reduzieren, aber wir haben uns auch verpflichtet, unsere Emissionen bis 2025 um 10 Prozent und bis 2035 um 20 Prozent zu senken. Wir haben uns auch verpflichtet, einen m\'f6glichst effizienten und erschwinglichen Energiemix bereitzustellen. Wir m\'fcssen den Entwicklungsl\'e4ndern helfen, zu wachsen, und d\'fcrfen ihrem Wachstum keine Hindernisse in den Weg legen"".Jo\'e3o Galamba, stellvertretender Minister und Staatssekret\'e4r f\'fcr Energie, Portugal, kommentierte: ""Es gibt eine positive Beziehung zwischen erneuerbaren Energien im Allgemeinen und gr\'fcnem Wasserstoff. Wir haben jetzt die Bedingungen geschaffen, unter denen Wasserstoff kein Hype sein kann; er muss Realit\'e4t werden. Wasserstoff l\'f6st einige der Probleme der erneuerbaren Energien und die erneuerbaren Energien machen Wasserstoff m\'f6glich. L\'e4nder, die in ihrem Mix aus erneuerbaren Energien wettbewerbsf\'e4hig sind, werden auch bei der Erzeugung von Wasserstoff wettbewerbsf\'e4hig sein. Die Verbraucher mit ins Boot zu holen, ist ein entscheidender Erfolgsfaktor f\'fcr jede Dekarbonisierungsstrategie"".Dr. Aissatou Sophie Gladima, Ministerin f\'fcr Erd\'f6l und Energie, Senegal, sagte: ""Heute stammen im Senegal 2 Prozent des Stroms aus sauberer Energie, aus Windenergie, und das Ziel ist, diesen Anteil zu erh\'f6hen. Aufgrund der geografischen Gegebenheiten m\'fcssen wir jedoch unsere abgelegenen Gebiete elektrifizieren, und dazu m\'fcssen wir gr\'fcne Energie erzeugen und mehr Strom aus Energien wie Erdgas gewinnen. Die Energiewende muss auf faire, transparente und zunehmende Weise erfolgen, und alle afrikanischen L\'e4nder m\'fcssen zusammenarbeiten, um diese Grunds\'e4tze zu verteidigen"".Dr. Alparslan Bayraktar, stellvertretender Minister, Ministerium f\'fcr Energie und nat\'fcrliche Ressourcen, T\'fcrkei, sagte: ""Alles, was wir brauchen, ist politisches Engagement und Bereitschaft sowie ein pragmatischer und kreativer Ansatz, um dies zu verwirklichen. Wir glauben, dass Gas bei diesem \'dcbergang eine wichtige Rolle spielen kann, und wir m\'fcssen diesen \'dcbergang erfolgreich bew\'e4ltigen"".Anfang dieses Monats gab das Rahmen\'fcbereinkommen der Vereinten Nationen \'fcber Klima\'e4nderungen (UNFCCC) offiziell bekannt, dass die VAE im Jahr 2023 Gastgeber der 28. Die Best\'e4tigung der UNFCCC folgte auf die einstimmige Billigung durch die Asien-Pazifik-Gruppe w\'e4hrend der COP26 in Glasgow.Auf der COP26Ein weiterer Programmpunkt der ADIPEC 2021 Strategiekonferenz war die Teilnahme von Paul Polman, ehemaliger CEO von Unilever und Ko-Vorsitzender der Global Commission for Economy & Climate, an einer Live-Sitzung, in der er seine Erkenntnisse \'fcber die Entstehung und Anpassungsf\'e4higkeit der Kreislaufwirtschaft, ihren Beitrag zur nachhaltigen globalen Entwicklung und die Bedeutung der UN-Ziele f\'fcr nachhaltige Entwicklung f\'fcr Regierungen, Unternehmen und B\'fcrger mitteilte. Es folgte eine Live-Sitzung mit Tarek El Molla, dem Minister f\'fcr Erd\'f6l und Mineralressourcen der Arabischen Republik \'c4gypten, der \'fcber \'c4gyptens Energiezukunft, die Pl\'e4ne und den weiteren Weg der Branche sprach und einen \'dcberblick \'fcber das East Mediterranean Gas Forum und das \'e4gyptische Modernisierungsprojekt gab.Die Live-Sitzungen am Nachmittag behandelten Themen wie ""Intelligente St\'e4dte und die Zukunft der Nachhaltigkeit: Wie ver\'e4ndert sich die Zukunft der Mobilit\'e4t?"", ""Aufbau einer innovativen und kreativen Welt"", ""Die Zukunft der Energie: Wie die Geopolitik die Welt ver\'e4ndert"" und ""Warum sich Gesellschaften und Arbeitspl\'e4tze ver\'e4ndern: Wie Unternehmen nach einer Pandemie widerstandsf\'e4hig werden"".Die ADIPEC-Strategiekonferenz wird bis zum 17. November unter dem Thema ""Aufbau des Energieunternehmens der Zukunft: neue Gesch\'e4ftsmodelle und Investitionsstr\'f6me"" und am 18. November unter dem Thema ""Transformationstechnologien: Entfesselung der Motoren des Wandels"" fortgesetzt.Die ADIPEC 2021 wird vom VAE-Ministerium f\'fcr Energie und Infrastruktur, dem VAE-Ministerium f\'fcr Industrie und Hochtechnologie, dem Ministerium f\'fcr Kommunen und Verkehr, der Kammer von Abu Dhabi, dem Ministerium f\'fcr Kultur und Tourismus von Abu Dhabi und dem Ministerium f\'fcr Bildung und Wissen unterst\'fctzt.\'dcbersetzt von: Magdy Elserougy.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE370","Xi a vita, delusione COP26, Russia: Cosa sta succedendo sui mercati","12 Novembre 2021 Venerd\'ec","Investing.com (Italian)","Di Geoffrey Smith e Alessandro AlbanoInvesting.com - Dopo i dati sull'inflazione di due giorni fa, il mercato del lavoro torna al centro dell£ttenzione con i dati sui nuovi lavori Jolts e le aspettative d'inflazione. Intanto, proseguono le tensioni nell'Europa orientale e al confine con la Bielorussia, mentre Mosca intensifica gli sforzi militari lungo il confine ucraino ricordando gli eventi di 7 anni fa. Ecco i principali market mover di questo venerd\'ec:1. Lavoro e aspettative di inflazione in primo pianoIl mercato del lavoro statunitense - e la sua capacit\'e0 di guidare l'inflazione - saranno nuovamente al centro dell£ttenzione con il Dipartimento del Lavoro che pubblicher\'e0 il dato mensile sulle aperture di nuovi lavori.Gli analisti prevedono che il numero di posti vacanti sia leggermente diminuito a ottobre a 10,30 milioni da 10,44 milioni a settembre. Le attese non sono molto lontane dal record storico di 11,10 milioni registrato ad agosto, e sono quasi 3 milioni oltre il picco pre-pandemia nel 2019.Inoltre, l'Universit\'e0 del Michigan comunicher\'e0 il sondaggio sulla fiducia dei consumatori per novembre, in cui \'e8 probabile che l£ttenzione si concentri sul sottoindice delle aspettative di inflazione, che il mese scorso ha raggiunto il livello pi\'f9 alto dal 2008.2. Scontro Russia/EuropaS'intensificano le tensioni tra Mosca e Bruxelles, dopo che\~l Cremlino ha di nuovo concentrato diverse truppe lungo il confine ucraino, spingendo i diplomatici statunitensi ad avvertire l'UE che potrebbe esserci una nuova incursione nel paese come quella di sette anni fa. Mosca sta inoltre, portando avanti esercitazioni militari congiunti con la Bielorussia vicino alla citt\'e0 di Grodno nel nord-ovest della Bielorussia, al confine con Polonia e Lituania.Nel frattempo, continua lo scontro tra le forze di frontiera polacche e i migliaia di migranti deliberatamente al confine dal presidente bielorusso Alexander Lukashenko, il quale ha minacciato di interrompere le forniture di gas russo attraverso il principale gasdotto Yamal-Europa gioved\'ec. La mossa aumenta indirettamente la pressione sull'Europa per dare l'ok alle importazioni del gas russo attraverso il gasdotto Nord Stream 2.Il Rublo, una delle valute pi\'f9 performanti dell£nno, \'e8 sceso contro il dollaro per il terzo giorno consecutivo ai minimi di cinque settimane.3. BorseEquity europee\~poco mosse ma impostate per segnare la sesta settimana consecutiva in positivo, con i titoli del lusso in forte rialzo sulla scia dei buoni risultati della proprietaria di Cartier, Richemont (SIX:CFR). Il DAX segna il +01,%, il\~FTSE MIB il -0,1%, il\~CAC 40 al +0,2% e lo Euro Stoxx 50 al +0,1%.4. Si chiude la COP26La conferenza sul clima COP26 \'e8 giunta ad una conclusione senza il successo sperato, dopo che il comunicato congiunto finale ha annacquato l'ennesimo impegno per andare oltre i combustibili fossili e contrastare i rischi dei cambiamenti climatici.Una bozza della dichiarazione finale del vertice ha ammorbidito il linguaggio sull'eliminazione graduale dell'energia a carbone e sulla rimozione dei sussidi per l'uso di combustibili fossili, in gran parte su insistenza dei paesi arabi, stando a Reuters.Nei giorni scorsi, era salito l'ottimismo dopo l£ccordo tra Cina e Stati Uniti sulla riduzione delle emissioni e dopo che il G20 di Roma si era faticosamente accordato sulle temperature da rispettare nei prossimi anni.Il Partito Comunista cinese ha eletto il presidente Xi Jinping per un altro mandato eliminando il limite dei quattro mandati, di fatto eleggendo Xi come presidente a vita. Il Comitato Centrale ha invitato il Paese a unirsi ""intorno al Partito con Xi al centro"" per una ""risoluzione storica"", e richiamando l£ttenzione su Hong Kong e sulla posizione cinese su Taiwan.Prima di lui, solo Mao e Deng Xiaping erano riusciti ad avviare la cosiddetta ""risoluzione storica"" rimanendo in carica fino alla loro morte, ma al contrario dei predecessori Xi avr\'e0 una ""posizione centrale"" nella nuova Cina, un linguaggio che lega indissolubilmente il destino di Pechino con quello del suo presidente.Investing.com - Investing.com Italia offre un set assortito di strumenti professionali per il Forex, Commodities, Futures e Borsa, inclusi dati streaming in tempo reale, un calendario economico completo, cos\'ec come notizie finanziarie e analisi tecniche e fondamentali elaborate da esperti interni.Leggi ancora pi\'f9 Notizie su Investing.com Italia e scarica la nuova App di Investing.com per Android!

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE378","JOLTS, lucha en Rusia y fracaso de la COP26: 5 claves en Wall Street","12 Noviembre 2021 Viernes","Investing.com (Spanish)","Por Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com - Los datos sobre las ofertas de empleo de Estados Unidos y la encuesta de la Universidad de Michigan sobre la confianza de los consumidores encabezan la agenda de un viernes tranquilo en cuanto a datos econ\'f3micos. Rusia mantiene a Europa en vilo con su agresiva postura en las fronteras de Ucrania y Polonia. Las acciones apuntan a una apertura al alza, pero todav\'eda van camino de cerrar la semana a la baja a causa de la inflaci\'f3n, y la COP26 ha terminado como empez\'f3, de forma claramente decepcionante. Aqu\'ed tenemos las cinco cuestiones principales de las que hay estar pendientes este viernes, 12 de noviembre, en los mercados financieros.1. JOLTS, expectativas de inflaci\'f3nEl mercado laboral de Estados Unidos  y su capacidad para impulsar la inflaci\'f3n volver\'e1 a estar en el centro de todas las miradas este viernes, cuando el Departamento de Trabajo publique su encuesta mensual de ofertas de empleo y rotaci\'f3n laboral.Los analistas esperan que el n\'famero de vacantes haya descendido ligeramente en octubre, hasta 10,30 millones frente a los 10,44 millones de septiembre, no muy lejos de los m\'e1ximos hist\'f3ricos registrado en agosto en 11,10 millones. Adem\'e1s, est\'e1 casi 3 millones por encima de su pico prepandemia de 2019.La Universidad de Michigan tambi\'e9n publica su encuesta sobre la confianza de los consumidores de noviembre; la atenci\'f3n se centrar\'e1 probablemente en el sub\'edndice de expectativas de inflaci\'f3n, que el mes pasado registr\'f3 su cota m\'e1s alta desde 2008. Dado el aluvi\'f3n de titulares sobre la inflaci\'f3n real que registr\'f3 m\'e1ximos de 30 a\'f1os en octubre, eso parece susceptible a una sorpresa al alza.2. Rusia bravuconea ante EuropaLa bravuconer\'eda de Rusia ha alcanzado cotas de intensidad no vistas en a\'f1os, reforzando los esfuerzos de su aliado Bielorrusia para desviar las nuevas sanciones de la UE contra sus dirigentes por unas elecciones fraudulentas y la represi\'f3n pol\'edtica.El Kremlin ha vuelto a concentrar tropas en la frontera ucraniana, lo que ha llevado a los diplom\'e1ticos estadounidenses a advertir de que Rusia podr\'eda realizar una nueva incursi\'f3n en el pa\'eds que invadiera hace siete a\'f1os. Tambi\'e9n est\'e1 realizando ejercicios militares conjuntos con Bielorrusia cerca de la ciudad de Grodno, en el noroeste de Bielorrusia, que limita con Polonia y Lituania.Mientras tanto, contin\'faa el enfrentamiento entre los guardias de seguridad fronterizos polacos y los miles de inmigrantes entregados deliberadamente a la frontera por el presidente bielorruso Alexander Lukashenko. Lukashenko amenaz\'f3 el jueves con interrumpir el suministro de gas ruso a trav\'e9s del importante gasoducto Yamal-Europa. Aunque es poco probable que el Kremlin permita una politizaci\'f3n tan abierta de sus suministros de gas, la medida alimenta indirectamente la presi\'f3n que se ejerce sobre Europa para que permita el inicio de las exportaciones a trav\'e9s del gasoducto Nord Stream 2.El rublo  una de las divisas de mejor rendimiento del a\'f1o cay\'f3 frente al d\'f3lar por tercera jornada consecutiva, un 1%, hasta alcanzar m\'ednimos de cinco semanas.3. Las acciones apuntan a una apertura al alza; los gigantes del comercio electr\'f3nico chino protagonizan de un D\'eda de los Solteros desigualTodo apunta a que los mercados de valores de Estados Unidos abrir\'e1n ligeramente al alza este viernes, pues la confianza determina la trayectoria en ausencia de noticias importantes que muevan el mercado.Entre las acciones que probablemente acaparar\'e1n la atenci\'f3n hoy se encuentran las de Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), que ha perdido casi un 20% esta semana en un contexto de perspectivas poco alentadoras (aun as\'ed cotiza a m\'e1s de 10 veces las ventas futuras).4. La COP26COP26 diluyeron una vez m\'e1s cualquier compromiso de dejar atr\'e1s los combustibles f\'f3siles y evitar el riesgo de un cambio clim\'e1tico catastr\'f3fico.El borrador de la declaraci\'f3n final de la cumbre suavizaba el discurso sobre la eliminaci\'f3n de la energ\'eda de carb\'f3n y la supresi\'f3n de las subvenciones al uso de combustibles f\'f3siles, en gran medida a causa de la insistencia de los pa\'edses \'e1rabes, seg\'fan Reuters.Esto se suma a los fracasos de esta semana en cuanto a la creaci\'f3n de un mercado mundial del carbono, el cumplimiento de promesas anteriores de ayudar a los pa\'edses m\'e1s pobres a financiar la transici\'f3n energ\'e9tica o el compromiso de realizar revisiones anuales del cumplimiento de las promesas de los pa\'edses.5. Los precios del petr\'f3leo vuelven a caer lastrados por el d\'f3larLos precios del petr\'f3leo crudo descienden, apenas por delante de la l\'ednea de ganancias de la semana, ya que el fortalecimiento del d\'f3lar sigue haciendo la vida m\'e1s dif\'edcil a los compradores no estadounidenses.A las 12:30 horas (CET), los futuros de petr\'f3leo estadounidenses bajan un 1,7% y se sit\'faan en 80,20 d\'f3lares por barril, amenazando con caer por debajo de los 80 d\'f3lares por primera vez esta semana. Los futuros del Brent se dejan un 1,5% hasta 81,67 d\'f3lares por barril.El recuento de plataformas activas de Baker Hughes ofrecer\'e1 este viernes nuevos indicios sobre si los productores estadounidenses est\'e1n acelerando los planes de producci\'f3n en respuesta a la reciente subida de los precios, o si siguen prefiriendo reparar los balances contables. La publicaci\'f3n de los datos de posicionamiento neto de la CFTC completar\'e1 la semana. Los datos de la semana pasada mostraron que los gestores de dinero no eran excesivamente optimistas en cuanto al petr\'f3leo, seg\'fan los est\'e1ndares hist\'f3ricos.Investing.com - Investing.com Espa\'f1ol ofrece un amplio conjunto de herramientas profesionales para Forex, Materias Primas, Futuros y la Bolsa de Valores incluyendo flujo de datos en tiempo real, un calendario econ\'f3mico global, as\'ed como noticias financieras, an\'e1lisis t\'e9cnico y fundamental por expertos.\£1Lea m\'e1s noticias en Investing.com Espa\'f1ol y descargue la nueva ""aplicaci\'f3n de Investing.com para Android!

Compte tenu de l£valanche de titres sur l'inflation r\'e9elle qui a atteint son plus haut niveau depuis 30 ans en octobre, cet indice semble vuln\'e9rable \'e0 une surprise \'e0 la hausse.2. La Russie agite son sabre contre l'EuropeLe bruit du sabre russe a atteint son niveau le plus \'e9lev\'e9 depuis des ann\'e9es, soutenant les efforts de son alli\'e9, le Belarus, pour d\'e9tourner les nouvelles sanctions de l'UE contre ses dirigeants, suite \'e0 des \'e9lections frauduleuses et \'e0 la r\'e9pression politique.Le Kremlin a de nouveau mass\'e9 des troupes \'e0 la fronti\'e8re ukrainienne, ce qui a incit\'e9 les diplomates am\'e9ricains \'e0 mettre en garde la Russie contre une nouvelle incursion dans le pays qu'elle a envahi il y a sept ans. Elle m\'e8ne \'e9galement des exercices militaires conjoints avec le Belarus pr\'e8s de la ville de Grodno, dans le nord-ouest du Belarus, qui a des fronti\'e8res avec la Pologne et la Lituanie.Pendant ce temps, l'impasse entre les gardes-fronti\'e8res polonais et les milliers de migrants d\'e9lib\'e9r\'e9ment livr\'e9s \'e0 la fronti\'e8re par le pr\'e9sident bi\'e9lorusse Alexandre Loukachenko se poursuit. Ce dernier a menac\'e9 jeudi d'interrompre les livraisons de gaz russe par le gazoduc Yamal-Europe. Bien qu'il soit peu probable que le Kremlin autorise une politisation aussi flagrante de ses approvisionnements en gaz, cette d\'e9cision accro\'eet indirectement la pression exerc\'e9e sur l'Europe pour qu'elle autorise le d\'e9but des exportations par le gazoduc Nord Stream 2.Le rouble - l'une des devises les plus performantes de l£nn\'e9e - a chut\'e9 face au dollar pour la troisi\'e8me journ\'e9e cons\'e9cutive, de 1 %, pour atteindre son plus bas niveau en cinq semaines.3. Les actions devraient ouvrir en hausse ; les g\'e9ants chinois du commerce \'e9lectronique ont connu une journ\'e9e des c\'e9libataires mitig\'e9eLes march\'e9s boursiers am\'e9ricains devraient ouvrir en l\'e9g\'e8re hausse vendredi, le sentiment \'e9tant le moteur de la direction en l£bsence de nouvelles importantes pour le march\'e9. Vers 13h15, les Dow Jones futures \'e9taient en hausse de 78 points, soit 0,2%, et \'e9taient en passe de subir une perte hebdomadaire en raison des craintes croissantes d'inflation et de hausse des taux d'int\'e9r\'eat. Le contrat S&P 500 futures a augment\'e9 de 0,1% et le contrat Nasdaq 100 a \'e9galement progress\'e9 de 0,2%.Parmi les actions susceptibles de faire l'objet d'une attention particuli\'e8re, citons Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), qui a perdu pr\'e8s de 20 % cette semaine dans un contexte de perspectives plus faibles (elle se n\'e9gocie toujours \'e0 plus de 10 fois les ventes \'e0 terme). Les g\'e9ants chinois du commerce \'e9lectronique Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) et JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) seront \'e9galement au centre de l£ttention apr\'e8s avoir connu des fortunes diverses lors de leur \'e9v\'e9nement de vente ""singles day"". La valeur brute des marchandises trait\'e9es par la place de march\'e9 Taobao d'Alibaba a augment\'e9 de moins de 10% pour la premi\'e8re fois.4. La COP26La plus grande f\'eate de l£ir chaud du monde s'est achev\'e9e, comme \'e0 l£ccoutum\'e9e, par une conclusion d\'e9cevante \'e0 Glasgow, en \'c9cosse. Les n\'e9gociateurs de la conf\'e9rence COP26 ont en effet \'e9dulcor\'e9 une nouvelle promesse de d\'e9passer les combustibles fossiles et d'\'e9carter le risque d'un changement climatique catastrophique.Selon l£gence Reuters, le projet de d\'e9claration finale du sommet a adouci le langage relatif \'e0 l£bandon progressif de l'\'e9nergie au charbon et \'e0 la suppression des subventions \'e0 l'utilisation des combustibles fossiles, en grande partie sur l'insistance des pays arabes.Cela s£joute \'e0 l'incapacit\'e9, plus t\'f4t dans la semaine, de faire des progr\'e8s substantiels sur la cr\'e9ation d'un march\'e9 mondial du carbone, sur la mise en  uvre des promesses ant\'e9rieures d£ider les pays les plus pauvres \'e0 financer la transition \'e9nerg\'e9tique, ou sur l'engagement d'examiner chaque ann\'e9e la mani\'e8re dont les pays mettent en  uvre leurs promesses.Un accord sur les id\'e9aux \'e9nerg\'e9tiques \'e0 long terme n£ sans doute jamais \'e9t\'e9 r\'e9aliste, \'e9tant donn\'e9 la crise \'e9nerg\'e9tique \'e0 court terme qui touche actuellement de nombreuses r\'e9gions du monde, et l£bsence de Xi Jinping, qui a choisi de rester chez lui pour s£ssurer un mandat du Parti communiste lui permettant de gouverner aussi longtemps qu'il le souhaite.5. Les prix du p\'e9trole chutent \'e0 nouveau en raison de la hausse du dollarLes prix du p\'e9trole brut ont chut\'e9 au cours de la nuit, les laissant \'e0 peine devant la ligne de gain pour la semaine, alors que la force du dollar continue de rendre la vie plus difficile aux acheteurs non am\'e9ricains.\'c0 13h30, les contrats \'e0 terme am\'e9ricains \'e9taient en baisse de 1,7 % \'e0 80,20 $ le baril, mena\'e7ant de passer sous la barre des 80 $ pour la premi\'e8re fois de la semaine. Les contrats \'e0 terme sur le Brent \'e9taient en baisse de 1,5 % \'e0 81,67 $ le baril.Le comptage de Baker Hughes donnera plus tard de nouvelles indications pour savoir si les producteurs am\'e9ricains acc\'e9l\'e8rent leurs plans de production en r\'e9ponse \'e0 la r\'e9cente flamb\'e9e des prix, ou s'ils continuent \'e0 pr\'e9f\'e9rer r\'e9parer leurs bilans. Les donn\'e9es de positionnement net de la CFTC cl\'f4tureront la semaine.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE389","Sultan Al Jaber : Die Energiewende bietet die M\'f6glichkeit, die Wirtschaft umzugestalten und zu diversifizieren und gleichzeitig das globale Wachstum zu f\'f6rdern","Mittwoch 19 Januar 2022","Emirates News Agency (WAM) (German)","ABU DHABI, 18. Januar 2022 (WAM) -- Die VAE sehen die Energiewende als Chance, das wirtschaftliche Wachstumsmodell des Landes zu ver\'e4ndern und zu diversifizieren, so Dr. Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister f\'fcr Industrie und Hochtechnologie und Sonderbeauftragter f\'fcr Klimawandel.In einer virtuellen Podiumsdiskussion mit dem Titel 'Projecting COP Ambitions across COP27 and COP28 and Economic Diversification Priorities Post-pandemic' auf der Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ADSW) erl\'e4uterte Dr. Al Jaber, wie die VAE und die Region des Nahen Ostens und Nordafrikas (MENA) von den Bem\'fchungen um den Klimaschutz profitieren k\'f6nnen.Dr. Al Jaber sprach w\'e4hrend der von Fred Kempe, Pr\'e4sident und CEO des Atlantic Council, moderierten Sitzung neben dem Abgeordneten Alok Sharma, Pr\'e4sident der COP26, und Sameh Shoukry, Au\'dfenminister von \'c4gypten und designierter Pr\'e4sident der COP27.""Wir bauen auch auf unsere einzigartigen F\'e4higkeiten im Bereich Wasserstoff, um die Grundlage f\'fcr einen kohlenstofffreien Wasserstoffmarkt zu schaffen. Und wie Sie wissen, haben die VAE in den letzten 15 Jahren in den Bereich der Solarenergie und der erneuerbaren Energien im weiteren Sinne investiert, und wir verdoppeln diese Investitionen"".Dr. Al Jaber wies darauf hin, dass in den n\'e4chsten zehn Jahren weltweit mindestens 3 Billionen US-Dollar in erneuerbare Energien investiert werden. Er sagte, dass dies eine Multibillionen-Dollar-Chance darstellt, die die VAE, die Region und ihre internationalen Partner nutzen k\'f6nnen. ""Das ist auch der Gedanke hinter unserer strategischen Initiative Net Zero. F\'fcr uns geht es bei Net Zero um neue Industrien, neue F\'e4higkeiten und neue Arbeitspl\'e4tze. F\'fcr uns ist die Bek\'e4mpfung des Klimawandels einfach ein gutes Gesch\'e4ft"".Dr. Al Jaber verwies auf die j\'fcngste strategische Partnerschaft zwischen der Abu Dhabi National Energy Company PJSC (TAQA), der Mubadala Investment Company (Mubadala) und der Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), die Masdar zu einem globalen Kraftwerk f\'fcr saubere Energie gemacht hat. Er sagte, das neue Masdar habe seine Kapazit\'e4t an erneuerbaren Energien fast verdoppelt und wolle auf dieser soliden Grundlage aufbauen, um 100 Gigawatt (GW) zu erreichen. Dr. Al Jaber rief die Partner im \'f6ffentlichen und privaten Sektor dazu auf, sich den VAE und Masdar anzuschlie\'dfen, um diese ehrgeizigen Ziele zu erreichen, die zu neuen Industrien, neuen F\'e4higkeiten, neuen Arbeitspl\'e4tzen und neuen M\'f6glichkeiten f\'fchren werden.Auf eine Frage zu den Ergebnissen der COP26 (der 26. Klimakonferenz der Vereinten Nationen) antwortete Dr. Al Jaber, dass die Konferenz ein Erfolg war, da Glasgow 90 % der Weltwirtschaft auf dem Weg zum Netto-Nullverbrauch vereinte.""Auf der COP 26 wurden auch viele Koalitionen zwischen Regierungen und Unternehmen ins Leben gerufen, um Innovationen zu beschleunigen. AIM for Climate, das die VAE zusammen mit den USA und 34 anderen L\'e4ndern ins Leben gerufen haben, ist ein gutes Beispiel daf\'fcr. Dabei handelt es sich um eine wachsende Koalition, die Investitionen in die Agrartechnologie lenkt, um die landwirtschaftlichen Emissionen zu reduzieren, die immerhin ein Drittel der weltweiten Emissionen ausmachen. Und auf der COP26 wurde endlich eine Einigung \'fcber Artikel 6 des Pariser Abkommens erzielt, der die Grundlage f\'fcr wirksame Kohlenstoffm\'e4rkte schafft. All dies schafft eine gro\'dfe Dynamik und eine gro\'dfartige Plattform, auf der \'c4gypten und die VAE aufbauen k\'f6nnen und werden.""In Bezug auf die COP28, die 2023 in Abu Dhabi stattfinden wird, betonte Dr. Al Jaber, dass dies die erste globale Bestandsaufnahme sein wird, die uns zeigen wird, wie wir die Ziele von Paris erreichen, und die vor allem den Fahrplan f\'fcr 2030 und dar\'fcber hinaus festlegen wird. Er f\'fcgte hinzu, dass die VAE bereits eng mit dem Vereinigten K\'f6nigreich und \'c4gypten zusammenarbeiten, um den Schwung der COP26 fortzusetzen, und erl\'e4uterte den Ansatz der VAE f\'fcr die COP28.""Wir wollen, dass Abu Dhabi der Ort ist, an dem die Welt ihre Zusagen in konkrete Ergebnisse umwandelt und dazu beitr\'e4gt, dass wirtschaftlich tragf\'e4hige L\'f6sungen f\'fcr den Klimaschutz in der ganzen Welt zum Einsatz kommen. Deshalb wollen wir, dass die COP 28 so inklusiv wie m\'f6glich ist und die Ansichten von Industrie- und Entwicklungsl\'e4ndern, des \'f6ffentlichen und privaten Sektors sowie von Wissenschaftlern und der Zivilgesellschaft widerspiegelt.""Denn wenn wir den \'dcbergang zum Energiesystem von morgen erfolgreich gestalten wollen, k\'f6nnen wir uns nicht einfach vom heutigen Energiesystem trennen. Wir m\'fcssen daf\'fcr sorgen, dass das derzeitige System effizienter und kohlenstoff\'e4rmer funktioniert. Wir sollten das Fachwissen aus dem gesamten Energiesektor nutzen, um die notwendigen L\'f6sungen f\'fcr den Klimaschutz zu finden"", sagte Dr. Al Jaber und betonte, dass das Ziel immer die Eind\'e4mmung der Emissionen und nicht der Fortschritt sein m\'fcsse.Der Abgeordnete Alok Sharma \'e4u\'dferte sich optimistisch, dass sowohl die COP27, die von \'c4gypten ausgerichtet wird, als auch die COP28 erfolgreich verlaufen werden, w\'e4hrend Sameh Shoukry betonte, dass die COP27 die erste COP in einem ""Umsetzungsjahrzehnt"" sein wird, in dem die Welt ihre gemeinsamen Anstrengungen zur Umsetzung der national festgelegten Beitr\'e4ge (NDCs) im Rahmen des Pariser Abkommens verst\'e4rkt.\'dcbersetzt von: Magdy Elserougy HYPERLINK https://wam.ae/en/details/1395303012471https://wam.ae/en/details/1395303012471\l"

Ele destaca o aumento da prote\'e7\'e3o da terra e dos oceanos do planeta atrav\'e9s de \'e1reas protegidas efetivamente administradas como uma das a\'e7\'f5es para alcan\'e7ar estes objetivos.Almheiri disse: ""Os Emirados \'c1rabes Unidos est\'e3o orgulhosos de apoiar o Compromisso dos L\'edderes pela Natureza, comprometendo-se a trabalhar com outras na\'e7\'f5es para reverter a perda da biodiversidade at\'e9 2030, e enviando uma poderosa mensagem de que n\'e3o h\'e1 conflito entre a conserva\'e7\'e3o da natureza e a economia. O movimento se alinha com nossa dedica\'e7\'e3o inabal\'e1vel para proteger nosso meio ambiente e preserv\'e1-lo para as gera\'e7\'f5es futuras, incutido em nossa na\'e7\'e3o pelo fundador dos EAU, o falecido Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan"".Enfatizando a import\'e2ncia de enfrentar os duplos desafios da perda da biodiversidade e da mudan\'e7a clim\'e1tica, ela acrescentou: ""A alarmante magnitude da perda da biodiversidade pode \'e0s vezes se apresentar como um pensamento posterior no processo clim\'e1tico, e \'e9 fundamental que n\'f3s, como governos e partes interessadas, nos unamos em torno de produtos de dupla finalidade. Alinhar nossas agendas para enfrentar a perda da biodiversidade e a mudan\'e7a clim\'e1tica \'e9 a \'fanica maneira de resolv\'ea-las e tomar medidas coletivas decisivas para preservar nosso planeta e a vida nele para as gera\'e7\'f5es futuras"".O Ministro observou que as \'e1reas protegidas desempenham um papel fundamental na salvaguarda dos ecossistemas que fornecem habitats para a biodiversidade e contribuem para a mitiga\'e7\'e3o da mudan\'e7a clim\'e1tica e para a adapta\'e7\'e3o a ela. Os EAU possuem 49 \'e1reas protegidas que representam 15,5% de seu territ\'f3rio. O pa\'eds atingiu a Meta 11 de Aichi para \'e1reas protegidas terrestres que abrangem 18,4% de seu territ\'f3rio terrestre, e \'e1reas marinhas protegidas que representam 12% de seu territ\'f3rio marinho e costeiro.O Compromisso dos L\'edderes com a Natureza implica em desviar o uso da terra e as pol\'edticas agr\'edcolas das pr\'e1ticas prejudiciais ao meio ambiente para os ecossistemas terrestres e marinhos, e reduzir significativamente a polui\'e7\'e3o do ar, da terra e marinha, particularmente eliminando vazamentos de pl\'e1stico para o oceano at\'e9 2050. Ele exige uma transi\'e7\'e3o para sistemas de produ\'e7\'e3o, consumo e alimentos sustent\'e1veis que atendam \'e0s necessidades das pessoas, permanecendo dentro dos limites planet\'e1rios, e assegurando que as pol\'edticas e decis\'f5es governamentais futuras sejam fator de prote\'e7\'e3o da natureza e do meio ambiente de forma a promover a conserva\'e7\'e3o, restaura\'e7\'e3o e uso sustent\'e1vel da biodiversidade.Ao aderir ao Pledge, os pa\'edses reconhecem o papel crucial da ci\'eancia e da pesquisa na luta contra a degrada\'e7\'e3o dos ecossistemas, a perda da biodiversidade e a mudan\'e7a clim\'e1tica, e se comprometem a envolver toda a sociedade, incluindo governos, academia, empresas, finan\'e7as e comunidades locais, com foco nas mulheres e na juventude.Trad. por Nadia Allim.wam.ae/en/details/1395302989961\l"

Em primeiro lugar, enquanto o mundo continuar a depender do petr\'f3leo e do g\'e1s, podemos assegurar o fornecimento confi\'e1vel do petr\'f3leo e do g\'e1s menos intensivos em carbono dispon\'edveis"". Estamos alavancando esta posi\'e7\'e3o para reduzir ainda mais a intensidade de carbono atrav\'e9s da expans\'e3o da primeira instala\'e7\'e3o de captura de carbono da regi\'e3o.""Estamos tamb\'e9m construindo sobre nossas capacidades \'fanicas em hidrog\'eanio para lan\'e7ar as bases para um mercado de hidrog\'eanio de carbono zero"". E, como voc\'ea sabe, os EAU t\'eam investido no espa\'e7o solar e no espa\'e7o renov\'e1vel mais amplo durante os \'faltimos 15 anos, e estamos dobrando este investimento"".O Dr. Al Jaber apontou que globalmente, pelo menos US$ 3 trilh\'f5es ser\'e3o investidos em energia renov\'e1vel durante os pr\'f3ximos dez anos. Ele disse que isto representa uma oportunidade multi-trilh\'e3o de d\'f3lares que os EAU, a regi\'e3o e seus parceiros internacionais podem capitalizar"". ""Na verdade, este \'e9 o pensamento por tr\'e1s de nossa Iniciativa Estrat\'e9gica Net Zero. A Rede Zero, para n\'f3s, \'e9 sobre novas ind\'fastrias, novas habilidades e novos empregos. Para n\'f3s, o neg\'f3cio de enfrentar a mudan\'e7a clim\'e1tica \'e9 simplesmente um bom neg\'f3cio"".Dr. Al Jaber citou a recente parceria estrat\'e9gica entre a Abu Dhabi National Energy Company PJSC (TAQA), Mubadala Investment Company (Mubadala) e Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), que transformou a Masdar em uma central el\'e9trica global de energia limpa. Ele disse que a nova Masdar quase dobrou sua capacidade de energia renov\'e1vel e a ambi\'e7\'e3o \'e9 construir sobre esta base s\'f3lida para atingir 100 gigawatts (GW). Dr. Al Jaber pediu que os parceiros, nos setores p\'fablico e privado, se unissem aos Emirados \'c1rabes Unidos e \'e0 Masdar para atingir estes ambiciosos objetivos que levar\'e3o a novas ind\'fastrias, novas habilidades, novos empregos e novas oportunidades.Respondendo a uma pergunta sobre o resultado da COP26 (26\£a Confer\'eancia das Na\'e7\'f5es Unidas sobre Mudan\'e7a Clim\'e1tica), o Dr. Al Jaber observou que foi um sucesso, pois Glasgow uniu 90% da economia mundial no caminho para o zero l\'edquido.""A COP 26 tamb\'e9m conseguiu lan\'e7ar muitas coaliz\'f5es entre governos e empresas para acelerar a inova\'e7\'e3o. AIM para o Clima, que os EAU lan\'e7aram com os EUA e 34 outros pa\'edses \'e9 um bom exemplo. Trata-se de uma coaliz\'e3o crescente que direciona os investimentos para a agrotecnologia a fim de reduzir as emiss\'f5es agr\'edcolas, que respondem por um ter\'e7o das emiss\'f5es globais. E criticamente a COP26 finalmente chegou a um acordo sobre o Artigo 6 do Acordo de Paris, que estabelece as bases para mercados de carbono eficazes.Tudo isso cria um grande impulso e uma grande plataforma que o Egito e os Emirados \'c1rabes Unidos podem, e v\'e3o, construir"".Na COP28, que ser\'e1 realizada em Abu Dhabi em 2023, o Dr. Al Jaber destacou que ela marcar\'e1 o primeiro balan\'e7o global que nos mostrar\'e1 como estamos caminhando em dire\'e7\'e3o aos objetivos de Paris e, criticamente, estabelecer\'e1 o roteiro para 2030 e mais al\'e9m.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE393","D\'f3lar firme, encuesta ISM, datos mixtos de China y COP26: 5 claves en Wall Street","1 Noviembre 2021 Lunes","Investing.com (Spanish)","Por Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com - La preocupaci\'f3n por la pol\'edtica monetaria mantiene al d\'f3lar firme y a los bonos a corto plazo d\'e9biles en el inicio de una semana ajetreada de reuniones de los bancos centrales.Se publicar\'e1 la encuesta empresarial ISM, que podr\'eda reforzar las expectativas de que la Reserva Federal tenga que subir las tasas de inter\'e9s antes de lo previsto (Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) ve ahora la primera subida en julio del a\'f1o que viene).La econom\'eda china emite se\'f1ales contradictorias, pero la crisis inmobiliaria, en el mejor de los casos, se est\'e1 agravando.La conferencia sobre el clima COP26 parece destinada a ser un anticl\'edmax despu\'e9s de que los l\'edderes del G20 no se pusieran de acuerdo sobre c\'f3mo acelerar la eliminaci\'f3n del carb\'f3n, y los precios del petr\'f3leo est\'e1n subiendo antes de la reuni\'f3n de la OPEP+ de esta semana. Esto es lo que hay que saber en los mercados financieros este lunes 1 de noviembre.1. El d\'f3lar se mantiene firme mientras Goldman advierte de una subida de tasas m\'e1s r\'e1pidaLas expectativas de una pol\'edtica monetaria m\'e1s estricta est\'e1n en el centro de la mente de los inversionistas al comienzo de una semana en la que probablemente se tomen decisiones importantes para reducir el est\'edmulo que sostuvo la econom\'eda durante la pandemia.La cesta del PCE mostr\'f3 que el aumento de los precios, que se hab\'eda limitado a unos pocos sectores a principios de a\'f1o, se hab\'eda ampliado significativamente. Estos datos pueden ser corroborados o no por la encuesta manufacturera ISM, que se publicar\'e1 a las 10 AM ET (1500 GMT).La reuni\'f3n de pol\'edtica monetaria de la Fed, de dos d\'edas de duraci\'f3n, comienza el martes, y se espera que termine con un anuncio sobre la retirada progresiva de las compras de bonos del banco central, que actualmente ascienden a 120,000 millones de d\'f3lares al mes.2. Los PMI chinos env\'edan se\'f1ales contradictorias; la crisis inmobiliaria se agrava Dos encuestas empresariales chinas muy seguidas enviaron se\'f1ales contradictorias: el \'edndice oficial de gesti\'f3n de compras(o PMI) sugiri\'f3 que la actividad manufacturera se hab\'eda contra\'eddo en octubre bajo el peso de la escasez de combustible, las medidas anticontaminaci\'f3n y las continuas interrupciones de la producci\'f3n relacionadas con el Covid-19.Sin embargo, el PMI del sector privado subi\'f3 de 50.0 a 50.6 desde septiembre, lo que ofrece cierta tranquilidad. Aun as\'ed, los rendimientos de los bonos basura subieron a su nivel m\'e1s alto desde 2009 y los Futuros del mineral de hierro cayeron hasta un 4% en medio de los continuos temores por las perspectivas del sector inmobiliario.Otro de los 20 mayores promotores por tama\'f1o, Yango Group, dijo el lunes que estaba |buscando extender el pago de tres de sus bonos en d\'f3lares, haciendo que sus acciones cayeran un 9% en Shenzhen.3. Las acciones abrir\'e1n al alza; Coca Cola y American en el punto de miraLas acciones estadounidenses se preparan para abrir en nuevos m\'e1ximos hist\'f3ricos m\'e1s tarde, en el optimismo generalizado sobre la recuperaci\'f3n econ\'f3mica - aunque el volumen puede ser menor de lo habitual debido a la sombra proyectada por la reuni\'f3n de la Fed que se aproxima.4. La COP26Es probable que esa falta de unidad frustre los esfuerzos de los negociadores en la COP26Los esfuerzos por intensificar la lucha contra el cambio clim\'e1tico se han visto desbaratados en los \'faltimos dos a\'f1os por la pandemia y por el posterior aumento de los precios mundiales de la energ\'eda, ya que la industria mundial se recuper\'f3 de ella m\'e1s r\'e1pido de lo previsto. Esto ha provocado que las emisiones de di\'f3xido de carbono vuelvan r\'e1pidamente a su tendencia anterior a la pandemia.5. El petr\'f3leo sube antes de la reuni\'f3n de la OPEPLos precios del petr\'f3leo subieron durante la noche, apoyados por un tono ampliamente positivo en los activos de riesgo que tambi\'e9n elev\'f3 las acciones europeas a nuevos m\'e1ximos para el a\'f1o.A las 6:25 AM ET, los futuros del crudo estadounidense sub\'edan un 0.6% hasta los 84.03 d\'f3lares el barril, mientras que los futuros del Brent sub\'edan un 0.9% a 84.50 d\'f3lares el barril. El diferencial entre ambos se redujo fuertemente a finales de la semana pasada, despu\'e9s de que los datos de la Administraci\'f3n de Informaci\'f3n Energ\'e9tica mostraran un descenso de la producci\'f3n estadounidense, lo que endureci\'f3 a\'fan m\'e1s el equilibrio local entre oferta y demanda.Investing.com - Investing.com Espa\'f1ol ofrece un amplio conjunto de herramientas profesionales para Forex, Materias Primas, Futuros y la Bolsa de Valores incluyendo flujo de datos en tiempo real, un calendario econ\'f3mico global, as\'ed como noticias financieras, an\'e1lisis t\'e9cnico y fundamental por expertos.\£1Lea m\'e1s noticias en Investing.com Espa\'f1ol y descargue la nueva ""aplicaci\'f3n de Investing.com para Android!

Als eine der Ma\'dfnahmen zur Erreichung dieser Ziele wird die Verbesserung des Schutzes von Land und Ozeanen durch effektiv verwaltete Schutzgebiete hervorgehoben.Almheiri sagte: ""Die VAE sind stolz darauf, den Leaders' Pledge for Nature zu unterst\'fctzen und sich zu verpflichten, mit anderen Nationen zusammenzuarbeiten, um den Verlust der biologischen Vielfalt bis 2030 umzukehren, und ein deutliches Signal zu senden, dass es keinen Konflikt zwischen Naturschutz und Wirtschaft gibt.

Nur wenn wir unsere Agenden zur Bek\'e4mpfung des Verlusts der biologischen Vielfalt und des Klimawandels aufeinander abstimmen, k\'f6nnen wir beide Probleme l\'f6sen und gemeinsam entschlossen handeln, um unseren Planeten und das Leben auf ihm f\'fcr k\'fcnftige Generationen zu bewahren.""Der Minister wies darauf hin, dass Schutzgebiete eine Schl\'fcsselrolle bei der Sicherung von \'d6kosystemen spielen, die Lebensr\'e4ume f\'fcr die biologische Vielfalt bieten und zur Eind\'e4mmung des Klimawandels und zur Anpassung an diesen beitragen. In den VAE gibt es 49 Schutzgebiete, die 15,5 Prozent der Landesfl\'e4che ausmachen. Das Land hat das Aichi-Ziel 11 f\'fcr terrestrische Schutzgebiete erreicht, die 18,4 Prozent der Landfl\'e4che ausmachen, und f\'fcr Meeresschutzgebiete, die 12 Prozent der Meeres- und K\'fcstenfl\'e4che ausmachen.Das Versprechen der Staats- und Regierungschefs f\'fcr die Natur beinhaltet die Abkehr von umweltsch\'e4dlichen Praktiken bei der Fl\'e4chennutzung und in der Landwirtschaft f\'fcr Land- und Meeres\'f6kosysteme sowie eine deutliche Verringerung der Luft-, Land- und Meeresverschmutzung, insbesondere durch die Beseitigung von Plastik, das bis 2050 ins Meer gelangt. Sie fordert einen \'dcbergang zu nachhaltigen Produktions-, Konsum- und Lebensmittelsystemen, die die Bed\'fcrfnisse der Menschen befriedigen und gleichzeitig innerhalb der planetarischen Grenzen bleiben, und stellt sicher, dass k\'fcnftige Regierungspolitiken und -entscheidungen den Natur- und Umweltschutz in einer Weise ber\'fccksichtigen, die die Erhaltung, Wiederherstellung und nachhaltige Nutzung der biologischen Vielfalt f\'f6rdert.Mit dem Beitritt zu dem Versprechen erkennen die L\'e4nder die entscheidende Rolle von Wissenschaft und Forschung im Kampf gegen die Zerst\'f6rung von \'d6kosystemen, den Verlust der biologischen Vielfalt und den Klimawandel an und verpflichten sich, die gesamte Gesellschaft einzubeziehen, einschlie\'dflich der Regierungen, der Wissenschaft, der Wirtschaft, der Finanzwelt und der lokalen Gemeinschaften, wobei der Schwerpunkt auf Frauen und Jugendlichen liegt.\'dcbersetzt von: Adel Abdel Zaher.

L'enqu\'eate ISM sur les entreprises est attendue et pourrait renforcer les attentes de la R\'e9serve f\'e9d\'e9rale, qui devrait relever ses taux plus t\'f4t que pr\'e9vu (Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) pr\'e9voit d\'e9sormais une premi\'e8re hausse d\'e8s juillet de l£nn\'e9e prochaine). L'\'e9conomie chinoise envoie des signaux mitig\'e9s, mais la crise de l'immobilier se poursuit - au mieux -.

Voici ce qu'il faut savoir sur les march\'e9s financiers ce lundi 1er novembre.1. Le dollar se maintient, Goldman pr\'e9voyant des hausses de taux plus rapidesLes attentes d'un resserrement de la politique mon\'e9taire sont au c ur des pr\'e9occupations des investisseurs \'e0 l£ube d'une semaine qui devrait \'eatre marqu\'e9e par des d\'e9cisions importantes visant \'e0 r\'e9duire les mesures de relance qui ont soutenu l'\'e9conomie pendant la pand\'e9mie.Le Dollar am\'e9ricain consolide pr\'e8s des sommets qu'il a atteints vendredi apr\'e8s que des donn\'e9es aient montr\'e9 que les prix des d\'e9penses personnelles des consommateurs - la mesure de l'inflation privil\'e9gi\'e9e par la R\'e9serve f\'e9d\'e9rale - a augment\'e9 de 4,4 % par an, le taux le plus \'e9lev\'e9 depuis des ann\'e9es. En r\'e9action, les rendements obligataires am\'e9ricains \'e0 deux ans ont d\'e9pass\'e9 0,5 % pour la premi\'e8re fois en 19 mois, tandis que les analystes de Goldman Sachs ont revu \'e0 la hausse leur pr\'e9vision de la premi\'e8re hausse des taux de la Fed d'un an, \'e0 juillet 2022.Le panier PCE a montr\'e9 que les augmentations de prix, qui avaient \'e9t\'e9 confin\'e9es \'e0 quelques secteurs plus t\'f4t dans l£nn\'e9e, s'\'e9taient consid\'e9rablement \'e9largies. Ces donn\'e9es peuvent ou non \'eatre corrobor\'e9es par l'enqu\'eate sur l'industrie manufacturi\'e8re de l'ISM, attendue \'e0 15h00.La r\'e9union de politique g\'e9n\'e9rale de deux jours de la Fed commence mardi et devrait se terminer par une annonce sur la r\'e9duction progressive des achats d'obligations de la banque centrale, qui s'\'e9l\'e8vent actuellement \'e0 120 milliards de dollars par mois.2. Les indices PMI de la Chine envoient des signaux mitig\'e9s ; la crise de l'immobilier se poursuitDeux enqu\'eates de conjoncture chinoises tr\'e8s surveill\'e9es ont envoy\'e9 des signaux mitig\'e9s, l'indice officiel des directeurs d£chat sugg\'e9rant que l£ctivit\'e9 manufacturi\'e8re s'est contract\'e9e en octobre sous le poids des p\'e9nuries de carburant, des mesures anti-pollution et des perturbations de la production li\'e9es \'e0 Covid-19.Toutefois, l'indice PMI du secteur priv\'e9 Caixin est pass\'e9 de 50,0 \'e0 50,6 en septembre, ce qui est rassurant. Malgr\'e9 cela, les rendements des obligations de pacotille ont atteint leur plus haut niveau depuis 2009 et les futures sur le minerai de fer ont chut\'e9 jusqu'\'e0 4 % en raison des craintes persistantes concernant les perspectives du secteur immobilier.Un autre promoteur immobilier parmi les 20 premiers par la taille, Yango Group, a d\'e9clar\'e9 lundi qu'il cherchait \'e0 prolonger le paiement de trois de ses obligations en dollars, ce qui a fait chuter ses actions de 9 % \'e0 Shenzhen.Ailleurs en Asie, le Nikkei a progress\'e9 de plus de 2% en r\'e9action \'e0 l'emphatique victoire \'e9lectorale du nouveau Premier ministre japonais Fumio Kishida, qui a rapidement promis un programme de relance \'e0 grande \'e9chelle. Les chiffres du commerce ext\'e9rieur de la Cor\'e9e du Sud ont montr\'e9 que les exportations ont augment\'e9 de 24% sur l£nn\'e9e, un peu moins que pr\'e9vu.3. Les actions US devraient ouvrir en hausse ; Coke, American en ligne de mireLes actions am\'e9ricaines devraient ouvrir \'e0 de nouveaux sommets plus tard, gr\'e2ce \'e0 un optimisme g\'e9n\'e9ralis\'e9 concernant la reprise \'e9conomique - m\'eame si le volume pourrait \'eatre plus faible que d'habitude en raison de l'ombre port\'e9e de la r\'e9union de la Fed qui approche.Vers 12h05, les Dow Jones futures \'e9taient en hausse de 154 points, soit 0,4%, tandis que les S&P 500 futures \'e9taient \'e9galement en hausse de 0,4% et les Nasdaq 100 futures de 0,3%.Parmi les valeurs susceptibles de faire l'objet d'une attention particuli\'e8re, citons Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) et PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), apr\'e8s que le Wall Street Journal a rapport\'e9 que Coke allait acheter le reste du fabricant de boissons sportives BodyArmor, intensifiant ainsi ses efforts pour contester la domination de Gatorade de Pepsi.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE402","VAE stellen Klimasicherheit in den Mittelpunkt der globalen Sicherheitsagenda","Mittwoch 9 M\'e4rz 2022","Emirates News Agency (WAM) (German)","NEW YORK, USA, 9. M\'e4rz 2022 (WAM) -- Die Vereinigten Arabischen Emirate (VAE) haben im Einklang mit der weitsichtigen Vision ihrer F\'fchrung einen partnerschaftlichen Ansatz gew\'e4hlt, der sich auf die Finanzierung von Projekten in L\'e4ndern konzentriert, die am st\'e4rksten von Klimarisiken betroffen sind, da die Klimafinanzierung ein nachhaltiges Wirtschaftswachstum erm\'f6glichen und gleichzeitig Frieden und Stabilit\'e4t f\'f6rdern kann, so Dr. Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister f\'fcr Industrie und Hochtechnologie und Sonderbeauftragter f\'fcr Klimawandel.In seiner Er\'f6ffnungsrede auf einer Sitzung des Sicherheitsrats der Vereinten Nationen zum Thema Klimafinanzierung zur Erhaltung von Frieden und Sicherheit erkl\'e4rte Dr. Al Jaber, dass die VAE \'fcber 1 Milliarde Dollar an Klimahilfe f\'fcr mehr als 40 L\'e4nder bereitgestellt haben, wobei der Schwerpunkt auf Inselstaaten und am wenigsten entwickelten L\'e4ndern liegt. Er f\'fcgte hinzu, dass die VAE in den letzten Jahren auch mehrere Milliarden Dollar f\'fcr Katastrophen- und Konflikthilfe zur Verf\'fcgung gestellt haben, bei denen die Klimaauswirkungen eine Rolle spielen.Die Arria-Sitzung, ein informelles Treffen der Mitglieder des Sicherheitsrates, wurde von Dr. Al Jaber geleitet. Botschafterin Lana Nusseibeh, St\'e4ndige Vertreterin der VAE bei den Vereinten Nationen, hielt die Er\'f6ffnungsrede des Treffens, an dem auch Botschafter Mohamed Abushahab, stellvertretender St\'e4ndiger Vertreter der VAE bei den Vereinten Nationen, teilnahm.In seiner Rede stellte Dr. Al Jaber fest, dass geopolitische Spannungen den internationalen Frieden und die Stabilit\'e4t gef\'e4hrden. W\'e4hrend sich die Welt mit diesen Herausforderungen auseinandersetze, d\'fcrfe man andere bestehende und neue Bedrohungen, die unsere kollektive Sicherheit untergraben, nicht aus den Augen verlieren.Die Erfahrungen der VAE im Bereich der Klimafinanzierung zeigen, dass die Betrachtung von Klimama\'dfnahmen durch die Linse des internationalen Friedens und der Sicherheit die Finanzierung auf vorrangige Sektoren wie die Nahrungsmittel- und Wassersicherheit ausrichten kann, so Dr. Al Jaber. Er erl\'e4uterte, dass dies eines der Ziele der Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for Climate) sei, einer Initiative, die die VAE im vergangenen Jahr zusammen mit 38 L\'e4ndern ins Leben gerufen haben, um die Investitionen in landwirtschaftliche Innovationen - von d\'fcrreresistentem Saatgut bis hin zu wassersparender vertikaler Landwirtschaft - zu erh\'f6hen.In seiner Rede vor W\'fcrdentr\'e4gern wie John Kerry, dem Sondergesandten des US-Pr\'e4sidenten f\'fcr Klimafragen, und Alok Sharma, dem Pr\'e4sidenten der COP26, forderte Dr. Al Jaber einen integrativen Ansatz, der Frauen st\'e4rkt und sicherstellt, dass die Klimafinanzierung bei der Finanzierung von Projekten zu einer gerechten nachhaltigen Entwicklung beitr\'e4gt.""Eine faire und ausgewogene Klimafinanzierung wird alle Gemeinschaften kurzfristig widerstandsf\'e4higer machen und eine Friedensdividende bis weit in die Zukunft hinein bringen"".Dr. Al Jaber bekr\'e4ftigte die Bedeutung der Klimafinanzierung im Kampf gegen den Klimawandel und forderte die internationale Gemeinschaft auf, mehr f\'fcr die Unterst\'fctzung der Entwicklungsl\'e4nder zu tun.""Die Klimafinanzierung ist eines der wichtigsten Instrumente zur Bew\'e4ltigung der Klimarisiken"". ""Dennoch"", so Dr. Al Jaber, ""bleibt die internationale Gemeinschaft weiterhin hinter den 100 Milliarden Dollar zur\'fcck, die den Entwicklungsl\'e4ndern vor \'fcber einem Jahrzehnt zugesagt wurden. Viele L\'e4nder, die auf der Tagesordnung des Rates stehen, sowie L\'e4nder, die vom Anstieg des Meeresspiegels betroffen sind, betonen, dass dieser Betrag allein nicht ausreichen wird"".Dr. Al Jaber betonte: ""Eine solide, nachhaltige und ehrgeizige Klimafinanzierung ist ein entscheidender Faktor f\'fcr weitere Fortschritte beim Klimaschutz und bei der Risikominderung."" Er f\'fcgte hinzu, dass ""ein besserer Zugang zu garantierten Finanzmitteln entscheidend ist"".Als verantwortungsbewusster globaler Partner haben sich die VAE verpflichtet, die L\'e4nder zu unterst\'fctzen, die dem Klimarisiko am st\'e4rksten ausgesetzt sind, sagte Dr. Al Jaber und wies auf das Ausma\'df der klimatischen Herausforderung hin.""Der j\'fcngste Bericht des IPCC (Intergovenmental Panel on Climate Change) unterstreicht das Ausma\'df der Herausforderung und stellt fest, dass bis zu 3,6 Milliarden Menschen durch die Auswirkungen des Klimawandels gef\'e4hrdet sind, insbesondere in fragilen Staaten. Die Klimaauswirkungen sind eine Frage von Frieden und Sicherheit. Diese Auswirkungen werden wahrscheinlich zu erheblichen Vertreibungen und zum Wettbewerb um Ressourcen f\'fchren und k\'f6nnten, wenn sie nicht angegangen werden, die Ursache f\'fcr viele k\'fcnftige Konflikte sein.Dr. Al Jaber erkannte an, dass der Bericht einige ermutigende Zeichen des Fortschritts enth\'e4lt, auf denen wir in den kommenden Monaten und Jahren aufbauen k\'f6nnen, sowie einen Plan, wie wir unsere am meisten gef\'e4hrdeten Gemeinschaften sch\'fctzen und st\'e4rken k\'f6nnen. Er wies auch darauf hin, dass auf der COP26 (26. Klimakonferenz der Vereinten Nationen) 90 % der Weltwirtschaft auf einen Netto-Null-Entwicklungspfad ausgerichtet wurden, und forderte einen \'e4hnlichen Schritt bei der Anpassung, insbesondere f\'fcr die am meisten gef\'e4hrdeten Gemeinschaften.Zum Abschluss seiner Ausf\'fchrungen rief Dr. Al Jaber dazu auf, Sicherheits- und Klimastrategien in fragilen L\'e4ndern besser aufeinander abzustimmen.""Wir wissen, dass das Klima nicht immer ein Faktor f\'fcr die Sicherheit ist. Aber wir wissen auch, dass wir in fragilen L\'e4ndern, die mit Klimarisiken konfrontiert sind, die Sicherheits- und Klimastrategien umso besser aufeinander abstimmen k\'f6nnen, je mehr wir diese Risiken mindern, die Widerstandsf\'e4higkeit st\'e4rken und das nachhaltige Wirtschaftswachstum beschleunigen k\'f6nnen.""Weitere W\'fcrdentr\'e4ger, die an dem Treffen teilnahmen, waren Osama Mahmoud, St\'e4ndiger Vertreter &Auml;gyptens bei der UNO; Dr. Mohamed Mubarak bin Dana, Sonderbeauftragter f\'fcr Klimaangelegenheiten f\'fcr Bahrain; Jennifer Morgan, Sonderbeauftragte f\'fcr internationale Klimaschutzma\'dfnahmen f\'fcr Deutschland; Barbara Pompili, Ministerin f\'fcr \'f6kologische Umstellung f\'fcr Frankreich; Chet Greene, Minister f\'fcr ausw\'e4rtige Angelegenheiten, Einwanderung und Handel f\'fcr Antigua und Barbuda; Ahmed Khaleel, Staatsminister f\'fcr Ausw\'e4rtige Angelegenheiten der Malediven; Nafisah Abubakar, Leiterin des Sekretariats f\'fcr die Energiesicherheit von Frauen im l\'e4ndlichen Raum (RUWES); Yannick Glemarec, Exekutivdirektor des Green Climate Fund, sowie Minister und Botschafter aus aller Welt.Um die Sitzung zu sehen, loggen Sie sich bitte ein unter: HYPERLINK https://uaeun.org/event/arria-climate-finance-9march2022/https://uaeun.org/event/arria-climate-finance-9march2022/ Die VAE haben f\'fcr den Monat M\'e4rz 2022 den rotierenden Vorsitz im Sicherheitsrat der Vereinten Nationen inne.

Ele acrescentou que os Emirados \'c1rabes Unidos tamb\'e9m forneceram v\'e1rios bilh\'f5es de d\'f3lares nos \'faltimos anos em ajuda em desastres e conflitos, onde os impactos clim\'e1ticos s\'e3o um fator que contribui para isso.A reuni\'e3o Arria-F\'f3rmula, uma reuni\'e3o informal dos membros do Conselho de Seguran\'e7a, foi presidida pelo Dr. Al Jaber. A Embaixadora Lana Nusseibeh, Representante Permanente dos EAU junto \'e0 ONU, proferiu os coment\'e1rios de abertura na reuni\'e3o que contou com a presen\'e7a do Embaixador Mohamed Abushahab, Representante Permanente Adjunto dos EAU junto \'e0 ONU.Durante seu discurso, o Dr. Al Jaber observou que as tens\'f5es geopol\'edticas est\'e3o desafiando a paz e a estabilidade internacionais. Ele disse que enquanto o mundo lida com estes desafios, n\'e3o devemos perder de vista outras amea\'e7as existentes e emergentes que minam nossa seguran\'e7a coletiva.A experi\'eancia dos EAU no financiamento do clima ressalta que, quando apropriado, ver a a\'e7\'e3o clim\'e1tica atrav\'e9s da lente da paz e seguran\'e7a internacional pode visar o financiamento em setores priorit\'e1rios como a seguran\'e7a alimentar e da \'e1gua, de acordo com o Dr. Al Jaber. Ele explicou que este \'e9 um dos objetivos da Miss\'e3o de Inova\'e7\'e3o Agr\'edcola para o Clima (AIM for Climate), uma iniciativa que os EAU lan\'e7aram no ano passado junto com 38 pa\'edses para aumentar os investimentos em inova\'e7\'e3o agr\'edcola, desde sementes resistentes \'e0 seca at\'e9 uma agricultura vertical eficiente em termos de \'e1gua.Dirigindo-se a dignit\'e1rios, incluindo John Kerry, Enviado Presidencial Especial dos EUA para o Clima, e The Rt.

Ele acrescentou que ""um maior acesso ao financiamento garantido \'e9 fundamental"".Como um parceiro global respons\'e1vel, os EAU est\'e3o empenhados em apoiar os pa\'edses mais expostos ao risco clim\'e1tico, disse o Dr. Al Jaber, ao apontar a escala do desafio clim\'e1tico. ""O \'faltimo relat\'f3rio do IPCC (Painel Intergovernamental sobre Mudan\'e7as Clim\'e1ticas) destaca a escala do desafio, afirmando que at\'e9 3,6 bilh\'f5es de pessoas s\'e3o agora altamente vulner\'e1veis aos efeitos das mudan\'e7as clim\'e1ticas, particularmente em estados fr\'e1geis. Os impactos clim\'e1ticos s\'e3o uma quest\'e3o de paz e seguran\'e7a"". Esses impactos provavelmente provocar\'e3o deslocamentos e competi\'e7\'e3o significativos sobre os recursos e, se n\'e3o forem tratados, poder\'e3o ser a fonte de muitos conflitos futuros"".O Dr. Al Jaber reconheceu que o relat\'f3rio fornece alguns sinais encorajadores de progresso a serem seguidos nos pr\'f3ximos meses e anos e um plano de como podemos proteger e fortalecer nossas comunidades mais vulner\'e1veis. Ele tamb\'e9m observou que a COP26 (26\£a Confer\'eancia das Na\'e7\'f5es Unidas sobre Mudan\'e7a Clim\'e1tica) alinhou 90% da economia global em um caminho de desenvolvimento l\'edquido zero e apelou para uma mudan\'e7a semelhante na adapta\'e7\'e3o, particularmente para as comunidades mais em risco.Concluindo suas observa\'e7\'f5es, o Dr. Al Jaber apelou para um maior alinhamento entre as estrat\'e9gias de seguran\'e7a e clim\'e1ticas em pa\'edses fr\'e1geis.""Sabemos que o clima nem sempre \'e9 um fator de seguran\'e7a. Mas tamb\'e9m sabemos que quanto mais pudermos alinhar as estrat\'e9gias de seguran\'e7a e clim\'e1ticas em pa\'edses fr\'e1geis que enfrentam riscos clim\'e1ticos, mais poderemos mitigar esses riscos, refor\'e7ar a resili\'eancia e acelerar o crescimento econ\'f4mico sustent\'e1vel"".Outros dignit\'e1rios presentes na reuni\'e3o incluem Osama Mahmoud, Representante Permanente do Egito junto \'e0 ONU; Dr. Mohamed Mubarak bin Dana, Enviado Especial para Assuntos Clim\'e1ticos do Bahrein; Jennifer Morgan, Enviada Especial para a A\'e7\'e3o Clim\'e1tica Internacional da Alemanha; Barbara Pompili, Ministra da Transi\'e7\'e3o Ecol\'f3gica da Fran\'e7a; Chet Greene, Ministro das Rela\'e7\'f5es Exteriores, Imigra\'e7\'e3o e Com\'e9rcio de Ant\'edgua e Barbuda; Ahmed Khaleel, Ministro de Estado das Rela\'e7\'f5es Exteriores das Maldivas; Nafisah Abubakar, Chefe da Secretaria de Seguran\'e7a Energ\'e9tica das Mulheres Rurais (RUWES); Yannick Glemarec, Diretor Executivo do Fundo Verde do Clima, bem como ministros e embaixadores de todo o mundo.Para ver a sess\'e3o, por favor, acesse: HYPERLINK https://uaeun.org/event/arria-climate-finance-9march2022/https://uaeun.org/event/arria-climate-finance-9march2022/ Os EAU ocupam a presid\'eancia rotativa do Conselho de Seguran\'e7a das Na\'e7\'f5es Unidas para o m\'eas de mar\'e7o de 2022.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE1","Why COP26 was disappointing and climate change needs more urgent action","April 18, 2022 Monday","ArabianBusiness.com","Over the last few years we've had a chance to decompress and reflect on many aspects of our lives and of course the sorry state of our planet. The hugely disappointing COP26 , held in Glasgow last year, is clear indication that we are not paying enough attention to critical matters even after going through a global lockdown. The UN SDGs (United Nations Sustainable Development Goals) which didn't get enough, or little, attention at COP26 shows that stricter measures are still not on any government's agenda. With the next COP27, which will be held in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt and the following planned to be held in the UAE, we hope to see more actions and emissions-cutting measures that challenge the climate and less false promises. The 17 UN SDGs were created in 2015 and adopted by 190 countries in 2015. Centred around global development priorities, the SDGs outline clear targets toward sustainable change, to meet net-zero targets by 2030. The world witnessed a glimpse of the adverse repercussions of climate change in 2019 which was recorded as the second warmest year with carbon dioxide (CO2) levels rising to a new record. We are much further along the road to 2030 today, compared to 2015, but progress is much too slow and experts agree that we are not on track to reach the goals. Without any doubt, climate change is affecting every person and every country. It's having an adverse effect on economies, sea levels are rising and we are witnessing extreme weather conditions. In 2020, the UN launched the 'decade of action' to bring awareness to the fact that the world is sorely lacking in making progress toward attaining the UN SDGs. Pre pandemic, there had been some positive outcomes, progress wise, access to drinking water has increased, and there are more women in leadership roles today. But the progress toward these goals is also uneven when examined on a country-by-country basis. The wealthier Nordic countries, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland are well on their way to meeting 75 percent of the requirements, and the top 10 countries that are on track are in Europe. Poorer countries dominate the other end of the spectrum: the Democratic Republic of Congo, Chad, and the Central African Republic are not faring as well. There are, of course, hundreds of countries in between the spectrum that haven't made as much progress as they could, including superpowers India, the United States, and China. It would be interesting to see the outcome of COP27 and 28, which are being held in the MENA region. It's only in the recent years, when food security issues became a concern during the global lockdown, the Middle East has given any attention to climate and environment matters but it has a lot of catching up to do. There is no doubt that Covid-19 has impacted progress made toward the goals, but it has also highlighted how essential the goals are - by exposing massive inequalities between rich and poor countries, uneven access to vaccines, and exposed massive risk to our most vulnerable populations. Our recovery from Covid-19 is a chance to recommit to the goals. The pace of change is sorely lacking, especially on the climate front, and food insecurity. Now is our chance to get back on track on the way to 2030, but how do we do it? Investment is sorely needed across the board, but who is going to bring that investment? The UN states that we need $5 to $7 trillion a year to fund sustainable projects. Where will that money come from? Most thinkers point to the private sector. Yes, private investment can play a part but governments have a large role to play from a top-down perspective to create the conditions needed for private investment to flourish. For example, designing tax and regulatory environments that encourage SDG-linked investment. Recently in the US, SEC unveiled proposed climate disclosure rules. 'It requires companies to disclose information on climate risks facing their businesses, and plans to address those risks impact their business model and outlook and the process used by them to identify, assess and manage these risks.' This is a great step by SEC, but ultimately tax on carbon emission with enforceable schemes will be the real game-changer. We also need to look at the broader picture, where governments are at one-time funding SDG goals, they are also upholding outdated policy such as propping up the fossil fuel industry, which is the cause of many of the issues we're now dealing with. Government subsidies to fossil fuel industries exceed $5 trillion dollars. It's like having a foot on the accelerator and the brake at the same time. We need to urgently address this situation for the betterment of the future generations. In order to do so, however, stakeholders need to work together - and governments need to be the catalyst driving the conditions and creating the frameworks for change to occur.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE2","Oil producers move from feeling ""unwanted at COP26"" to ""superheroes"" ahead of COP27: report","April 11, 2022 Monday","ArabianBusiness.com","Oil producers have always been an easy target at the United Nations' annual climate summits. This year, with the Russia-Ukraine conflict boosting demand for fossil fuels, they're preparing to fight back, Bloomberg reported. As Western economies desperately seek alternatives to Vladimir Putin's exports, many are working to increase supplies of energy &mdash; whether it's clean or not. US President Joe Biden has ordered an unprecedented release of emergency crude, while Poland has signaled it wants to use coal past the European Union's 2050 date to reach net-zero emissions. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson travelled to Saudi Arabia to ask for an increase oil production. The UAE Energy Minister Suhail Al-Mazrouei summed up the industry's change in fortune at a conference in Dubai last month. ""Oil producers felt unwanted in COP26 , felt like we were in a corner,"" Al-Mazrouei said. ""Now, we're like superheroes."" The UK banned oil companies from sponsorship deals at the gathering in Glasgow last November, saying that their net-zero targets weren't credible, according to Bloomberg. It was a victory for green campaigners who had criticized Poland for allowing coal companies to plaster their branding all over the COPs it hosted in 2013 and 2018. The decision also struck a nerve with oil executives, including Shell chief executive officer Ben van Beurden, who complained about not feeling welcome ahead of the talks last year. It's unlikely the industry will face the same resistance this year. Egypt, which will oversee COP27 in the resort town of Sharm El-Sheikh this November, has historically aligned itself with a group of developing countries that's resisted pressure to do more to cut emissions. It's argued that African countries shouldn't be deprived the opportunity to exploit their oil and gas reserves, and stressed that the priority of this year's meeting should focus on getting rich countries to pay more to help them transition to clean energy, the Bloomberg report added. While the UAE &mdash; the hosts of 2023's meeting &mdash; has been a relative frontrunner within the region on climate policies, becoming the first oil producer in the Arabian Gulf to set a net-zero goal last October, it's still squarely in favour of continuing to use fossil fuels. The country wants to shift the COP narrative so hydrocarbons are seen as part of the solution, instead of the problem, according to a person familiar with the nation's strategy. Officials from the UAE and Egypt are already working closely to make sure the two conferences are aligned, the person said. There are also signs that the next two COPs risk being co-opted by oil interests because of the close relationship between Saudi Arabia and the host countries. Saudi Arabia has pledged $15 billion to support Egypt as its economy comes under pressure from the war in Ukraine, depositing the first $5 billion last month. ""The Saudis have perennially been a spoiler in this process since the beginning,"" said Alden Meyer, a COP veteran and senior associate with research group E3G. There's a long list of complaints from scientists and diplomats about the country's pushback on global agreements to cut emissions and reports from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change summarising latest scientific findings. Meyer says the Saudis led the fight to downplay a groundbreaking 2018 IPCC report that stated the devastating impacts of warming beyond 1.5C. Experts say efforts should focus on cutting emissions first. In a recent submission to the UN, the kingdom warned rich countries that reducing fossil fuels could backfire by cutting prices and boosting demand in developing nations. Saudi Arabia's energy ministry didn't respond to questions. The nation announced its own net-zero target soon after the UAE did, though it aims to neutralise planet-warming emissions a decade later, by 2060. The UN doesn't count emissions generated outside a country's borders, so both nations could continue to export fossil fuels while technically achieving their goals. The Saudi government has said it will invest more in solar and wind energy and rely heavily on carbon capture technology. At the same time, the kingdom has said oil demand will remain strong for decades and it is spending billions of dollars to boost the country's production capacity. OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo has also urged Egypt and the UAE to redefine the conversation on oil. ""These two COPs have the potential to address these challenges &mdash; energy inclusiveness and investment,"" he said. The meetings can be a ""reset"" and show that oil and gas production and climate change goals aren't ""mutually exclusive,"" he said. But the risk is that boosting fossil fuel supply locks in production beyond the current crises, says Joeri Rogelj, a member of the EU Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change. That will make it harder to reach the Paris Agreement's stretch goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels, a target that's already in jeopardy. And there's another way of looking at the situation. While the war will force nations to take a more hard-headed approach to tackling climate change, it should also help them realise that their national security depends on switching to homegrown clean energy, says Christiana Figueres, an architect of the 2015 Paris Agreement. ""What I expect to see as of this year, and the rest of the decade, is a change in tone that is really about national security, even for the West,"" she said. Still, the current geopolitical environment means there's a low chance that November's COP meeting will end with consensus on the need to phase out unabated oil and gas consumption, according to Meyer from E3G. All countries have to agree on the final document at the end of the summit, meaning any single nation can derail the entire process. Al-Mazrouei, the UAE minister, underscored how challenging it will be for other nations to convince oil producers to get on board in light of recent events. ""At COP26 , they asked financial institutions to limit the financing of new oil and gas projects,"" he said, ""and six months after that, they're asking for more oil.""

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE3","Tuvalu Foreign Minister presents speech from rising waters at COP26","November 13, 2021 Saturday","Big News Network.com","GLASGOW, Scotland: In a pre-recorded speech aired at the COP26 summit in Glasgow, Scotland, Tuvalu Foreign Minister Simon Kofe, dressed in a suit and tie with his pant legs rolled up to his knees, stood in a submerged area that use to be dry land. Waters around Tuvalu, a small island nation in the South Pacific, are rising faster than the global average, at some 0.2 inches per year. Like many of its neighbors, which are among those most at risk from climate change, Tuvalu, whose highest point is about 15 feet above sea level, is warning that without international action, it will be become totally submerged. COVID-19 outbreaks and travel restrictions caused by the pandemic have kept most of their leaders from attending the summit, with the exception of the leaders of Fiji, Palau and Tuvalu. In his speech, Kofe stressed that the eight islands of Tuvalu were ""sacred"" to its 12,000 people, stating, ""They were the home of our ancestors, they are the home of our people today and we want them to remain the home of our people into the future."" In his speech at the COP26 World Leaders Summit on 2nd November, Palau President Surangel Whipps, Jr. also highlighted the importance of maintaining the average global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of this century. ""Frankly speaking, there is no dignity in a slow and painful death,"" he said. Overall, Pacific island nations have sent fewer high-level government officials and civil society representatives to COP26 than in previous climate summits, a fact that climate activists stressed has made it more difficult to attend every meeting and pressure some of the world's major polluters, including the U.S. and China. \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE4","Beyond COP26: what's next for CEOs?","December 8, 2021","Gulf Industry Worldwide","(Image: source/30/12/images/ COP26 .jpg) Managing climate change is the greatest challenge of our time, and the 26th UN Conference of the Parties in Glasgow, Scotland, better known as COP26 , represents a milestone in the world&rsquo;s efforts to take concerted action. Six years after the landmark Paris Agreement, nations are taking stock of the progress they have made on previous commitments, including their promises to reduce emissions and adapt to climate change. Ahead of COP26 this year, the UAE pledged to reduce its carbon emissions by 23.5 per cent compared to business as usual for the year 2030, effectively translating into absolute emission reduction of about 70 million tonnes. The UAE also announced an ambitious target of reaching net zero emissions with AED600 billion ($163 billion) invested in clean and renewable energy sources by 2050, becoming the first Middle Eastern country to commit to a net-zero emissions target. The UAE development model will take into account the net-zero goal with all institutions working as a team towards this goal. Tom De Waele While the policy work continues, many senior executives of UAE corporations will raise the question, &ldquo;What do we do after COP26 ?&rdquo; The first thing they will have to do is recognise that with all the attention on climate change this year, things are speeding up in some key areas. &bull; Regulations. Carbon-taxation and emissions-trading schemes will expand, and the price of carbon will probably rise. Governments will also promise more subsides to spur change, such as initiatives designed to reduce the cost of green hydrogen. &bull; Financial disclosure. Companies will face more requirements to report on their climate risks, through a set of common reporting standards and climate-change disclosures, for example. &bull; Science-based targets. More companies will set ambitious decarbonisation targets and sign onto initiatives to track these goals and will aim to include Scope 3 emissions in their plans. &bull; Scrutiny from investors. Sustainability, and climate change in particular, will become even more important for investment decisions. Fund managers are starting to respond: the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative brings together 128 fund managers with $43 trillion under their care in a pledge to make investment decisions that support the goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 or sooner. &bull; Customer expectations. Pressure from customers will lead more companies to look beyond their own operations and across their supply chains and use of their products. BMW plans to reduce carbon emissions across the entire life cycle of its vehicles, from production through ownership, by at least 40% by 2030. Torsten Lichtenau Most importantly, the focus is going to shift from setting targets to delivering results. Until now, executives may have been rewarded just for stating goals; from here on, they will need to show real reductions. Here are Make carbon transition a pillar of strategy. Too often, sustainability and carbon transition come as afterthoughts, but they should be baked into the strategy practice. The risks and opportunities of climate change should shape decisions about new products and how to improve operations. For example, UK supermarket leader Sainsbury&rsquo;s is making carbon reduction a cornerstone of its strategy, with pledges to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions to net zero by 2040, and to cut Scope 3 emissions by 30% by 2030. Among many changes, it has switched to energy-saving lithium-ion pallet trucks. Get more bang for your net-zero buck. Companies are pushing their carbon transitions as rigorously as any other business initiatives, which means improving efficiency while reducing cost. German engineering and technology firm Bosch has been carbon neutral in Scope 1 and 2 emissions since 2020, thanks to greater energy efficiency. It is also about finding opportunities to monetise investments in sustainable technologies. Mexican cement producer Cemex sells a line of concrete that contains 70% less carbon, and it offsets the rest of the related emissions to deliver a carbon-neutral product. Embed carbon transition into the fabric of the business. Even the best plans will fall flat without the right supporting practices. Pricing, incentives, and tracking are three practices that help carbon transitions stay on track. &bull; Pricing. More and more companies price carbon internally, like any other cost of doing business. &bull; Incentives. Linking compensation incentives to carbon-reduction efforts keeps them on the agenda. French food producer Danone, for example, ties 20% of senior executives&rsquo; annual compensation to social and environmental targets. &bull; Tracking. New software systems extract data from enterprise resource planning and other corporate systems, then calculate the precise carbon footprint and issue progress reports. Avoid the hourglass effect. In many companies, including those in the UAE, top management and new employees are enthusiastic about sustainability, while middle management is left to solve the revenue, cost, and safety implications. Many have little or no experience managing carbon reduction, though support can be offered by educating everyone about carbon reduction in their industry and clarifying the rules for trade-offs. The transition away from carbon and toward net-zero emissions is likely to be a top priority for many executives for the rest of their careers. For most companies in the UAE, the window for consideration has closed. It&rsquo;s time to act and deliver meaningful carbon reductions.  \"

So, what's the event all about and why does it matter. Why is the summit called COP26 ? A UN climate change conference is called COP, which is an acronym for the Conference Of Parties (CoP). So far, there have been 25 summits since 1992. The conference is now in its 26th round, hence the name COP26 . Where and when is the summit being held? The summit is being held in Glasgow, Scotland. It will officially open on Sunday (October 31) and last for 13 days. The talks are scheduled to end at 6pm on Friday (November 12), but past experience shows they are likely to extend into Saturday and, perhaps, even to Sunday. The United Kingdom (UK), as the host country, will chair the summit. Why is COP26 It represents the first major test of the Paris agreement, which committed nearly 200 countries to holding global warming to well below two Celsius (C) degrees, ideally 1.5 C degrees compared to pre-industrial levels. It is also a key moment for governments to show they will deliver money promised to countries on the frontlines of the climate crisis and to consign fossil fuels to history. COP26 therefore is seen as a summit, which, will address that has and hasn't been achieved since 2015 while also setting plans to reach the Paris Agreements targets What will the talks revolve around? Discussions will largely focus on whether the commitments made by countries to cut emissions will be enough to halt dangerous temperature rises and get the world on track to reaching net zero. Negotiators will also discuss plans to provide climate finance support to countries worst hit by the climate crisis and how to help countries adapt to climate change impacts. Which world leaders will attend COP26 ? Over 100 world leaders are expected to attend the conference in the first few days, but only a few names are widely known so far. These include US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, French President Emmanuel Macron, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, Colombian President Ivan Duque, Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven, Swiss President Guy Parmelin, South Korean President Moon Jae-In. Who else is attending? There are several big names in attendance, ranging from climate activists to cultural leaders. These include Sir David Attenborough, named as the COP26 People's Advocate, Pietro Parolin, Cardinal Secretary of State of Vatican City, environmental activist Greta Thunberg and, UN secretary general Ant\'f3nio Guterres. Which world leaders will be conspicuous by their absence? Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and Queen Elizabeth II will also not be attending COP26 .

""Make no mistake: This is a critical juncture for our future and for that of generations to come,"" Gulf News said in an editorial on Sunday. The paper added that six years ago, the vast majority of nations signed on to a plan to reduce the planet's temperature by 1.5 degrees Celsius. Part and parcel of that plan was a commitment from developed nations to contribute $100 billion to a fund to less developing nations turn to alternative energy sources that would no generate greenhouse gases and increase their carbon footprints. The editorial continued, ""That fund has been undersubscribed by half, so too a commitment from nations to a carbon neutral future. Yes, some have committed to do so by 2030, others by 2050, more by 2060. That is kicking the can of today's problems down the road for others to deal with. Simply put, now is the time for climate action. And now is the time for change. ""The worsening effects on our warming planet are seen with more floods, more severe weather events, stronger hurricanes and cyclones, hotter summers, colder winters, longer droughts, fewer fish, less biodiversity, more deaths and an environment that has been scarred by our addiction to carbon-based fuel sources and unchecked industrialisation at the expense of the fauna and flora with whom we share our home."" ""The outcome of COP26 will determine whether it is us - yes, we are all responsible by our personal choices - who decided that this planet was as disposable as the litter we discard, or whether it is a jewel that we hold in stewardship for this and future generations.""

Will we have to explain that we didn't do enough to make our air clean when we had a chance?

The move consolidates the nation's position as a global leader in nature-based climate change solutions. Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, Minister of Climate Change and the Environment, presented the new target at the High-Level Ministerial Dialogue on Adaptation Action that took place on the Adaptation, Loss and Damage Day at the 26th UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow. She said, ""The UAE is keen to leverage nature-based solutions to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change.

Mangrove forests protect the UAE's coasts from rising sea levels and storm surges, and provide critical habitats for biodiversity. They also serve as powerful carbon sinks. The country is home to 60 million mangroves that form forests spanning 183 square kilometers and capture 43,000 tonnes of CO2 annually. With the additional 100 million mangroves planted, the UAE's mangrove forests will cover 483 square kilometers and sequester nearly 115,000 tons of CO2 per year. Co-hosted by the UK COP26 Presidency and the Global Centre on Adaptation (GCA), the High-Level Ministerial Dialogue on Adaptation Action convened global leaders with the aim of accelerating climate change adaptation action worldwide.

In an editorial on Monday, Gulf News said, ""Going into the Glasgow summit, the hope was that all parties could reach a comprehensive deal to limit the warming of our planet to just 1.5 degree Celsius."" ""With the UAE set to host COP28 in two years' time, the groundwork begins now on building consensus that the damage being inflicted on our planet is stopped, and that the worse effects of climate change are halted outright if not significantly reversed,"" the paper said. COP26 delegates only managed to sign off on a joint plan of action after a commitment to phase out coal that was included in earlier negotiation drafts was watered down, leaving COP26 President Alok Sharma to say he was ""deeply sorry"" for how events had unfolded. The issue of coal and its significance for nations such as China and the US that burn it for energy production, and others such as India where it is a cornerstone powering domestic growth, was always going to be difficult. The Glasgow pact is at least a start, one where there has finally been movement on coal. COP28 can at least begin to accelerate that momentum now that coal has started to shift. It continued, ""Since the Paris Agreement six years ago, providing a financial incentive to poorer nations to reduce dependence on fossil fuels, adapt renewable energies, change their environmental outlook and subsidise their development, is part and parcel of the fight for that 1.5 degree limit. ""Financing remains an issue, with just half of the money promised at Paris paid. Developing nations want to see more and more urgently. The historical reality is that much of the damage done to our environment began with developed nations' exploitation of fossil fuels, and there is a price to be paid for asking developing nations now to turn from those carbon-based fuels.""

Held under the patronage of President His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and hosted by the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) from 15th \- 18th November in Abu Dhabi, the ADIPEC 2021 Strategic Conference provided the perfect setting to gather the world's energy Ministers and policymakers to chart a clear path for the energy industry to align itself with the outcomes of COP26 and to shape government policy and industry behaviour in the months and years to come. The esteemed panel of Energy Ministers from Bahrain, Portugal, Senegal, and Turkey highlighted the growing importance of natural gas and the importance of supporting developing countries through the energy transition as critical factors fuelling the future through a new energy ecosystem underpinned by climate concerns and emission-reduction goals. Dr. Mohamed bin Mubarak bin Daina, Envoy for Climate Affairs and Chief Executive of the Supreme Council for Environment, Bahrain, said: ""We made our commitment [to net zero] by 2060 but we also made a pledge to ourselves that we would reduce emissions by 10 percent in 2025 and 20 percent by 2035. We are also committed to providing the most efficient and affordable state of energy mix. We need to help developing countries to grow and not put obstacles in front of their growth."" Jo?o Galamba, Deputy Minister and Secretary of State for Energy, Portugal, commented: ""There's a virtuous relation between renewables in general and green hydrogen. We have now created the conditions under which hydrogens cannot be hype; it has to be a reality. Hydrogen solves some of the problems of renewables and renewables make hydrogen possible. Countries that are competitive in their renewable mix will be competitive in producing hydrogen. Bringing consumers on board is a critical success factor for any decarbonisation strategy."" Dr. Aissatou Sophie Gladima, Minister of Petroleum and Energies, Senegal, said: ""Today, in Senegal, 2 percent of electricity comes from clean energy, from wind energy, so the aim is to increase this level. However, due to the geographical constraints, we need to electrify our remote areas and to do that we need to create green energy, and produce more power from energies like natural gas. Energy transition needs to be done in a fair manner, a transparent manner, and an increasing manner, all African countries need to work together to defence these principles"". Dr. Alparslan Bayraktar, Deputy Minister, Ministry of Energy Natural Resources, Turkey, said: ""The infrastructure is there, the sources are there, all we need is political commitment and willingness, and a pragmatic and creative approach to make this happen. We believe that gas can play a major role for this transition, and we need to successfully manage this transition."" Earlier this month, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) officially announced that the UAE will host the 28th Conference of the Parties (COP28) in 2023. The UNFCCC confirmation followed unanimous endorsement by the Asia Pacific Group of nations during COP26 in Glasgow. Also announced at COP26 was the launch of the UAE and the International Renewable Energy Agency's (IRENA) $1 billion global finance platform that aims to finance 1.5 GW of new renewable energy power in developing countries by 2030.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE11","Dubai participates in the COP26 Climate Summit","November 16, 2021 Tuesday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","DUBAI, 16th November, 2021 (WAM) -- A Dubai led delegation participated in the 26th session of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) held in Glasgow, Scotland, from 31 October to 12 November, headed by Abdulla Mohammed Al Basti, Secretary-General of The Executive Council of Dubai and Vice Chairman of the Steering Committee of the C40 Cities Network for South and West Asia. The conference comprised several events aimed at exploring the challenges of climate change and uncovering solutions to reduce the impact of the current climate crisis. The 26th UN\~Climate Change Conference\~of the\~Parties\~( COP26 ), which takes place on a yearly basis, brings together world leaders and Heads of States and Governments, alongside international organisations and business leaders to develop a global agenda devoted to tackling climate change. The conference examines pressing decisions and global agreements by countries to reduce emissions and enhance adaptation, and discusses options and targets for climate financing. Al Basti stressed that the UAE winning the bid to host the global climate summit COP 28 in 2023 reflects the country's efforts to embed sustainable development as a key principle by investing in green infrastructure and supporting the growth of green economic activities. This achievement comes as a result of the successful initiatives put in place in line with the vision of His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE; His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai; and His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. The vision set for the UAE has allowed it to achieve significant strides in clean energy and wastewater treatment infrastructure. The country is currently supporting the establishment of a strong circular economy ecosystem, which will bolster its efforts to reduce its carbon footprint. In this context, Al Basti pointed out that Dubai is successfully shaping the green finance agenda, alongside the C40 Network of Leading Cities in Climate Change, following the directives of H.H. Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of The Executive Council of Dubai. He stated: ""Tackling climate change is a key priority of ours and is crucial to achieving a safer and more sustainable future for all. For years, Dubai has been shifting towards alternative energy and promoting the concept of sustainability across all sectors through pioneering initiatives and projects in the field of environmental protection, local resource management, and green investment."" He underlined the role that Dubai has played on a global level, to promote a sustainable and green economy through the production of clean energy, as part of which the emirate has implemented numerous initiatives. These have included the utilisation of concentrated solar panels and photovoltaic panels for solar energy production; generation of green hydrogen using solar energy; the development of the hydroelectric plant project in Hatta using clean energy; in addition to optimising the use of treated water for irrigation and cooling; and concerted efforts to reduce demand for energy and water in all sectors of the emirate through building standards and extensive retrofitting activities. As part of its role as member of the steering committee of the C40 Leadership Group, Dubai led an effort to identify the main challenges and priorities for ""climate budgeting"" for the C40 cities. This effort came in response to the rising challenges of financing climate change at a city level and the urgent need to mitigate the negative impact it is already having on the global community. Dubai's work on the topic alongside C40's team consisted of mapping existing practices followed by focused interactive workshops with the C40 member cities. The workshops comprised of a review of the outputs of the analysis of studied by teams from the Government of Dubai on the challenges and enablers of climate finance in cities, in addition to deep dives into best practices from the cities of Oslo in Norway, Paris in France, Tshwane in South Africa and Montreal in Canada which have established successful climate budgeting models. The workshops also included surveys to map the individual challenges and priorities of the participating cities with regard to mainstreaming climate finance at the city level. During a focused session held at the Glasgow Climate Summit with a number of mayors of leading cities in climate action and officials from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Secretary General of The Executive Council of Dubai highlighted the need to provide additional support for network cities specifically to enhance their capabilities to develop climate action programmes and initiatives that meet the requirements of international funders, in addition to training local financial authorities on understanding climate action and what it means for city operations and capital investments. He also referred to challenges that relate to financing adaptation to climate change, stressing that current funding only represents 20% of the total amount required to protect societies from the expected climate change impacts on the global community. Dubai joined the C40 global network in 2015, as part of its commitment to address climate change and join efforts with leading cities to scale up climate action. Founded in 2005, the network currently includes 96 megacities that have been working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance climate action by sharing knowledge and best practices. Dubai's efforts will allow the emirate to play a key role in supporting the UAE's roadmap to reaching net zero carbon by 2050, a commitment the country announced weeks prior to COP26 . \"

We hope the UAE will work closely with us as we look to deliver on this vital agenda at COP26 ."" ""The UK is the UAE's third largest non-oil trade partner in Europe, while the UAE is the UK's largest trading partner in the Gulf, accounting for a third of all UK trade in the region. The GCC, as a collective, is the UK's 4th largest trading partner,"" the UK Embassy said in a press statement sent to the Emirates News Agency (WAM) on the visit of Lord Mayor of the City of London to the UAE. The Lord Mayor also met with officials from India and Kenya at the Expo 2020 Dubai to explore how best the UK can assist emerging markets coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic by helping countries unlock the private capital needed to fund sustainable developments. \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE21","Ministry of Climate Change launches joint initiatives to boost public-private partnerships at COP26","November 6, 2021 Saturday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","GLASGOW, 6th November, 2021 (WAM) -- The Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MoCCAE) launched two new initiatives, one in collaboration with Majid Al Futtaim and the other is in collaboration with the private sector at the 26th UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow. The initiatives aim to increase the involvement of the private sector in the UAE's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, boost climate change adaptation capabilities, drive climate innovation, and promote sustainable practices. Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, Minister of Climate Change and the Environment, said, ""The UAE continues to reinforce its leadership in climate action at home and abroad, and our private sector entities are our long-standing trusted partners in our fight against climate change. A low-emission future can only become a reality with their active engagement and full commitment. Our two new joint initiatives are prime examples of public-private partnerships that support our nation's climate and sustainability agenda, and I thank our partners for helping us bring them to life."" Ibrahim Al-Zu'bi, Chief Sustainability Officer at Majid Al Futtaim and Chairman of the Corporate Advisory Board of World Green Building Council, said, ""Now in the core of COP26 , the past months have been an exciting time for the UAE with the announcement of its Net Zero by 2050 commitment. This is particularly encouraging for Majid Al Futtaim, with our own Net Positive in water and carbon commitments by 2040, we see endless opportunities to work in partnership to drive forward sustainability excellence across our region. Programs and tools like the Posterity20 will be critical for putting the UAE's commitment into action, mobilising the private sector, growing a community of knowledge sharing and collaboration, and fostering the entrepreneurship and technological solutions vital for the transition to net zero."" MoCCAE and Majid Al Futtaim teamed up with the Posterity Institute to launch Posterity20, the first regional initiative that identifies, celebrates, and showcases the top 20 thought leaders in the field of sustainability in the Middle East and North Africa. The project seeks to create a community of regional sustainability thinkers and doers who can mobilize society into action. The outcomes of Posterity20 will also include an annual forum, the P-Hall of Fame, and the Thought Leadership Portal \- a virtual think tank and knowledge hub. The second initiative is the Climate Tech Venture Capital, the region's first impact-driven VC fund that works in a co-investment model with major regional corporations to support and scale up clean tech startups in the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia. In addition to securing much-needed funding for promising climate ventures, the fund aims to curate a portfolio of tangible investment opportunities for private sector investors from the region and beyond who are interested in green and sustainable projects. \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE22","JOLTS, Russian Saber-Rattling, COP26 Failure - What's Moving Markets","November 12, 2021 Friday","Forexpros","Investing.com - By Geoffrey Smith Investing.com -- U.S. employment vacancies data and the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment poll head a quiet Friday for economic data. Russia keeps Europe on edge with aggressive posturing on the borders of Ukraine and Poland. Stocks are set to edge higher but are still on course for an inflation-stamped down week, and the COP26 ends as it began, in distinctly underwhelming fashion. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, 12th November. 1. JOLTS, inflation expectations in focus The U.S. labor market \- and its ability to drive inflation \- will be in focus again later, as the Labor Department releases its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. Analysts expect the number of vacancies to have fallen slightly in October to 10.30 million from 10.44 million in September, but that's still not far off the all-time record of 11.10 million seen in August. It's also nearly 3 million above its pre-pandemic peak in 2019. The University of Michigan also releases its consumer sentiment survey for November, where the focus is likely to be on the inflation expectations subindex, which hit its highest since 2008 last month. Given the barrage of headlines about actual inflation hitting a 30-year high in October, that seems vulnerable to an upside surprise. 2. Russia rattles its saber at Europe Russian saber-rattling reached its loudest in some years, buttressing the efforts of its ally Belarus to deflect fresh EU sanctions against its leadership over fraudulent elections and political repression. The Kremlin has massed troops on its Ukrainian border again, prompting U.S. diplomats to warn that Russia may make a fresh incursion into the country that it invaded seven years ago. It's also conducting joint military exercises with Belarus near the town of Grodno in northwest Belarus, which borders on both Poland and Lithuania. Meanwhile, the standoff between Polish border security guards and thousands of migrants deliberately delivered\~ to the border by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko continues. Lukashenko threatened to stop supplies of Russian gas through the key Yamal-Europe pipeline on Thursday. While the Kremlin is unlikely to allow such an overt politicization of its gas supplies, the move indirectly raises the pressure on Europe to allow the start of exports through the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. The ruble - one of the year's best-performing currencies - fell against the dollar for a third straight day, by 1%, to a five-week low. 3. Stocks set to open higher; Chinese e-commerce giants have a mixed Singles Day U.S. stock markets are expected to open a touch higher Friday, with sentiment driving direction in the absence of major market-moving news. By 6:15 AM ET (1015 GMT), Dow Jones futures were up 78 points, or 0.2%, on course for a weekly loss thanks to rising fears of inflation and higher interest rates. The S&P 500 futures contract was up 0.1% and the Nasdaq 100 contract also edged up 0.2%. Stocks likely to be in focus later include Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), which has lost nearly 20% this week against a backdrop of a weaker outlook (it still trades at over 10 times forward sales). Chinese e-commerce giants Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) will also be in focus after mixed fortunes on their 'singles day' sales event. Gross merchandise value processed by Alibaba's Taobao marketplace grew at less than 10% for the first time ever. 4. COP26 The world's biggest hot air fest came to a characteristically underwhelming conclusion in Glasgow, Scotland, as negotiators at the COP26 conference watered down yet another pledge to move beyond fossil fuels and head off the risk of catastrophic climate change. A draft final declaration from the summit softened language on phasing out coal power and removing subsidies for fossil fuel use \- largely at the insistence of Arab countries, according to Reuters. That adds to failures earlier in the week to make any substantial progress on creating a global market for carbon, enforcing earlier promises to help poorer countries finance the energy transition, or committing to annual reviews of how countries implement their promises. Agreement on long-term energy ideals was arguably never going to be realistic, given the short-term energy crisis currently afflicting many parts of the world, and the absence of Xi Jinping, who chose to stay home to secure a mandate from the Communist Party to rule as long as he wants. 5. Oil prices fall again as stronger dollar weighs By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. futures were down 1.7% at $80.20 a barrel, threatening to dip below $80 for the first time this week. Brent futures were down 1.5% at $81.67 a barrel. Baker Hughes' rig count later will give fresh indications as to whether U.S. producers are accelerating production plans in response to the recent surge in prices, or whether they are continuing to prefer to repair balance sheets. The CFTC's net positioning data will round off the week. Last week's data showed that money managers were not excessively long of oil, by historical standards.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE23","World Cement Association calls for MENA cement firms to decarbonise","April 22, 2022","BuildGreen","The World Cement Association (WCA) has called upon cement firms in the MENA region to take decarbonisation action, ahead of COP27 in Sharm-el-Sheikh, Egypt and 2023's COP28 in Abu Dhabi, UAE. All eyes are on the commitments and actions of the region's oil and gas sector; however, cement manufacturing in the MENA region is also significant, making up around 15% of the world's total production, a statement from the WCA noted. The first steps are being made with the UAE, India, UK, Canada and Germany launching the Industry Deep Decarbonisation Initiative at COP26 in 2021. Nevertheless, there has been limited progress to date across the region on decisive emissions reductions, with many pledges insufficient to reach a warming limit of two-degrees Celsius. Only the UAE and Saudi Arabia have made net zero pledges of 2050 and 2060 respectively, the organisation said. Consulting group and WCA member A3 & Co estimates that there is potential for companies in the region to reduce their CO2 footprint by as much as 30% with no investment required. WCA sees this as an opportunity for cement producers across MENA to take the lead and embark on their decarbonisation journeys today, which will both contribute to emissions reductions and save on operational costs, including energy and fuel, said a top official from the organisation. ""There has been a lot of discussion in Europe and North America about decarbonisation roadmaps for the cement industry and good work has been done to start on this journey. However, 90% of the world's cement is produced and used in developing countries; to impact overall industry emissions we must include these stakeholders. Cement companies in the Middle East have some low hanging fruit to take advantage of, which will lower costs at the same time as reducing CO2 emissions. At WCA we have a number of programmes that can help them realise this opportunity,"" remarked WCA CEO Ian Riley. The WCA is said to be the original international cement association and represents the cement industry and its stakeholders. Corporate Members are cement producers and have equal rights regardless of size or nationality. It connects members across the world and provides practical help to improve competitiveness and sustainability. \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE24","The role of industrial clusters in advancing the energy transition","April 12, 2022 Tuesday","ArabianBusiness.com","During COP26 Accenture, an information technology and consulting company, defines industrial clusters as geographic areas that comprise co-located companies representing either a single or multiple industries. Because of high energy consumption, use of raw materials and complex global supply chains, industrial manufacturers are among the world's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases. Fossil fuel combustion and industrial purposes in the UAE produced 203 million metric tons of CO2 emissions in 2020. Although this was the third consecutive year that emissions in the UAE have declined, there is still a long way to go. As nearly 70 percent of the global economy committed to net zero, I believe industry leaders and governments will need to explore solutions that could accelerate this transition while ensuring profitability. As such, industrial clusters will have a key role to play. The proximity of multiple industrial energy consumers creates an opportunity to scale low-carbon technologies through multi-stakeholder collaboration and can yield sizeable economic opportunities. In fact, McKinsey's research suggests that next-generation climate technologies could attract $1.5trillion to $2tr of capital investment per year by 2025. Luckily, climate technologies can help implement net-zero solutions for industrial clusters. If deployed widely, these technologies could deliver about 60 percent of emissions abatement by 2050. As my work involves extensive research about industrial clusters and climate technologies, I have found that some of the main technologies that could help lower industrial emissions include carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), hydrogen, and electrification. CCUS technologies According to the Centre for Climate and Energy Solutions, CCUS technologies can capture more than 90 percent of CO2 emissions emitted from industrial facilities by capturing the CO2 before is released into the atmosphere and storing it underground. CCUS technologies are particularly beneficial in decarbonising sectors with heavy emissions. Some industrial clusters are geographically advantaged in that their geological features allow them to pursue undersea storage for carbon capture and storage, such as in Scotland. At present, the deployment of CCUS is still limited due to costs, equipment requirements and energy consumption. However, further investment in R&D as well as additional incentives can make CCUS more economical. Last year, ADNOC announced a partnership with French oil major Total to explore opportunities in CO2 emission reductions and CCS. This was sought after as the UAE announced its goal to reduce its carbon intensity by 25 percent over the next decade. Hydrogen: As a clean-energy carrier and a fuel, hydrogen could play a significant role in decarbonisation. High-energy density and zero-carbon combustion makes hydrogen well suited to address a large percentage of GHG emissions that would be hard to abate with electricity alone. This includes sectors such as aviation and shipping, industry, buildings, and road transport. Hydrogen has the potential to satisfy 15 to 20 percent of energy demand. In fact, green hydrogen was featured in emissions reduction pledges at the UN Climate Conference, COP26 , as an important pillar of a net-zero economy. It has been recently announced that German companies have signed agreements with firms in the UAE to build up a hydrogen supply chain. This is one of the many steps that the UAE has been taking to advance its transition to net-zero. Electrification: According to IRENA's Electrification with Renewables report in 2019, electrification could cut annual carbon emissions nearly in half by 2050. As the prices of renewable electricity has dropped in recent years, the opportunity for electrification is significant as it allows industrial companies to lower their overall costs and emissions simultaneously. This is particularly beneficial for industrial sectors such as cement, chemicals, and steel as they consume the most energy in comparison to other sectors. Electrification is expected to feed 48 percent of global energy demand. The proximity of businesses to each other not only creates opportunities for systemic efficiencies and sustainable technologies, but it is a true opportunity to bring together supporters and stakeholders across the value chain. Additionally, industrial clusters can generate new jobs in underserved areas, and significantly improve air quality and health. Cross-sector collaboration and building research and innovation ecosystems is essential for the energy transition of the industrial clusters. Most importantly, this is a theme for what is required to achieve net-zero goals and mitigate climate change: partnership, awareness and collaboration are key in this scenario.

Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, and Head of the UAE delegation to the 26th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change - UNFCCC ( COP26 ), attended today the official launch ceremony of the Energy Transition Accelerator Financing (ETAF) Platform, a new global climate finance facility to accelerate the transition to renewable energy in developing countries. The UAE and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) today announced the launch of the global platform on the sidelines of COP26 , in Glasgow, the United Kingdom. The UAE committed US$400 million in funding provided by the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD) toward the platform's goal of securing a minimum of US$1 billion in total funding. Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan said, ""The new ETAF platform reinforces our long-standing commitment to support positive climate action in developing and vulnerable countries. As a signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the UAE fundamentally believes, we must work together globally, in partnerships, to mitigate the effects of climate change. The UAE is proud to act decisively in pushing forward a responsible, sustainability-led agenda, and in assisting other nations to benefit from the significant advantages of renewable energy."" Dr. Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and UAE Special Envoy for Climate Change, said, ""The UAE views development aid and climate action as powerful catalysts for economic growth, both domestically and internationally. Today's announcement will help to advance the economies of partner countries by providing reliable, low-cost renewable energy for businesses, industry, and homes. We are proud of this significant new contribution by the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development to accelerate climate action and deliver immediate economic benefits in the process. This is the kind of initiative that combines partnership, policy and finance to create tangible progress and it is this focus on practical results that has motivated the UAE to offer to host COP 28 in 2023."" Through co-financing, ETAF will aim to mobilise an additional US$2 billion in energy transition investments, targeting a total deployment of 1.5 GW of clean renewable energy generation and storage by 2030. ETAF will be managed by IRENA from its Abu Dhabi headquarters, capitalising on the UAE's climate finance market and renewable energy innovation infrastructure. The new accelerator platform will help mitigate investment risks and finance renewable energy projects in developing countries that may otherwise struggle to secure sufficient capital. Francesco La Camera, the Director-General of IRENA, said, ""We have reached a defining moment in our generation's efforts to put our economies and our environment on a path to stability, resilience and shared prosperity. The energy transformation is the most attractive and effective tool we have to achieve that. This new investment platform reflects the UAE's commitment to shaping a sustainable future, and IRENA's efforts to serve its over 180 member countries as an indispensable energy transformation partner. We encourage multilateral development banks, international financial institutions, governments, and private sector actors to join us in bolstering sustainable development efforts."" The new UAE-IRENA partnership to establish the ETAF platform builds on the long-term collaboration between IRENA and ADFD, which includes seven cycles of the US$350 million IRENA-ADFD Project Facility. Between 2013 and 2020, the facility financed 26 projects in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, notably including Small Island Developing States. Mohammed Saif Al Suwaidi, Director-General of ADFD, said, ""IRENA and ADFD have an excellent track record working together on the development of major renewable energy projects in developing markets. These projects have significant environmental, economic and social impact that is transformational for countries and their people. Through this new platform, we seek to bring together finance and development partners from around the world under a shared vision to combat climate change."" ""Given the essential role that renewable energy projects play in achieving sustainable development for developing countries, ADFD has committed to allocating US$400 million until 2030 to enable accelerated deployment. These projects will have a great impact on local communities, helping beneficiary countries to achieve greater economic and social development,"" he added. ADFD has contributed to financing to a number renewable energy projects in developing countries, in addition to funding the UAE's initiatives to support renewable energy projects in island states, including the IRENA/ADFD Project Facility, UAE-Caribbean Renewable Energy Fund (UAE-CREF), and the UAE-Pacific Partnership Fund. In total to date, ADFD has worked with a number of clean energy partners and governments around the world to support the development of 90 renewable energy projects in 65 countries that have the capacity to generate more than 9,000 megawatts of electricity. With the new ETAF contribution, ADFD's total financing for renewable energy projects now stands at US$1.8 billion. The ETAF platform will source projects on an ongoing basis, supplemented by calls for proposals aligned with Paris Agreement and SDG milestones. Investment-ready projects identified under IRENA's existing Climate Investment Platform will also represent a notable pipeline. Moreover, H.H. Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed visited the UAE's pavilion at COP26 , and commended the efforts of the pavilion team and the delegation members and the keenness they showed to highlight the UAE's significant regional and global role in the field of climate action, especially since the UAE applied to host COP28 in 2023. During his visit to the pavilion, he met with a group of Emirati youth, and highlighted their pivotal role in adopting innovative solutions to deal with the fallout of climate change, and the active and important role they are expected to play at COP28. He also urged youth to enhance their contributions to climate action, noting that joint action, cooperation and constructive partnerships are the main course of action for tackling climate change. Furthermore, Sheikh Abdullah underlined the importance of strengthening international cooperation and coordination in dealing with the repercussions of climate change, to drive environmental preservation efforts and ensure a prosperous, sustainable future for generations to come.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE28","Climate change is the biggest security risk facing the world, says COP26 President","September 21, 2021 Tuesday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","ABU DHABI, 21st September 2021 (WAM) - Climate change is ""the biggest security risk for the world"", but it has the potential to bring peace between warring countries, said the president of COP26 . ""This is an opportunity for countries to reimagine their economies,"" Sharma said. But it will require funding. While climate change initiatives were still billions short of the promised $100 billion a year for poor countries to finance green growth, it was now evident that trillions of dollars are needed, much of it from the private sector, in addition to sovereign wealth funds and government spending. Sharma highlighted the UAE's leadership on climate action, which includes investing billions in renewables in the UK and a number of other countries. Sharma visited Abu Dhabi last April where he attended the Regional Climate Dialogue led by the UAE's special envoy for climate change, Dr Sultan Al Jaber. Asked if the current fallout from climate change could be a source of peace, uniting people in conflict, particularly in the Middle East, Sharma replied: ""People have understood that climate change is an issue which does not respect borders. And I would make the case that from a security perspective, climate change is the biggest security risk for the world. Whether it is rising sea levels, food availability or forced migration. That's why it's vitally important that every country steps up to the plate at Cop26 ."" Cop26 (Conference of the Parties) in November, regarded as the most important since the Paris Agreement on climate change. The key achievement in the 2015 deal was to restrict temperature rises to 1.5 degrees C. ""People have also talked about '1.5 to stay alive',"" said Sharma during the interview at his office in 9 Downing Street. He then reeled off a series of numbers required to keep 1.5 C ""within reach"" as carbon emissions continue to rise. ""We have to cut emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 and that tells you how stark the situation is,"" he says. ""It needs everyone to act. Every single nation has to come forward with ambitious plans to cut emissions by 2030, but then also set out net-zero commitments by the middle of the century."" ""We want to ensure that we close off all the final rules from the Paris Agreement, there are a number of outstanding issues after six years and we really need to resolve it"". Renewable energy was central to getting emissions down and Sharma praised the UAE for its policies that included signing a Memorandum of Understanding on climate action with the UK last Friday. Both government and private sector investment were key in helping developing nations decarbonise while growing their economies. ""How do you support these countries to transition to renewables, rather than going down the fossil fuel route?"" he said. ""I know that the UAE has been supporting countries as part of making that energy transition, in addition to sovereign wealth funds investing also. That is what we need to drive forward and make the case of green growth."" Britain had also demonstrated that ""green growth is possible"" in expanding its economy by 80 per cent yet cutting emissions by 40 per cent in the last three decades. Much of that was through massive investment in the offshore wind sector, which with the UAE's investment would quadruple in size by 2030 as the biggest in the world, leading to a welcome ""tumble"" in consumer prices. A similar boost could happen in the fossil-fuel-reliant Middle East. ""It has been incredibly encouraging what the UAE has been doing in terms of solar,"" he said. ""There is a real opportunity for Gulf nations to lead this renewable energy transition because they have a lot of sun and wind,"" said the MP, who also holds a place in the Cabinet. ""The UAE has shown leadership in the region because they set out an all-economy NDC [Nationally Determined Contribution] at the end of last year"". NDCs embody efforts by each country to reduce national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change Sharma was careful not to voice a position on the UAE's bid to host to the Cop28 climate change 2023 conference in Abu Dhabi, given his position as president of Cop26 . ""We're neutral on this but of course we're very happy to share our experiences in attaining Cop26 with the UAE,"" Sharma responds with an encouraging smile. ""I wish well to any country that is looking to host a Cop. It's a huge undertaking and the UAE did actually very successfully and at very short notice host a first regional climate meeting this year which I attended. We had very, very good discussions, so I think the UAE has demonstrated that it is able to organise these events."" The UK is optimistic about getting tangible results from the Cop26 meeting, but it will be a tall order. Getting all countries to commit to net zero by the middle of the century would be a key achievement for Cop26 , with more than 70 per cent having already signed up. Despite the frosty relationship between Britain and China, the Cop26 president said he has been able to have ""candid and constructive"" discussions with Beijing about ending its significant coal emissions. ""We have now got to the point where the G7 countries have signed up to say that they will not finance any international coal projects from this year. Of course, we would like China and the others as well to do the same,"" he said diplomatically, then praised its clean energy projects. ""China has a third of the world's renewable capacity and that's what we want to see encouraged around the world."" While the British government has invested ?12bn in renewables, its projects will only become viable if the private sector stumps up three times that amount. Sharma is optimistic it will. ""There's been a significant sea change over the last years, where very many in the private sector actually see the merits of green investment, that it's good for the bottom line. If you just look at the market capitalisations of companies that are going green as opposed to those in the old economy, you see the divergence. The private sector is absolutely on this journey with us."" Britain, with the help of the German and Canadian governments, is putting together a delivery plan ""to demonstrate to the world what the pathway is to get to the $100 billion a year"". ""But if you look at the amount of money that is going to be required in terms of energy transition around the world you're talking about trillions a year,"" he added. ""This is where the private sector and wealth funds are so vitally important, ensuring that they invest and ultimately get a return as well."" Asked to explain Cop26 to a teenager, Sharma, who has two daughters aged 21 and 19, recounts the dramatic impact of flooding, wildfires and hurricanes, some of which he has seen first-hand having travelled to 33 countries this year. ""It becomes incumbent on us - at this moment - to ensure that we get global temperatures within control,"" he said. ""I'm incredibly concerned. The decisions world leaders take are going to impact significantly on the next generation."" He said that climate events were clearly ""getting more ferocious and frequent"". One of the countries he visited was the Caribbean island of Barbuda that is still recovering from the destructive 2017 hurricane Irma. ""I said to them what message do you want me to take back?"" The response from Barbuda's people was sobering. ""They said: 'you've got to tell the world's biggest emitters that they have to take action otherwise we're not going to have a place to call home'."" \"

Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, Minister of Climate Change and Environment, announced the endorsement of the pledge at a high-level event titled 'The Way Forward: Bridging the gap on nature from COP26 to COP15' \- a joint event of the Leaders' Pledge for Nature, the High Ambition Coalition (HAC) for Nature and People, and the Global Ocean Alliance. The gathering was hosted by the governments of Costa Rica, France, and the UK in the presence of President Carlos Alvarado Quesada of Costa Rica. Endorsed by the European Commission and 92 countries from all regions, the Leaders' Pledge for Nature is a commitment to urgent and transformational actions aimed at addressing biodiversity loss, safeguarding the planet, and working collaboratively to achieve positive outcomes for nature, climate, and sustainable development. It highlights increasing the protection of the planet's land and oceans through effectively managed protected areas as one of the actions to achieve these goals. Almheiri said, ""The UAE is proud to endorse the Leaders' Pledge for Nature, committing to working with other nations to reverse biodiversity loss by 2030, and sending a powerful message that there is no conflict between nature conservation and the economy. The move aligns with our unwavering dedication to protecting our environment and preserving it for future generations, instilled in our nation by the founding father of the UAE, the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan."" Emphasising the importance of addressing the dual challenges of biodiversity loss and climate change, she added, ""The alarming magnitude of biodiversity loss can sometimes come across as an afterthought in the climate process, and it is critical that we as governments and stakeholders rally around dual-purpose deliverables. Aligning our agendas for tackling biodiversity loss and climate change is the only way we can resolve them, and take decisive collective action to preserve our planet and the life on it for future generations."" The Minister noted that protected areas play a key role in safeguarding ecosystems that provide habitats for biodiversity, and contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation. The UAE has 49 protected areas that account for 15.5 percent of its territory. The country has achieved Aichi Target 11 for terrestrial protected areas that span 18.4 percent of its land territory, and marine protected areas that account for 12 percent of its marine and coastal territory. The Leaders' Pledge for Nature entails shifting land use and agricultural policies away from environmentally harmful practices for land and marine ecosystems, and significantly reducing air, land, and marine pollution, particularly by eliminating plastic leakage into the ocean by 2050. It calls for a transition to sustainable production, consumption, and food systems that meet people's needs while remaining within planetary boundaries, and ensuring that future government policies and decisions factor in nature and environmental protection in a way that promotes biodiversity conservation, restoration, and sustainable use. By joining the Pledge, countries recognise the crucial role of science and research in the fight against ecosystem degradation, biodiversity loss, and climate change, and commit to engaging the whole of society, including governments, academia, business, finance, and local communities with a focus on women and youth. \"

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE32","Firm Dollar, ISM Survey, Mixed Chinese Data, COP26 - What's Moving Markets","November 1, 2021 Monday","Forexpros","Investing.com - By Geoffrey Smith Investing.com -- Monetary policy concerns keep the dollar firm and short-dated bonds weak at the start of a busy week for central bank meetings. The ISM business survey is due and may cement expectations of the Federal Reserve having to hike rates sooner than expected (Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) now sees the first hike as early as July next year). China's economy sends out mixed signals but the real estate crisis is - at best - grinding on. The COP26 climate conference seems set to be an anticlimax after G20 leaders failed to agree on how to accelerate the phase-out of coal, and oil prices are pushing higher ahead of this week's OPEC+ meeting. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, 1st November. 1. Dollar firm as Goldman warns of faster rate hikes Expectations of tighter monetary policy are front and center in investors' minds at the start of a week that is likely to see landmark decisions to wind down the stimulus that sustained the economy through the pandemic. The U.S. Dollar is consolidating close to the highs it posted on Friday after data showed prices for personal consumer expenditures \- the Federal Reserve's favored measure of inflation \- rising at 4.4% annually, the fastest in years. Two-Year U.S. bond yields topped 0.5% for the first time in 19 months in response, while analysts at Goldman Sachs moved up their forecast for the first Fed rate hike by a year to July 2022. The PCE basket showed that price increases, which had been confined to a few sectors earlier in the year, had broadened significantly.\~ Those data may or may not be corroborated by the ISM manufacturing survey, due at 10 AM ET (1500 GMT). The Fed's two-day policy meeting begins on Tuesday, and is expected to end with an announcement on phasing out the central bank's bond purchases, which are currently running at $120 billion a month. 2. China's PMIs send mixed signals; real estate crisis grinds on Two closely-watched Chinese business surveys sent out mixed signals, with the official purchasing managers index suggesting that manufacturing activity had contracted in October under the weight of fuel shortages, anti-pollution measures and ongoing Covid-19-related disruptions to production. The private-sector Caixin PMI, however, rose to 50.6 from 50.0 in September, offering some reassurance. Even so, junk bond yields rose to their highest since 2009 and Iron ore Futures fell as much as 4% amid continuing fears for the outlook of the real estate sector. Another top-20 developer by size, Yango Group, said on Monday it was looking to extend payment on three of its dollar bonds, sending its shares down 9% in Shenzhen. Elsewhere in Asia, the Nikkei rose over 2% in response to an emphatic election win for Japan's new Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who promptly promised a large-scale stimulus program. South Korea's trade numbers showed exports up 24% on the year, a little less than expected. 3. Stocks set to open higher; Coke, American in focus U.S. stocks are set to open at new record highs later, on broad-based optimism about the economic recovery - albeit volume may be lower than usual due to the shadow cast by the approaching Fed meeting. By 6:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), Dow Jones futures were up 154 points, or 0.4%, while S&P 500 futures were also up 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.3% Stocks likely to be in focus later include Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), after The Wall Street Journal reported that Coke is to buy out the rest of sports drink maker BodyArmor, upping its efforts to challenge the dominance of Pepsi's Gatorade. Also in focus will be American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), after weather and tight staffing rosters snarled its weekend flying schedule, and gaming platform Roblox (NYSE:RBLX), which was hit by a lengthy outage over the weekend. 4. COP26 Coal lives to fight another day, after the G20 Group of Leaders from industrialized and emerging nations failed to agree on new proposals to phase it out of the world energy mix at their meeting on Saturday. That lack of unity is likely to frustrate the efforts of negotiators at the COP26 climate conference this week, which will be forced to confront the unwelcome reality that most of the pledges made under the 2015 Paris Climate Accord have not been honored. Efforts to step up the fight against climate change have been thrown into disarray over the last two years by the pandemic and by the subsequent surge in global energy prices as world manufacturing recovered from it faster-than-expected. That has resulted in carbon dioxide emissions quickly returning to their pre-pandemic trend. 5. Oil pushes higher ahead of OPEC+ meeting Crude oil prices rose in overnight trading, supported by a broadly positive tone in risk assets that also lifted European stocks to new highs for the year. Reports continue to bubble about the OPEC+ meeting on Thursday, but an increase in output above and beyond the 400,000 barrels a day already outlined seems unlikely: OPEC's Joint Technical Committee cut its expectations for 2021 demand last week, although it left its 2022 forecast unchanged.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE37","What will a future with climate-smart agriculture look like?","March 16, 2022 Wednesday","ArabianBusiness.com","Climate change and sustainability initiatives continue to drive corporate conversations as more private and public sector stakeholders unite their efforts in preserving the planet for the future. The latest of such efforts is Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for Climate), a global initiative led by the UAE and the US with the support of over 140 government and non-government partners. The initiative addresses climate change and global hunger and is looking to increase investment in and support for climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation over five years (2021-2025). Its most recent accomplishment was this February where it announced a new target to raise investment commitments from $4 billion, pledged when AIM for Climate launched at COP26 in 2021, to $8bn by the 27th COP27 in November. In an interview with Arabian Business, Jaime Adams, senior advisor for International Affairs at the US Department of Agriculture and David Livingston, senior advisor to John Kerry, the Special Presidential Envoy for Climate discuss the climate change challenges in the region and how AIM for Climate is addressing them. What is the impact of the global food system on climate change? JA: Agricultural production can have unintended consequences of contributing greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide to the atmosphere. Under the use of climate-smart agricultural practices, these contributions can be greatly reduced but innovation is needed to evolve these tools with a changing climate while maintaining food security. What do you see as the main environmental challenges in the GCC? DL: Ensuring the global food supply while reducing greenhouse gases is a challenge presented by climate change. The global community has an opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and store carbon all while ensuring adequate food production through climate-smart agriculture. How does AIM for Climate aim to address these challenges? JA: Farmers around the world benefit every day from climate-smart agriculture innovation. However, more must be done. We are at a crossroads facing the challenges of ending global hunger and addressing the climate crisis. Together, we can do more, and agriculture must be part of the solution. Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for Climate) is a global initiative led by the UAE and the US with the support of over 140 government and non-government partners. AIM for Climate seeks to address climate change and global hunger by uniting participants to significantly increase investment in and support for climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation over five years (2021-2025). Our goal is that AIM for Climate will encourage ambitious investment in climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation that will help create a surge of solutions, enabling the world to meet nutritional needs, increasing agricultural productivity, improving livelihoods, conserving nature and biodiversity, building resilience to climate change, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and sequestering carbon. Can you outline the targets for AIM for Climate over the next five years? DL: AIM for Climate is a landmark initiative uniquely focused on increasing investment and enabling greater public-private and cross-sectoral partnerships focused on these challenges. Our goal is that, over the next five years, AIM for Climate partners will mobilise new investment - targeted in the billions of dollars - in climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation. In fact, at the recent AIM for Climate Ministerial held in Dubai, UAE on February 21, AIM for Climate partners announced a new target to raise investment commitments from $4 billion, pledged when it launched at COP26 in 2021, to $8bn by the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. Government partners provide the crucial foundation of AIM for Climate, through a wave of new public investment in climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation. But other sectors, including business, philanthropy, and other non-government partners, are invited to build upon that foundation with ""innovation sprints"" - investments in specific, impactful, expedited efforts - or by providing critical knowledge for identifying investment gaps, challenges and opportunities.

This year's Global Energy Perspective study by McKinsey was released at time when global energy markets are facing unprecedented uncertainties, including the conflict in Ukraine. The report nonetheless indicated that the long-term transition to low-carbon energy systems continues to see strong momentum and, in several respects, acceleration. Leading up to COP26 , a total of 64 countries, covering more than 89 percent of global emissions, have pledged or legislated achieving net zero in the coming decades. To keep up with these net-zero ambitions, the global energy system may need to significantly accelerate its transformation. The report projects a rapid shift in the global energy mix, with the share of renewables in global power generation expected to double in the next 15 years while total fossil fuel demand is projected to peak before 2030, depending on the scenario. However, even with current government commitments and forecasted technology trends, global warming is projected to exceed 1.7&deg;C by 2100, and therefore reaching a 1.5&deg;C pathway is increasingly challenging. ""However, even if all countries with net zero commitments deliver on their aspirations, global warming is still expected to reach 1.7&deg;C.

The report presents specific outlooks per fuel type such as natural gas, oil, coal, hydrogen and sustainable fuels, as well as a view on the role of CCUS (carbon capture, utilisation and storage) in decarbonising the energy sector. Other key findings of this year's report include: Hydrogen demand is expected to grow four to six times by 2050, driven primarily by road transport, maritime, and aviation Hydrogen and hydrogen-derived synfuels are expected to account for 10 percent of global final energy consumption by 2050 Rapid technological developments and supply chain optimisation have collectively halved the cost of solar, while wind costs have also fallen by almost one-third. As a result, 61 percent of new renewable capacity installation is already priced lower than fossil fuel alternatives. Battery costs have also fallen by nearly half in the past four years Global oil demand is projected to peak in the next three to five years, primarily driven by electric vehicle uptake By 2050, CCUS could grow more than 100-fold from an almost non-existent footprint today, with investment opportunities exceeding LNG markets today Future growth in energy investments will almost entirely be driven by renewables and decarbonisation technologies Despite net-zero commitments from governments and corporations, an 85 percent renewable power system by 2050, and the rapid update of EVs and decarbonisation technologies, global warming is projected to exceed 1.7 degrees For all the latest business news from the UAE and Gulf countries, follow us on Twitter and Linkedin, like us on Facebook and subscribe to our YouTube page, which is updated daily. \"

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE42","Energy transition provides opportunity to transform and diversify the economy, while driving global growth: Sultan Al Jaber","January 18, 2022 Tuesday","Emirates News Agency (WAM) - Business (English)","ABU DHABI, 18th January, 2022 (WAM) -- The UAE sees the energy transition as an opportunity to transform and diversify the economic growth model of the country, according to Dr. Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and Special Envoy for Climate Change. Speaking during a virtual panel session titled 'Projecting COP Ambitions across COP27 and COP28 and Economic Diversification Priorities Post-pandemic' at the Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ADSW), Dr. Al Jaber explained how the UAE and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region can take advantage of the drive to climate action. Dr. Al Jaber was speaking alongside the Rt. Hon. Alok Sharma MP, President of COP26 , and Sameh Shoukry, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Egypt and President-Designate of COP27, during the session moderated by Fred Kempe, President and CEO of the Atlantic Council. Dr. Al Jaber said, ""This region has specific advantages that can accelerate the energy transition from our position as energy leaders. Firstly, as long as the world continues to rely on oil and gas we can ensure reliable supplies of the least carbon intensive oil and gas available. We are leveraging this position to further drive down the carbon intensity through expansion of the first in the region carbon capture facility. ""We are also building on our unique capabilities in hydrogen to lay the foundation for a zero carbon hydrogen market. And, as you know, the UAE has been investing in the solar and broader renewable space for the last 15 years, and we are doubling down on this investment."" Dr. Al Jaber pointed out that globally, at least US$3 trillion will be invested in renewable energy over the next ten years. He said this represents a multi-trillion dollar opportunity that the UAE, the region and its international partners can capitalise on. ""In fact, this is the thinking behind our Net Zero Strategic Initiative. Net zero, for us, is about new industries, new skills and new jobs. For us, the business of tackling climate change is simply good business."" Dr. Al Jaber cited the recent strategic partnership between Abu Dhabi National Energy Company PJSC (TAQA), Mubadala Investment Company (Mubadala) and Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) which transformed Masdar into a global clean energy powerhouse. He said the new Masdar has almost doubled its renewable energy capacity and the ambition is to build on this solid foundation to reach 100 gigawatts (GW). Dr. Al Jaber called for partners, in the public and private sectors, to join the UAE and Masdar in delivering these ambitious goals that will lead to new industries, new skills, new jobs and new opportunities. Responding to a question on the outcome of COP26 (the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference), Dr. Al Jaber noted it was a success as Glasgow united 90% of the world's economy on the path to net zero. ""COP 26 also succeeded in launching many coalitions between governments and businesses to accelerate innovation. AIM for Climate, which the UAE launched with the US and 34 other countries is a good example. This is a growing coalition that directs investment to agri-tech to reduce agricultural emissions, which account for as much a third of global emissions. And critically COP26 finally reached a deal on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which lays the foundation for effective carbon markets. All of this creates great momentum and a great platform which Egypt and the UAE can, and will, build on."" On COP28 which is set to take place in Abu Dhabi in 2023, Dr. Al Jaber highlighted that it will mark the first ever global stocktake that will show us how we are tracking towards the Paris goals and, critically, it will set the roadmap towards 2030 and beyond. He added that the UAE is already working closely with the UK and Egypt to continue the momentum of COP26 and went on to detail the UAE's approach to COP28. ""We want Abu Dhabi to be where the world turn pledges into concrete results and help take commercially viable climate solutions to scale around the world. This is why we want COP 28 to be as inclusive as possible, reflecting the views of developed alongside developing countries, the public and private sectors and scientists and civil society."" ""Inclusive also means including the expertise that exists across the energy spectrum, and specifically the hydrocarbon industry, because if we want to successfully transition to the energy system of tomorrow, we cannot simply unplug from the energy system of today. We need to make the current system work more efficiently with less carbon. We should leverage expertise from across the energy sector to find the climate solutions we need,"" said Dr. Al Jaber as he stressed the need to always remember that the goal is to hold back emissions, not progress. Rt. Hon. Alok Sharma MP expressed his optimism that both COP27, which will be hosted by Egypt, and COP28 will be successful while Sameh Shoukry highlighted that COP27 will be the first COP in what should be an ""implementation decade"", where the world steps up its collective efforts to implement the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris agreement. \"

Mr. Guterres's comments came on Thursday as he unveiled his new initiative to develop stronger standards for ""net-zero"" pledges by partners below the national government level, in the fight against climate change. The key objective is to stop global temperatures from rising 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels \- as the international community agreed in Paris in 2015. But the UN chief warned that the world was losing the race to reduce global temperature rise. Governments had the biggest responsibility to achieve net-zero emissions by mid-century \- ""especially the G20"" industrialized nations he said - before calling on ""every business, investor, city, state and region to walk the talk on their net-zero promises."" The Expert Group will make recommendations before the end of the year addressing four areas, he told the launch: Current standards and definitions for setting net-zero targets. Credibility criteria used to assess the objectives, measurement and reporting of net-zero pledges. Processes for verifying progress towards net-zero commitments and decarbonization plans. And, a roadmap to translate standards and criteria into international and national regulations. He noted that the Group of experts was gender-balanced and geographically diverse, ""with deep experience across government, business, the global financial system, civil society and academia."" They will be working in a personal capacity, ""and I expect them to consult widely, extensively and transparently to hear the perspectives and views of all stakeholders"", the UN chief concluded. He praised the commitment being made at Thursday's meeting to create a new brains' trust to make the commitments on net zero, a reality, in the form of the new advisory High-Level Expert Group. At COP26 ""Today we take a step towards meeting that need and ensuring the highest standards of environmental integrity and transparency. To avert a climate catastrophe, we need bold pledges but matched by concrete, measurable action."" He stressed that net-zero standards at every level of activity, and strengthened accountability around implementing those goals, would deliver real and immediate emissions cuts. \"

Climate change is now a communications challenge if we are to achieve the shift that is required from governments, corporations, and citizens to each play their role in working towards a net-zero future. It has been confirmed that COP27 will take place in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, in November 2022 and that the UAE will host the COP28 International Climate Conference in 2023. Playing host for the next two International Climate Conferences is significant for the Middle East as it isthe world's hottest, driest, and most water-scarce region. It presents the opportunity to raise awareness of critical issues such as climate adaption and help the world navigate through the energy transition. In the next few years, the Middle East may prove to be a vital staging ground for the global battle against climate change. ""Business leaders in the region have big decisions to make on their organization's role on climate change. The demand for climate change counsel from communications practitioners is rising with the need to be able to clearly communicate the importance of new sustainability goals and inspire stakeholders and customers to follow suit,"" says Abdulrahman Inayat, Co-Founder, and Director of W7Worldwide. ""The urgent need to address climate change is now part of the COVID-19 recovery narrative and companies that do not have a strategy in place that supports a sustainable future will be left behind,"" added Inayat. W7Worldwide has produced a guide with &lsquo;7 Post COP26 Communications Strategies to Build Back Sustainably from COVID-19' to help business leaders and organizations future-proof their sustainability strategy. The report advises that communicators need to educate themselves on the goals that underpin COP, as these will start to become more specifically aligned to the communications strategy of many companies and sectors. COP26 decisively set the new sustainability agenda, and this respectively will shape communications strategy and output. It's reported that 67% of the public believe businesses should lead on tackling climate change, so businesses must act. Companies with relevant and impactful sustainability strategies will attract customers and public support. More and more citizens recognize that some crises are too big to solve alone. Brands can show that, like COVID-19, tackling the climate crisis needs everyone's efforts as part of their social responsibility and commitment to the planet. Now is the time for brands and organizations to articulate and tell their sustainability story. The sustainability story must be one of the key pillars of the corporate communications plan to show what it means to the business. Organizations are looking to engage more people, and to make sustainability accessible and understandable for everyone, they need to work closely with the media to ensure their message lands. Millions of people know that climate action is urgent. To convince others, communicators need to drop the jargon and produce more relatable content. They also need to provide a compelling call to action that is hard to argue against and will bring in social and environmental benefits. Climate anxiety is thought to be at an all-time high - particularly among young people. There is a fine balance between communicating the gravity of the situation and fuelling fear. It is important therefore to sell the positive of sustainability, not the negative and talk about the solutions a business brings. In sharing more and more stories about achievements and challenges, sustainability will become a vibrant part of an organization's culture and strategy. \"

Once the 6.3MW project is complete, JLT will be home to one of the UAE's largest district solar car shade installations, the authority said. The project will result in a significant reduction in power consumption tariffs for the district, generating savings each year for property owners, in turn making JLT more affordable for residents and tenants alike, the DMCC statement explained. DMCC said the project is being funded from the cost savings achieved by the energy generation, so there will be no additional cost to the JLT community. The 20-year agreement for the project was signed as part of the Dubai Clean Energy and Net Zero Carbon Strategy 2050, which will provide 100% of Dubai's total power capacity from clean energy sources. It also forms part of DMCC's extensive sustainability strategy, which will see a reduction in the business district's impact on the environment, with a particular emphasis on water and energy usage, the statement noted. Work is set to commence in March 2022, with additional DMCC assets and other energy reduction initiatives set to join the scheme in the coming period, DMCC said. ""As seen at COP26 , sustainability and decreasing carbon emissions are among the most critical issues that people and businesses face today. Sustainability is integrated into every level of DMCC, which is why we are proud to be driving Dubai's decarbonisation efforts. Through initiatives such as this, we are able to deliver an enormously positive impact to the 100,000 people that live, work and enjoy the JLT district,"" said DMCC chief operating officer Feryal Ahmadi. The installation of solar panels across JLT is said to follow on from another solar car shade initiative at One JLT. In addition to the solar project, a range of energy saving initiatives have been implemented over the past 12 months and have reduced consumption from the national energy grid by over 30%, noted Ahmadi. Sustainability and other ESG issues are a core focus for DMCC. In August 2017, DMCC became the first freezone in the GCC to commit to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), encouraging responsible business practice throughout the entire value chain. As part of its commitment to the UNGC, DMCC publishes an annual sustainability report that highlight's the business district's progress on sustainability targets, concluded Ahmadi.

This 20-year agreement was signed as part of the Dubai Clean Energy and Net Zero Carbon Strategy 2050, which aims to source 100 percent of Dubai's total power capacity from clean energy sources by 2050. It also forms part of DMCC's extensive sustainability strategy, which will see a reduction in the business district's impact on the environment, with a particular emphasis on water and energy usage. Work is set to commence in March 2022, with additional DMCC assets and other energy reduction initiatives set to join the scheme in the coming period. The chief operating officer of DMCC, Feryal Ahmadi, said: ""As seen at COP26 , sustainability and decreasing carbon emissions are among the most critical issues that people and businesses face today. ""Sustainability is integrated into every level of DMCC, which is why we are proud to be driving Dubai's decarbonisation efforts. Through initiatives such as this, we are able to deliver an enormously positive impact to the 100,000 people that live, work and enjoy the JLT district."" The installation of solar panels across JLT follows on from another solar car shade initiative at One JLT, which will achieve further significant cost savings. In addition, a range of additional energy-saving initiatives have been implemented over the past 12 months and have reduced consumption from the national energy grid by more than 30 percent. Sustainability and other ESG issues are a core focus for DMCC. In August 2017, DMCC became the first free zone in the GCC to commit to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), encouraging responsible business practice throughout the entire value chain. As part of its commitment to the UNGC, DMCC publishes an annual sustainability report that highlight's the business district's progress on sustainability targets.

During the COP26 climate talks held in November 2021, the UAE and U.S. launched the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate, to encourage investments of $4 billion from governments and non-government innovation partners. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Thomas Vilsack told Reuters, ahead of the Agriculture Innovation Mission's first ministerial meeting in Dubai, that the Mission now aims to generate $8 billion in climate-smart investment commitments by the next COP27 climate talks in Egypt. ""We believe we actually need to set a higher goal. President Biden believes we should get $8 billion by COP27,"" Vilsack said. The initiative is supported by 140 partners, and the initial $4 billion target comprised $1 billion each from the governments of the U.S. and the UAE, while $1.8 billion came from other governments and $200 million from non-government partners. The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently said it would invest $1 billion in pilot projects for climate-smart commodities, which will promote farming, ranching and forestry practices that reduce emissions. The U.S. farming industry is already battling the effects of climate change, such as higher incidences of drought and flooding. A Gulf oil producer that imports most of its food and desalinates seawater for potable water, the UAE is investing heavily in agricultural, water technologies and clean energy, and will host COP28 climate talks in 2023.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE54","UAE places climate security at the center of the global security agenda","March 9, 2022 Wednesday","Emirates News Agency (WAM) - Business (English)","NEW YORK, USA, 9th March, 2022 (WAM) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE), in line with the far-sighted vision of its leadership, has adopted a partnership approach which focuses on financing projects in countries most exposed to climate risks as climate finance can enable sustainable economic growth while promoting peace and stability, according to Dr. Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and Special Envoy for Climate Change. Delivering the opening remarks at a United Nations Security Council meeting on Climate Finance for Sustaining Peace and Security, Dr. Al Jaber explained that the UAE has provided over $1 billion in climate aid to more than 40 countries, with a special focus on island and least-developed nations. He added that the UAE has also provided several billion dollars in recent years in disaster and conflict relief where climate impacts are a contributing factor. The Arria-formula meeting, an informal meeting of Security Council members, was chaired by Dr. Al Jaber. Ambassador Lana Nusseibeh, Permanent Representative of the UAE to the UN, delivered the opening remarks at the meeting which had in attendance Ambassador Mohamed Abushahab, Deputy Permanent Representative of the UAE to the UN. During his speech, Dr. Al Jaber noted that geopolitical tensions are challenging international peace and stability. He said that while the world deals with these challenges, we should not lose sight of other existing and emerging threats that undermine our collective security. The UAE's experience in climate financing underscores that, where appropriate, viewing climate action through the lens of international peace and security can aim finance at priority sectors such as food and water security, according to Dr. Al Jaber. He explained this is one of the goals of the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for Climate), an initiative that the UAE launched last year along with 38 countries to scale up investments in agricultural innovation from drought resistant seeds to water-efficient vertical farming. Addressing dignitaries including, John Kerry, U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, and The Rt. Hon. Alok Sharma, COP26 President, Dr. Al Jaber called for an inclusive approach that empowers women and ensures climate finance contributes to equitable sustainable development when financing projects. ""Fair and balanced climate finance will make all communities more resilient in the short term and will deliver a dividend of peace well into the future."" Reiterating the importance of climate finance in the fight against climate change, Dr. Al Jaber urged the international community to do more to support developing nations. ""Climate finance is one of the most important tools to manage climate risks."" ""Yet,"" Dr. Al Jaber noted, ""the international community continues to fall short of the $100 billion climate finance pledge made to developing nations over a decade ago. Many countries on the Council's agenda, as well as countries affected by rising sea levels, emphasize this amount alone will be insufficient."" Dr. Al Jaber stressed ""robust, sustained and ambitious climate finance is a critical enabler of continued climate progress and risk reduction."" He added that ""greater access to guaranteed finance is critical."" ""The latest IPCC (Intergovenmental Panel on Climate Change) report highlights the scale of the challenge, stating that up to 3.6 billion people are now highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, particularly in fragile states. Climate impacts are a matter of peace and security. These impacts are likely to drive significant displacement and competition over resources, and if not addressed, could be the source of many future conflicts."" Dr. Al Jaber acknowledged that the report provides some encouraging signs of progress to build on in the months and years ahead and a blueprint for how we can protect and strengthen our most vulnerable communities. He also noted COP26 (the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference) aligned 90% of the global economy on a net zero development pathway and called for a similar step-change on adaptation, particularly for communities most at risk. Concluding his remarks, Dr. Al Jaber called for greater alignment between security and climate strategies in fragile countries. ""We know that climate is not always a factor in security. But we also know that the more we can align security and climate strategies in fragile countries facing climate risks, the more we can mitigate those risks, reinforce resilience and accelerate sustainable economic growth.""

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE55","AB Talks: The Middle East energy transition is not a ""zero sum game"" and needs to be more inclusive","April 6, 2022 Wednesday","ArabianBusiness.com","With Egypt set to host COP27 and the UAE set to host COP28, all eyes have turned to the Middle East - especially countries such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which have set ambitious net-zero targets and have successfully begun implementing carbon capture, solar, wind, and green hydrogen projects, among others. Yet, experts have stated that the discourse around energy transition in the region needs shift into more inclusive and balanced territory. Speaking to Arabian Business on the latest episode of AB Talks, Dr Ahmed Ali Attiga, the chief executive officer of the Arab Petroleum Investments Corporation (APICORP), said: ""An energy transition that is balanced, pro-active, and inclusive, requires the dialogue to be much wider between all the stakeholders than what has taken place. For example, at COP26 , the oil producers were not even invited. ""The region in particular, sits at the intersection of both sides of the transition. It's one of the largest hydrocarbon producers, but at the same time, it has embraced and started the implementation of serious measures to diversify the energy mix. This is how the energy transition needs to be looked at. It's not a zero-sum game where one side wins and the other side loses. The objectives of the energy transition should not be mutually exclusive, but rather an integrated process of diversifying the energy mix and making all elements of the mix greener and cleaner."" Another part of making energy diversification more inclusive will revolve around enhancing private sector partnership in energy transition. Earlier this year, APICORP and Saudi-based Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) started the 'Infra Initiative' - a $1bn private sector-focused financing initiative. Commenting on the need for more such initiatives, Attiga added: ""Partnerships between multilateral financing institutions can help in accelerating the energy transition in a balanced direction, while mobilising additional funding for projects and transactions that are required to move in this direction. ""Over the past few years, the participation of the private sector in executive energy and infrastructure projects have grown by 20-25 percent. By using different vehicles and schemes such as private-public-partnerships, private equity, and project financing such initiatives can help countries that are coming out of a conflict or are in the middle of a transition."" Meanwhile, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has caused volatility in commodity prices, while oil prices have lingered above $100 per barrel for more than a month. ""The uncertainties in the world have taken a very dangerous turn globally, with the Russia-Ukraine war that unfortunately started a few weeks ago,"" Attiga said. ""The early warning signs in terms of supply chain disruptions, inflation, and other macro- and micro-economic effects are very worrying. We hope that matters don't escalate and that containment limits the damage that this crisis has caused. Given that Russia is a key member of the OPEC+ alignment it is hard to predict what will happen in the oil markets going forward. The fact that the OPEC+ remains resilient, and has kept to its framework agreements through this crisis is what has kept the market from severe fluctuations.""

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE58","Digital transformation: Creating a sustainable future","February 22, 2022 Tuesday","ArabianBusiness.com","The recent United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) saw country leaders convene to discuss upcoming commitments and goals in the mission to end climate change.   "" COP26 has kept the 1.5 degrees alive. But its pulse is weak and it will only survive if we keep our promises and translate commitments into rapid action,"" said Alok Sharma, President for COP26 . Every industry needs to take accountability to innovate sustainable processes and ensure implementation has an impact, including a set of nonfinancial criteria like diversity, business ethics, wellbeing, and shareholders rights. For the architecture, engineering, and construction industries, it has become a priority in order to respond and prepare for the future, with the pandemic being the catalyst for this change in thinking. To change what we create, we must change how we create, with sustainable, equitable and resilient outcomes in mind. As these industries are notably major contributors to pollution and waste, with the construction industry generating over a third of global waste, with volume expected to double by 2025, a key factor in making this shift is digital transformation through actionable information and digital tools that help achieve sustainable outcomes. This is already seen as a top priority, with 69 percent of Autodesk industry customers currently supporting the UN Sustainable Development Goal 13 regarding climate action. The future of sustainability has many avenues however we focus our efforts to advance positive outcomes across three primary areas: energy and materials - maximising energy efficiency and lower carbon emissions from materials used to make the supply chain more sustainable; health and resilience - building safer, healthier, and more sustainable infrastructure; and work and prosperity - aiming to have an impact on the entire workforce by advancing access to learning skills of the future. Digital transformation will, therefore, need to be the partner for the new possible, with tech and software transforming industries. Reshaping the processes and developing the tools needed to meet the intensifying industry demands of today can propel the industry towards a more sustainable world that benefits everyone. These industries need to be unified in their approach, with industry-focused solutions, such as the Autodesk Forge platform, empowering customers with data and insights, as well as delivering total carbon solutions to help these industries to get the insights that will allow them to design and develop products in a more sustainable, equitable and resilient way. Notably, rethinking business plans, design, and manufacturing of products is no small task. While many companies understand the importance of digital transformation, the process of transitioning entire processes and securing the necessary buy-in is a colossal effort. A significant impediment is that many digital tools are too complex and too siloed, making change unnecessarily difficult. However, through innovative software enhancements, such as through Autodesk Fusion 360, it is fulfilling its mission of providing leaders, innovators, and designers of tomorrow with the digital tools and the knowledge needed to address some of the biggest challenges. In a global research project by Altimeter and Autodesk conducted in July 2021, the research surveyed approximately 750 software buyers and users across key geographies, job titles, and company types. Ultimately, the research confirmed that the past two years had made digital transformation critical, with 65 percent saying digital transformation had disrupted the industry to a moderate or great extent (69 percent for D&M, 58 percent for AEC). It then increased to 71 percent when respondents were asked if digital transformation will disrupt industries in the next two years to a moderate or great extent (D&M 75 percent and AEC 65 percent). Businesses reported a myriad of benefits for digital transformations, including improved efficiency and reduced costs as key components. Convergence to play a key role in digital transformation To develop sustainable digital transformation processes, convergence is ultimately the solution, meaning the blending of previously separate technologies, processes, and data to create new combinations of products, services, and experiences that reshape industry structures. Companies are now anticipating and preparing for the next wave of digital convergence disruption. It is notable that 95 percent of all respondents said convergence of some kind was already affecting their industry today and 73 percent agreed that their organisation approached convergence as a competitive advantage for their company. Through the process of convergence, it benefits organisations first, translating into improved efficiency and reduced operating costs. To put it into context from an industry standpoint, it is common to find technologically obsolete wastewater network infrastructures and an increasing number do not meet the standards of being in a state of good repair. Updated processes are integral to the health and wellbeing of community residents and critical to improving society and protecting the environment. However, to understand the condition of the network, teams need the tools and resources to manage, inspect, and respond to risk before it becomes a problem. An example of how digital convergence is assisting in sustainability can be seen through Afsluitdijk - a 32-kilometre dam with a sustainable infrastructure has been at the forefront for Dutch hydraulic engineering. The project has focused on protecting and preventing damage to the dam and its surroundings, whilst offering ecological and recreational mechanisms. The planners rely on the latest technology so each team can work collaboratively and efficiently, allowing them to strengthen the enclosure dam, increasing the capacity for it to discharge water, as well as construct pumps to move water into the sea. Another instance comes from the late 19th century when scientists began to recognise urban heat islands through the discovery of the city of London often being a few degrees higher than the surrounding rural areas. A few degrees difference can impact thermal comfort, caused in part by the process of concrete, asphalt, brick, and other materials absorbing and re-emitting heat during the day and cooling more slowly at night. This isn't just a comfort issue, but rather it is also a sustainability issue. The US Environmental Protection Agency estimates an increase of just 2&deg;F may increase the use of air conditioning by 1-9 percent - powered mostly by electricity produced by fossil-fuel-powered plants. Through microclimate analysis tools, real estate developers, urban planners, and architects can evaluate the thermal comfort of outdoor spaces. While methods of calculating the urban heat island effect already exist, they're often accessible only to expert users, take hours to run, or do not visualise the data. New microclimate analysis programmes, such as Spacemaker, are fast, intuitive, and highly visual. For the first time, the entire site planning team can quickly see the impact of design decisions on thermal comfort, specifically in this case heat islands, and resolve any issues efficiently and effectively. Buildings generate nearly 40 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. A combination of processes can therefore help meet emissions reduction targets set by the Paris Agreement - and reinforced by Glasgow Climate Pact - such as the Autodesk Total Carbon in beta. Combining Revit data with open-source energy analysis and material carbon data in the cloud, Total Carbon provides real-time, accurate, and reliable total carbon analysis. Tools such as this give users the insights they need to create sustainable designs in Revit, making it easier for them to design for environmentally friendly outcomes from the start. It is safe to say that new solutions and the convergence of current software processes have been key in unlocking the insights and unleashing the innovation that is needed to help industries design more sustainable buildings, construct more resilient cities, and make a better future for all. What we build must be paired with how we build, and digital transformation for sustainable outcomes is undeniably at its core. By industries accepting and working together to develop new processes, it allows for sustainable goals to be met and most importantly, become the industry standard that is needed to ensure a sustainably led future. \"

It also discussed directions supporting the hydrogen and industrial fuel sector. Sharif Al Olama, Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure for Energy and Petroleum Affairs, led the meeting from the UAE side, whereas Ernst Peter Fischer, the Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany to the UAE, chaired the meeting from the German side. At the meeting were Yousef Al Ali, Assistant Under-Secretary for Water, Electricity and Future Energy Affairs; Elien Von Zitwitzer, Director of Bilateral Energy Cooperation at the German Federal Ministry for Economics and Climate Protection, and several concerned officials from both sides. The meeting was informed that specialist technical groups had been formed to develop the hydrogen market in the two countries. The first working group is concerned with developing hydrogen business and technology while the second will develop policies and legislation in hydrogen, to realise the vision of both countries, and to achieve the roadmap for leadership in hydrogen for the UAE, launched at the Global Climate Change Summit ( COP26 ) in Glasgow. The roadmap represents a comprehensive national plan to support low-carbon local industries, achieve climate neutrality and enhance the country's position as a source of hydrogen. This is within the framework of consolidating the directions of rational leadership by promoting future solutions to support the Global Climate Initiative. The latest of these is the UAE's strategic initiative for climate neutrality 2050, the first in the Middle East and North Africa. Sharif Al Olama stressed that the joint working group announced in November 2021 aims to maximise the benefit of bilateral cooperation in the field of clean energy between the two countries, especially green hydrogen, by strengthening cooperation and strengthening ties between the two governments and the private sector and research institutes. The group is working on organising a forum to discuss obstacles to the market's absorption of green hydrogen, promoting ambitions to expand the horizons of clean energy production, and supporting the Paris Agreement on climate change. He said that the UAE can be a global centre for clean energy in all its forms, especially hydrogen, and it is currently one of the leading countries in developing this field. Al Olama praised the bilateral relations between the UAE and Germany, which have witnessed tremendous progress over the past few years, thanks to the leadership of the two countries, mutual trust, respect, and shared interests. The meeting is part of a high-level steering group established from the ""Declaration of Intent"" of the cooperation agreement signed by the UAE and Germany in 2017. \"

Participants reiterated their renewed commitment to drive collective climate action and address regional concerns on the impact of climate change in the region and around the world. Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Chairman of WGEO and MD and CEO of Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA), commended the efforts of regional governments in the transition towards a green economy. He said that the ministerial roundtable Is one of many others taking place in MENA Climate Week, and WGEO is committed to fostering a green course of development and finding a balance between economic growth and environmental protection. Al Tayer noted that WGEO came into existence in response to the priorities and concerns identified at the Rio+20 UN Conference on Sustainable Development, and it has supported cooperation between governments, the private sector, and the international community. WGEO received observer status from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) during the 26th Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ). The organisation is committed to a global green economy transition, which depends on the principles of exchange of knowledge, experience, best practices, and success stories. The participation of policymakers in events, such as these, plays an important role in creating a framework for nurturing the planet's ecosystems and mitigating the impact of environmental degradation on human welfare. ""For us in the UAE, growth is continuous. We, as a nation, have embarked on a journey of becoming a global hub and a successful model for a new green economy that can attain economic sustainability while preserving its environment for future generations. The vision of the UAE leadership can be seen in our nation's policies. As we look forward to creating a better future for our descendants, I would like to welcome global leaders to be a part of this journey and promote successful green economic solutions that meet current economic and environmental needs as well as address the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2030,"" said Al Tayer. Waleed Bin Salman, Vice Chairman of WGEO, noted that the UAE has shown its commitment to embracing and building momentum towards a green economy. So much so, that in October our wise leadership announced a plan for net-zero emissions by 2050, with significant investments in renewable energy. The UAE is the first country in the Middle East and North Africa to launch a substantial initiative to achieve this ambitious climate commitment ""Advancing the green economy requires international cooperation, guaranteeing a new approach and a stable partnership among all stakeholders around the world. Today's roundtable on the green economy will bring us closer to making these solutions available and accessible to other nations and lead us towards true change,"" added Bin Salman. The first-ever MENA Climate Week is being held at the Atlantis on The Palm in Dubai from 28th to 31st March 2022. The event is hosted by the UAE Government, represented by the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MoCCAE), WGEO, and DEWA, in collaboration with the UNFCCC, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and the World Bank Group. The event is supported by regional partners, including the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the League of Arab States Secretariat, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for West Asia (ESCWA), and the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB). \"

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE63","Let's not forget zero hunger is as important as zero emissions","November 14, 2021 Sunday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","Ahead of the COP26 Climate Change Conference, a photo of world leaders tossing a coin into Rome's famous Trevi Fountain went viral. It started with a post on Twitter by Portuguese politician Bruno Ma\'e7\'e3es, which was captioned: ""World leaders toss a coin at Trevi for good luck fighting the climate emergency."" Naturally, the Internet did its thing and ran amok with memes, sarcastic comments and quick-witted criticisms. On Reddit, one user wrote: ""You know what's better than luck? Effort."" Another wondered why US President Joe Biden was missing from the picture. ""Where's Joe? Taking a nap?"" The ridicule and ensuing controversy may have been warranted if the narrative for the picture had been true. But world leaders weren't tossing coins into the Trevi for good luck fighting the climate emergency; they were participating in a photo-op to mark a centuries-old Roman tradition. Throwing a coin into the fountain  with your right hand over your left shoulder  means you will return to Rome, according to ancient legend. Yet, underlining how fake news and misguided narratives are born, the Internet was quick to associate it with a false climate change narrative instead. Then again, that's understandable. Everywhere you turn, one statement is clamouring for attention, blaring louder than others  world leaders aren't doing enough. Other variations, inspired largely by climate activist Greta Thunberg's spirited protests, are also commonplace. They've turned a blind eye to climate change for decades. They would rather profit from environmental destruction than leave behind a habitable Earth for the next generation. They  with their private jets and premium leather Oxford shoes  simply don't care. In other words, everything they've spewed thus far is just a spate of ""blah, blah, blahs."" Thunberg and other activists are far from off-base; climate change is indiscriminately wreaking havoc all over the world. Satellite images show that wildfires around Lake Baikal in southern Siberia have left burn scars that can be seen from space. Coastal cities in the Gulf could drown as sea levels rise. The Maldives, a tourism hotspot, is predicted to disappear by the end of the century. Just last year, the UK recorded some of the highest temperatures and rainfall. Of course, the time to take action is now, but no one  rich, poor, empathetic or tactical  was going to be able to trounce the crisis in two weeks. Long before the summit ended, Thunberg declared COP26 a failure. For the most part, it was, especially because emerging economies didn't get the funding they deserved. But even if COP26 fell short in many ways, we can't forget that it was a spark that ignited global action. The world has known about the climate crisis for decades. In 1988, Nasa scientist James Hansen told the US Congress that the greenhouse effect had arrived. His words marked the beginning of the end of the world as we know it, spurring the US to become a founding member of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. But more than 30 years went by and world powers showed little interest in tackling the climate emergency. At least we can say with some confidence that things have changed since then. COP26 brought climate change to the forefront  thanks, in part, to activists such as Thunberg. Some of the efforts may be too little, too late, but the summit did make a few waves. For the first time, the Glasgow Climate Pact struck a deal to ""phase down"" coal, which contributes to about 40 per cent of annual carbon dioxide emissions. The very mention of fossil fuels in a climate agreement is a win for the COP26 presidency, even if the spirit had to be watered down. An earlier draft of the pact included a commitment to phase ""out"" coal, rather than phase ""down."" But India led the opposition, with climate minister Bhupendar Yadav questioning how developing countries could promise to phase out coal when they ""still have to deal with the development agendas and poverty eradication. The last-minute amendment had Alok Sharma, the British president for COP26 , fighting back tears as he told delegates he was ""deeply sorry"" for how the events had unfolded. Apparently, leaders, even the ones who are criticised, do care and understand the gravity of fighting the climate crisis. In his address, Sharma acknowledged that the win was a fragile one. ""The hard work starts now,"" he said. Ultimately, the world is making a more concerted effort now than it has in decades. In particular, the UAE, which is set to host COP28 in Abu Dhabi in 2023, has stepped up to the plate. Dr Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and Special Envoy for Climate Change, summarised the UAE's climate goals best when he told the Atlantic Council that the country views green energy not as a threat, but as a ""unique opportunity"" to capitalise on its strength and financial expertise. What really matters, despite all the talk about COP being ""blah blah blah"" is that there are no quick fixes, especially when you consider the intrinsic link between climate and sustenance. With billions still reeling under poverty, unilateral solutions are simply impossible. Thunberg and others are not wrong to fight for urgency, but the world cannot just halt fossil fuel burning like closing a tap. When the UN Sustainable Development Goals' first priority of ""zero hunger"" still remains unaddressed, what we need is a ""solutions COP"" of practical climate action linked to poverty and hunger eradication. The UAE's promise to work towards that, therefore, makes headlines for the right reasons. HYPERLINK mailto:gopika@khaleejtimes.com gopika@khaleejtimes.com \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE64","Europe's real climate muscle is its market, and US is realising it","November 10, 2021 Wednesday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","Almost lost in all the headline news generated at the whirlwind G20 and COP26 summits was a steel and aluminium trade agreement between the EU and US that removes a major trade irritant left over from the previous American administration. US manufacturers will get access to cheaper clean steel and aluminium from Europe while Europeans with a hankering for Kentucky bourbon or Harley-Davidson motorcycles will find those products and others more affordable. Unable to influence geopolitics through military power, the EU is increasingly using its real power as the most desirable market globally, a compelling trading bloc of 27 nations with 450 million affluent consumers and some of the greatest manufacturers in the world. Starting first with metals, cement and energy, if you want to sell into the EU, you will need to pay the carbon price. And though US President Joe Biden is having trouble pushing his most progressive policies through a majority of Congress, it is clear he and his advisers are interested in following the EU lead. The US-EU deal includes future development of a long-term plan to confront other nations on overproduction and applies pressure on exporters of carbon-intensive steel, though specifics have yet to be negotiated. COP26 global climate summit, which by design is about bargaining and voluntary steps. The summit carries no mandates or enforceable requirements. The new EU-US metals deal is not just a simple return to the status quo of 2018. It is a template for efforts to address the existential threat of climate change, starting by reining in overproduction in the steel industry, one of the biggest CO2 emitters in the world. ""Together, the United States and European Union will work to restrict access to their markets by dirty steel and limit access to countries that dump steel in our markets, contributing to worldwide oversupply,"" the White House said. It is a small step towards fixing a ""leaky"" system on carbon pricing and emissions regulations. The EU has robust carbon market with rules and prices that push industries to reduce pollution. But imported goods often don't face such constraints. The EU's answer is CBAM, effectively an import levy on carbon-intensive products. If it works as designed, the programme incentivises companies to invest in green technologies, and not just in Europe. Overseas producers will have to comply to access the market. Other nations could also join in the effort, creating a club of economies dedicated to curbing global warming through carbon taxation. Carbon border levies weren't scheduled to be formally discussed at the COP26 summit under way in Glasgow, but European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen said the EU will push ahead, starting with plans to tax a handful of imported raw materials based on their carbon content. ""We will now introduce slowly but surely a carbon border adjustment mechanism that says if you come with dirty products on our market, you have to pay a price as if you were in the emissions trading system of the European Union,"" von der Leyen said at a COP26 side event. ""But we prefer that you keep the money in your economy by putting a price on carbon in your economy."" Can the border tax, or the threat of it, actually work to clean up dirty emissions? The answer is yes, at least according to Turkey. Its climate envoy to the COP26 summit said the threat CBAM helped push the country to finally ratify the 2015 Paris Climate Accord just weeks before the event in Glasgow began. A Franco-German guarantee of $3.2 billion in financial support helped push Turkey to sign the Paris accord, but CBAM  which would hit Turkey hard  also played a role, said envoy Mehmet Emin Birp nar. Former senator and secretary of state John Kerry, special climate envoy for the US, said Biden wants to evaluate Europe's CBAM and that the US could deploy its own border adjustment tax. Other nations might also be interested, but the EU's tough love for the climate is far from universally embraced. In addition to developing counties that say they can't afford to clean up their act so quickly, even some in the EU are strongly resisting. At the COP26 ""This is not a deal but an ideology,"" he said, adding that the initiative would hurt citizens by making fossil fuels more expensive. Poland is also a vocal critic of EU policies. Warsaw recently called for ""revision or postponement"" of the bloc's 2030 climate plan, blaming the recent surge in energy prices on the EU's carbon trading system. ""It will be met by those who frankly are largely not in this room,"" Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told COP26 . ""It will be our scientists, our technologists, our engineers, our entrepreneurs, our industrialists and our financiers that will actually chart a path to net zero."" That might sound good in theory, but those more wary of human nature know often the only way to ensure consistent action is self-interest \- and few want to lose income because they didn't adapt. In such an important issue all civilised leverage possible should be used. Europe's real muscle is its market.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE65","The agricultural sector is ripe for disruption","April 13, 2022 Wednesday","ArabianBusiness.com","Nobel Prize winner Norman Borlaug is credited with saving over a billion lives from starvation worldwide in the late twentieth century &ndash; thanks to his innovations in high yield, disease-resistant wheat varieties. With these new wheat varieties countries like Mexico, India, and Pakistan dramatically eased two critical issues: hunger and food security. Today, a third issue &ndash; climate change &ndash; is combining with ongoing hunger and food insecurity to create a trifecta of highly interrelated global challenges. The food sector generates around 35 percent of human-made greenhouse gas emissions, according to a recent peer-reviewed article in Nature Food. This is the backdrop to the UAE and US announcing $4 billion at COP26 for the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for Climate), a multilateral endeavor to bolster innovation in climate-smart agriculture and food systems over the next five years. Overall, the UAE has committed more than $163 billion to invest in clean and renewable energy sources over the next thirty years as part of its UAE Net Zero 2050 strategy. This complements the UAE's existing portfolio of food security programmes under the National Food Security Strategy 2051, positioning the country to attain its objective of ranking top in the Global Food Security Index by the middle of the century. A combination of complexity, urgency, and abundant capital make the overlap of food and climate innovation a perfect target for an ambitious entrepreneur. Sowing the seeds A burgeoning ecosystem of relevant entities, support, and policy initiatives already exists in the UAE &ndash; attracting startups to focus on these areas. Earlier this year Dubai launched the Food Tech Valley with an aim to triple the UAE's food production while ensuring sustainability and conservation of resources. Last November, the Abu Dhabi Agriculture and Food Safety Authority unveiled a new development to increase the efficiency of sustainable farming. T his month, the UAE FoodTech Challenge launched its second $2m competition to bring ground-breaking startups to the region in order to seed the most innovative, commercially viable, and sustainable technologies to strengthen the nation's food security. And startups are successfully spinning up in response. In Dubai, Sokovo announced it will build a vertical farm to produce thousands of tonnes of fruits and vegetables every year, while the International Centre for Biosaline Agriculture is working to cultivate crops with a minimal carbon footprint. Satsure is building an AI-enabled irrigation project in Abu Dhabi to improve water-use efficiency by leveraging big data. Red Sea Farms (a winner of the 2020 UAE FoodTech Challenge) reduces the carbon and water footprint of our food by developing sustainable, saltwater-based agricultural systems. The UAE is proving to be a significant testing ground for novel food technology solutions. Many are already demonstrating that they are effective and energy-efficient, with vertical farm crops and hydroponic systems using 70 to 95 percent less water and over 90 percent less land than traditional systems. In short, it is early days, but early developments are promising. Agri-innovation startAD, the Abu Dhabi-based global startup accelerator powered by Tamkeen and anchored at NYU Abu Dhabi, has been a part of this success &ndash; attracting talent to the UAE and supporting startups through its impact programs. Innovators and entrepreneurs are poised to continue capitalizing on this momentum in the Emirates, finding new ways to turn good ideas into great businesses. Food security is the focus at this year's edition of Angel Rising, hosted by VentureSouq and startAD, since it is such a policy priority for the UAE, and wider GCC which imports between 80 percent and 90 percent of its food. Angel Rising's aim is to educate the next generation of mission-driven investors from the GCC on the growing trends in and returns from food security-focused startups. The investment potential is enormous: the agricultural sector overall is worth $3.5 trillion, four percent of global GDP, and employs 874 million people, accounting for 27 percent of the global workforce. Producing enough food for a projected global population of 10 billion people by 2050 all while protecting the planet is an urgent global challenge. Nearly 10 percent of the global population was undernourished in 2020 according to the United Nations, and the situation is expected to become more dire without the type of innovative solutions that Norman Borlaug dedicated his life to creating. By challenging startups to address the food security and climate overlap, the UAE is investing not only in its own future but the planet's.

Stop treating nature like a toilet,"" said UN Secretary-General Antonio Gutteres. ""Let's do all we can,"" chanted celebrity teenage environment activist Greta Thunberg at the COP26 summit in Glasgow. Prince Charles chimed in and said: ""Time is literally running out to save the planet."" Indeed, the world is warming and land could go under as oceans rise. Cities and people are at risk and celebrity politicians, environmentalists and royalty are predicting gloom and doom if we continue to burn coal and fuel. There's dread, fear and a volcano of frustration all over the world that little's being done to save the world from a climate apocalypse. We hear them but livelihoods are at stake in the developing world as newer, cleaner technology taking longer to reach them. The pandemic may have changed the way we work and commute, albeit briefly, but that's not enough to reverse climate disaster, proclaim the experts. The West, meanwhile, is taking its green lessons seriously and is attempting to keep things cool in their part of the hemisphere that has seen the full extent of the Industrial Revolution. We are now in a phase of history that's been called the Fourth Industrial Revolution where virtual technology rules. However, virtual tech has serious environmental issues: it involves producing more electricity that could, in turn, warm the earth further. It's a cycle we cannot ignore because the future depends on how we deal with and mitigate the impact of climate change. Now, let's go back to who's responsible for the most emissions since 1750. Our World in Data shows the US has emitted 410.2 billion tonnes of carbon. China comes in second but has emitted half that amount of the gas. Russia, Germany and the UK follow have also done their part to raise CO2 levels. India and others follow suit but these carbon emissions are a fallout of recent growth spurts. The trouble with conclaves like COP26 is that there's a lot of talk and no concrete action. Development goals are in open conflict with green statements; temperature targets are unlikely to be met. Human activity has been blamed for a warmer world and must be curtailed to keep temperature rise below 1.5C under the previous Paris climate deal. But countries are prone to flouting these limits as they draw up growth plans post the pandemic. How do you hold them to account? Punitive action is ruled out. Setting temperature limits, while showing intent, does little to prevent a warmer planet. The result could be devastating for future generations who deserve a better, safer life. It's important to dig deeper to reach a consensus on the dangers of climate change. Rich countries have a moral obligation to help the developing world with green technology. Unless that happens climate summits like COP26 will hold out false hopes. \"

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE75","KT Exclusive: Climate change is the most serious threat to the future of our planet, says UAE Minister Almheiri","November 8, 2021 Monday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","As the UAE Minister of Climate Change and Environment, Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri leads the Ministry's mission of spearheading the UAE's drive to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change, protect the country's ecosystems, and enhance its food and water security. She is currently in Glasgow as part of the UAE delegation to the 26th UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) that ends on November 12 . Khaleej Times asked her about the young nation's efforts to become a game changer in global climate action. Edited excerpts from the exclusive interview: What's been the UAE's stand on climate change? The UAE views climate change as the most serious threat to the future of our planet. The nation's journey in climate action started with its accession to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1995. In 2015, the UAE became the first country in the GCC region to sign the Paris Agreement that seeks to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Last month, the nation reaffirmed its climate leadership by launching the UAE Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative as the first country in the region to pursue a net-zero pathway. The UAE is also a prime convener of global climate action, having staged events such as the Abu Dhabi Climate Meeting in 2019, the UAE Regional Climate Dialogue in 2021, Climate and Biodiversity Week at Expo 2020 Dubai, and the annual Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week. Earlier this year, the country announced its bid to host COP28 in Abu Dhabi in 2023. What is the UAE Vision 2021? How can it bring about sustainable development? Sustainable environment and infrastructure is one of the six national priorities under the UAE Vision 2021. The National Agenda of the UAE Vision 2021 focuses on improving air quality, conserving water resources, boosting the share of clean energy in the country's energy mix, increasing the percentage of treated waste out of the total waste generated, and implementing green growth plans in sectors such as infrastructure, telecom, logistics and housing. How has the UAE integrated climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning in light of the National Climate Change Plan of the UAE 2017-2050? The Plan charts the UAE's path forward in climate change mitigation and adaptation. Within its framework, the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE) is implementing the National Climate Change Adaptation Program that aims to strengthen the country's climate resilience. As part of the program, we have assessed climate risks across key sectors \- energy, infrastructure, health and the environment \- and are working to prepare sectoral adaptation action plans. The Ministry is also currently developing the region's first climate change law. How has the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) evolved as the heart of the clean energy revolution? IRENA was established in 2009 \- at a time when the development and deployment of renewables was accelerating, but many barriers remained. Since then, the Agency has emerged as a credible source of knowledge on all aspects of renewables \- from science and policy to technology \- and is an authority on national and global information and trends in this domain. Its role involves national capacity building on renewable energy, facilitating renewables finance, helping countries map their renewables potential, and identifying market trends and enablers. IRENA works with other relevant international agencies to advance the global clean energy transition and climate action. As the host country and key supporter of IRENA, the UAE is proud of the Agency's achievements. How is the UAE committed to developing a healthcare system resilient to climate change? In July 2019, the UAE Government launched the UAE National Framework for Action on Climate Change and Health 2019-2021 in partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO). The Framework outlines the country's strategic response to public health challenges posed by climate change. It considers high-priority risks that emerged from the risk assessment exercise undertaken as part of the National Climate Change Adaptation Program while laying the ground for continued assessments and capacity building among stakeholders. Under the Framework, a National Committee on Climate Change and Health has been established to coordinate the development of a relevant policy and action plan. Why should COP26 COP26 must succeed not only for the sake of the Middle East but for the sake of the people and the planet. Climate risks are increasing, and devastating impacts of climate change are already being witnessed all around the world. For a fighting chance to keep global warming below 1.5\'b0C, we must scale up and accelerate our efforts to achieve net zero by the middle of the century. The window of time to act is closing, and COP26 provides a prime opportunity for the international community to reinforce its commitment to climate action. Lastly, should the least developed countries and developing nations pick up the tab on behalf of their more prosperous and developed counterparts? Just the opposite \- developed countries must support developing nations in reducing their carbon footprints and strengthening their climate change adaptation capabilities by mainstreaming climate change solutions in development aid, facilitating technology transfer and building local capacities. At COP26 , we are looking to developed countries to meet their commitment to allocating US$100 (367.30) billion of public finance for climate action. One of the key enablers of a climate-resilient future is renewable energy, and the UAE is leading by example in supporting the deployment of renewables in developing nations. To date, we have invested $16.8 (Dh61.71) billion in renewables ventures in 70 countries. To facilitate project financing, we have launched the $350 (Dh1,285.55) million IRENA/Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD) Project Facility, as well as the UAE-Pacific Partnership Fund and the UAE-Caribbean Renewable Energy Fund, valued at $50 (Dh183.65) million each. And just a few days ago, at COP26 , the UAE partnered with IRENA to launch the Energy Transition Accelerator Financing (ETAF) platform that seeks to mobilize $1 (Dh3.67) billion in renewable energy financing for developing countries by 2030. ADFD has already contributed $400 (Dh1,469.20) million to the platform. HYPERLINK mailto:joydeep@khaleejtimes.com joydeep@khaleejtimes.com \"

""Our ambition is to ultimately achieve net-zero emissions flying in the UK and across Europe, and we are proactively working alongside industry leaders, such as Airbus and Wright Electric, to help support and champion zero-emission technologies for passenger planes of the future."" Aviation Minister, Robert Courts, welcomed the announcement, ""It's great to see easyJet joining Race to Zero on COP26 's Transport Day. "" COP26 represents an opportunity to build momentum in reducing aviation emissions, particularly ahead of the next ICAO Assembly in 2022. ""easyJet are stepping up to the challenge \- putting in place a net-zero roadmap which will help secure a sustainable future for the sector and create green jobs in the process."" In 2019, easyJet became the first major airline worldwide to offset the carbon emissions from the fuel used for all its flights, and currently remains the only major airline in Europe to do so. This comes at no additional cost to its passengers and the airline only supports projects that are certified by either Gold Standard or Verified Carbon Standard. However, easyJet acknowledges that offsetting can only be an interim solution. easyJet is working with its partners Airbus and Wright Electric to accelerate the development of zero emission technologies. The airline is optimistic that it could begin flying customers on planes powered by hydrogen-combustion, hydrogen-electric or a hybrid of both by the mid to late-2030s. The airline is also striving to reduce fuel consumption, with single-engine taxiing on departure and arrival and the use of advanced weather information to improve navigation performance. Since 2000, easyJet has reduced its carbon emissions per passenger kilometer efficiency by more than a third. \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE80","KT Edit: New generation walks the talk on climate","November 3, 2021 Wednesday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","Glasgow COP26 Summit plans to iron out environmental concerns facing Planet Earth The Glasgow COP26 Summit  which is incidentally serving a (largely) sustainable menu to delegates from around the world  plans to iron out environmental concerns facing Planet Earth. Big announcements have been made by key players, including the US, China and (host) the UK, and the issue of climate change seems all set to be at a tipping point. Be that as it may, one person has been grabbing headlines on her own dime. Greta Thunberg. The Swedish teenager who's now become the face of climate change activism for the 'woke' generation, has been in the news for organising a sort of an ""anti-camp"" in the city, and talking about how politicians  or 'world leaders'  and people in power who have gathered ""are pretending to take our future seriously, pretending to take the present seriously of the people who are being affected already today by the climate crisis Change is not going to come from inside there. That is not leadership  this is leadership""  and by this she means it is up ordinary folks to be agents of change. One can be divided in opinion on Thunberg's brand of ""activism"", which, at times, her detractors feel, borders on rabble-rousing, but the larger point she makes about we, the people, being the catalysts for climate change is interesting. The point is underscored by the findings of the Arab Youth Survey that was commissioned in a timely manner so that the results could be released during COP26  as a reflection of what Arab youths, the future of the Middle Eastern region, feel about this burning issue. The survey factored in thoughts of 3,400 young Arabs, in the age group of 18 and 24, and their collective response vis-\'e0-vis climate change is hugely positive and a clear indication that this is a region, and a generation, that wants to walk the talk when it comes to saving Planet Earth. Fifty-six per cent  more than half of those surveyed  said they are concerned about the environment and what is being done with it. As a token gesture of wanting to walk the talk, almost two-thirds respondents said they would boycott a brand  however appealing it may be  if its core values are not aligned with sustainability. That is what is called taking ownership. Even before the results came in, the UAE, for instance, has been empowering its future generations with its strong focus on the matter, which is why the GCC comes up trumps in the region: almost four out of five young people feel that the government is leading from the front when it comes to environmental legislation. \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE81","Climate justice requires women's leadership","March 30, 2022 Wednesday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","The world is well aware that the climate crisis is one of the main stumbling blocks to sustainable development. And yet, despite the dramatic evidence of the lethal consequences of climate change, and despite possessing the knowledge, technologies, and resources to fix it, we continue on the same high-carbon path that threatens our survival. We also know that climate stabilisation depends on a whole-of-society response, and thus on all citizens' equal and fair participation in governance. That has not happened, either: Women have been under represented in climate decision-making. And while this trend has slowly been reversed, much more needs to be done to advance a gender-sensitive response to climate change. Three imperatives stand out: women's leadership, indigenous rights, and education. Efforts to improve gender parity in climate governance have been ongoing for nearly a decade. In 2014, delegates to COP20 adopted the Lima Work Programme on Gender to encourage the inclusion of more women in climate-change negotiations. But five years later, at COP25 in Madrid, 60 per cent of government delegates and 73 per cent of heads and deputy heads of delegations were men. This imbalance led to the adoption of the Enhanced Lima Work Programme and Action Plan on Gender. Under the enhanced plan, the parties to global climate talks pledged to appoint and provide support for national gender and climate-change focal points for climate negotiations, and for project implementation and monitoring. Even so, from 2019 to 2021, women occupied only 33 per cent of all leadership positions in climate-change negotiations and expert mechanisms. But efforts to include women in these discussions continue. The final agreement issued at the close of last November's COP26 in Glasgow included gender equality and women's leadership as central components of climate policy and action strategies. This represents clear recognition that the transition to net zero will be possible only through active citizenship, with women playing a vital role. Women are disproportionately affected by the climate crisis, but they are also important agents of change. Giving women a seat at the decision-making table and using a gender lens to shape low-carbon development strategies will go a long way toward making progress on efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change. The transition to carbon neutrality requires a radical change in production systems and consumption patterns across all sectors. Women must be part of the process to develop effective policies. The task is daunting, but there are examples to follow. Costa Rica, for one, has set a clear path toward net-zero carbon dioxide emissions. Since 2014, more than 98% of the energy generated in Costa Rica has come from renewable sources. And in 2021, the country was awarded the Earthshot Prize for its conservation model, according to which local citizens are paid to preserve and restore natural ecosystems, including rainforests. Costa Rica's success can be attributed largely to the commitment of its citizens to sustainable development and the involvement of indigenous and rural women in climate adaptation, knowledge production, and efforts to strengthen resilience. Indigenous and rural women in particular are the most vulnerable to climate change and environmental degradation. The inclusion of these women in creating sustainable practices is thus central to ensuring the effectiveness of climate-related decisions. Initiatives such as Club de Madrid's Shared Societies approach emphasize that indigenous communities have the right to be involved in these discussions, and acknowledge that local communities are more likely to support and implement conservation plans when they are fully invested in their development. Education is also a crucial component of inclusive climate decision-making. In 2021, UNESCO called for environmental education to be a core curriculum component in all countries by 2025. The Berlin Declaration on Education for Sustainable Development states that environmental education must be available to girls and boys alike from an early age to ensure that future generations have sufficient knowledge to respond to climate change. Emphasizing gender equality and non-discrimination in access to climate knowledge and skills will boost the ability of young people to effect change. The recent all-male ""CEO lunch"" convened at the Munich Security Conference shows that women are still missing from the highest levels of global decision-making. Yet women's leadership is needed to respond effectively to shared global challenges. Without the active and meaningful participation of women and girls in local, national, and global climate strategies, a carbon-neutral future will remain out of reach.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE83","UAE asserts strong climate action equals strong economic growth at high-level pre-COP26 climate talks in UK","July 26, 2021 Monday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","ABU DHABI, 26th July, 2021 (WAM) -- Dr. Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, the UAE's Special Envoy for Climate Change and Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology, met his counterparts in London for high-level talks ahead of November's COP26 climate change summit in the UK. During the ministerial gathering, which included ministers from 40 countries, and in meetings with UK officials and business leaders on the sidelines, Dr. Al Jaber took the opportunity to advance the UAE's progressive agenda on climate action tied to economic growth. Dr. Al Jaber said, ""Our leadership firmly believes that proactive climate action is a powerful engine of economic growth. In line with this vision, the UAE has always been a regional leader, as the first the first country in the region to sign and ratify the Paris Agreement and the first in the region set an economy-wide reduction in emissions by 2030, as part of our second nationally determined contribution (NDC). We are keen to partner with the rest of the world to share best practices, technology and innovation, ensuring we fast track efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change in ways that deliver real and substantial social and economic benefits."" The London meeting was aimed at achieving consensus and building momentum on several topics to be addressed at COP26 , including mitigation, adaptation and climate finance. At the meeting, Dr. Al Jaber discussed global efforts to enhance climate change resilience and adaptability, as well as efforts to leverage clean technologies to enhance global growth. In particular he referenced the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM-C) initiative, announced at the Leaders Summit on Climate in Washington last April. AIM for Climate, of which the UAE is a founding member, alongside the United States, aims to significantly increase innovation and R&D spending on agri-tech initiatives aimed at enhancing food and water security, reducing emissions from agriculture and providing new climate friendly industries. He also reaffirmed the UAE's offer to host COP28 in 2023, underlining the UAE's commitment to a consultative multilateral process aimed at speeding consensus. In May, the country announced its bid to host the 28th Session of the Conference of the Parties (COP28) to the UNFCCC in Abu Dhabi in 2023. The move received a positive response worldwide given the UAE's track record on clean tech innovation and the country's considerable expertise as a global climate action convener. He also noted that the UAE would ensure that COP28 is a springboard for progressive climate action that delivers both social and economic dividends. On the sidelines of the Ministerial, Dr. Al Jaber held bilateral meetings with COP26 President Alok Sharma, US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, John Kerry, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa, Md. Shahab Uddin, MP, Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Bangladesh and Jong-Moon Choi, Vice Foreign Affairs Minister of the Republic of Korea, in which he highlighted the UAE's keenness to partner for progress, leverage climate action for economic opportunity and play a constructive role through multilateral cooperation within all relevant international forums, including the UNFCCC. During his visit, the Dr Al Jaber also met with, The Rt Hon Anne-Marie Trevelyan, Minister for Business, Energy, Clean Growth, Lord Grimstone, Minister of Investment and Bernard Looney CEO of BP, where he stressed the UAE's commitment to leverage UK-UAE partnerships across the public and private sectors to invest in innovation that can achieve climate goals, along with sustainable growth. Dr. Al Jaber commented that the UAE's approach to climate action is closely tied to its economic development. ""The UAE's track record and future ambitions in climate action perfectly align with the country's plans to diversify and build a knowledge-based economy, spur sustainable development across key sectors and bring socio-economic benefits to our country while influencing progress regionally and internationally,"" he said. The UAE has already built a strong foundation of energy and economic diversification that the country will build on. The country has repeatedly broken the world record for the lowest cost of solar energy generation and is home to three of the world's largest and most cost-efficient solar power plants. Furthermore, it is the first country in the region to use carbon-free nuclear energy, and a regional pioneer in industrial-scale carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS). In addition, the UAE is exploring blue and green hydrogen projects, leveraging its existing resource base and expertise in gas production, supply chain infrastructure and transportation. \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE84","WHO's 10 calls for climate action to assure sustained recovery from COVID-19","October 12, 2021 Tuesday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","GENEVA, 11th October, 2021 (WAM) -- Countries must set ambitious national climate commitments if they are to sustain a healthy and green recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The WHO COP26 COP26 ) in Glasgow, Scotland, spells out the global health community's prescription for climate action based on a growing body of research that establishes the many and inseparable links between climate and health. ""The COVID-19 pandemic has shone a light on the intimate and delicate links between humans, animals and our environment,"" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. ""The same unsustainable choices that are killing our planet are killing people. WHO calls on all countries to commit to decisive action at COP26 to limit global warming to 1.5 C \- not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it's in our own interests. WHO's new report highlights 10 priorities for safeguarding the health of people and the planet that sustains us."" The WHO report is launched at the same time as an open letter, signed by over two thirds of the global health workforce - 300 organisations representing at least 45 million doctors and health professionals worldwide, calling for national leaders and COP26 country delegations to step up climate action. ""Wherever we deliver care, in our hospitals, clinics and communities around the world, we are already responding to the health harms caused by climate change,"" the letter from health professionals reads. ""We call on the leaders of every country and their representatives at COP26 to avert the impending health catastrophe by limiting global warming to 1.5 C, and to make human health and equity central to all climate change mitigation and adaptation actions."" The report and open letter come as unprecedented extreme weather events and other climate impacts are taking a rising toll on people's lives and health. Increasingly frequent extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, storms and floods, kill thousands and disrupt millions of lives, while threatening healthcare systems and facilities when they are needed most. Changes in weather and climate are threatening food security and driving up food-, water- and vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, while climate impacts are also negatively affecting mental health. The WHO report states: ""The burning of fossil fuels is killing us. Climate change is the single biggest health threat facing humanity. While no one is safe from the health impacts of climate change, they are disproportionately felt by the most vulnerable and disadvantaged."" Meanwhile, air pollution, primarily the result of burning fossil fuels, which also drives climate change, causes 13 deaths per minute worldwide. The report concludes that protecting people's health requires transformational action in every sector, including on energy, transport, nature, food systems and finance. And it states clearly that the public health benefits from implementing ambitious climate actions far outweigh the costs. ""It has never been clearer that the climate crisis is one of the most urgent health emergencies we all face,"" said Dr Maria Neira, WHO Director of Environment, Climate Change and Health. ""Bringing down air pollution to WHO guideline levels, for example, would reduce the total number of global deaths from air pollution by 80 percent while dramatically reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that fuel climate change. A shift to more nutritious, plant-based diets in line with WHO recommendations, as another example, could reduce global emissions significantly, ensure more resilient food systems, and avoid up to 5.1 million diet-related deaths a year by 2050."" Achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement would save millions of lives every year due to improvements in air quality, diet, and physical activity, among other benefits. However, most climate decision-making processes currently do not account for these health co-benefits and their economic valuation. WHO's COP26 The recommendations are the result of extensive consultations with health professionals, organizations and stakeholders worldwide, and represent a broad consensus statement from the global health community on the priority actions governments need to take to tackle the climate crisis, restore biodiversity, and protect health. Climate and Health Recommendations The COP26 report includes ten recommendations that highlight the urgent need and numerous opportunities for governments to prioritize health and equity in the international climate regime and sustainable development agenda. Our health is not negotiable. Place health and social justice at the heart of the UN climate talks. Harness the health benefits of climate action. Prioritize those climate interventions with the largest health-, social- and economic gains. Build health resilience to climate risks. Build climate resilient and environmentally sustainable health systems and facilities, and support health adaptation and resilience across sectors. Create energy systems that protect and improve climate and health. Guide a just and inclusive transition to renewable energy to save lives from air pollution, particularly from coal combustion. End energy poverty in households and health care facilities. Reimagine urban environments, transport and mobility.

Speaking at a panel session titled 'Countdown to COP26 \- State of Play Ahead of a Critical Summit' at the one-day forum in Riyadh, Dr. Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and Special Envoy for Climate Change, said: ""The United Arab Emirates highly commends the leadership and the people of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, particularly the youth, for such a landmark, bold and long-term strategic initiative. It represents a paradigm shift in ambition for this region; it underlines the vital role this region can and should play in providing practical climate solutions; and it represents another example of how this region can help address global challenges."" ""As a region, we have always had to live with harsh climate conditions and we will have to continue to innovate in both mitigation and adaptation. I firmly believe that an inclusive, partnership-based approach that embraces the energy transition as an economic opportunity is the best way to achieve truly sustainable global progress. The UAE's Net Zero Strategic initiative is an open invitation for the world to partner with us in developing this new economic model for progress."" Dr. Al Jaber noted political climate action has slowed even as investment in renewables has risen and the world needs practical solutions that are commercial and scalable. He expressed optimism about COP26 (the UN Climate Conference, taking place in Glasgow from 1st-12th November, 2021) and provided insights on the UAE's offer to host COP28. ""After the highs of Paris, political climate action has slowed even as investment in renewables has risen and the world has experienced a series of climate-related weather events. So, it is evident that COP26 needs to start shifting the goals towards an action-oriented approach. The world needs practical solutions that are commercial and scalable and COP26 provides a timely platform to shift gears. I strongly believe it will be an important step in the right direction. ""It is through this approach that the world can truly take the opportunity of the energy transition which is to use the wave of investment in low-carbon solutions to drive economic prosperity for all. For that to happen, it is clear that developing countries must get the finance and technical support they need to rewire their energy systems and to put climate mitigation measures in place. ""We need a functioning Article Six to set up carbon markets which can help direct the flow of capital to low carbon solutions. We need greater ambition on emissions targets to close the gap between current NDCs and the Paris goals, and we need strategic roadmaps to make sure ambition becomes reality. Critically the world needs an umbrella approach with flexibility under which each country can have its own path to lower emissions,"" H.E. Dr. Al Jaber said, as he explained that these are some of the reasons the UAE is keen to host COP28. Speaking alongside H.R.H. Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman Al-Saud, Minister of Energy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), Marco Alver\'e0, CEO of Snam, and Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Dr. Al Jaber added that the UAE will be looking to work closely with the United Kingdom (UK), as hosts of COP26 , Egypt, as hosts of COP27 and the UNFCCC. ""Progress at COP26 Responding to a question on the UAE's Net Zero Strategic Initiative by 2050 from Fred Kempe, President and CEO of Atlantic Council and the moderator of the session, H.E. Dr. Al Jaber explained that the strategic initiative closely aligns with the development path the UAE is already embarking on in diversifying its economy. ""This initiative is really a holistic economic program inspired by our leadership's 50-year vision for our country's progress. We fundamentally believe that the pathway to net zero is a powerful vehicle for economic opportunity and we will use this opportunity to develop new industries, new skills, and new jobs."" ""In fact,"" Dr. Al Jaber added, ""it is already delivering results."" He emphasised that the business of tackling climate change is good business. ""As just one example, the UAE operates three of the largest and lowest-cost solar plants in the world. We are investing to increase the UAE's renewable energy capacity four-fold to about 9 gigawatts by the end of 2025. This investment is developing people and delivering jobs and opportunities."" On the energy transition, Dr. Al Jaber highlighted it will take time and require a diversified energy mix. ""Today, more than 80% of the global energy system is fossil fuels, and around 55% is oil and gas so it is clear that oil and gas will continue to play an important role in meeting the world's need for energy. Renewables are the fastest-growing sector of energy but they still meet only around 7% of global energy demand. Renewables will increase their market share, but that will take time."" Sharing his perspective on the current global energy supply crunch, Dr. Al Jaber noted it is a result of long-term under-investment in traditional fuels and said investment in carbon-efficient hydrocarbons must continue to avoid supply shocks during the energy transition. He pointed out that since 2014, oil and gas investment has been running 15-20% down, and last year it dropped by a third compared to 2019 even though demand is rising to almost 100 million barrels a day. ""This consistent under-investment makes the world vulnerable to supply shocks when the unexpected strikes, or when a number of events happen at the same time. So the world must reverse this trend of under-investment and it must make the investments it needs to ensure energy security and economic prosperity."" SGI aims to improve the quality of life and protect future generations in KSA. It brings together environmental protection, energy transformation, and sustainability programs to work towards three overarching targets \- reducing emissions, greening Saudi, and protecting land and sea \- to achieve a common goal of a green future. \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE87","Rally around BAADR app to make earth a better place","March 23, 2022 Wednesday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","Almost every day, we hear or read about the environment through TV, newspapers, social media or even in general conversation with the topic becoming an increasingly important focus for many countries around the world. The UAE is no different. Over the course of 50 years, the country has undergone significant transformation, establishing itself as a key global destination for business, trade and tourism. Environmental protection has been a key pillar in this journey thanks to the wise guidance of our leaders continuing the legacy of the UAE's late Founding Father - Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan. An influential figure, who was devoted to conserving our nature with a clear vision to shape the future of the country, Sheikh Zayed once said that 'the environment is an integral part of our country, our history and our heritage'. Today, thanks to his inspiring words we are surrounded in our cities by natural greenery. The local parks are regularly visited by hundreds of people every week - whether meeting with friends or taking part in a recreational activity - surrounded by plenty of trees and plants which can be seen from most of the major roads and highways of the city. At the Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi (EAD), we have been at the forefront of driving positive change in the UAE's capital, ensuring Sheikh Zayed's vision remains strong and exemplifies his values of conservation. For example, climate change is the biggest environmental impact we need to address via the creation and implementation of proactive policies and legislations but this is not the only one. Additional issues include pollution, waste disposal and loss of biodiversity, which are threatening our planet with every passing day. With these growing concerns, it is clear that the world will not be the same in the next 10 or 20 years unless action is taken now. This is why the EAD recently launched BAADR, a unique, simple and user-friendly smartphone application that incentivises users and places residents and citizens in the UAE at the forefront of driving positive change. By participating in eco-friendly tasks across seven key themes - Reuse, Switch, Grow, Initiate, Conserve, Join and Move - the app aims to improve our understanding of our impact on the environment and encourage users to think about their actions. More importantly, BAADR can help us behave in a more environmentally conscious manner by making minor changes to our everyday lives. It will enable people to realise how much water or energy they can save, be being more eco-friendly and feel proud of their actions. This can lead them to inspiring others to change their mindsets and make a positive impact - all of which will help create a better future for ourselves and our children. Both in the short and long-term, BAADR will not only benefit Abu Dhabi and the UAE but also the world. There are measures that are being implemented by various countries following last year's COP26 assembly in Glasgow. These include the agreement on finding ways to further cut emissions of carbon dioxide, and over 100 nations pledging to cut their methane emissions by at least 30 per cent by 2030 - all of which shows that we are going in the right direction. The responsibility lies within all of us to play a crucial role in providing a cleaner planet and, more importantly, we need to understand the impact our actions are having on the environment. BAADR can be a catalyst in solving the challenges that we currently face. It can be the answer in helping reduce the amount of solid waste in Abu Dhabi - 9.9 million tonnes in 2018 - or encouraging UAE residents away from single-use plastics, with a current average of 450 plastic water bottles consumed per capita every year in the emirate. We will not see major changes overnight. It will take time but as things stand, if we do not take action, then future generations will also be affected. Together, we have a duty to ensure Sheikh Zayed's legacy continues by making those small changes and integrating with BAADR to make our planet a better place that will improve the lives of fauna, flora, wildlife and human beings. With every passing day, we can make a difference and there is no better time than now to download the App and start using it.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE89","India And China To Be Most Exposed Due To Stranded Assets","April 5, 2022 Tuesday","Arabian Post","By Dr. Gyan Pathak India and China would be the most exposed countries in the world to shutting down of fossil-fuel infrastructures in the mitigation pathways to climate change, and if the existing units would continue to be operated as historically, they would entail CO2 emissions exceeding the carbon budget for 1.5 degree C, a new flagship UN report on climate change released on April 4 has warned. It insisted that global greenhouse gas emission would have to peak ""before 2025 at the latest, and be reduced by 43 per cent by 2030."" The option before the world is therefore limited, whether to shut them down or to continue with them. The report of the Working Group III (WGIII) contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change (IPCC) has indicated that harmful carbon emissions from 2010-2019 have never been higher in human history. It has been even cites by the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres as a proof and warning that the world is on a ""fast track"" to disaster, with scientists arguing that it's 'now or never' to limit global warming to 1.5 degree C. Unless governments everywhere reassess their energy policies, the world will be uninhabitable, he warned. IPCC has been insisting that all countries must reduce their fossil fuel use substantially, extend access to electricity, improve energy efficiency and increase the use of alternative fuels, such as hydrogen. Unless action is taken soon, some major cities of the world will be under water, heatwaves to reach unprecedented high level, terrifying storms will hit, there would be widespread water shortages, and millions of species of plants and animals would face extinction. And this horror story would not be a fiction but realty. It is indicated in the report, if the world continue with the current energy policies. We are on a pathway to global warning of more than double the 1.5 degree Celsius limit agreed in Paris in 2015. However, climate promises were broken, and a yawning gap exists between the implementation and the pledges. Now we need concrete action since there already exists a substantial and growing carbon lock-in today, as measured by committed emissions associated with existing long-lived infrastructure. If we are to mitigate the adverse effects of the climate change, the owner-operators of fossil-fuel infrastructure and societies many choose to retire many of them earlier than in the past, and committed emissions are thus contingent on the competitiveness of non-emitting alternative technologies and climate policy ambition. Therefore, in this mitigation pathways, some fossil-fuel infrastructure may become stranded assets, ie ""assets that have suffered from unanticipated or premature write-downs, devaluations or conversion to liabilities."" A systematic map of the literature on carbon lock-in has synthesized quantification of stranded-assets in the mitigation pathways which show first that the coal power plants are the most exposed to risk of becoming stranded. Secondly, if mitigation action is delayed, it would further increase stranded assets. And thirdly, sectoral distribution and amount of stranded assets much differ between countries. It should be kept in mind that there is high agreement that existing fossil fuel infrastructure would need to be retired earlier than historically, used less, or retrofitted with CCS, to stay within the remaining carbon budgets of limiting warming to 1.5 to 2 degree Celsius. Studies estimate that cumulative early retired power plant capacities by 2060 can be up to 600 GW for gas, and 1700 GW for coal. Only 42 per cent of the total capital stock of both operating and planned coal-fired power plants can be utilized to be compatible with the 2 degree C target. Moreover, Coal-fired power plants in scenarios consistent with keeping global warming below 2 degree C or 1.5 degree C will have to be retired one to three decades earlier than historically has been the case. After coal, electricity production based on gas is also projected to be phased out, with some capacity remaining as back-up. It has been estimated that USD 541 billion worth of stranded fossil fuel power plants could be created by 2060 with China and India the most exposed, the new flagship UN report says. It has also been suggest by some studies that stranded long-lived assets may be even more important outside the power sector. While stranded power sector assets by 2050 could reach up to USD 1.8 trillion in scenarios consistent with a 2 degree C target, there could be USD 5-11 trillion worth of stranded assets in the buildings sectors. Another study has estimated the potential value at risk for global real estate assets up to USD 21 trillion. More broadly, the set of economic activities that are potentially affected by a low carbon transition is wide and includes also energy-intensive industries, transport, and housing. The mitigation pathways following the current NDCs until 2030 do not show a significant reduction of coal, oil, and gas use compared to immediate action pathways. The report says, if action is not taken now, but delayed, there would be higher stranded assets and the societal, economic, and political strain of strengthening action. Carbon lock-in can have a long-lasting effect on future emissions trajectories after 2030. Immediate action is the only cost-effective pathway to mitigation of climate change. The risk of stranded assets has implications for workers depending from those assets, asset owners, assets portfolio managers, financial institutions and the stability of the financial system. Since India is likely to be two of the most exposed countries in this regard, the government obviously should plan its strategy now and look afresh on its commitment and prepone the actions that it has pledged during COP26 .

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE92","What the future holds for the region's automotive industry","March 29, 2022 Tuesday","ArabianBusiness.com","Coronavirus has brought forth a growing awareness regarding corporate sustainability and global businesses' role in climate preservation and as such the automotive industry is increasingly heading towards the electrification of vehicles. The pandemic has also highlighted the fragility of global supply chains as multinationals had to adapt their manufacturing needs to ever-shifting situations, said Thierry Sabbagh, managing director, Nissan Middle East. How do you evaluate the automotive sector in the UAE in 2021 and what are your expectations for 2022? Despite a slowdown in recent years, brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic and disruptions in global supply chains, 2021 saw the automotive industry adapt and move forward on several fronts. Our business strategy yielded a 9.9 percent increase in sales across the Gulf during the first nine months of FY21, when compared to the same period last year. This was demonstrated by a 17.7 percent increase in the UAE, a 36.2 percent increase in Bahrain, and a 37.7 percent increase in Kuwait from April to December 2021. Combined sedan sales increased by nearly 62 percent as compared to the same period last year. Through customer surveys, we've recorded a 17 percent increase in our Customer Happiness index across our digital platforms in FY21 compared to FY20. We continue to listen to our customers and cater our products and offerings to meet their evolving needs by working closely with our partners across the region which has led to a 40 percent increase in our leads to sales conversion within a single year. What are the main challenges facing the sector (especially chip shortages and supply chain problems) and how did Nissan address them? Businesses across a variety of industries have been navigating unprecedented challenges, especially in the past two years since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, which was augmented by supply chain disruptions and most recently a global shortage in semiconductors, all of which have had a cascading effect on the global automotive industry and the consumer technology industry amongst many others. With experts predicting the end of the semiconductor shortage as global production ramps up, the near future remains uncertain, and with that, we at Nissan continue to adapt to unexpected changes, while keeping customers our top priority in doing so. Over the past two years, we have adjusted production schedules within our manufacturing operations, and continue to work closely with our global teams and local partners to minimize the disruption of vehicle deliveries to our dealers and customers. Guided by the Nissan NEXT global transformation plan, we have also managed to maintain profitability and business continuity despite the challenges. How would you describe your transition to the production of electric cars? As the need for greater connectivity and technology in automobiles increases, we are dedicated to building cleaner and greener vehicles that are more connected than ever before. As we place electrification and autonomous driving at the center of our long-term strategy, we harness innovations being made on a global scale and are proud to see this taking shape in the form of the Nissan Ariya, the brand's first all-electric crossover that was showcased for the first time in the region at Expo 2020 Dubai. Serving as a symbol of what is to come, the Ariya is the epitome of Nissan Intelligent Mobility and demonstrates the brand's direction and vision for the future of mobility. As part of our Ambition 2030 plans, we plan to invest over 2 trillion yen ($17.6 billion) over the next five years and aim to launch 23 new electrified models, including 15 new EVs in key global markets by 2030. A few of our latest concepts include Nissan Chill-Out, a next-generation crossover EV that utilises the CMF-EV platform for high levels of comfort and driving excitement, as well the Nissan-Hangout, a utility vehicle that changes the perception of mobile space, all with the goal to democratize technology and accelerate the road to electrification through mass adoption. How important is the UAE market to Nissan, and how would you describe your performance in it? The UAE and the wider Middle East remains a key region of opportunity for Nissan, and our presence in the UAE dates back over fifty years. In 1994, Nissan was also the first Japanese carmaker to establish its regional headquarters in the UAE. Thanks to the deep-rooted heritage of Nissan in the region, and despite the challenges brought about by Covid-19, the last two years have seen us introduce new products to the market, increase sales, and elevate innovation in the products and services we offer customers across the region. The UAE's ambition continues to be met with its relentless dedication to future-readiness, demonstrated through its Net Zero 2050 Strategic Initiative announced ahead of the UN's COP26 summit last year. This comes in parallel with Nissan's 2050 carbon neutrality goals, becoming the first Japanese automaker to join the UN-backed Race to Zero campaign, with commitments to move beyond vehicle emissions to actively implementing innovative sustainability process along the entire supply chain, to reduce carbon footprint on a larger scale.

The document sets out pathways and concrete actions that state and non-state actors can take to repurpose public support for agriculture. It was developed by the COP26 Presidency, the World Bank, and Just Rural Transition \- an initiative that brings together a global community of public and private sector stakeholders to champion equitable solutions to food systems challenges. Almheiri said, ""Individual efforts by countries are not enough to reach our common goal. Recognising that effective global partnerships play a key role in eradicating world hunger, the UAE endorses the Policy Action Agenda for Transition to Sustainable Food & Agriculture. We are confident the Agenda will drive a much-needed inclusive shift to sustainable agriculture through appropriate policies, investments, and support."" As a prime example of a multilateral effort that drives transformative climate action in the agricultural sector, the Minister highlighted the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for Climate), a joint UAE-US initiative that seeks to increase and accelerate investments in climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation and R&D over the next five years. The Policy Agenda recognises the importance of agriculture in producing food, providing livelihoods for billions of people across the world, and contributing to the economy. At the same time, agriculture is the second main driver of greenhouse gas emissions after energy and the major cause of biodiversity loss, which, in turn, undermines food systems, and poses risks for farmers, communities, and economies. The document provides a comprehensive definition of sustainable agriculture, recommends steps to take, outlines illustrative policy options to assist decision-makers, proposes channels for ongoing policy dialogue, collaboration, and peer support building on existing commitments and initiatives, and states the case for repurposing public policies. \"

""The country is no stranger to aiming high and achieving those aims,"" the paper said, noting that this target of net zero requires the continuation of a drive in the country that already exists in the country: prioritising sustainability and pushing an ecological mindset to remain at the core of development and decision-making. The daily continued, ""One of its main strategies is to reach net zero by 2050, a goal that has been commended by several world leaders, is by investing AED600 billion in clean and renewable energy sources over the next three decades. ""This, as John Kerry, the US special climate envoy, says, is an example that has been set for other energy-producing nations. Kerry said he saluted the UAE's ambitious climate commitment, just as UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he welcomed the move and encouraged 'other Gulf states to follow this example ahead of Cop26 '."" Cop26 , in Glasgow, the discussions will be heavily focused on similar plans by nations and the progress that the participating countries are required to have made; agendas they have set for themselves that align with the global climate programme. For the sake of international accountability \- but in the larger scheme of things, also for the sake of the planet, our future and that of the children of tomorrow \- all countries need to set their sights on clear goals. They need to share with other nations their agendas and progress made over the period of time specified in their country's plans, which in Cop26 terms, are also called their Nationally Determined Contribution. No global stakeholders can be exempt from contributing to the world's climate ambitions, namely, the steps outlined in 2015 at the Paris deal that was signed by 195 countries, including the UAE. At that time, all signatories agreed to do their bit to limit the global average temperature increase to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels. The editorial added, ""To be sure, meeting climate goals requires governments to work together and adopt a concerted approach to tackle rising global temperatures and resulting consequences that can include floods and wildfires, as we have seen in recent years."" ""So what needs to be achieved next month at Cop26 ? Agreeing to global net zero carbon by 2050 and the 1.5 degrees temperature aim made within reach; agreeing that communities and natural habitats have to be protected; securing private and public sector financing to deliver on projects; and the understanding that teamwork will be crucial.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE95","Sustainability - COMMENT Food for thought","March 31, 2022","Gulf Business","Ian Harfield, managing director Engie Solutions - GCC Growing consumer awareness and increased government ini- tiatives around sustainability and climate change are adding pressure on industries to adopt sustain- able practices. This is particularly true of the food and beverages (F&B) sector where food pro- duction is responsible for one-quarter of the world's greenhouse gas emis- sions. Left unchecked, this figure will only rise due to the combined impact of a rising population and growth of the middle class - wealthier people consume more resource-intensive, animal-based foods. According to the World Economic Forum, by 2050, the demand for food will be 60 per cent greater than it is today. There is, therefore, an urgent need for the F&B industry to address its carbon footprint. According to research, only 15 per cent of F&B firms are on track to meet their sustainability goals. To address the challenges climate change poses for food systems, various initiatives have been implemented in the region in line with global sustainability goals. The UAE was the first in the region to announce a net-zero pledge ahead of the upcoming UN Climate Change Conference 2021 ( COP26 ). The UAE also partnered with the US to launch the Agriculture Innovation Mission AIM for Climate, a global initiative aimed at accelerating investments in R&D for climate-smart agri-tech. From a regional perspective, other GCC countries have also joined the sus- tainability race. For example, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain have pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2060. Mean- while, Kuwait pledged to achieve a sustainable living environment under its Vision 2030, while Qatar has targeted to cut 25 per cent of local greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Due to the urgency of the situation, the region is actively adopting sustainable and climate smart agricultural methods and promoting sustainable production and consumption habits. Research shows 49 per cent of global consumers consider sustainability attributes when purchas- ing food and beverages. So, how can the food industry evolve its sustainable business models? An excellent place to start is data analysis. Using the data generated by food production companies, data ana- lytic tools can be used to define and track against the metrics that align with an organisation's goals and initiatives. Having access to such information allows for optimisation of resource productivity. Organisations will be able to improve budget certainty, evaluate supply-side adjustments, identify demand-side actions, and monitor project performance to track and report progress towards their goals. Secondly, sustainability is a collabora- tive effort and engaging partners up and down the supply chain is vital. Apart from optimising its production pro- cesses, the F&B industry should look to decarbonise end-to-end operations by transitioning to green power options. Securing renewable power sources such as solar thermal solutions and on-site generation among others, will reduce carbon emissions. Research shows com- panies sourcing renewable electricity outperform their rivals financially, with the difference ranging from 0.3 to more than 7 percentage points. Additionally, shifting fleets to low- carbon transportation, changing to low-carbon cold chain technology, opti- mising transit routes and retrofitting improves energy and water consump- tion. Further, by integrating energy efficiency into plants, warehouses and processing centres, manufacturers can cost-effectively lengthen plant lifecycles while meeting decarbonisation goals. Outsourcing Meeting sustainability goals can overwhelm even well-resourced F&B giants, who would rather focus on their core business. Outsourcing energy management services to specialised firms enables food manufacturers to strengthen their economic performance by leaning on third-party providers for reliable energy supply, management of multi- technical projects and strict control of operating costs. Most importantly, energy manage- ment firms can deploy specialised analytical tools to identify areas for improvement, analyse energy consump- tion trends, advise on purchasing energy, electricity and gas, and optimise energy performance. An example of such outsourced services includes tai- lor-made high-tech financed solutions for carbon footprint reduction. Here, customers only pay for the energy they use while the energy services company undertakes the capital expenditures investment. All risks related to engi- neering, procurement and construction and energy performance are transferred to the energy services provider. Another sustainable model is on-site energy power generation, particularly solar, which eliminates the need to transport power across great distances, significantly reducing costs and energy losses. These services are delivered in conjunction with traditional offerings, including the optimised production and distribution of hot/cold/iced water, compressed air, compressors for steam, industrial gas, etc., process utilities such as refrigeration, process environment (e.g., HVAC), heat recovery installations and more. Technology Technology is a crucial driver of sustain- ability, with many digital opportunities to improve process performance and decrease costs. This has led to greater demand for the availability and effi- cient use of data, marked by an increase in apps. With increased scrutiny of food sources, traceability is today a significant trend in the food industry. Traceability is the ability to follow the movement of a food product and its ingredients through all steps in the supply chain, both backwards and forward. Blockchain has emerged as a powerful and efficient technology allowing consumers to trace their food from 'farm to fork' with a QR code scan. Demands for reducing food waste has led to apps such as TooGoodToGo, Phenix and Karma, which connect consumers with surplus food from local restaurants, bakeries and grocery stores that sell products at a fraction of the list price. The discussion around climate change is becoming more intense, increasing demands to reduce energy and water consumption and mitigate carbon emis- sions. Even the most prominent players in the food industry would struggle to maintain a coherent decarbonisation strategy while delivering their core busi- ness objectives. ""WITH INCREASED SCRUTINY OF FOOD SOURCES, TRACEABILITY IS TODAY A SIGNIFICANT TREND IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY. TRACEABILITY IS THE ABILITY TO FOLLOW THE MOVEMENT OF A FOOD PRODUCT AND ITS INGREDIENTS THROUGH ALL STEPS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN, BOTH BACKWARDS AND FORWARD"" 60% GREATER THAN IT IS TODAY PERCENTAGE OF DEMAND FOR FOOD BY 2050 CCORDING TO THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE96","Climate Change: The alternative is unimaginable","February 2, 2022","The Big Project Middle East","The COP26 summit was an opportunity for the parties to commit to the goals of the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Since the 2015 Paris Agreement, many countries have made commitments on climate action and many have committed to reach Net Zero emissions by 2050. Most of the global community have agreed to work together to limit global warming to well below two degrees, and to adapt to the impacts of a changing climate and to make finance available to assist with the transition from fossil fuels to alternative energy sources. The International Energy Agency predicted that carbon emissions would reduce by just 40% by the middle of the century based on current progress. Significant investment is required to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy. Scaling up investments to finance the transition from fossil fuels to renewables, as well as smart power networks, energy efficiency measures, and electrification in sectors including transportation, buildings, and industry, will be required to transform the world's energy systems. According to the International Energy Agency, worldwide energy investments are currently over $2tn per year, or 2.5% of global GDP (IEA). To achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050, this must climb to $5tn, or 4.5% of GDP, by 2030 and remain there until at least 2050. The bulk of this money will go towards decarbonising electricity generation and infrastructure and to make power networks better suited to much higher volumes and variability of renewable energy. Without a global climate policy and a joint commitment by all, today's minor emitters will develop into significant emitters as their populations and incomes rise. These are also the countries that are typically most hit by the effects of climate change, making transition costs more difficult to bear due to rapidly rising energy demands and limited financial flexibility to finance green projects. Green or climate finance to fund emissions reduction investments in developing countries would allow the burden to be more evenly shared and help the global economy achieve net zero emissions. China, the EU, Japan, Korea, and the United States have all pledged to achieve net zero emissions by the middle of the century, yet the current energy crises in some of these regions suggest that the transition from fossil fuels will not happen in time. Investment in renewable energy projects is essential if the Paris Agreement commitments are to be achieved. As the world starts to recover from the pandemic, it must now tackle climate change and make the commitment to change for everyone's future. The alternative cost is unimaginable.

On its Twitter account, the Free Nazanin campaign wrote, ""Nazanin's lawyer was called today by the Judiciary and informed that the appeal on her second case failed,"" adding that there had been ""no court hearing."" The ""sentence of 1+1 years was upheld by Judge Babai, Court 54. No summons date yet for prison,"" the tweet added. At the end of April, Zaghari-Ratcliffe received a second jail sentence on charges of spreading propaganda against the regime. Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her employer, the Thomson Reuters Foundation, have repeatedly denied the charges brought against her. After the latest decision, she requested a conversation with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to ask him to help secure her release during his meeting with the Iranian delegation traveling to Glasgow for COP26 . ""Nazanin has asked to speak with the PM, who invited the Iranian President to Glasgow next month for # COP26 ,"" the campaign tweeted on Saturday. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who was given British diplomatic protection in 2019 and has been designated a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International, has gone on three hunger strikes during her detention. In February, her family said she believed she had contracted COVID-19 in Evin Prison outside Tehran. In 2019, her supporters said she was transferred to the mental ward of a hospital in Tehran and was denied visits from her father. \"

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE101","Cut activism at climate summits, we want results","November 27, 2021 Saturday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","There were no winners at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow on Saturday. The world has a long way to go before climate targets are met and celebrations can begin. Ten years; 20; 30? Countdown to catastrophe? We will know soon. World leaders won't wager a bet yet. They may be in agreement to cool the planet and ensuring temperatures do not rise above 1.5\'baC in the medium term. How do we get there is the question. Some deal, any deal was the objective as discussions went cold after assembled protesters and activists had dispersed or made statements from the virtual havens. Climate regulars from Gen Z and Y like Greta Thunberg blamed politicians and governments for failing future generations and the planet. We've heard that before. Let's move on. The venue may have been different but the script remained the same. Former US president Barack Obama also made an appearance but offered little by way of solutions. A watered-down agreement was finally reached on Saturday evening which fell way short of what needs to be done to reverse the effects of climate change while saving lives and the planet. All this was happening as floods continued to wreak havoc in India as the monsoons extend into the winter months. Forecasters are unable to predict the trajectory of the rains this year and the result is disaster for global cities like Chennai in south India. It is normal to cast the blame on climate change, though unchecked human development on water bodies and farmland is the primary reason for our cities being flooded. The truth is: we are unprepared for these changes in weather. The air and our oceans are getting warmer. Our landmass is parched or flooded. We are swinging between extreme weather which makes our world inhabitable. So what did the just concluded COP26 climate summit really achieve, high-profile billing notwithstanding? It succeeded in renewing commitments on reducing emissions but was largely ineffective in enforcing its writ on governments. Such groupings, in fact, lack executive teeth. The question, therefore, arises: why should sovereign governments listen and be bound by these deliberations or agreements. Even the UN hasn't been able to enforce any agreement, forget prevent war. Climate justice for the poor is what the moral goal should be while battling social inequality. In principle, countries agree that climate change is real. Combatting it together demands political will. To reach any agreement, the developed world must provide incentives and funds to developing countries to swiftly make the shift to green technology. Funds must be earmarked for this purpose and spelt out before any deal can be reached. Until that happens, climate summits will serve no real purpose even as activists and lobbyists have a field day. \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE102","UAE: Remarkable success for 1st MENA Climate Week 2022","March 31, 2022 Thursday 6:30 AM EST","UAE Government News","March 31 -- Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, Government of UAE issued the following news release: The Middle East and North Africa Climate Week (MENACW) 2022 achieved remarkable success and widespread praise from prominent institutions and figures concerned with climate action around the world. The Week's activities attracted over 15,000 participants from 40 countries around the world who attended in person and virtually. It also attracted 500 global speakers and experts, including ministers and officials from the government and private sectors, and climate champions, in addition to officials from UN climate organisations. Over four days, the MENA Climate Week featured over 200 panel discussions, workshops and ministerial roundtable sessions. The event was hosted by the UAE Government, represented by the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE), the World Green Economy Organization (WGEO), and Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA), in collaboration with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and the World Bank Group. It was supported by regional partners, including the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the League of Arab States Secretariat, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for West Asia (ESCWA), and the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB). Successful Closing The closing ceremony was held at Atlantis The Palm, Dubai. HE Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, Minister of Climate Change and Environment; HE Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Chairman of the World Green Economy Organization, and MD&CEO of DEWA; and James Grabert, Global Head of the UNFCCC Regional Collaboration Centres, gave speeches at the closing ceremony, which was attended by a large number of officials and climate action pioneers. Upscale Climate Action HE Mariam Almheiri, Minister of Climate Change and Environment, said, ""The urgent need to upscale climate action in the region was the focus of MENA Climate Week. We have reaffirmed our continued commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, especially SDG13: Climate Action, and aligned our efforts to achieve our common climate goals. We have agreed that climate action goes beyond a simple energy transition. We must take a holistic, cross-sectoral, economy-wide approach with multi-stakeholder engagement to the transition of societies and economies to a more sustainable future."" HE Almheiri added, ""With the next two COPs taking place in the Middle East and North Africa, the eyes of the world will be on our region. We are dedicated to keeping up the momentum until COP27 and beyond, and working closely with Egypt to deliver a successful event."" A major milestone in climate action In his speech at the closing ceremony, HE Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Chairman of the World Green Economy Organization, and MD&CEO of DEWA, commended partners and organisers of the MENA Climate Week for their valuable contribution to its success. Over four days, the event served as a major milestone in global climate action, and particularly in the region, which has seen a significant increase in climate initiatives. It is also getting ready to host COP27 and COP28. ""The timely MENA Climate Week served as the first event focusing on the international climate agenda for 2022. It built on the momentum of the Paris Agreement and the COP26 last year in Glasgow, UK. It is a driving force for regional and international stakeholders to collaborate to implement recommendations and the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2030. The MENA Climate Week took place at the beginning of a critical decade in terms of climate protection and combating global warming. The event has galvanised regional support and collaboration among regional government entities, private organisations and civil society to pave the way for hosting COP27 in Egypt this year and COP28 in the UAE next year,"" said HE Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Chairman of the World Green Economy Organization, and MD&CEO of DEWA. ""Holding the event in Dubai has enabled us to share our ambitious national vision and success in supporting global efforts in climate change mitigation. Dubai has implemented strategic projects that resulted in its increased use of clean and renewable energy resources and reduced carbon emissions by 22% in 2019 and 33% in 2020, which were above the set targets. The MENA Climate Week has emphasised the need for stronger regional and international collaboration to address climate change, promote sustainability, and build a better future for humanity. As we conclude this event, I express my gratitude to all participants, partners, sponsors, and supporters of the MENA Climate Week 2022 and a special thanks to UNFCCC and its team. The success of this event further increases our confidence and perseverance to help boost global climate action as well as strengthen cooperation to achieve climate goals, which are key priorities for all world countries and an urgent need as we continue to experience the growing impact of climate change,"" added Al Tayer. Key recommendations Key recommendations of the MENA Climate Week included calling on all stakeholders to continue providing a constant, multi-sectorial and multi-layered assistance towards achieving carbon-neutral targets, which can contribute to creating sustainable economies, increased employment, social security and prosperity. While recognising the urgent need for climate finance to be made available for mitigation but also for adaptation purpose, there is an urgency for national governments to establish policies and regulatory frameworks to de-risk private sector investments, to mobilise finances and to guide investors. When setting the new collective quantified goal on climate finance, the international community should consider climate finance in a manner that addresses the needs and priorities of developing countries, and also the quality of finance to ensure climate finance is accessible. Planning and development of long-term low emission development strategies which currently involve the Ministries of Environment and/or Climate Change should be extended to Ministries of Economy, Finance, Energy and others to truly unlock the potential of this process and consider the establishment of macro-economic roadmaps of just transition and accompanying policy options, involving all relevant Ministries and breaking down of silos. Three Tracks The Week's activities focused on three tracks; the first was 'Raising Ambition: National actions and economy-wide approaches.' The second was 'Tradition meets Modernity: Integrated Approach for Climate Resilience.' The third track was 'Accelerating Implementation in this Critical Decade.'

""It will not only help reduce emissions from the oil and gas industry in the region but will also create new carbon sinks and help restore and protect vast swaths of land through afforestation"", she said. ""It is now clear that the global economy is irreversibly heading towards the deep decarbonisation of all sectors, from energy, to manufacturing, transport, and food systems"". 'HISTORIC JUNCTURE' ""We need to urgently peak, reduce, and stabilise global greenhouse gas emissions to Net Zero by 2050"" by cutting global emissions by 2030 by 45 per cent, compared to 2010 levels, she said. ""Your leadership is needed more than ever at this historic juncture"". A REGION EXPOSED Entire communities the world over, are already being hurt by climate impacts, with the Middle East and North Africa particularly vulnerable. Exposed to a range of systemic risks, such as desertification, food insecurity, forced displacement and extreme heat waves, without action the region will face 200 days of extreme heat, and temperatures of 50&deg;C, every year by the end of the century, according to Mohammed. ""But the region also has incredible assets to leverage, which could make it a frontrunner for a post-carbon, resilient, and inclusive economy,"" she added. CHOOSE NOT TO FAIL Everyone must act quickly for a fair net-zero transition in all regions, especially those dependent on oil and gas revenues, Mohammed said, spelling out: ""In our fight against climate change, failure is a choice, not a certainty"". While transitioning away from fossil fuels will be ""a challenge of epic proportions"", requiring targeted support to those temporarily impacted, she upheld that those investments ""could yield innumerable benefits in the long term"". ""Solidarity and fairness are core principles that underpin the multilateral regime"" she said. ""That is why I am pleased to see that the Middle East Green Initiative is a regional and cooperative approach to climate action"". COP26 'A TURNING POINT' During COP26 , the deputy UN chief urged the leaders to be prepared to make it not only a success, but a real turning point towards ""a green, resilient, and just transition"". Against that backdrop, she suggested that all countries update their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) for increasingly ambitious climate actions that ""bring us closer to our collective emission reduction goal"" globally. ""G20 countries, who are responsible for up to 80 per cent of global emissions must lead by example"", said the UN official, asking donors to allocate at least half of their climate finance to adaptation. ""As shareholders of multilateral, regional and national development banks and funds, you can instruct your representatives at the Boards of these institutions to work toward allocating 50 per cent of climate finance to adaptation"", she said. CREDIBILITY 'WILL BE KEY' Pointing out that the Paris Agreement on climate change requires that all public and private finance investment flows be aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), she urged that private finance reach constituencies that are ""not always on their radar"", such as least developed countries, small-developing islands and in general vulnerable communities. ""And private finance institutions&hellip;need to pass the credibility test...[including] robust taxonomies and standards; mandatory climate risk disclosure; and more transparency across the board to ensure that all financial flows contribute to keeping the 1.5C degree goal within reach"", she said. ""Credibility will be key"". And top executives in the private sector, should understand that developing countries should not be saddled with unsustainable levels of debt, forced to make ""impossible trade-offs to the detriment of their people and our planet"".  \"

Addressing a panel discussion by Atlantic Council at the 26th Conference of Parties ( COP26 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Dr. Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and UAE Special Envoy for Climate Change, said an umbrella approach that brings together all the elements is needed for success in reducing the impact of climate change. ""We have adopted an inclusive approach to growth and progress, which contributed to many significant achievements over the past 50 years. We will continue to follow this approach in line with the principles of the Fifty-Year Charter, which prioritises sustainable economic and social growth. Sustainable investments must first be sustainable financially."" Dr. Al Jaber was speaking alongside the United States Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry, Ambassador Raychelle Omamo, Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary, Kenya, and Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Addressing the audience, John Kerry said, ""First of all, let me thank the UAE and Dr Sultan Al Jaber; he has just been a spectacular envoy and partner with us over these past months. The UAE hosted the very first Middle East climate dialogue, which involved four or five oil and gas producers, all of whom came on board for Net Zero, all of whom have been really committed to COP and the process of responsible activity in all sectors and I thank them for that, and I wish them happy UAE Flag Day."" Commenting on the launch of the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate, Bill Gates added, ""Thanks to leadership of UAE and United States for kicking this off we have about 30 countries now signed up for the initiative where you make a commitment to raise your research and development for better agriculture, both seeds and livestock, digital mapping to help the farmers and digital advice."" Commenting on the need for inclusive approach to climate action, Raychelle Omamo said, ""COP 26 must remember the African woman, because the African woman is the way forward on our continent she's the farmer, she's the person that deals with our SMEs, she drives our economies. So whatever applications that we use or innovations that we begin to develop, we must develop them with the view of building inclusive society, societies that are prosperous for everyone."" The need for an inclusive approach Addressing the panel, Dr. Al Jaber reiterated that the UAE's inclusive approach was important to take ""innovation to scale, from capital to R&D, technology development and project delivery. Inclusivity means all sectors \- governmental, private, academic and civil society \- working together. This must include countries with major hydrocarbon resources. They have huge energy experience and an essential role to play. The world needs to be open, not closed; it needs answers, not justifications."" Dr. Al Jaber said the UAE moved early into renewables. ""We began our investments in renewable energy 15 years ago. We focused on science and innovation, providing the space and the capital to turn ideas into world-class projects. Today, we have renewable investments worth US$70 billion across 70 countries. We will grow our renewables position and we already have plans to increase the renewable energy capacity fourfold to about 9 gigawatts by the end of 2025."" Highest ambitions for COP28 Commenting on the UAE's offer to host COP28 in 2023, which was endorsed by the Asia Pacific Group of nations, Dr. Al Jaber said the UAE had set its ambitions high, adding the nation would approach dialogue and discussions with the same progressive drive - focusing on achievement and progress - that enabled the UAE to mark significant achievements over its 50-year history. ""We would push towards practical solutions that the world needs real solutions that are both commercial and scalable. We would also bring fresh perspectives because we understand that progress and development remain essential in parallel with global efforts to reduce the effects of climate change."" ""We seek to make COP28 both flexible, compatible with the requirements of both developed and developing countries and inclusive, recognising there are various paths towards net-zero emissions. It is about getting to the destination on time not about the route to get there,"" he added. On this year's UN Climate Conference, Dr. Al Jaber said there is ""good progress and a great sense of hope. I would like to see COP26 propose practical plans and solutions and avoid a one-size-fits-all approach. Certainly, developing nations require a completely different set of policies and incentives. Climate action should not become an economic burden on developing nations. Our focus must be on holding back emissions, not slowing growth and progress. ""It would be fruitful for developed nations to meet the US$100 billion pledge on climate finance. The successful delivery of Article Six to set up functioning global carbon markets would be another strong indicator of the success of COP26 . If COP26 can achieve all of this, then it will have been a big success. A successful COP26 will also create momentum for COP27, COP28 and beyond."" If UAE is affirmed as the COP28 host in 2023, Dr. Al Jaber said he would work closely with the UK, Egypt and the UNFCCC to push for practical solutions that are both commercial and scalable. ""The UAE has deep practical experience in energy, climate action and renewables, and we have a strong track record of mobilising support to address common challenges,"" he added. ""The COP process is critical to the world, and each COP must build on those that have come before. COP28 is also the year of the global stocktake and this presents its own opportunity to assess where the world is and to further accelerate climate action."" UAE focuses on collaboration and partnership Dr. Al Jaber said collaboration and partnership underline the UAE's recent climate initiatives. For instance, the new Energy Transition Accelerator Financing (ETAF) Platform, a US$1billion US-funded facility, launched in conjunction with the Abu Dhabi-based International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), is designed to finance 1.5 GW of new renewable energy power projects in developing countries by 2030. The Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for Climate) is a major joint initiative by the UAE and US with the support of more than 30 other countries. The goal is to accelerate innovation in climate-smart agriculture and food systems over the next five years. ""Investing in innovation and advanced technological solutions in agriculture such as heat resistant crops, vertical farming and digital agriculture, will help enhance resilience in parts of the world that are most vulnerable to climate change,"" said Dr. Al Jaber. As an early mover in renewables, the UAE has the world's largest solar park and a burgeoning peaceful nuclear power sector. The Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant is set to provide up to a quarter of the nation's electricity needs when it becomes fully operational, avoiding up to 21 million tonnes of carbon emissions annually. \"

The agreement envisages the development of solar photovoltaic (PV) facilities with a capacity of as much as 1.2 gigawatts (GW), and potential associated storage. Singapore is looking to import as much as 4 GW of low-carbon electricity by 2035, which would constitute 35 percent of its total supply. ""The UAE is eager to collaborate with countries in Asia to help them on their energy transition and to meet climate objectives,"" said Gulf Today in an editorial on Wednesday. ""Masdar is known for its overarching clean energy focus, and has been leaving its stellar stamp wherever it goes,"" noted the editorial comment. Founded by Mubadala, Masdar today is an investor in renewable energy and sustainability projects with a total value of almost US$20 billion, and a combined capacity approaching 13 gigawatts. It is one of the fastest-growing renewables companies in the world, active in more than 30 countries across the globe. Many of the solutions that Masdar has championed have been 'world-firsts' \- such as the Hywind project established off the coast of Scotland, the first floating offshore wind farm. Masdar is also involved in some of the biggest renewable energy projects, including the 2 GW Al Dhafra solar plant, set to be the largest single-site solar facility in the world. Masdar City is home to more than 900 companies from six continents. Over the past decade, Masdar City has piloted technology in areas such as mobility, transportation, construction, renewable energy and sustainable living. The ongoing Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week bears testimony to its green energy commitment. It is the first global gathering of its kind after COP26 . Masdar is also highlighting the role of the energetic youth, a key pillar in the nation's growth, in its clean energy drive. The 2022 Youth 4 Sustainability (Y4S) forum is a series of youth-led discussions taking place till January 19th as part of ADSW 2022.

Over the past week, more than 30,000 international delegates, decision-makers, environmentalists and sustainability experts have gathered at the annual Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week conferences and events. In an editorial on Sunday, Gulf News said, ""The event, which runs until Tuesday, is the first significant gathering of climate change experts, key personnel and researchers to gather in an international forum since the COP26 climate conference convened in Glasgow in November."" This Sustainability Week event has also been given fresh impetus, with the UAE set to host COP28 in less than two years. ""For that reason alone, the gatherings in Abu Dhabi now are vital in laying the groundwork and shaping the thinking of decision-makers globally on how best to slow down and reverse the heating of our planet,"" the paper said. It is also one of the largest global gatherings of stakeholders and researchers, administrators and decision-makers dedicated to making sure new development initiatives are sustainable, positive both environmentally and economically and with renewable energies and Earth-friendly policies fuelling growth. The editorial continued, ""Abu Dhabi, with its hosting of IRENA the example set by Masdar City and its unique approach to cleaner and greener living, fostering research and innovation as well as bringing the UAE's first nuclear facility on stream all show its commitment to renewable energy, making this planet more environmentally friendly as well as being at the forefront of action against climate change. Among topics up for discussion are the economics of renewable energy, how water shortages will impact progress and development, how the environment can be protected and enhanced as cities and communities push for expansion and compete for fewer resources while making the most of renewable energy opportunities, and highlighting new technologies and advances that will allow us to do more using less energy."" ""The challenges facing the world are huge. We need to turn back the worst effects of climate change and repair at least some of the damage caused to our environment and natural work by a rapidly heating planet and carbon emissions,"" it added. The Dubai-based daily concluded by saying, ""The challenges, as IRENA pointed out earlier this week, are immense, with the need to convert half of the fuel and energy we use to renewable sources. The reality is that unless we work towards making a real difference, the key issues discussed at Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week will continue to challenge the world."" \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE110","Opec+ supply gap may push oil higher, IEA warns","February 13, 2022 Sunday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","A failure by Opec and its allies to meet their output targets will result in persistent price rally, the International Energy Agency warned as it raised its forecast for world oil demand in 2022. &ldquo;Chronic under-performance by Opec+ in meeting its output targets and rising geopolitical tensions have propelled oil prices higher,&rdquo; the IEA said in its monthly oil market report. If the persistent gap between Opec+ output and its target levels continues, supply tensions will rise, increasing the likelihood of more volatility and upward pressure on prices. Still, the economic shock could be averted if those members of Opec + that possess extra reserves deploy them, the Paris-based agency said. The UAE and Saudi Arabia are the two oil producers with the most spare production capacity. On the other hand, Opec maintained its outlook for oil demand in 2022 but said there is an &ldquo;upside potential to the forecast&rdquo; as global economies continue to recover strongly from the coronavirus pandemic-induced headwinds. The group maintained its oil demand forecast for this year at 4.2 million barrels per day, unchanged from the previous month's forecast. The IEA said those risks of oil supply tensions and more volatility, which will have broad economic implications, could be reduced if producers in the Middle East with spare capacity were to compensate for those running out. Saudi Arabia holds the bulk of the group's spare capacity. It has so far resisted the idea of tapping those reserves more quickly, contending that the individual quotas set by the Opec+ agreement should be respected. Oil market experts said major oil producers appear to be in no hurry to increase supply. &ldquo;What is perhaps more important is governments are increasingly walking back their commitments to an energy transition agreed to at COP26 . This is one more example of incompatible trends. The world cannot both use more oil and gas, and produce less.&rdquo; The price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) opened 2022 at about $75 a barrel (bbl). A week ago, the price rose above $90/bbl for the first time since 2014. That was also the last year the price of WTI was above $100/bbl. Analysts pointed out that in the first half of 2014, oil prices bounced between $100/bbl and $105/bbl. But the shale boom had put millions of new barrels of oil into the markets over the course of several years, and by mid-2014 the market was approaching an oversupply situation. The price of oil started to decline, but then in the second half of the year Opec embarked upon a price war to win back market share that had been lost to the American shale boom. &ldquo;The result was that the bottom fell out of the oil market. By the end of 2014, the price had declined to $53/bbl. The price remained depressed for all of 2015, and by early 2016 WTI fell below $30/bbl,&rdquo; Robert Rapier wrote in Oilprice.com. &ldquo;The question now is whether the current situation is more like the first half of 2014, or whether it is more like 2011, when prices rose above $100/bbl and largely stayed there for the next three years. I would argue that we are somewhere in between,&rdquo; said Rapier. &mdash; HYPERLINK mailto:issacjohn@khaleejtimes.com issacjohn@khaleejtimes.com \"

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE112","UAE Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative, an integrated approach to sustainable development: Mariam Almheiri","October 25, 2021 Monday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","DUBAI, 25th October, 2021 (WAM) -- With only a few days left until the 26th UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ), 197 world leaders, along with tens of thousands of negotiators, government representatives, businesses, and citizens, are gearing up to participate in the 13 days of talks that will accelerate climate action and give the world a chance to limit the rise in global temperature to 1.5 C. Marking the beginning of a 'decade of action', COP26 will be shaped by major political dynamics and developments, with China's pledge to become carbon-neutral before 2060 at the forefront. This bold commitment from the world's biggest emitter has been labelled as a game changer by observers and will inject fresh momentum for action. In addition, the US's return to the Paris Agreement under President Joe Biden's administration will be key to shifting the world's largest economy onto a net-zero footing for 2050. Regionally, the UAE has been leading climate efforts and setting a benchmark for climate ambitions. The launch of the UAE Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative in early October 2021 was the outcome of extensive and ongoing work of the nation's institutions, and represents an opportunity to advance the country's economic diversification to develop new industries, technologies, skills, and jobs while protecting the environment. Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, Minister of Climate Change and the Environment, said, ""With the unprecedented rise in the frequency and scale of climate change impacts seen today, net zero has become a necessity, and countries can either sink or swim. Being the first country in the region to take such a step will give us a first-mover advantage to become a regional leader in the low-carbon economy. We will bring all hands on deck and leverage our net-zero drive to boost green economy. We strongly believe in the gains from becoming climate-neutral, therefore we have committed to investing US$160 billion in clean and renewable energy projects by 2050."" The UAE Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative saw the light of day after the completion of a comprehensive government accelerator programme. The programme was specially designed to integrate the work of key government and private sector entities to prepare and implement an inclusive sustainability plan for all sectors that will set the course for net zero without compromising the country's economic potential. The Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MoCCAE) is leading and coordinating efforts to execute the initiative and ensure collaboration at national level to fulfil this objective. Stakeholders in vital sectors, such as energy, economy, industry, infrastructure, transport, waste, agriculture, and the environment, will update relevant plans, strategies, and policies, and implement projects to achieve net zero by 2050 in line with their needs and growth requirements. The contribution of private sector actors is more important than ever to help the UAE become climate-neutral by mid-century, adapt to the impacts of climate change to protect communities and natural habitats, mobilise finance, and deliver on its climate goals faster. MoCCAE is currently working with private sector entities nationwide to scale up their participation in the efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and ensure they are resilient in the face of climate change. One of the main enablers of a net-zero goal is the deployment of clean energy at scale. Having invested over US$40 billion in local clean energy ventures to date, the UAE is on track to generate 14 GW of carbon-free power by 2030. Mindful of the dire effects of climate change on crop production and the fact that food systems generate one-third of global GHG emissions, the UAE has joined forces with the US to launch the Agricultural Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM4C) at COP26 . With a membership base of 33 countries to date and the support of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the initiative seeks to increase investment in agriculture innovation and R&D for climate-smart food systems over the next five years. \"

This bold approach has underpinned our commitment as a first mover in climate action in the region. In fact, we are now building on our strong track record of climate innovation to drive sustainable economic growth."" A constructive global citizen. The UAE was the first country in the GCC region to sign and ratify the Paris Agreement. This 2015 agreement commits signatories to work together to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2030. Furthermore, the UAE was the first country in MENA to commit to an economy-wide reduction in emissions. As a result of this forward thinking, the nation is now home to three of the largest and lowest-cost solar plants in the world \- including Noor Abu Dhabi, the world's largest stand-alone operational solar power plant, located in Sweihan, Abu Dhabi, featuring 3.2 million solar panels and producing 1.2 gigawatts of electricity. This results in a carbon footprint reduction of 1 million metric tons per year, the equivalent of taking 200,000 gasoline-powered cars off the roads. Path-breaking initiatives. The UAE is the first country in the region to deploy industrial-scale carbon capture technology. In 2016, ADNOC and the UAE renewable energy company Masdar teamed up to launch Al Reyadah, a commercial-scale carbon capture facility that captures 0.8 million tonnes of CO2 from Emirates Steel plant annually. The UAE also stands as the first Arab nation to deploy zero emission nuclear energy. When the four nuclear power reactors are completed, it is expected that Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant will meet 25 per cent of the country's electricity needs with zero carbon emissions. There is a rise in Controlled Environment Agriculture in the UAE, such as automated vertical farms, which enhances food security and contributes to sustainable food systems. A three-pronged strategy for energy transition. The UAE's future energy needs will be met by a three-pronged approach: gas, solar and nuclear power. ""Our nation is also a pioneer in new zero carbon energies such as hydrogen,"" added Almheiri, noting that the nation has the foundations and competitive advantages in place to become one of the largest and lowest-cost global producers of low-carbon hydrogen. While cutting emissions is crucial, and very much on the table for discussion at COP26 , the UAE takes a holistic approach to climate action. The Minister added: ""Recognising that food systems account for more than a third of all global greenhouse gas emissions, we have partnered with the US to introduce the Agriculture Innovation Mission (AIM) for Climate, a global initiative aimed at accelerating investments in R&D for climate-smart agri-tech."" Set to be launched during COP26 , the joint UAE-US initiative AIM for Climate seeks to drive more rapid and transformative climate action in the agricultural sector, empowering agriculture to be part of the solution to address the climate crisis, build resilience to its impacts, and create co-benefits of climate action. AIM for Climate launches with support from over 30 countries, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation. Through the Mission, the UAE aims to attract much-needed investments in agriculture, address global hunger challenges and increase sustainable economic growth. The UAE will also announce other ground-breaking initiatives in November that align with the international community's climate action plans. Partnering for climate action. Partnerships are key to accelerating progress on climate action. Having invested US$16.8 billion in renewable energy projects in six continents around the world, and as home to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the UAE's approach is founded on bridge building with the international community. The UAE's commitment to the UNFCCC has been in place since 1995. But even prior to that, the UAE was a signatory to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and its Montreal Protocol. 2005 saw the UAE join 191 other nations in agreeing to the measures laid out in the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC. 2019 saw the Abu Dhabi Climate Meeting, underlining its local plans and international support, for the planet, the economy and the people. This year, as well as driving the conversation locally with the UAE Regional Climate Dialogue in April, UAE delegates took part in US President Joe Biden's Leaders Climate Summit, and are now heading to COP26 . Underlining the UAE's bold and continuing climate action is the recent offer to host COP28 in 2023, with the issuing of an inclusive invitation to governments, businesses and civil society to collaborate on practical climate solutions, raise ambition and create lasting, sustainable economic growth. The UAE's COP26 Minister Almheiri concluded: ""Together, we face the challenge of leaving a healthier planet to the next generations. In our drive to promote sustainability across the board, we view COP26 as an opportunity to share our aspirations for a low-carbon future."" \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE118","In now-or-never urgency, world looks to EU to lead climate war","October 27, 2021 Wednesday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","There is now an urgency in the mission as climate change becomes a real and present danger. It's the most important conference on climate change ever held. As leaders, scientists and activists gather in Glasgow, Scotland starting next week for the COP26 UN-sponsored forum, even sceptics are aware that extreme weather events are hitting with greater frequency globally. And with all the previous and preliminary meetings laying the groundwork, COP26 is the time and place for real tangible action. There is now an urgency in the mission as climate change becomes a real and present danger. Glasgow is also the setting for the 27-member European Union to show its true strength as it leads the battle against climate change through its own measures, for example as a role model and ability to leverage others. In the lead-up to COP26 , the EU Parliament approved a common negotiating position for one of the bloc's toughest ministers \- Dutchman Frans Timmermans \- to advocate as he leads the charge. And make no mistake: The EU is leading the way as the world's most prepared and determined centre of power in the fight against climate change. Before the pandemic hit, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had already placed climate change as the No. 1 priority and marshalled the funding and players to back it up. Central to the effort is a plan for trading in carbon emissions that has serious economic disincentives for any non-compliant producer globally. And it is underpinned with specific target goals that reach just five years into the future, not some theoretical horizon decades hence. Similar to how its privacy and data protection laws affected the global internet, the EU's carbon rules will impact manufacturers and energy consumers worldwide. As the wealthiest region in the world and the biggest trader in goods and services, if you want to do business internationally, you will have to meet EU rules. It can truly set the global standard. Tasked by their own voters and consumers, European leaders and manufacturers are clear they intend to implement a bold move away from the old carbon-based paradigm for power and production. A measure of how deep that runs is an announcement last week by Volkswagen, the world's biggest carmaker, that it will no longer build vehicles in Europe with internal combustion engines by 2035. Given the deep tradition and long history of the engines that powered the world for more than a century, it was a historic announcement. And the EU knows it must step up now because other superpowers cannot or will not fully commit to firm action in the near future. Although US President Joe Biden has re-engaged the international effort there is no clear program on how the US proposes to transform its own economy and move away from carbon-emitting production. And to get his budget through Congress, Biden appears to be scaling back even the cautious level of ambition in his clean energy program. For his part, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged that China would stop funding new coal plants abroad but rolling blackouts in October have put Beijing's timetable for ending the use of coal at home into question. Power outages in northeastern China plunged millions of homes into darkness and triggered factory shutdowns. Even the state-run Global Times newspaper termed the electricity cuts ""unexpected"" and ""unprecedented"". At the same time, near-panic about soaring gas, oil and electricity prices in Europe and elsewhere \- though unrelated to the transition away from carbon \- has put the need for renewable energy in the spotlight. But even with its advantages, how can the EU ensure something tangible emerges from Glasgow by the time the summit ends on Nov. 12? The EU Parliament tasked Timmermans to be a ""bridge-builder"", a job that includes bringing wealthy nations together with the less affluent, a strategy it said helped achieve real results at past climate negotiations. In such a new global effort combining science, diplomacy and action, the learning curve has been steep. At one of the first real summits on climate change, held in Copenhagen in 2009, major greenhouse gas emitters arrived with few if any concrete proposals. When the conference was over, they mostly continued on as before. By 2015, the threat seemed more immediate than before and the EU had learned how to better operate in the new diplomatic dynamic. At the landmark meeting in Paris, the EU helped form an informal group of developed and developing countries committed to supporting the common goal of a real transition to a green economy. The target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius relative to pre-industrial levels was established, and developed countries pledged to help fund efforts by the poorest countries. So the Paris Agreement was signed. But in the six years since, global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to climb, even in the pandemic-stricken year of 2020. Wealthy nations also have not kept their promise to provide $100 billion a year to poor countries to help fund the green transition. The EU will need to exert real pressure on the US and others to deliver their share. Discussion of the climate crisis was once considered a rather arcane debate over something that sceptics said was not even real, or perhaps just a theoretical calculation made by eccentrics and otherworldly scientists. It seemed far away for many, more akin to the periodic announcements on the behaviour of black holes in deep space. Yet today, Germans and Belgians are continuing to rebuild following catastrophic floods last summer and another ""bomb cyclone"" threatens the western US at the very moment final preparations are underway in Glasgow for COP26 . The challenge is real and the EU says it is equally serious about getting real plans in place. Considered hobbled at times by the self-interest of member nations, the EU knows it must now lead and force others to follow. The time has come for a shared solution to a shared global threat.

""This same forward looking dynamic approach is needed more than ever by the UAE, and others in the gulf region, post the announcement of net zero commitment by 2050,"" he added while virtually addressing the Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ADSW) Summit on Monday afternoon. The ADSW Summit as part of the Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week is hosting more than 80 global leaders, including heads of state, policy makers, and international business leaders, as UAE aims to take the global sustainability agenda forward and accelerate pathways to net zero. The Dutch Prime Minister said that the real challenge is now only beginning. Reaching the milestones laid out over the next few years will be crucial after COP 26 [Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)], he pointed out. ""The ideas and methods that made us prosperous are no longer the answer. We need smarter, more sustainable economies. There is no easy solution to the climate change problem, but also there is no other option but to take up the challenge,"" Rutte emphasised. Citing The Netherlands pavilion at Expo 2020 Dubai as an example, he said it highlighted three crucial requirements for life, water energy and food. The Prime Minister said they were not treated as separate themes with their own individualistic solutions, but instead the Pavilion took a holistic approach, each linked with one another. Rutte said that the new way to address climate change issues is ""joint-up-thinking"". The Pavilion that extracts water from air to grow plants, and once Expo ends, its every scrap of material will be taken down and given a new purpose, is an example of this new way of thinking, he noted. The Dutch leader hoped ""this small scale demonstration of circularity provides a small demonstration of how innovation can help address the climate crisis"". Rutte pointed out that ""climate change is not simply an economic crisis, it's also a social crisis"". He said the world's poor are being hit hardest, leading to greater inequality. In his closing remarks, the Prime Minister added that ""we need to be even more ambitious than we have been. Thanks to demographic changes, economic development and international trade, demand for fresh water, energy and food can only increase, so we need to align our policies and technologies around the natural nexus of water, energy and food"". He concluded that ""we need to be more ambitions and lead to a world sustainable future for all"". ADSW 2022 is the first major sustainability event after the COP26 climate change conference, and acts as a global catalyst for COP27, which will be held in Egypt in 2022, and COP28, which will be hosted by the UAE in 2023. \"

The most significant outcome was the doubling of the increased investment target from $4 (Dh14.69) million, pledged at the launch of the initiative at the 26th UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in November 2021 in Glasgow, to $8 (Dh29.38) million by COP27 that will take place in November in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. We welcomed seven new government partners - six countries and the European Commission (EU) - to our coalition, which means we now have over 140 government and non-government partners. In addition, we launched AIM for Climate Ideations - a new way for our partners to support the initiative through hosting events and activities focused on advancing its objectives. IBM has introduced our ninth innovation sprint - IBM Sustainability Accelerator - a pro-bono social impact programme that will see the company provide technology and expertise to deliver key insights on agriculture to farmers, community leaders and conservationists. We also announced our innovation sprint focal areas for 2022 - smallholder farmers in low-and middle-income countries, methane reduction, emerging technologies and agroecological research - and heard from guest speakers on the first two topics. What are innovation sprints? Innovation sprints are investments in specific, impactful, expedited efforts by our non-government partners. Our innovation sprints for 2022 will be launched at COP27. Proposals can be submitted at HYPERLINK mailto:info@aimforclimate.org info@aimforclimate.org We are planning to host Ideation events for each of the focal areas to facilitate discussion and networking towards the creation of innovation sprints. Who can support AIM for Climate and how? In addition to governments, our coalition is open to non-government partners from the ranks of international organisations, non-profits, academia, technology, and food & beverage (F&B) companies, and farmers' associations. They can support AIM for Climate as innovation sprint partners or knowledge partners. I have already explained what innovation sprints are. Also, knowledge partners, such as private research and education institutions, international organisations, companies, or non-governmental organisations (NGOs), amplify agricultural innovation through insight sharing, innovation collaboration, coordination, institutional capacity building, or demonstration and deployment. Our current non-government partners include the United Nations' (UN) Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Economic Forum (WEF), the UN Foundation, the Foundation for Food & Agriculture Research (FFAR), CGIAR, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and CropLife International, just to name a few. Among the most prominent representatives of the private sector are PepsiCo, BASF, Bayer, IBM, and Nestl&eacute;. Hosted by Expo 2020 Dubai, the dinner was an amazing experience that brought together leaders from diverse backgrounds and cultures, each bringing a unique perspective, united through food. The guest chefs used their knowledge and experience to curate and narrate a dinner aligned with the SDGs and the eight thematic areas of the Chefs' Manifesto that aims to inspire those who are the closest to food and offer them a pathway to building a world with zero hunger through simple, practical everyday actions. Each table of guests had their own personal chef, who prepared a menu that was relevant to their personal story. The chefs used food grown locally at Emirates Bio Farm and sustainably sourced ingredients from the UAE, supported by ingredients from their home countries. When it comes to food, whether we're ministers, heads of organisations, chefs, or members of civil society, we all have an essential role to play in helping end world hunger and building a better future for the next generations. The dinner provided us with an ideal opportunity to have real conversations about how we can work together to achieve this noble mission. Uniting the world for a food-secure future, the inaugural edition of the Summit in the MENA region served as the definitive platform for dialogue aimed at driving positive change in regional and global food systems. The event drew the participation of over 100 global leaders, 140+ exhibitors and more than 50 innovative start-ups from over 60 countries. The summit comprised several key tracks, including the Global Leaders' Symposium that convened international ministerial delegations and leading executives from non-profit organisations worldwide to explore new solutions to global food security challenges. Also, part of the event, the MENA Agri-Food Innovation Days aspired to enhance engagement of the public and private sectors, academia, and civil society in driving the transformation of the region's food systems through providing a forum for exchange of knowledge and best practices and highlighting the latest innovations and technologies. The Making it Happen conference focused on innovation and technology-enhanced agriculture and supply chain, with some of the most influential local, regional, and global brands discussing their roles in enhancing food security and safety. The event also featured the Generation Food stage, hosting a range of workshops on various topics related to food for the future global population, and a farmers market showcasing the best food products grown and made in the UAE. Helping countries integrate nutrition into their national food security and climate plans, the VGFSN bring all relevant sectors under one umbrella to build sustainable food systems. Adopted in February 2021 and informed by scientific evidence, the guidelines seek to provide guidance on policies and interventions to address malnutrition in all its forms. The VGFSN align with the UAE's efforts to promote the right food choices for its community, encompassed in its Nutritional Labelling Policy and National Nutrition Guidelines. We are committed to supporting the implementation of the VGFSN in our region and are confident they will go a long way in improving our ability to deliver healthy diets and bring considerable socio-economic benefits. Food for Life is a bold, first-of-its-kind community awareness and engagement campaign that addresses the nexus of health, nutrition and planetary well-being through promoting healthy diets from sustainable food systems. The initiative is run by MOCCAE, the UAE Ministry of Health and Prevention (MoHAP), Emirates Nature-WWF and FAO. The food we choose to eat and the way we produce it is affecting not only our health but also the health of our planet. The global food system is the single biggest contributor to biodiversity loss, deforestation, drought, freshwater pollution, and the collapse of aquatic wildlife. It's also the second-biggest generator of greenhouse gas emissions after the energy industry. We want our people to connect with food - understand where our food comes from and eat and live mindfully. We want their diets to be safe, diverse, balanced and based on nutritious foods. Wherever possible, we want them to consciously opt for food that is locally produced to minimise its carbon footprint. Because a few small changes adopted by many people can create a domino effect that ultimately results in a huge impact. And improving our diets is one of the greatest impacts we can have on both our health and our environment. We have prepared a packed calendar of activities across UAE communities and digital platforms. I encourage everyone to check out the initiative's website, HYPERLINK , take a quiz to test their knowledge and learn more about healthy diets from sustainable food systems. They can also register for community events, where they'll get the chance to have fun with like-minded people while doing something for their health and the health of our planet.

COP26 ""As economies bounce back from the Covid-19 pandemic, at the fastest rate in 50 years, demand has outpaced supply. After almost a decade of under-investment in our industry, the world has sleepwalked into a supply crunch. It is time to wake up."" Dr Al Jaber said that the energy transition of tomorrow cannot be done by unplugging from the energy system of today. ""The oil and gas industry will have to invest over $600 billion every year until 2030 just to keep up with expected demand. Yes, renewable energy is the fastest growing segment of the energy mix but oil and gas is still the biggest, and will be for decades to come. The future is coming but it is not here yet. We must make progress with pragmatism."" Dr Al Jaber revealed that Adnoc will increase its production capacity to five million barrels per day by 2030. However, he pointed out that Adnoc through virtual geology and design has been able to offer some of the least carbon intensive barrels in the world. ""We were the first company to bring carbon capture and storage to the region. And we are expanding our capacity from 800,000 tonnes to 5 million (tonnes) per year."" Highlighting further innovations to reduce carbon emissions, he said: ""From January, up to 100 per cent of our grid power will come from clean sources, namely, nuclear and solar. In one move this will significantly reduce Adnoc's operational emissions."" Dr Al Jaber underlined that if the world is to resolve the dilemma of energy transition, the solutions can be found where the energy expertise exists.

The initiative, which is led by the Danish and Costa Rican governments and was launched at COP26 in Glasgow on November 11, has called for ""bold and tangible action, not talk"" to move beyond oil and gas. The alliance is supported by 11 governments and views an end to oil and gas production as a key component of meeting the Paris Agreement's 1.5-degree target. ""The IPPC has sounded a code red for humanity, because there is no future for oil and gas in a 1.5-degree world,"" said Danish Minister for Climate, Energy\~and Utilities Dan Jorgensen ""The fossil era must come to an end."" The alliance is the first state-led initative to bring the phasing out of oil and gas production into the international area. The alliance currently features: Denmark; France; Ireland; Sweden; Wales; Iceland; Costa Rica; Quebec; New Zealand and California. Italy supports the alliance as a friend. The group does not feature any major oil and gas producers, and crucially does not feature the UK, the COP26 host. Denmark is taking the lead by setting 2050 as the date for the end of oil and gas production, and has committed to ceasing immediately all oil and gas licensing. ""Our goal is not small, our ambition is not modest. We hope that today will mark the beginning of the end of oil and gas,"" said Jorgensen. ""The science has spoken and the time for O&G has run out,"" he said. The body features countries that have committed to ending oil and gas production by a certain date. Governments and sub-national governments can also support the movement without setting an end-date for oil and gas. Jorgensen said the group hopes to unveil new members in the coming day, and will be able to start a major conversation on ending oil and gas and to develop new strategies to pursue a just energy transition. ""Last week's flurry of announcements created a lot of headlines, but initiatives like the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance show what real climate leadership looks like. If we want to keep global heating below 1.5 degrees, a managed decline of fossil fuel production is the only way. This alliance is a great first step to start that process,"" said May Boeve, executive director of 350.org The group's aims follow the conclusions of the International Energy Agency (IAE), which said recently that there can be no new investment in new fossil fuel production projects if the world is to meet the 1.5-degree target.

Industry observers note that the decision poses major ramifications for oil exploration in the region. Shell Oil, which had planned to conduct field explorations by venturing with Siccar Point, justified its decision based upon the economic infeasibility of the enormous investment needed to move forward. ""After comprehensive screening of the proposed Cambo development, we have concluded that the economic case for investment in this project is not strong enough at this time, as well as having the potential for delays,"" according to a company statement. Environmentalists claim Shell's step was nothing short of a ""deathblow"" to the Cambo project, which has faced stiff opposition from activist groups throughout the United Kingdom. Greenpeace had dragged the government of the United Kingdom into court over its permission given for conducting oil drilling activities. Following the United Nations COP26 climate summit held in Glasgow in October, Nicola Sturgeon, SNP leader and first minister of Scotland, hinted at her disagreement in allowing the project to proceed while impact studies are still underway. Environmentalists remain opposed to the Cambo project, bearing in mind the United Kingdom's goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Governmental consent was initially provided two decades ago to conduct field exploitation at the location, some 78 miles offshore in one thousand-meter-deep waters.

The announcement comes in advance of the 2021 Global Conference on Health & Climate Change, being organised by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Global Climate and Health Alliance and other partners, and on the sidelines of the UN Climate Change Conference COP26 in Glasgow, UK, in November. It responds to the call from the COP26 Presidency, currently held by the United Kingdom, to adopt initiatives towards building an environmentally sustainable health sector. The announcement draws on the critical steps being taken by the UAE on climate and health. It also follows the nation's offer to host COP28 in 2023 with a focus on making it as inclusive and action-oriented as possible. The nation adopts a holistic approach towards climate action and aims to help create a robust ecosystem that interlinks all key sectors, including healthcare, given the importance of climate on human wellness. In 2019, the UAE undertook a national climate risk assessment for the health sector as well as launched the UAE National Framework for Action on Climate Change and Health 2019-2021 in partnership with WHO. Under the Framework, the UAE National Committee on Climate Change and Health is currently coordinating the development of a sector-specific adaptation plan. The UAE is committed to updating the climate and health vulnerability and adaptation (V&A) assessment on a regular basis and ensuring that the findings continue to inform health policies and programmes. Notably, the UAE will seek to strengthen its response measures as heat stress grows in an already hot and humid desert climate. Currently, the UAE offers a stipulated mid-day break to outdoor workers during peak summer months. The Abu Dhabi government has also introduced a 'Safety in Heat' programme that aims at reducing heat exposure at the workplace. In addition to adapting the health sector, the UAE is also working towards reducing emissions from the health sector. The country is looking to carry out an assessment of baseline emissions covering supply chains, and develop an action plan for a low-carbon health system in line with national climate mitigation targets and Paris Agreement goals. UAE's emission reduction efforts in the health sector and beyond are expected to yield air quality improvements and related public health co-benefits, thus offering win-win solutions for health and climate. The steps the UAE is taking to develop the national health system, and prepare it for imminent and long-term climate impacts, will enhance its resilience and effectiveness in face of any future crises. \"

In his pre-recorded video address at the UN, Xi also said, ""China will support other developing countries in generating green and low-carbon energy."" Xi's announcement was lauded by Kerry, who called it a good start to achieving success at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) held in Glasgow, Scotland. Alok Sharma, Head of COP26 , also praised the announcement. Xi's measured speech, which did not directly mention the bitter rivalry between China and the U.S., came after the first UN address of President Joe Biden, who warned of a new era of intense competition. Last year, Xi repeatedly promised China will achieve its carbon dioxide emissions goal before 2030 and carbon neutrality before 2060. But some experts stressed those targets are not ambitious enough, as China, which is still heavily reliant on coal for its domestic energy needs, is the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter. One of Biden's first actions after assuming office in January was to re-engage the U.S. in the Paris agreement. Relations between the two largest global economies have dropped to their lowest level in decades, due to issues ranging from human rights to the origins of COVID-19. \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE127","Supergrids to take renewable energy to the world","March 10, 2022","Gulf Industry Worldwide","(Image: source/31/03/images/Supergrids-electricity-2.jpg) In the race towards a zero emissions world, mammoth transcontinental power highways or Supergrids that can evacuate large quantities of renewable electrons to power-hungry locations across the globe are now back in vogue, a Zawya report said. Supergrid projects that made headlines last year included a 15,000-km link to evacuate Chile&rsquo;s renewable power to China; the India-promoted and the UK-US backed Green Grids Initiative - One Sun One World One Grid (GGI-OSOWOG), announced at the COP26 climate summit; and a 3,800 km high voltage Morocco-UK cable project to be built at an investment of more than $20 billion by XLinks - a UK-based company that has ACWA Power&rsquo;s CEO Paddy Padmanabhan on its board. Closer home, the Middle East and North Africa (Mena) region&rsquo;s first large-scale HVDC interconnection project, the $1.8 billion Saudi-Egypt interconnector with 3,000 megawatts (MW) capacity, was awarded last year. In the Middle East, the first project to use HVDC technology was the 400kV GCC Grid, which connects the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member countries through 1,200-km network of overhead and underground lines. This vision has gained traction with the rapid growth of solar and wind power in the Mena region. The idea of connecting Mena&rsquo;s renewable resources to Europe was first conceived a decade ago by Desertec, but the project wasn&rsquo;t able to make much headway. Paul van Son, President, Dii Desert Energy (or Desertec 3.0), who backed the original idea, explained: ""You always need price differences to justify infrastructure. Power links will become feasible when the price differences between Mena and Europe are interesting enough. In the long term, there will be enough business cases for grid extensions between North Africa, Middle East or between continents."" Van Son added that similar grids in China have already proved their potential. Cross-border energy exchanges will grow in parallel with the increasing penetration of solar and wind generation, according to Floris Schulze, Middle East Managing Director of CESI. The Milan-based energy consultancy is involved in developing an energy trading master plan and interconnection grid code for a Pan Arab Electricity Market. ""The growing deployment of variable renewable energy sources calls for a higher power system flexibility to deal with production volatility; and strengthening of transmission infrastructures, including cross-border lines,"" said Schulze. Regional grids An interconnected grid is key to decarbonising the region&rsquo;s energy systems, noted Dietmar Siersdorfer, Managing Director, Siemens Energy Middle East. ""The idea of a regional grid has lent new urgency to decarbonise energy systems across the Middle East over the next few decades, and the need to decouple their economies from oil."" He pointed out that transnational interconnections have the potential to deliver significant benefits, by improving access to energy, moving electricity from low carbon and low-cost areas to high demand areas, providing stability, improving trade, reliability, and redundancy. ""Abundant solar resources could turn the Gulf into a solar hub to supply a global network of high-voltage highways and Supergrids,"" he said. Commenting on the technical benefits of interconnectors, Schulze said: ""Stronger interconnections allow flexibility of the power system and it is possible to minimise the risk of VRES, curtailment that causes an adverse impact on costs."" The GCC Grid has saved over $3 billion since commissioning, Ahmed Ali Al-Ebrahim, GCCIA&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer had said at a recent event. The Authority&rsquo;s study showed that the interconnector can potentially save over 25 GW of generation capacity between 2021 and 2025. Mega investments According to Schulze, the GCC&rsquo;s transmission and distribution sector is expected to witness higher investments, especially in the area of strengthening and building new interconnections to manage the periodic surplus or possible shortfall of energy at a wider scale. Citing Europe as an example, he said, Europe&rsquo;s decarbonisation plan includes up to 78 per cent renewable penetration requiring 95 GW of new cross-border capacity, which translates to &euro;51 billion ($69 billion) in Europe-specific T&D grid investments by 2040. The world may need to invest close to $733 billion per year till 2050 in power grids, including energy flexibility measures, in a 1.5-degree C scenario, according to Irena. Schulze noted that cross-border infrastructure projects being capital intensive, identifying benefits is crucial with drivers changing from supply security in the past to better renewable integration and environmental benefits while minimising costs. ""Hence, new indicators shall be considered and quantified when assessing the cost-benefits of new interconnections"" he said, adding these projects should also be bankable. Siemens Energy&rsquo;s Siersdorfer noted that the technology for cross border power-links is available but regional interconnections could be a slow process. ""It can take years to develop the appropriate regulatory frameworks, raise funds, build interconnections and negotiate the rules and tariffs that allow for cross-border electricity transfer,"" he said. The Siemens Energy official underlined that the grid must be made resilient against voltage dips, adding that where the share of renewable energy exceeds 50 per cent, special mechanisms need to be in place, which could add to the complexity of grid interconnection. What is next? Supergrids could enable power trading to generate revenues, but an Apicorp report noted that less than 10 per cent of the GCC grid&rsquo;s capacity is being used, mostly for reserve or emergency purposes rather than commercial trading. CESI and GCCIA recently launched an electronic platform to discover electricity prices in the region - a first step towards developing a regional electricity spot market. Schulze said the GCC needs to take a step-by-step approach and develop an Ancillary Service Market, which is a market mechanism that allows cross-border transactions at a short-term notice.  \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE128","Putting public finance on the right side of world history","October 5, 2021 Tuesday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","The economics of renewable energy have improved beyond recognition. Solar power is now the cheapest form of electricity in history. Over 90 per cent of power-generation capacity added around the world last year was in renewables. But to stand a chance of limiting global warming to 1.5\'b0 Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the world's energy systems must transform even faster. And that requires governments and public financial institutions to stop supporting fossil fuels and instead emphasize international support for the clean-energy transition. The science is clear. To meet the 2015 Paris climate agreement's 1.5\'b0C target, the global energy transition needs to progress 4-6 times faster than it currently is. Fossil fuels still supply 84 per cent of the world's energy and account for over 75 per cent of global emissions. The International Energy Agency's Net Zero by 2050 roadmap shows that global energy systems must be fossil-fuel-free by 2040. Yet since the Paris agreement was concluded, G20 governments have provided more than three times more public finance for fossil fuels ($77 billion) than for renewables every year. This year's catastrophic storms, floods, and wildfires have shown why we need climate action now, not later. And because future prosperity lies in clean energy investment, there is also a clear economic development case for redoubling our efforts. Wind and solar are now cheaper than new coal and gas power plants in two-thirds of the world. The dramatic cost reduction over the past decade has transformed global energy options, particularly in the very poorest countries, where renewables-based mini grids offer real opportunities to alleviate energy poverty and provide energy access. Boosting investment in renewables is also vital to creating jobs, driving economic growth, and reducing air pollution. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, deploying renewables at scale could help create 42 million jobs worldwide by 2050. This additional employment will be crucial for delivering a resilient, green recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, especially in countries with young, fast-growing populations. But, of course, jobs will also disappear as we abandon fossil fuels. We therefore must take steps to ensure that every community benefits from the transition. This will require carefully designed policies to support a managed shift away from older forms of energy generation. Global solidarity will be critical. We must do much more to provide everyone with the necessary technologies, expertise, investment support, and financial strategies. Fortunately, we already have solutions to the problem. At the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow in November, governments and financial institutions must commit to supporting cheaper, cleaner, no-regrets energy, and to ending all international support for fossil-fuel-based power. This should not be too difficult, given that many legacy energy investments will inevitably become stranded assets. We are already starting to see significant progress in this direction. In May, G7 member states committed to cease all of their international financing for coal projects by the end of 2021, and to ""phase out new direct government support for carbon-intensive international fossil fuel energy."" Moreover, South Korea, Japan, and now China \- the world's largest providers of international coal financing \- have also agreed to stop funding coal projects overseas. Equally important, more than 85 countries (plus the European Union) have submitted updated national climate pledges, as outlined in the Paris agreement. These show a clear trend toward higher renewable energy use and lower reliance on fossil fuels by 2030. But many of these countries will need substantial technical and financial support to hit their targets. The United Kingdom and the European Investment Bank have both committed to making international support for the clean-energy transition a high priority. In 2019, the EIB became the first multilateral bank to announce an end to all financing for fossil-fuel energy projects (by 2021). The bank has been increasing its investments in clean energy, including in developing countries to support their transition. In Kenya, EIB investments have helped build the largest wind farm in Africa, providing clean and affordable energy to the region. Similarly, in March, the UK government put an immediate end to new public support for overseas international fossil-fuel energy projects, fully shifting investment into renewables. This decision has already started to unlock significant opportunities, building on existing support for clean energy provided by the country's export credit agency, UK Export Finance. This includes over \£3140 million ($189 million) of financing for UK exports to Ghana, which will help Ghana pursue major national infrastructure projects, including an initiative for solar-powered clean water that will reach more than 225,000 people. We now must build on this momentum to ensure that COP26 is a success. More commitments are needed to align international public support fully with the Paris goals. We can achieve the necessary solidarity by bringing governments and public-finance institutions together behind a joint statement proclaiming support for clean energy and a phase-out of fossil fuels. We invite governments and public-finance leaders to join us in supporting this statement. The cost of climate inaction would be catastrophic. We have reached a critical juncture for our planet. COP26 must be remembered as the moment when we took decisive action to safeguard our shared future.  Project Syndicate Werner Hoyer is president of the European Investment Bank.

To date, 350,000 new seedlings have already been planted on Jubail Island and over the next decade, a total of 1,000,000 additional new mangroves will be planted in support of the country's ambition to plant 100 million mangroves by 2030; representing an increase from 30 million, which was announced during this month's COP26 Conference in Glasgow. The announcement by JIIC reaffirms its ongoing efforts to promote socially and environmentally responsible development, in addition to actively implementing programmes to protect and enhance the island's biodiversity. Ponds, labelled as 'Biodiversity Genesis Zones', have also been created within the new channel system and will improve the flushing of the channels to enhance the overall water quality within the wetland system. These new littoral zones have been shaped adjacent to existing areas of the mangrove forest and saltmarsh and will also create additional habitat for native species. In addition to the 350,000 seedlings already planted, Jubail Island has partnered with Etihad Airways to plant another 182,000 mangrove trees in the next five years at Jubail Island. Mounir Haidar, Managing Director of Jubail Island Investment Company, said: ""We extend our sincere thanks to the Environment Agency \- Abu Dhabi for their continued support and guidance throughout our environmental initiatives, and for their strenuous efforts to work with partners with the common goal of protecting biodiversity and preserving the quality of life in the UAE for a sustainable future. At Jubail Island Investment Company, we are determined to develop Jubail into a prominent landmark destination that sets the standard for community development which will protect the natural environment and preserve the flora and wildlife that inhabits the island. ""Mangrove forests are an important part of the UAE's natural assets, providing a haven for wildlife while also helping to reduce overall carbon emissions, releasing oxygen and reducing erosion and pollution in our waterways and coasts. It is only right that we support the UAE's forward-thinking initiative by planting 1 million mangrove trees over the course of 10 years right here within Jubail Island. This planting initiative will further enhance Jubail Island position as a hub of ecotourism in Abu Dhabi as well as being an integral element of our overall landscaping plan for the island, which will be home to more than 10,000 residents when completed in late 2023."" Nestled among the breath-taking natural beauty and rich biodiversity of the mangroves, and covering more than 2,800 hectares, Jubail Island is perfectly situated between Yas Island and Saadiyat Island, and will become Abu Dhabi's leading sanctuary designed to appeal to wellness and nature enthusiasts. \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE130","UAE companies step up ESG compliance, look towards sustainable future","November 10, 2021 Wednesday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","With the increased focus on climate change, corporate companies in the UAE are upping the game by considering environmental, social and governance (ESG) benchmarks while making business and investment decisions, experts said. A panel discussion titled ""Welcoming a Sustainable Future"" was held at Expo 2020 Dubai on Wednesday to highlight these corporate efforts. Shady Elborno, head of macro strategy at Emirates NBD, said: ""The UAE companies are starting to see the benefits of developing a more sustainable approach to business in addition for understanding the potential risks associated with climate change within their own operations and of the societies in which they operate."" The efforts are in line with the UAE's vision to drive the sustainability agenda through strategic development policies, such as Vision 2021, the energy strategy for 2050, the Green Agenda 2030 and the National Innovation Strategy. The panel, moderated by Abdulla Galadari, senior partner at Galadari Advocates and Legal Consultants, tackled the topic of how social and environmental considerations have found their place in the country's development agenda and serve corporates in the global and regional economic context. Commenting on the impact ESG is having on businesses and economies, Elborno said the COP26 , the UN's 26th annual global climate change conference currently being held in Glasgow, will ""supercharge ESG metrics guidelines and goals for companies around the world."" He said investors have started pushing companies to be ESG compliant and the fact that they are choosing companies based on their ESG benchmarks is having a huge impact. But Elborno added that it is an encouraging trend that consumers themselves are taking a ""much more involved attitude towards ESG metrics"" of companies, everything from packaging of goods down to the sustainable recycling of foods down to the way how companies are governed. Echoing the same sentiment, Fatima Alnaqbi, head of strategy and future department at Ministry of Finance, said when investors looking at diversifying their portfolio, they are assessing companies on their ESG benchmarks. ""Even for SMEs, being ESG complaint has become an important requirement for them to set up their businesses,"" she added. ""There is a good understanding and a strong belief that there is a strong correlation between the financial performance and ESG practices,"" she said. For his part, Galadari said ESG is an integral part of the company's vision and it aims at doing better for the future of the environment. ""We have recently made great progress in terms of diversity, environmental practices, and social initiatives. I know my words will resonate with many of you sharing a similar vision,"" he said. Sara Ahmed Alliusie Alhilali, project manager, Tourism Development and Investment at Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing, spoke about Dubai's vision to become one of the world's leading sustainable tourism destinations. She said the Dubai Sustainable Tourism Initiative, launched in 2016, has created a regulatory framework that allows for measurements, metrics, performance impacts of the hotel industry. ""With the 19 requirements, we are really encouraging hotels to have a real presence of being advocates of sustainability,"" said Alhilali. ALSO READ: From a regulatory perspective, Peter Smith, managing director and head of strategy at Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) said he is hoping that something will come out of COP26 that will enable them as a regulatory community to carry on pushing the agenda of sustainability finance.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE132","How to manage energy crises in an age of climate disruption","December 13, 2021 Monday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","A recent report by Goldman Sachs reached a surprising conclusion: Over the past eight years, financial markets have been increasing the cost of capital for big, long-term, high-carbon investments in sectors such as offshore oil and liquefied natural gas. But when it comes to renewable projects, the ""hurdle rate"" \- the minimum rate of return required by investors \- has been declining. The difference is significant, translating into an implied carbon price of about $80 per tonne of carbon dioxide for new oil developments and $40 per ton of CO2 for LNG projects. Capital markets seem finally to be internalising the message that high-carbon investments should carry a significant risk premium. This insight has not emerged spontaneously. It is the result of many years of in-depth research, targeted analyses by groups like Carbon Tracker and the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, pressure from investor alliances, hard-hitting NGO campaigns, and divestment decisions by foundations, churches, universities, and pension funds. The shift in capital-market sentiment has been reinforced by political action. At last month's United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, nearly 40 countries and institutions pledged to end public finance for oil, gas, and coal projects overseas. In addition, Denmark and Costa Rica spearheaded a group of 12 countries and regions that launched the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance. These efforts, though still partial in their coverage and insufficient, are to be welcomed as a sign that financial flows are now starting to align with the goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, as mandated by article 2.1(c) of that treaty. But the implicit carbon price demanded by capital markets so far covers only the supply side: the oil, gas, and coal fields, refineries, and transport infrastructure that feed fossil fuels into the global economy. Unfortunately, similar progress on the demand side for coal, oil, and gas has been lacking. Despite much talk of green recoveries from the COVID-19 shock, huge government stimulus programs have largely failed to discriminate between green and dirty economic activity, and have thus stabilized the global economy on the old growth path. Moreover, these interventions have created significant consumer demand as the economy bounces back. Movement profiles point to renewed car use and air travel, while energy-intensive industries like cement, steel, plastics, and chemicals are again fueling demand for electricity, gas, and coal. Significantly, China's economic stimulus has focused far too much on the highly carbon-intensive building sector, instead of undertaking the long overdue reorientation of the country's growth model in line with its climate goals. The current surge in fossil-fuel energy prices reflects a multitude of highly idiosyncratic factors. But today's situation may well presage a future in which a misalignment of supply- and demand-side climate policies generates significant price swings. Hydrocarbon lobbyists have been quick to exploit the recent uptick in fossil-fuel energy prices to advocate for renewed government financing and subsidies, as well as favourable regulatory treatment for their clients' investments. In essence, they are calling for the public sector to step in to help fossil-fuel producers at a time when private capital is quite rightly shying away from climate risk and slowly withdrawing from the sector. Efforts to ease the energy crunch can and must be aligned with solving the climate crisis. Each well-insulated house, wind park, and solar panel reduces the strain on gas supplies. Making cities attractive for cycling and walking, and upgrading public transport, is not only good for public health and safety; it is also an investment in weaning ourselves off the oil that is straining our purses and killing our planet. Similarly, reducing demand for single-use plastic packaging will further decrease demand for the fossil-fuel feedstocks of petrochemicals. And innovations like flying taxis, supersonic air travel, and space travel that benefit only the super-rich and create new, wasteful energy demand could easily be restricted or even banned before they are widely adopted. Instead of loosening supply-side carbon policies, as some short-sighted voices advocate, we must \- even in periods of high energy prices \- keep our eye on the main goal. That means focusing on the inevitable, well-managed decline of coal, oil, and gas and their substitution by sustainable clean energy. In the short term, the best remedies for high energy prices are demand-reducing measures, like the lower highway speed limits that some Western governments instituted following the 1970s oil-price shock. In short, a just transition away from fossil fuels requires us to ""cut with both arms of the scissors"". As the UN Environment Programme emphasised in two pre- COP26 reports, that means simultaneously closing the huge gaps in climate action on both the demand and the supply side. Despite the much-needed progress towards pricing high-carbon investments appropriately, these gaps are still far too big. Only by closing them quickly and in parallel can we stave off catastrophic climate disruption, and avert the economic disaster that could result from massive energy-price swings and extensive stranded fossil-fuel assets.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE133","UAE welcomes the responsibility of hosting COP28: Minister Almheiri","December 6, 2021 Monday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","The UAE has recently wrapped up its successful participation in the 26th UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, during which the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) announced that the young Arab nation has been chosen to host COP28 in 2023. The event also witnessed the launch of Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for Climate), a joint UAE-US initiative aimed at increasing and accelerating investment in agricultural innovation and research & development (R&D) over the next five years. AIM for Climate has already garnered a strong coalition of support, including more than 30 countries and around 50 non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and mobilised $4 (Dh14.69) billion of increased investment, with $1 (Dh3.67) billion pledged by the UAE. Another feather in the UAE's cap was the launch of the Energy Transition Accelerator Financing (ETAF) platform in partnership with the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). The new global climate finance platform intends to fast-track the shift to renewable energy in developing countries. The UAE committed $400 (Dh1,469.24) million in funding, provided by Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD), for the initiative that seeks to secure $1 (Dh3.67) billion in total. Managed by IRENA from its Abu Dhabi headquarters, ETAF will help mitigate investment risks and finance renewable energy projects in developing countries that may otherwise struggle to secure Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, Minister of Climate Change and Environment, was part of the UAE delegation to the global gathering, led by Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE's Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, and comprising representatives of leading government and private sector entities. Almheiri attended multiple high-level events and bilateral meetings at the conference, where she highlighted the UAE's endeavours to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change, protect its environment, and enhance its food and water security. She also made several important announcements on behalf of the country. Khaleej Times spoke to the minister about the outcomes of the summit and the way forward. Edited excerpts from the interview: What are your thoughts on the honour for the UAE to host COP28 in 2023 and the Arab League's support for the young nation to host such a momentous event? We appreciate the support of the international community for our bid, and are proud of the UNFCCC's vote of confidence that reaffirms the UAE's climate leadership. At a time of rapidly rising climate risks that threaten all countries, we welcome the responsibility of hosting COP28. We seek to leverage our solid track record as a global climate action convener to deliver a productive event with high youth engagement that builds a strong economic case for climate action, and mobilises countries to increase the scale and pace of their efforts to address climate change. We are committed to driving multilateral diplomacy aimed at preserving our planet for the next generations and building a better future for all humankind. Why does the UAE believe climate action is an opportunity to achieve sustainable economic growth? As a result of climate change impacts, governments bear costs in healthcare, disaster relief and rebuilding damaged infrastructure that amount to billions of dollars, and businesses face risks ranging from disrupted supply chains and higher insurance costs to labour challenges. Meanwhile, people \- particularly disadvantaged and vulnerable populations \- are affected by food and water insecurity, higher food prices, lost incomes and livelihoods, adverse health effects and displacement. According to UN estimates, every dollar spent on preparation for climate disasters could save seven dollars in disaster relief costs. In addition to the savings, tackling climate change through innovation creates new knowledge, new industries, new skills, and new jobs that fuel economic growth. So, it's clear that climate action makes good business sense and provides valuable opportunities for sustainable development, on which we shouldn't miss out. What measures are being undertaken to implement the UAE Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative? Federal and local government authorities have joined forces to issue policies and strategies and launch projects and initiatives aimed at cutting down on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These include expanding the deployment of clean energy solutions, planting millions of trees, developing the country's carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) network, shifting to a green economy across priority sectors \- industry, energy, transport, and the environment \- and increasing reliance on advanced technologies and AI. The Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE) is working with private sector entities nationwide to devise plans and implement projects that will help them shape a low-carbon development path. How would the UAE promote inclusive climate negotiations? Inclusivity will be the guiding principle of COP28. We understand that each region and country have a different starting point and might move at its own pace. The event will provide an ideal opportunity to learn from our peers which path is working under what circumstances. We will ensure that the voice of every nation \- whether developed or developing \- and every stakeholder is heard, and that the specific geographic, climatic and socio-economic conditions of every country are considered when charting a global roadmap to a climate-resilient future. We are keen to promote a just and inclusive transition to a sustainable way of life that truly leaves no one behind. How is COP28 an opportunity to 'bring the world together to explore effective solutions to the most pressing challenges our planet faces'? If we want to achieve the objective of the Paris Agreement to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius (C), we need all hands on the deck. And as the home of IRENA and an experienced host of high-profile international events, the UAE provides an ideal venue to convene world leaders to tackle climate change on a global level. COP28 is particularly important because it will provide a platform to present the results of the first global stock taking of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that aims to assess the world's progress in reducing GHG emissions. We plan to focus on advancing climate change adaptation, raising our collective climate ambition and stepping up global climate finance commitments. How is the UAE planning to 'work closely' with John Kerry, the US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate? In addition to collaborating on AIM for Climate, the UAE has endorsed the US- and EU-led Global Methane Pledge that aims to reduce global methane emissions by 30 per cent by 2030. We also seek to jointly identify opportunities for strategic investment in the clean energy transition worldwide, develop and scale clean energy technologies, and work to enhance climate security. During his previous visits to the UAE, Mr Kerry toured our clean energy projects and participated in the UAE Regional Climate Dialogue. He praised the country's efforts to lead other nations in the search of new technology to address the global climate challenge. Data shows that the UAE already has about 60 million mangroves, and aims to increase the number by 50 per cent. What steps are being taken to increase the mangrove cover? The UAE has always been a pioneer in leveraging nature-based solutions to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change. As we are a coastal country, we seek to harness the power of our blue carbon ecosystems, including mangrove forests that protect our coasts from rising sea levels and storm surges, provide critical habitats for biodiversity and serve as effective carbon sinks. In our second NDC, we pledged to plant an additional 30 million mangroves by 2030 \- the 50 per cent increase that you mentioned. And at COP26 , we stepped up our ambition by raising this target to 100 million. The move will bring our total mangrove forest area to 483 square kilometres and boost the CO2 sequestration rate to nearly 115,000 tonnes per year. We are working closely with NGOs and the private sector to achieve our goal. A prime example of such collaboration is the Dubai Mangrove Forest, an initiative of Emirates Marine Environmental Group (EMEG) sponsored by P&G. How is the UAE improving global water security through cloud-seeding technology? To explore the significant unrealised potential of rain enhancement, the National Center of Meteorology (NCM) runs the UAE Rain Enhancement Program (UAEREP). Since its inception, the program has established a network of more than 1,200 researchers from over 500 institutions around the world. UAEREP has gained a prominent position in the global quest to address water security challenges through innovation, and placed the UAE at the international forefront of rain enhancement research. Under the programme, the UAE has been one of the first countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region to use the cloud-seeding technology that modifies a cloud's structure to increase the chance of rain by adding small, ice-like particles. UAEREP's research focuses on boosting the efficiency of cloud seeding through various methods, such as leveraging nanotechnology to accelerate water condensation and using drones to minimise the environmental impact of the operations. How is the UAE becoming a key player in the hydrogen industry? January 2021 marked the inception of the Abu Dhabi Hydrogen Alliance that aims to establish our capital as a pioneer in green and blue hydrogen. We launched the first industrial-scale solar-powered green hydrogen project in the region at the Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Dubai in May 2021 while expanding blue hydrogen production to diversify our energy mix. At COP26 And just a few days ago, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and Abu Dhabi National Energy Company (TAQA) have announced the formation of a new joint venture focused on renewable energy and green hydrogen. The UAE's hydrocarbon industry maintains one of the world's lowest methane intensities of 0.01 per cent. The Global Methane Pledge that we endorsed at COP26 provides us with an opportunity to share our capabilities and experience in best-in-class methane performance with the other signatories. On the home front, we aim to reduce human-caused methane emissions through domestic policy-making and developing innovative solutions in sectors such as oil and gas and waste management. Our methane mitigation strategy is part of our holistic approach to climate action. HYPERLINK mailto:joydeep@khaleejtimes.com joydeep@khaleejtimes.com \"

The MoU comes ahead of the UN COP26 climate summit in November, due to be hosted by the UK in the city of Glasgow and offers a framework for wide-ranging cooperation by government entities, companies, and research agencies in support of realizing COP26 goals. The agreement recognizes that strong, decisive climate action can be an engine for economic growth, job creation and sustainable development and aligns with the UAE's recently launched ""Principles of the 50"" roadmap to mark the country's Golden Jubilee. The Principles will help forge a new era of economic and social growth for the UAE over the next 50 years. Dr. Sultan Al Jaber said: ""Fifteen years ago, the UAE made a strategic decision to invest heavily in innovation and low-carbon energy, especially renewables and in partnership with other countries. In the UK, we were an anchor investor in some of the country's largest wind projects - including Dudgeon and the London Array - that have helped make Great Britain the world's leading market for offshore wind energy. ""Today's MoU, on the eve of the UN climate summit in Glasgow, builds on our long-standing partnership with the UK, including on environmental cooperation and investment. We look forward to strengthening our collaboration across all sectors to help support and realize the bold ambitions the UK has outlined for COP26 ."" The UAE was the first country in the region to ratify and sign the Paris Accords and the first in MENA to set an economy-wide reduction in emissions by 2030, as part of its second Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The country has a demonstrable track record on progressive climate initiatives across all key sectors, including energy, industry, and agriculture. Today's agreement with the UK focuses on facilitating the exchange of information on policies, programmes, regulations, and business models that support joint efforts on climate action. It will also better enable research and development, promote investments and the adoption of technology, and support private sector collaboration as well as assist with coordination and cooperation on development and humanitarian activities.

""The Kingdom's announcement, in line with the 2015 Paris agreement, follows similar pledges by the UAE and Saudi Arabia,"" said Gulf News in an editorial on Tuesday. The United Nations' weather agency on Monday warned that greenhouse gas concentrations ""hit a record last year"" and the world is ""way off track"" on climate goals, according to a Reuters report. Petteri Taalas, Secretary-General the UN's World Meteorological Organisation said in the report that carbon dioxide levels ""surged to 413.2 parts per million in 2020, rising more than the average rate over the last decade despite a temporary dip in emissions during Covid-19 lockdowns."" ""The spike in the carbon dioxide levels mean that the planet's temperature will rise much higher than the 1.5 degrees Celsius maximum target set by the Paris Agreement."" ""We need to revisit our industrial, energy and transport systems and whole way of life,"" Taalas said, calling for ""dramatic increase"" in pledges to help reduce global warming at the upcoming COP26 conference.

The shortage could also hinder production of other electronic products, such as washing machines and smartphones which rely on semiconductor chips. It remains too early to know when normal deliveries of chips will resume, he added, telling the BBC, ""I cannot give you a date. This new variant could add pressure to that, so how well we react is going to be crucial."" The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 caused many factories to close, leading to a backlog in semiconductor chip production, which was then exacerbated by soaring demand, with people working from home requiring laptops and tablets. ""We have a semiconductor shortage as an industry, and how we recover from that is critical,"" Uchida added. Besides Uchida's comments, Nissan has announced that its vehicle electrification strategy includes the proposed introduction of 23 electrified models by 2030, along with a goal of having electric vehicles account for 75 percent of its European sales by 2026. Earlier this year, Nissan announced an investment of \£31 billion in its Sunderland plant in the UK, to develop it as a hub for electric vehicle production. However, its goals for China and the U.S. are far less ambitious, planning on 40 percent of its sales in China to be electric or hybrid by 2026, while it only expects to hit that same percentages in the U.S. by 2030. However, at the recent COP26 climate summit in Scotland, Nissan, along with Toyota, Volkswagen and BMW, refused to join Ford and Volvo in pledging to phase out petroleum-fueled vehicles by 2040. Nissan is also investing more in developing solid state batteries, which are expected to more efficient than lithium-ion batteries, the current industry standard. \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE139","Why Start-ups Should Be Setting Up With Sustainability at the Heart","February 23, 2022","HealthMagazine.ae","Print Start-up businesses are the heartbeat and future of our planet, and they therefore, must play a key role in creating sustainable businesses of the future. To elaborate more, UK TV personality and founder of sustainability platform &lsquo;Buy Smarter Buy Greener&rsquo; Kate Hardcastle MBE discusses the way forward in sustainability and small businesses. Why it matters According to Hardcastle, at a time when our planet had some time to recover due to less travel during COVID-19, the leaders of the world came together for COP26 and the big brands are making their pledges to do more and be better &ndash; with net zero, reducing waste, recycling and reusing, all high on the agenda. &ldquo;It matters to our consumers more than ever too, COVID-19 has subtly, but significantly shifted consumer awareness of the relationship with the spaces in which we live, accelerating demand for living a more sustainable life,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Over the last 18 months, consumers have spent more time outdoors and in many cases had more time on their hands to appreciate our planet with 39 percent of shoppers saying they will have a more environmentally friendly mindset when out shopping as a result of COVID-19.&rdquo; Where to begin When we talk about sustainability, it&rsquo;s important to look at what is realistic to a business owner? &ldquo;We know that it&rsquo;s impossible to be one hundred percent green and sustainable all of the time, so it&rsquo;s essential to look at what is realistic for you and your business &ndash; what quick switches, ideas, and changes could you implement to make a difference?&rdquo; she asks. &ldquo;Small steps make big changes. As a start-up business of 2021 and beyond, it is our duty to create a business which is mindful of our planet, reducing the impact, and in an ideal world, being self-sufficient.&rdquo; Here are some areas to consider when starting your business Create a green culture from day one &ndash; setting out your green agenda and objectives at the same time as creating your business plan is essential &ndash; sustainability should be at the heart of your business. Think about how you could help your staff, your community, and those around you to be green, too&ndash; could you set up a &lsquo;green team&rsquo; or allocate a &lsquo;green champion&rsquo;? Empower staff to make important decisions and introduce new initiatives that will encourage all staff and customers to make more sustainable choices. Reducing your carbon footprint &ndash; many large companies have set future goals to reduce their carbon emissions and become net zero &ndash; as a startup business, how can you build this into your business plan from the word go? Think about your forecasted emissions, how could you minimize or reduce them? Look at your consumption of energy and water, can you install heat pumps or solar panels to generate your own energy from the beginning? If you can&rsquo;t avoid or reduce certain elements of energy usage, look into carbon offsetting schemes whilst you find a way to reduce your emissions further. Packaging &ndash; think about how your products are packages and distributed to your customers. What type of materials are you using to send your products out to customers? Can you reduce the amount of packaging used or reduce the amount of single use plastics used in the process? Product sourcing &ndash; take a look at the products you will use to run your business, whether this is the materials used to make your products or the tools and machinery needed in the process &ndash; can you reduce plastic usage or use recycled materials? Challenging your supply chain &ndash; take a look at your suppliers green credentials to make sure they align with your sustainable values or even simply asking them if they can source a more environmentally friendly solution for you can make a big difference. Wastage and recycling &ndash; whilst we appreciate that this probably isn&rsquo;t the most appealing job to on your to do list, reviewing your waste is an effective way to understand exactly what your business is using and what is being thrown away &ndash; as a start-up business, take a look at your forecasted wastage &ndash; how can you reduce, reuse, and recycle more in your processes? Behind the scenes &ndash; when setting up a business, there are many behind the scenes tasks that can be tackled with a green focus from day one &ndash; from the cleaning products you use to the energy consumed and even the pens in your stationery cupboard. Having a holistic approach to creating a sustainable business will help embed your green plan and cement it at the heart of the business. Consider ways to help your customers make sustainable choices &ndash; how can you help them to come on the green journey, too? Can you help them live every day in a more sustainable way? Can you educate them on how your products or services are reducing the impact on our planet? Can you give them tips or ideas to be more sustainable? Collaboration is key &ndash; we simply can&rsquo;t work alone to reduce our impact on the planet &ndash; how can you work with others to make a difference? Can you make a collective effort to reduce waste or recycle more? Can you create a green charter for the businesses around you to sign up to? Together, we can make an impact and doing so from day one in a start-up business gives the upper hand and keeps sustainability at the forefront. H \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE140","Raising the bar for sustainable mountain tourism","December 9, 2021 Thursday","ArabianBusiness.com","Global cooperation has been a big takeaway from climate events such as Cop26 and the Saudi Green Initiative Forum. It's clear that climate action can only be achieved through multilateral collaboration and sharing knowledge, ideas, and expertise with other like-minded peers. As a fragile mountain ecosystem that's home to thousands of wild animals, migratory birds, lavender fields, juniper trees and local communities rich in culture and heritage, protecting this environment and its inhabitants is paramount. Partnerships must be strengthened to raise awareness and promote sustainable mountain development. Humans have lived and thrived at high altitudes for thousands of years. Traces of human occupation in what we now call Soudah and parts of Rijal Almaa stretch back several millenniums; scientists have found rock inscriptions that they believe could be between 5,000 and 6,000-years-old. Desert Rock mountain resort unveiled to support Saudi tourism ambitions While mountains have served as a place of human settlement for time immemorial, protecting these dynamic yet vulnerable ecosystems have only taken root in last few decades. In 1992, heads of state convened at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro and signed a plan for action called Agenda 21. Chapter 13 is entitled 'Managing Fragile Ecosystems: Sustainable Mountain Development'. This chapter launched a slow but steady process where awareness and understanding of the global importance of mountains, the vulnerability of their ecosystems and the need to protect local communities increased. It was a watershed moment. And it led to the creation of today's Mountain Partnership \- a global alliance of more than 400 members. Steered by the United Nations' Food and Agricultural Organisation, the Mountain Partnership is a vibrant voluntary alliance of governments and organisations committed to working together with the common goal of achieving sustainable mountain development. By tapping the wealth and diversity of knowledge, information, and expertise of global membership, it stimulates concrete initiatives at all levels to address threats, improve quality of life and sustain healthy environments in the world's mountain regions. Partnerships must be strengthened to raise awareness and promote sustainable mountain development. At Cop26 , this organisation came together to promote the benefits of low-impact tourism and its contribution to the conservation and valorization of mountain ecosystems and their biodiversity. Helping local communities bounce back and recover from the Covid-19 pandemic can be driven by sustainable tourism. Natural resource management and climate adaption in mountain regions are issues we at Soudah Development care deeply about. Located in the southwest of Saudi Arabia on the kingdom's highest mountains, our destination is covered in green highlands, cloud-piercing clifftops and an extraordinary array of flora and fauna. Here, you can spot striped hyenas, Indian crested porcupines, native Arabian wolves, the Arabian red fox, wild cats, and the Asian garden mouse. High up on the mountaintop you may even be able to see the steppe eagle soaring across the sky or maybe a griffon vulture gliding through the air. You may spot the endangered Asir magpie. As you take one of the many serpentine hiking paths through the juniper-clad valleys, you will discover the rich culture and heritage of Soudah and parts of Rijal Almaa. It offers a chance to experience, traditional folk music, poetry, fashion. Visitors can bask in the authentic charm of the flowerman festival where locals don crowns made from vibrant flowers and grass rich in the aroma of lavender and marjoram. As you continue down these hiking trails, visitors often replenish themselves on the coffee, mountain strawberries, honey and locally caught fish (it is, after all, just 80km as the crow flies to the coastal town of Al Qahma on the Red Sea). As a business, we were established to drive the transformation of Soudah and parts of Rijal Almaa in the Asir region by creating a luxury mountain tourism destination. Sustainability is a guiding principle for everything we do. Soudah Development is committed to protecting the region's natural beauty, biodiversity, and wildlife. We are committed to protecting the region's natural beauty, biodiversity, and wildlife. Our masterplan, which we hope to launch next year, utilises only 20 of the 627 square kilometers of the project's total land area. This is part of our efforts to promote environmental integrity and protect natural resources. As part of this commitment, we recently became the first real estate developer in the Gulf to join the Mountain Partnership. We have previously spoken about setting new benchmarks in sustainability and our membership of this alliance is a demonstration that we stick to our word. It is the first of many environmental and sustainability-focused partnerships we will join to promote sustainable mountain development, empower local communities, combat climate change, and encourage low-impact tourism. We aspire to the raise the bar for sustainable mountain tourism in the region and work with partners around the world to do so.

We are fortunate here in the UAE to have taken a progressive leadership role in handling the pandemic to the point where we now operate in one of the most normal environments I have experienced. Whilst safety and medical care procedures, free vaccination, testing and digital data availability via next-level applications like Al Hosn remain at the forefront of our minds, the UAE is shoulder to shoulder with the best in the world. Face to face conferences have been back for some time, video calls have become optional yet again and major events such as Expo2020 Dubai have been operating without fuss, showcasing to the world what normal looks like from here on in. Janssens: hoping for a sustainable future COP26 , the UN climate change conference, was followed by Adipec the world's most influential meeting place for the oil and gas industry. With decarbonisation and energy transition very much on the industry agenda, where can we make genuine changes for the immediate future without negatively impacting business? This is the issue on every business leader's mind today. In fact I wondered if it was possible to apply learnings from an inclusive workplace discussion I had chance to catch at Adipec to improve the ESG arena. There are three key themes to consider: LEADERSHIP BEHAVIOUR Do we as leaders genuinely care about sustainability? I am heavily invested in industrial processes and infrastructure which lend themselves very well to this kind of thinking. On the other hand, I am also a father and have a deep responsibility to advocate for positive change for the next generations to come. Our company motto is ""measure the facts"" and, in terms of sustainability, we play a role in helping our customers in precise measurement across their operations so they can optimise and make informed decisions around reducing, reusing and recycling resources. Part of our engineering and process advisory role is in understanding issues and recommending efficient solutions, through which we continue to play a small but growing part in the incremental changes underway. A company like Krohne is upping its efforts to hold our supply chain as accountable as we are in responsible environmental, sustainable and governance-related choices. Our most recent Sustainability Report points to our ongoing efforts in this area, as we are well aware of our role place in the sustainability chain to make a positive change. FOCUS ON LIVED EXPERIENCE By bringing to life the small, subtle changes around the office and our global operations we can make a difference. While we are fortunate to be regionally headquartered in a forward-looking society such as the UAE, we need to bring greener ways of working to life around the office too. Can we use less water and electricity in our everyday operations? Local GCC companies such as Dewa, ADDC, SWCC, Neom, are strong educators in this space and provide excellent case studies and proof points. It is through alchemical public-private partnership that we can combine vision and investment with expertise in innovative measurement and process optimisations solutions. The end results are greater than the sum of their parts, offering exponential positive outcomes that will likely achieve far more than was originally intended. The important thing is to bring the vision to life and showcase the benefits. BE THE MOST SUSTAINABLE Beyond workplace behaviours, this final thought can be applied across every part of our lives - do you make greener choices where you can? Most buildings and communities in the UAE offer some level of recycling facility but do we make full use of this? Where we have buildings with huge windows and natural light streaming in, are we turning off our electric lights? What do we do with our plastic Pet bottles? The choices are there to be made and they can be increasingly complicated. The decision to purchase a fully electric car over a traditional combustion engine or hybrid vehicle opens a discussion around battery technology and product lifecycle overall, when perhaps not owning a vehicle at all is the ""greener"" option for your family and the topic rolls on. As a final reflective takeaway I would ask: Does our behaviour and our consequent choices reflect this pearl of wisdom? ""It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities."" - Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, J.K. Rowling At Krohne every day we try to make the right choices both in the context of our legacy and in our ongoing mission to equip our partners with the very best innovations in measurement technology to make the right decisions for a better tomorrow.  \"

As part of its immersive and application-based MBA experience, students learned about Dubai&rsquo;s healthcare industry through applying Action Learning problem-solving approaches and frameworks gained during their MBA to address a pressing real-world challenge faced by VPS Healthcare as well as healthcare groups all over the world &ndash; climate change. During the 5-hour hackathon, groups of students ideated and presented solutions for how VPS Healthcare can include climate-informed assessments into healthcare decision-making and health policies to meet the needs of patients today and in the future. The students, hailing from 19 different countries, had the opportunity to immerse themselves in the city of Dubai as part of a longer 4-day Dubai trek that included visiting the Dubai World Expo and interactions with corporate partners to understand how Dubai has transformed itself from its reliance on oil, which used to account for 50 percent of GDP, into a global trade and tourism destination with over 95 percent of GDP coming from non-oil industries. This includes healthcare and medical tourism, which has grown into one of Dubai&rsquo;s top sectors, thanks to a rapidly growing urban population as well as a high influx of medical tourists who trust Dubai&rsquo;s high-tech facilities to receive treatment. Yet the rise in this sector poses a unique challenge: in carrying out its healing mission, the healthcare sector needs to factor in challenges that will become increasingly hard to ignore, including increased fatalities and injuries due to extreme weather events and a rise in chronic health conditions like asthma, infectious diseases, and mental illness. At the recent United Nations&rsquo; Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, 45 countries including the United Arab Emirates committed to transforming their health systems to be less carbon emitting and more environmentally sustainable. Recognizing the key role that they play as one of the UAE&rsquo;s leading healthcare groups, VPS Healthcare collaborated with the ASB to host this hackathon that would enable the organization to source fresh new thinking and innovative solutions to this enormous challenge. &ldquo;The partnership between VPS Healthcare and Asia School of Business represents our commitment towards addressing what experts are calling one of the greatest public health threats of our time,&rdquo; said Dr. Shamsheer Vayalil, Founder and Chairman of VPS Healthcare. &ldquo;We believe it will take collective effort globally to mitigate and address the climate risks we face today. The MBA students of the first-ever VPS Healthcare-ASB Climate Change Hackathon proposed a number of &lsquo;hacks&rsquo; that can help create resilient and sustainable solutions for the mission-driven health systems like VPS Healthcare, and impact the health of patients and communities they live in. The evaluation criteria for the winning &lsquo;hacks&rsquo; considered the applicability of the solutions and the novelty of the ideas. Solutions identified include AI-based predictive analytics combining patient data with meteorological data and other historical data to inform capacity planning, and a real-time carbon tracking dashboard using procurement and planning data to simulate the impact of a new project or policy. &ldquo;As an industry leader within a region that is rapidly ascending to global prominence, VPS Healthcare wants to be front and center in finding solutions for the challenges posed by climate change and believe that the solutions presented by the students will help us formulate climate change&ndash;driven procedures and integrate them into policies with a sense of urgency&rdquo; added Dr. Vayalil. &ldquo;At the same time, we also want to see how we can reduce our carbon footprint and implement environmentally conscious policies, as we want to do our part in leading the way towards a more sustainable manner of delivering outstanding healthcare.&rdquo; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re extremely grateful to be able to partner with a world-class company like VPS Healthcare to address such an important challenge while providing our students with a rich, international learning experience, especially during these volatile pandemic times.

Dr. Al Jaber made the invitation when he delivered the UAE's National Statement to the 26th session of the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow. He conveyed to delegates warm greetings from the leadership, government and people of the UAE, as the country focuses on building international cooperation, and developing valuable partnerships to advance global progress, in the same spirit in which the UAE has welcomed the world to Expo 2020 Dubai - 'connecting minds, creating the future'. Dr. Al Jaber also expressed sincere gratitude towards the Asia Pacific Group of nations for their endorsement of the UAE's bid to host COP28 in 2023. He told COP26 delegates, ""We are proud to have been endorsed as the hosts of COP28 by the Asia Pacific Group of nations. I would also like to pay tributes to all partners and friends backing our nation's bid. We look forward to upcoming sessions and discussions with the aim of securing international support for our offer to be confirmed as the host of COP28 by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The UAE is honoured to welcome all parties to work on developing an ambitious agenda for COP28 in 2023 that will accelerate the development of practical solutions and make crucial progress on climate action"". Dr. Al Jaber highlighted the UAE's expertise in climate action, its focus on sustainable growth, and its capabilities and potential for hosting the world's largest and most important international climate change event. He said, ""Our nation's Founding Father, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, set out the principles of sustainability in all sectors. These principles have been integral to our nation's efforts in protecting the environment, diversifying energy sources, and developing policies to reduce the impact of climate change. The effects of climate change transcend borders, and are relevant to all nations, small or large, developed or developing, rich or poor."" The visionary UAE leadership views climate action as an opportunity for sustainable economic and social growth, and this drives the country's climate strategy. Dr. Al Jaber said that global climate action must address the different needs of all stakeholders. He told delegates, ""We should avoid a one-size-fits-all approach."" He said the UAE has entered a new era of transition in the energy sector. ""We view this as an opportunity to focus on new paths towards the future. We believe that investing in low-carbon solutions in the energy sector will drive economic prosperity. Launched last October, the UAE 'Net Zero by 2050' Strategic Initiative reflects the vision of our leadership and the ambitions we have outlined for the 'Next 50' years of our nation. It is also an open call from the UAE to the world for partnership and cooperation to find sustainable solutions, while creating incentives for economic growth."" The UAE has pledged to make climate security a priority when it joins the UN Security Council in 2023. Fulfilling the US$100 billion pledge by developed nations to support climate action in developing countries will play a vital role in mitigating and adapting to the impacts of climate change. In addition, there is a strong need to create an investment ecosystem to support sustainable growth. At COP26 Further, the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for Climate) - a major new initiative led by the UAE and United States (US) with the support of over 30 governments - was also officially launched. AIM for Climate announced an ""early harvest"" of US$4 billion of increased investment to accelerate innovation for climate-smart agriculture and food systems over the next five years. The UAE has pledged US$1 billion of increased investment as part of this initiative, which aims to increase and accelerate agricultural and food systems innovation in support of climate action. The UAE also joined the Global Methane Pledge building on its position as one of the least methane intense nations in the world. Over five decades, the country has successfully reduced the volume of natural gas flared in the domestic energy sector by more than 90 percent. In turn, the UAE's hydrocarbon industry today holds one of the world's lowest methane intensities of 0.01 percent. The UAE will build on this foundation of ultra-low methane intensity in the energy sector to further improve its methane performance. The UAE, represented by the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure (MOEI) also announced the Hydrogen Leadership Roadmap, a comprehensive national blueprint to support domestic, low-carbon industries, contribute to the country's net-zero ambition and establish the country as a competitive exporter of hydrogen. The UAE has an outstanding experience and impressive record in climate action, which helps establishing an efficient ecosystem that comprised all the elements necessary to scale innovation in this area, including capital, research and development, technology and project implementation and operation. The UAE has invested over $17 billion in clean energy projects in six continents around the world. The UAE focuses on accelerating progress in the development of clean, scalable and commercially viable solutions and techniques, improving the efficiency of resource management and advancing progress towards food and water security. Today, the UAE is home to three of the largest and lowest cost solar power plants in the world, and has built the first large-scale carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) facilities in the region. As well as being the first country to deploy zero emission nuclear energy to its grid - and a pioneer in new Net Zero energies such as hydrogen. \"

Frank Janssens, Vice President, KROHNE Middle East and Africa Amidst Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week, it seems an apt time to reflect a little on decarbonisation and the broader ESG dialogue. Whilst safety and medical care procedures, free vaccination, testing and digital data availability via next-level applications like Al Hosn remain at the forefront of our minds, the UAE is shoulder to shoulder with the best in the world. Face to face conferences have been back for some time, video calls have become optional yet again and major events such as Expo2020 Dubai have been operating without fuss, showcasing to the world what normal looks like from here on in. COP26 , the UN climate change conference, was followed by ADIPEC the world's most influential meeting place for the oil and gas industry. With decarbonisation and energy transition very much on the industry agenda, where can we make genuine changes for the immediate future without negatively impacting business? This is the issue on every business leader's mind today. In fact, I wondered if it was possible to apply learnings from an inclusive workplace discussion and I had chance to catch at ADIPEC to improve the ESG arena. There are three key themes to consider: Leadership behaviour Do we as leaders genuinely care about sustainability? I am heavily invested in industrial processes and infrastructure which lend themselves very well to this kind of thinking. On the other hand, I am also a father and have a deep responsibility to advocate for positive change for the next generations to come. Our company mottos are ""measure the facts"" and, in terms of sustainability, we play a role in helping our customers in precise measurement across their operations so they can optimise and make informed decisions around reducing, reusing and recycling resources. Part of our engineering and process advisory role is in understanding issues and recommending efficient solutions, through which we continue to play a small but growing part in the incremental changes underway. HYPERLINK https://krohne.com/en/company/group/quality-health-and-safety-and-environment https://krohne.com/en/company/group/quality-health-and-safety-and-environment ) points to our ongoing efforts in this area, as we are well aware of our role place in the sustainability chain to make a positive change. Focus on the lived experience By bringing to life the small, subtle changes around the office and our global operations we can make a difference. While we are fortunate to be regionally headquartered in a forward-looking society such as the UAE, we need to bring greener ways of working to life around the office too. Can we use less water and electricity in our everyday operations? Local GCC companies such as DEWA, ADDC, SWCC, NEOM, are strong educators in this space and provide excellent case studies and proofpoints. It is through alchemical public-private partnership that we can combine vision and investment with expertise in innovative measurement and process optimisations solutions. The end results are greater than the sum of their parts, offering exponential positive outcomes that will likely achieve far more than was originally intended. The important thing is to bring the vision to life and showcase the benefits. Be the most sustainable person you can be Beyond workplace behaviours, this final thought can be applied across every part of our lives \- do you make greener choices where you can? Most buildings and communities in the UAE offer some level of recycling facility but do we make full use of this? Where we have buildings with huge windows and natural light streaming in, are we turning off our electric lights? What do we do with our plastic PET bottles? The choices are there to be made and they can be increasingly complicated. The decision to purchase a fully electric car over a traditional combustion engine or hybrid vehicle opens a discussion around battery technology and product lifecycle overall, when perhaps not owning a vehicle at all is the ""greener"" option for your family and the topic rolls on. As a final reflective takeaway I would ask: Does our behaviour and our consequent choices reflect this pearl of wisdom? \"

The agreement was brokered by the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which hosted a signing ceremony at Expo 2020 Dubai, with the participation of Emirates Development Bank chairman Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber and U.S. Climate Envoy John Kerry. The agreement was reportedly first discussed in September, during a meeting between Energy Minister Karine Elharrar and Mohamed Al Khaja, UAE Ambassador to Israel. It will see Jordan obtain water from an Israeli plant along the Mediterranean coast, while Israel receives solar power from the Jordan-based facility, which will be constructed by an Emirati firm. The agreement is also the latest outcome of last year's Abraham Peace Accords signed by Israel and the UAE, which was brokered by the Trump administration. The Biden administration, while stressing the accords are not a replacement for Israeli-Palestinian peace, also pledged to support related agreements. Last month, Elharrar met with Jordan Water and Irrigation Minister Mohammed Al-Najjar to sign a separate agreement to double the amount of water Israel supplies to Jordan. The agreement was the ""most significant"" since the former enemies signed a peace treaty in 1994, Elharrar said. Jordan, which has publicly downplayed its ties with Israel for many years, has not commented on the agreement. Jordan is one of the world's most water-deficient countries, while Israel is also hot and dry, but its advanced desalination technology has created opportunities for selling water. Feasibility studies for the project will begin next year. The Israel-Jordan agreement should have been signed at the start of the month during the COP26 Climate Summit in Glasgow, but Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett delayed the announcement due to concerns the deal would be criticized by the political opposition, according to the Walla news site. \"

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE154","Time to stop unnecessary deaths from air pollution","October 20, 2021 Wednesday","ArabianBusiness.com","Tom Day, co-founder of AirZones. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), ambient air pollution accounts for an estimated 4.2 million deaths per year due to a variety of diseases caused or exacerbated by the air we breathe. Add in other types of air pollution and the WHO estimates it causes around 7 million deaths per year. Statistics from the Thomson Reuters Foundation reveal air pollution kills 800 people every hour - 13 every minute. That's more than three times the number of people who die every year of malaria, tuberculosis, and AIDS combined. Air pollution is now the fourth leading cause of death. Clearly, more must be done. After the recent launch of new WHO Global Air Quality Guidelines, there is now updated evidence underlining the damage air pollution causes to human health, at even lower concentrations than previously understood. ""Today, as many as nine out of ten people breathe polluted air, leading to some 7 million premature deaths each year, of whom 600,000 are children. Unless we act decisively, this number could double by 2050,"" UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres (pictured below) said recently. And while the guidelines are simply that - they are not legally binding \- they are based on sound scientific evidence. Since the last guidelines, issued in 2005, there have been major advances in science and data collection. Understanding of the health effects of air pollution are even clearer now \- and it's clear that lower levels of air pollution must be achieved to protect public health worldwide. Dr Maria Neira, director of Environment, Climate Change and Health at the WHO says no government has the excuse to say 'we didn't know' the evidence is clear now. And if current suggested levels of pollution in the 2021 guidelines had been achieved just five years ago, the WHO suggests almost 3.3 million deaths attributed to ambient air pollution could have been prevented. Dr Neira (pictured below) also points out that air pollution causes a raft of non-communicable diseases (such as cancers and heart diseases); respiratory diseases and infections; pre-term births and a number of other causes of death in children and infants. Deaths that could be avoided if more attention was given to air pollution reduction. And of course, reduction of air pollution also leads to a reduction in the harmful pollutants that contribute to climate change. A key part of the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) of world leaders in Glasgow, Scotland, is the protection of human health. The health benefits gained by reducing climate change are mainly gained from the reduction of air pollution. The WHO is of course lobbying hard ahead of COP26 , with recent news reports saying the public health benefits of ambitious climate actions far outweigh the costs. There is also the huge economic burden on health care provision, not to mention lost productivity in the workplace due to air pollution-related issues. The new WHO guidelines call for a much greater reduction in the exposure levels for most pollutants, (including particulate matter - mainly from vehicles and burning fossil fuels; nitrogen dioxide - from vehicles; and ground-level ozone - caused by vehicles and industry) and are clearly designed with a simple goal: to protect people's lives. In 2013, outdoor air pollution and particulate matter were classified as carcinogenic by WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). To address air pollution and climate change, governments, public bodies and organisations need to urgently design more effective methods to protect people from the ravages of air pollution. \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE155","Saqr Ghobash participates in advisory meeting of heads of IPU geopolitical groups","November 21, 2021 Sunday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","ABU DHABI, 21st November, 2021 (WAM) -- Saqr Ghobash, Speaker of the Federal National Council (FNC) and President of the Arab Inter-Parliamentary Union, has said that the strategy of the Inter-Parliamentary Union for 2022-2026 should prioritise the international issues of climate change and empowering women and youth. He made this statement during his participation in the virtual advisory meeting of heads of geopolitical groups in the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), which was attended by Dr. Omar Al Nuaimi, Secretary-General of the FNC, and Afraa Al Busti, Assistant Secretary-General for Parliamentary Communication. The meeting's agenda included five main items, including consultations on the new Inter-Parliamentary Union strategy for 2022-2026, mechanism for electing presidents and vice-presidents of standing committees, consultations on upcoming Inter-Parliamentary Union meetings, the financial obligations of states, and the formation of the board of the Cremer-Passy Inter-Parliamentary Union Award. Commenting on the strategy, Ghobash stressed that the Arab group supports the fundamental values of the strategy, especially those related to equality, transparency, integrity, joint interests and promoting patriotism, noting that such values are integral foundations of parliamentary action. He also affirmed the importance of considering diversity in terms of nationality and religion etc. He explained the second strategic goal, which involves the inclusion of all segments of the community within the parliament. Under this context, Ghobash noted the importance of setting goals with set deadlines, stressing that all less-represented segments, most notably women and youth, should be empowered within the set deadlines. He also spoke about the experience of the UAE, which has established goals in phases, noting that within the planned phase, women's representation in the country's parliament accounted for 50 percent. The Inter-Parliamentary Union should prioritise climate change in the upcoming period, he suggested, stressing the importance of a common international will to integrate parliamentary action with government action. He also discussed the importance of capitalising on the outcomes of COP26 in Glasgow to achieve further progress in the two upcoming conferences, which are set to take place in Egypt and the UAE. \"

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE157","Biden's ""America is back,"" a call for new Cold War","December 8, 2021 Wednesday","Big News Network.com","On Wednesday and Thursday of this week, U.S. President Joe Biden will host a virtual ""Summit for Democracy."" The gathering will bring together leaders from 110 countries who work in government, civil society, and the private sector, with the officially declared purpose of developing an agenda to renew democratic government and keep democracy's ideals strong. (The guest list includes Pakistan, Ukraine, and Brazil.) As authoritarianism grows around the world, including in the U.S., the administration says it seeks practical ideas and strong alliances against its spread. But how to square this high-sounding project when just a few months ago ""America is back"" was President Biden's mantra as he met with the Group of Seven in Cornwall, NATO allies in Brussels, and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva? Biden earned widespread praise for leading a return to normality after Donald Trump's reign of error. The question is, though, what is normality, and ""America is back"" for what? Biden's emphasis in the European meetings was bolstering NATO allies for a new global face-off with Russia-and increasingly China. Despite existential threats posed by catastrophic climate change (which Biden and other world leaders inadequately addressed at COP26 ) and an ongoing global pandemic, Biden's new normal seems ominously leaning to a revival of Cold War politics. ""We are committed to the rules-based international order,"" concludes the final communiqu from the June NATO meetings, but ""Russia's aggressive actions constitute a threat to Euro-Atlantic security China's growing influence and international policies can present challenges that we need to address together as an alliance."" Much of the NATO plan addressed bolstering the alliance's growing military capabilities on the Russian borders, and NATO for the first time also designated China as a ""systemic challenge."" As the Democracy Summit convenes, old Cold War tropes are indeed being recycled. In a rare joint op-ed article, China and Russia's ambassadors to the U.S. depict the summit as ""[a]n evident product of its Cold War mentality, [which] will stoke up ideological confrontation and a rift in the world, creating new 'dividing lines.'"" In the United States' narrative that is described in the Chinese and Russian ambassadors' warning, the world is divided between democratic and authoritarian nations. The U.S. has never ceased to paint the latter as repressive and rapacious, threatening their neighbors and working to disrupt a presumably benign rules-based order. China is the new ""number one pacing challenge,"" as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin put it in March, with Russia relegated to second place. It is vital, the United States insists, that it and its NATO allies invest to maintain superiority in every domain of warfare-land, air, sea, space, and cyber-and in every region from the borders of Russia to the Great China Sea. In a Washington addled by bitter partisan divides, the call to meet the threat posed by China and Russia forges bipartisan consensus. Right-wing Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas wrote in a February report titled ""Beat China"" that he sees the Asian country as the new Soviet Union: ""Once again, America confronts a powerful totalitarian adversary that seeks to dominate Eurasia and remake the world order."" As during the Cold War with the USSR, with China, the threat abroad is being used to justify action at home. When it comes to investing in the American people, Republicans such as Cotton see big government as evil and industrial policy as creeping socialism when it comes to foreign policy, they eagerly join the call for updating ""America's long-term economic, industrial and technological efforts to reflect the growing threat posed by Communist China."" The same GOP senators who couldn't bring themselves to back an investigation into the sacking of the Capitol rush to support research and development when framed as addressing threats posed by Chinese investments. While dangerous, a Cold War face-off between democracies and authoritarian states, anchored by China and Russia, is the establishment's sweet spot. The powerful military-industrial security interests gain renewed importance. The tremendously bloated Pentagon budget continues without question as it presumably gears up for new deployments, and a new array of weapons to counter growing Chinese assertiveness. NATO gets a revived mission. A bipartisan center can be reestablished, with bickering about tactics and spending anchored by an agreement on mission. The costs of going back to the Cold War are immense, however. While Senator Bernie Sanders praised Biden in June for recognizing authoritarianism as a ""major threat to democracy,"" he wisely cautioned that ""[t]he primary conflict is taking place not between countries but within them And if democracy is going to win out, it will do so not on a traditional battlefield but by demonstrating that democracy can actually deliver a better quality of life for people than authoritarianism can."" It also deeply distorts the real security threats America faces. This summer, as the impacts of extreme weather exacted an ever-greater toll on American lives and resources, it became increasingly difficult to pretend that climate change is only a distant threat. No progress can be made without China, which now leads the world in fossil fuel emissions and at COP26 pledged to cut them to net zero by 2060. Climate can no longer be relegated to a rhetorical statement of concern at the end of documents focused on military buildups and great power conflicts in peripheral countries. A renewed Cold War will reinforce the nationalist and militarist factions in all countries. More than a year after Trump left the presidential office and social media platform from which he could amplify his lies about China and COVID-19, the fearmongering he fueled continues to contribute to a rise of hate crimes against Asian Americans in the United States. This is but one of many aspects of how the deep fractures within the country will make revitalizing its democracy even more difficult. Before America chose to lead any kind of ""Summit for Democracy,"" and before ""America is back"" to a new Cold War, the country urgently needs a more serious discussion about its real security priorities-and the real challenges it faces.

The country is the world's eighth largest emitter of CO2, yet it is one of the few countries not to ratify the Paris pact. Neighbour Turkey became the last G20 country to ratify the agreement in October. The official, Ali Salajegheh, reportedly said that sanctions were impeding Iran in areas like renewable energy. The Iranians have seen an collapse in overseas investment in their renewable energy sector in the face of US sanctions. Iran's president Ebrahim Raisi decided not to attend the ongoing UN climate change summit, COP26 , in Glasgow, but the country sent a team to plead for relief from the economic blockade caused by Washington's sanctions. ""Iran has been impacted by climate change like every other place in the world,"" Salajegheh was quoted as saying. ""This has reduced our rainfall per annum and also the inflow of water into our rivers has reduced by 40% [and] this has affected our agriculture and affected our industrial and drinking water."" On the issue of the Paris climate agreement, Salajegheh was cited as saying the pact had to be a ""two-way street."" ""When you have oppressive sanctions in force it does not allow for any kind of imports even medicine which is a human fundamental right,"" he said. ""If the sanctions are removed, then we have a commitment towards the international community, it is at that time that they can transfer modern technology and finance to us especially in the area of renewable energy so we can modernise our deteriorating infrastructure,"" he told BBC News.

This year, those speeches have an added element of importance, with two critical and pressing issues dominating the annual session, issues that affect us all now, Gulf News wrote in its today's editorial. In six weeks' time, Cop26 takes place in Glasgow. ""The gathering is our last best chance to commit to policies that can at least partially reverse the dramatic global warming that is affecting how we live on this planet. The decisions made there will determine the future course of our planet with significant and serious ramifications for ourselves, our children and future generations. ""As leader after leader noted during the speeches to the General Assembly, there is no more time left, we need real action on climate change, we need nations to live up to their words to reverse climate damage, we need all to focus on reducing carbon emissions so our Earth can at least cope if never heal from the damage we have inflicted upon it,"" the paper further noted. US President Joe Biden has committed his nation to double its financial pledge to help poorer nations recover from climate change. At least $100 billion is needed, and Cop26 will need to firm up those numbers by early November. ""But the fight against climate change is about far more than money. It is about making changes that are meaningful, cutting emissions, changing the way we live, changing the planet for the better. And those are changes that every leader and nation at the General Assembly must commit to. Even China has committed to ending the development of coal plants overseas,"" the Dubai-based English language newspaper went on to say. As pressing as climate change is, so too is coronavirus, the paper noted, adding, ""These past 20 months have shown us that mass vaccinations offer the best way forward, allowing people to largely resume life resembling normality once jabbed against the virus."" ""Just as with the climate, inequality remains a pressing issue. The reality of the vaccines' roll-out is that wealthier nations have produced and acquired far more doses of vaccines than poorer ones. Europeans are more than 70 per cent fully vaccinated, Africans only 3 per cent. That is a disparity that is unconscionable. Simply put, vaccines must be shared as a matter of criticality. World leaders must commit to greater vaccine equality as a matter of urgency. Yes, vaccines and climate,"" the editorial concluded. \"

In fact, the Irish Times reported, Ring said he thought he was at a Green Party meeting after hearing Tnaiste Leo Varadkar and others discuss the climate action plans. The Government will release to the public its Climate Action Plan next week, to coincide with the United Nations Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow. The Climate Change Advisory Council has recently prepared carbon budgets aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 51 per cent by 2030. Rural farming is expected to have an emissions reduction target of between 20 and 30 per cent over the next decade. Some members of Fine Gael and Fianna Fil TDs have voiced concern that reducing the nation's cattle herds will be fundamental to reducing emissions. Ring was said to have referred to the ""Dublin-oriented green agenda"" at the meeting. The Irish Times also reported that Minister of State Patrick O'Donovan said those promoting climate-related actions were placing farmers and ranchers on the defensive about how they make their livings.

Spearheaded by the governments of India and the UK, the International Solar Alliance (ISA), India Presidency of the ISA, and the UK COP Presidency unveiled plans for the programme seeking to connect 140 countries to round-the-clock green and renewable power. The announcement was accompanied by the One Sun declaration endorsed by 80 ISA member countries, which stated: &ldquo;Realising the vision of One Sun One World One Grid through interconnected green grids can be transformational, enabling all of us to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement to prevent dangerous climate change, to accelerate the clean energy transition, and to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. These efforts can stimulate green investments and create millions of good jobs. By sharing the sun's energy, we can help to build a more peaceful and prosperous world.&rdquo; The project will be implemented by ISA, in partnership with the World Bank Group, and aims to harness solar energy wherever the sun is shining, ensuring that generated electricity flows to areas that need it most. In doing so, the project aims to reduce reliance on non-renewable energy such as coal by enabling them to purchase affordable solar power from other countries. As the chief agency leading and delivering the project, ISA aims to help mobilise $1 trillion of funding by 2030 to assist developing countries in expanding their solar power grids to meet their energy access, energy security and energy transition needs. The initiative is widely seen as a big and bold move ahead on the ISA's solar transition roadmap and will go some way towards realising its vision for a solar energy future. Speaking at the event, the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi said: &ldquo;One Sun, One World & One Grid will not only reduce storage needs but also enhance the viability of solar projects. This creative initiative will not only reduce carbon footprints and energy cost but also open a new avenue for cooperation between different countries and regions. &ldquo;The One Sun One World One Grid and Green Grids Initiative is an idea whose time has come. If the world has to move to a clean and green future, these interconnected transnational grids are going to be critical solutions.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE164","ESG Developments in the MENA and GCC Region: Look Back 2021 / Look Ahead 2022","March 10, 2022","Law Update (UAE)","Written by: Layla El-Wafi - Senior Legal Counsel - Governance and Middle East, at Standard Chartered Contributions/support from: Francis Patalong, Zane Anani and Leen Masadeh This article will: offer a high-level review of environmental, social and governance (ESG) related legal, policy and transactional developments in the MENA / GCC region in 2021, and anticipate regional trends in ESG that lie ahead in 2022. 2021 In Review: 2021 saw an uptick in sustainable finance transactions from the private and public sectors; numerous ""E"" (environmental) related commitments from some governments in the region with net zero emissions target announcements. The ""S"" (social) and ""G"" (governance) of ESG also saw progress with issuance of data protection laws; regulations on ethical use of technologies like artificial intelligence, and government initiatives related to human rights, diversity and inclusion. Recruitment for new ESG related roles in the private sector were notable especially within advisory, professional, and financial services. 2022 In Preview: Potential for harnessing international momentum on climate change action including taking practical steps on emissions reductions and &lsquo;green economy' transitioning also considering development needs. Continued demand from private sector and governments for sustainable finance including voluntary carbon markets and offset trading. Increased voluntary adherence from the private sector in ESG risk integration (especially financial institutions or ""FI's"") including compliance and reporting according to local, international and/or industry standards and laws to meet net zero targets, gender parity and (to a lesser extent) human rights / supply chain diligence. Some regional regulators enhancing current or announcing new ESG related policies for risk integration and reporting obligations aligning with international regulations (the &lsquo;GDPR Effect') or developing national approaches focused on reducing carbon emissions and gender parity (although strict enforcement will remain absent or unclear). Sustainability related roles and third-party advisory services will continue to be in demand in line with more ESG integration, compliance, certification and reporting obligations (often driven by international FI requirements but increasingly for regional FI regulatory requirements). Introduction An ESG led approach covers a multitude of actions and priorities. It reflects a holistic and systematic method for public institutions and private corporations to consider, plan for, and act sustainably and ethically in relation to people and the natural environment. The &lsquo;ESG buzz' in recent years reflects the escalation of the global warming climate crises and inequities that international and regional commitments have tried to address - notably the Paris Agreement on Climate Action and UN Sustainable Development Goals (""SDGs""). ESG related developments in the Middle East, North Africa (""MENA"") and Gulf Cooperation Council Countries (""GCC"") continued apace in 2021 in line with global developments and trends. Prepare to hear more about ESG in 2022 both in the region and internationally as commitments from regulators and the private sector ramp up to meet the SDGs 2030 deadline and mitigate climate change effects. Over the last year several governments in the MENA / GCC region announced net zero carbon emissions targets[1], enacted personal data and privacy laws[2], and regulators issued guidance on sustainable finance[3], ethical use of enabling technology and outsourcing,[4] required ESG reporting and female board representation for publicly listed companies[5]. The United Arab Emirates (""UAE"") set up a Human Rights Institute[6] with a wide mandate to draft a national human rights action plan and passed a law concerning enhanced accountability of government ministers and officials[7]. Looking ahead the region shows signs to take greater strides in stronger and deeper ESG led practices albeit not uniformly due to the variable socio-economic and security circumstances present in the region. The UAE and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (""KSA"") stand out, with Egypt, Bahrain and Omani authorities also issuing ESG related policies (although enforcement strategies remain absent or unclear). Given the forthcoming UN Climate Summits (COP 27 and 28) will be hosted in the region, ESG related principles will likely gain more prominence, in keeping with international trends and pressures. This may spotlight regional solutions to bridge the challenge of protecting the environment and meeting economic development needs like KSA's Green Initiative endorsing a circular carbon economy and commitment to plant 10 billion trees in KSA and a further 40 billion in the Middle East region[8]. It may also pull forward those countries currently lagging. Given most governments in the region are not encumbered by complex political systems they can mobilize quickly and make up for lost time. These shifting sands need to settle before the new legal and regulatory landscape can be assessed. It is however promising that the three strands of ESG appear to be moving at a broadly similar pace - which is cause for optimism. The legal community are well placed to solve for such challenges together with policy makers, scientists, innovators, investors and financial institutions. Looking Back 2021: Steady Gains There was a succession of regional developments in relation to climate change, sustainable finance, social considerations, and good governance - see table below for a country-by-country overview. The UAE currently stands out positioning itself as the region's sustainable finance hub[9] with numerous regulatory actions especially by capital markets regulator (SCA) and financial free zone regulators in Abu Dhabi (ADGM) and Dubai (DIFC). UAE regulatory initiatives included mandatory ESG reporting, female board appointments, and public awareness and capacity building webinars and conferences. The UAE government also appointed a dedicated Climate Change Special Envoy; announced a detailed Sustainable Finance Strategy issued by its Ministry of Climate and Environment and announced a Net Zero 2050 Strategic Initiative with associated funding commitments valued at US$163 billion for investment in clean energy. The Zayed Sustainability Prize continued for its 14th year to promote grassroots solutions awarding US$ 3 million in prize money. The Dubai Expo 2020 promoted hundreds of Global Innovators social impact projects and hosted the first UN SDG Global Goals Week held outside of New York. There was also a pronounced increase in regional government led and/or public-private partnerships for green financing[10], investment in renewable energy, sustainability linked sovereign issuances (such as KSA's Red Sea tourism project's green financing[11]), Oman's green power investment[12], Egypt's green bond issuance and plans to invest in renewable energy plants[13] and Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund Mubadala announcing the creation of a standalone ESG Unit[14]. Private sector sustainable finance commitments and transactions were also on the rise[15] driven partly by international and regional banks in the region like Standard Chartered, HSBC and First Gulf Bank, also from MNCs and asset managers, Engie Consortium and EFG Hermes, and by local corporates in retail and the aviation sectors notably Majid Al Futtaim[16], Emirates[17] and Etihad Airline[18]. Alongside these government and corporate initiatives, the advisory community (banks, lawyers, consultants) invested considerable efforts in raising awareness and engaging with clients on ESG in public and private webinars and conferences for capacity building, transactional and advisory mandates. The pandemic focused the attention of this sector on the fragility and risk embedded in the &lsquo;business-as-usual' model, with advisory firms actively educated themselves and their clients on the threats and opportunities presented by the global ESG mainstreaming challenge. This was also reflected in increased hiring for ESG related jobs across different sectors.

In 2022 it is anticipated that there will be: Increased private sector voluntary compliance (namely for MNCs, international FI's and large regional corporates) in ESG risk assessment and reporting according to international or industry standards to meet net zero targets, gender parity and to a lesser extent human rights / supply chain diligence because of increased shareholder demands, litigation and reputational risks emanating from home jurisdictions (noting increased interconnectivity and social media); and Some regional regulators enhancing current or announcing new sustainable finance frameworks and wider ESG integration and reporting. These policies may align with international regulations (&lsquo;the &lsquo;GDPR Effect') but with a local/regional relevance and pace which can offer a model of interoperability with, rather than wholesale adoption of, US, European or Asian standards. The focus will remain on meeting net zero targets and gender parity (although strict enforcement strategies will remain absent or unclear). International focus on climate change and environmental protection will soon spotlight the region with consecutive hosting of the UN Climate Summits and regional attendance at the UN Biodiversity Conference COP 15 hosted by China. This may elevate regional solutions to meet development needs during the transition period to clean energy including KSA's Green Initiative and Circular Carbon Economy (CCE) proposals[49] endorsed by G20 Leaders in 2020 relying on the ""4 Rs"" (carbon reduction, reusing, recycling and removal) and other offsetting through intensive tree planting[50] allowing continued reliance on oil and gas prevalent in the region while mitigating emissions harm. The momentum of these events can be harnessed to facilitate meaningful regional policy formation, cooperation and action on climate change mitigation and transitioning assuming there is political will, economic resource, technical support and overall stability. Net zero policy announcements alone will not be sufficient. The public and private sectors must work together to meet the funding and financing needs and put the regulatory frameworks to prompt action, build infrastructure and provide vulnerable segments of our societies including SME's and family run businesses with meaningful support. Advances by certain countries in the region are commendable but struggling neighbors should not be left behind considering the pan-regional and global impacts. The private sector - in particular financial institutions and MNCs - will continue to promote sustainable finance and ESG bench-marking especially in relation to climate change mitigation and funding other SDGs to meet self-imposed commitments, regulatory targets, institutional investor expectations and to avoid litigation and reputational risks. The role of FI's has also gained more prominence post COP26 with commitments from the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero or GFANZ. This presents both an opportunity to offer new products and services but also challenges given the impediments faced by countries in the region. Nevertheless ESG features in corporate lending will continue to accelerate in the region in 2022-2023 together with third-party assurance, sustainability compliance certification and auditing to comply with private financing requirements but increasingly for nascent local regulatory reporting and compliance (for example sustainable finance frameworks and personal data privacy laws). This will also coincide with more ESG related job recruitment as reflected on job posting cites such as LinkedIn indicating a &lsquo;greening' of business models in some pockets of the region (namely the GCC and Egypt). This normalization is aligned with current international transactional, integration and reporting standards including the Taskforce on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), the EU Sustainable Finance Taxonomy, EU SF Disclosure Regulation as well as sustainable finance frameworks, data privacy and ethical use of AI regulations issued by China, Singapore and Hong Kong governments. It is noteworthy that the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)'s creation of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) announced at COP26 in November 2021 is expected to consolidate climate disclosure and sustainability accounting standards (SASB). There are also emerging regional ESG regulatory reporting requirements especially within financial services and capital markets beyond environmental related factors in relation to diversity and inclusion (""D&I""). Global FI regulators in UK, US, Hong Kong and Australia taking steps to formalize reporting D&I for FI's and publicly listed companies by imposing executive accountability for more diverse leadership in recognition of D&I being an enabler of stronger governance, better environmental and social outcomes and enhanced company performance. This has been echoed by some FI regulators in the GCC region and Egypt focusing on uplifting female participation by mandating publicly listed companies to appoint at least one female board member and public / private partnerships such as the UAE Gender Council. Risks, Challenges and Opportunities Governments and corporations (especially FI's) globally are under pressure to &lsquo;know and show' that they are implementing international commitments such as the UN SDGs, Paris Agreement on Climate Change, UN Guiding Principles on Human Rights, OECD Guidelines for Responsible Business (in addition to industry specific ones) to integrate ESG principles to mitigate climate change risks, biodiversity loss, and enhance social safeguards. Further ESG led action is needed to achieve the UN SDGs but also imperative for the region to avert further adverse climate impact, which will not only radically change the ecology but also the economy, which risks overwhelming a region with a disproportionately young population. Given most governments in the region are not encumbered by complex political systems they can mobilize quickly given political stability, security and financial resources. Further delays in implementing credible ESG led policies and investments in the region pose numerous risks including: confusion over ESG benchmarking standards and labeling of financial product that can result in greenwashing and potential litigation claims and brand damage for MNCs in their home jurisdictions of Europe, US and Australia in relation to carbon net zero and human rights commitments (especially given the trend toward linking climate litigation with human rights as a basis for corporate legal liability); and economic and social losses due to lack of readiness on climate change risks impacting energy, biodiversity, water and food security which could exacerbate existing conflicts or create new ones; and higher cost of funds or stranding of assets due to a divergence in approach by international institutional investors, insurers and regulators which may impact trade, business, and foreign direct investment. Challenges The challenges to ESG integration and impact in the region are many including: Stark divisions between thriving countries (on a &lsquo;business-as-usual' model), countries in crisis and those in between with limited inter-regional cooperation on sustainability related projects; Failure to consider ESG as an integrated approach which is critical given the impact of climate change is already reflected in the region (with a high proportion of youth and high energy demands). As measures are adopted to tackle the &lsquo;Environment', the &lsquo;Social' and &lsquo;Governance' issues must be addressed coherently; Carbon Net Zero commitments generally lack specificity in the implementation plans including insufficient physical infrastructure, technology and monetary incentives to follow through on circular economy and significant carbon capture, reduction, recycling commitments; Large funding requirements and difficult social and fiscal policy decisions for &lsquo;greening' economies, reskilling / education of workers and students including SMEs (where there is still confusion about definitions of &lsquo;responsible', &lsquo;sustainable', &lsquo;green'); and incentives for banks (i.e. RWA discounts on capital treatment for qualifying transactions that support sustainable finance growth); Differences in climate finance and climate related disclosures standards and carbon market pricing causing confusion, reluctance and slowing down uptake; and Need for more reliable, standardized and secure data to enable better policy decisions, tracking and rating for investors and regulatory enforcements of breaches (in the short term more for international purposes rather than regional). Opportunities: Despite the risks and challenges, the region shows promise and opportunities for continuing to invest in its ESG journey to reach the UN SDGs and climate change commitments to avert further regional strife, including: Leveraging the young population and emerging entrepreneurs and fintech industry[52] using technology / innovation to meet energy demands, food and water security and waste management to &lsquo;leapfrog' development stages with lesser emissions. Examples of businesses in the UAE include EroeGo MENA tackling food waste; Ehfaaz recycling / composting; Cartflow upcycling and the MENA FinTech Association Sustainable Finance Alliance[53]; Further developing integration of human rights, digital and data privacy ethics, and gender parity. The UAE Human Rights Institute can be a regional influencer in enhancing labour and migrant worker standards and social safeguards more broadly including ethical use of technology and advances in laws and regulations enabling digital governance (including data privacy, internet of things, AI and e-transactions); Dedicated education tracks and curriculum enhancements in the schooling and university systems to build capacity and divert more funding to research and development of regional / local solutions to energy, water, waste and food security and biodiversity preservation/regeneration; and Encourage more civic engagement and consumer education on zero waste lifestyles (such as the Abu Dhabi Environment Agency's new app &lsquo;Baadr' to help residents embrace a more &lsquo;green' lifestyle[54], a new tariff on and eventual banning of plastic bags[55] and Jordan's Greening the Desert Project training of permaculture practices). Conclusion With eight years remaining in the &lsquo;Decade of Action' to achieve the UN SDGs and mitigate climate change temperature rises, there is a need for greater investment, pan-regional and international cooperation. The region is operating at variable speeds in addressing these challenges - projects such as NEOM in Saudi Arabia have the vision and ambition to become a new global paradigm for how we live, work and thrive in a sustainable, zero carbon way. Any disparities will need to be worked through collaboratively and can present opportunities for investors in the region and beyond. There is genuine urgency but also complexity in this task. The legal community are well placed to solve for such challenges together with policy makers, scientists, innovators, investors and financial institutions.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE165","Masdar Green REIT signs financing commitment with First Abu Dhabi Bank","January 19, 2022 Wednesday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","Masdar City through its Masdar Green Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), has signed a financing commitment in the amount of $200 million with First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) relating to financing of the REIT portfolio to facilitate further acquisitions and portfolio growth. FAB will act as sole mandated lead arranger and bookrunner, green loan coordinator, agent, security agent and account bank for this transaction. The announcement was made during an official signing ceremony held at the fourth Abu Dhabi Sustainable Finance Forum during Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week - the global platform for accelerating sustainable development hosted by Masdar. The announcement comes 12 months after Masdar City partnered with Emirates NBD Asset Management to receive management services for the UAE's first sustainable REIT. ""Investors are increasingly looking for 'responsible' investment opportunities and evaluate companies based on specific environmental, social and governance ('ESG') practices criteria,"" said Abdulla Balalaa, executive director, Masdar City and chairman of the REIT. ""The Masdar Green REIT's portfolio currently includes four commercial properties within Masdar City, which is the pioneering sustainable urban development project, and technology innovation hub, in Abu Dhabi. The financing from First Abu Dhabi Bank, will help the REIT in building its sustainable real estate portfolio through additional acquisitions of properties in Masdar City. The proceeds of these acquisitions will in turn assist Masdar City to bring more sustainable real estate assets to market through new sustainable developments and continuing the future expansion of Masdar City,"" he said. ""The Masdar Green REIT will give investors the responsible and forward-thinking investment options they are looking for, via these sustainable income-generating real estate assets, with a primary focus in Masdar City. The properties within the Masdar Green REIT's current portfolio consume approximately 40 per cent less electricity and water than comparable buildings in Abu Dhabi, targeting sustainability ratings of three Pearls or above on Abu Dhabi's Estidama Pearl Building Rating System, while one asset is also LEED Platinum certified. This REIT also intends to provide a vehicle through which third-party, sustainable developers can monetize their assets, attracting both real estate developers to Masdar City, and aspiring local and international sustainable investors,"" Balalaa added. As the UAE's largest bank and one of the world's largest and safest financial institutions, FAB is a regional leader for sustainable finance in the Middle East. FAB issued the region's first green bond in 2017 and has financed over $30 billion in sustainable projects to date. In 2021, the bank executed the first green repurchasing ('repo') transaction in the Middle East, structured in partnership with Deutsche Bank. FAB was also the first bank in the region to commit to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and to join the Net-Zero Banking Alliance and was part of the official UAE delegation to the COP26 climate conference. Mustafa Al Khalfawi, head of Global Banking UAE and global head of Government, Sovereigns & Public Sector, Investment Banking Group, said: ""First Abu Dhabi Bank has made a commitment to fund projects that deliver tangible environmental and social benefits, and we are leading the way forward in financing the transition to a more sustainable future. As one of our strategic clients, we are delighted to support Masdar City in this landmark transaction, with an innovative and flexible financing structure to enable the Masdar Green REIT to fulfil its strategic objectives. The transaction serves to underline FAB's ongoing commitment to Masdar and sustainable financing, and we look forward to further deepening our relationship as Masdar implements its exciting plans to grow its high-quality portfolio."" Masdar City announced it was launching the green REIT, the first in the UAE to invest solely in sustainable real estate projects, during Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ADSW) in January in 2020. The Masdar Green REIT was established at Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) as a Qualified Investor Fund (QIF) and is managed by Masdar Capital Management Limited which is regulated by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority. Masdar Green REIT intends to offer an attractive opportunity for professional investors through private placement to invest in a unique portfolio of stable, income-producing, sustainable real estate assets. The Masdar Green REIT marks great progress in bringing the Abu Dhabi Sustainable Finance Declaration to life, which was signed in 2019 by 25 public and private sector entities, including Masdar City and the ADGM, and is aimed at establishing a healthy and sustainable finance industry that supports the UAE in attaining the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Currently active in more than 40 countries, Masdar has been advancing the commercialization and deployment of renewable energy, sustainable urban development, and clean technologies, to address global sustainability challenges since 2006. In 2018, Masdar signed the first green revolving credit facility in the Middle East, helping to support its investments in global clean technology and sustainable real estate projects.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE167","Weekly Comic: Hard Decisions on Energy, Climate Change","October 19, 2021 Tuesday","Forexpros","Investing.com - By Geoffrey Smith Investing.com --\~The world has under-invested in fossil fuels because of an obsession with Climate Change. The resulting shortage of supply and the vicious squeeze in global energy prices only shows that the price of Climate Change mitigation is unacceptably high. For any further proof, witness the orgy of self-righteousness and self-congratulation that is about to explode at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, an event that seems doomed already to failure, for all that the politicians there will claim otherwise. Exasperation turns easily to despair when fuel bills are rocketing (everywhere), when gas stations are empty (as in the U.K.), \~when the power system responsible for keeping the lights on for 1.4 billion people is down to four days' worth of fuel supplies (as in India), and when the only country that can solve your short-term energy crisis is a repressive kleptocracy that you would prefer to keep as far away from you as possible (as in most of Europe). But despair is not inevitable and the current energy crisis \- while it may be repeated \- will not be lasting. The current squeeze \- which has introduced the global investing public to the Dutch TTF benchmark gas contract and Chinese coal futures \- is a passing phenomenon. Much of it is due to the pandemic, which depressed coal output from South Africa to China and which delayed necessary maintenance of Russia's gas installations last year. But the pandemic is fading, and so will these pressures. Looking ahead, one can also be more confident that high prices will, as usual, be the cure for high prices, and that future regulations will be drafted to provide better incentives for backup power and more redundancy in infrastructure - especially in storage, the only solution to the problem of renewables' intermittency. Most importantly, the two countries that will drive Climate Change more than any other in the coming years \- China and India \- know that they cannot afford further unbridled growth in fossil fuel consumption. For many years, the effective constraint on Chinese policy was pollution, and the public health emergencies created by smog from its coal-fired power stations. However, catastrophic flooding across various parts of the country this year has made it clear that extreme weather events are increasingly a threat to economic - and ultimately social - stability. UBS analysts point out that while 40% of the $210 billion in global climate-related losses last year were insured globally, only 2% were in China. ""When we protect nature, it rewards us,"" President Xi Jinping said in a speech earlier this month, with a nod to those floods. ""When we exploit nature ruthlessly, it punishes us without mercy."" To be sure, such platitudes won't stop either China or India burning more coal in the short term. And Beijing's action this week to approve new coal mine projects in Inner Mongolia flatly contradicts President Xi Jinping's stated ambition to reach peak zero carbon emissions by 2030, raising suspicions that Beijing will yet again back off any action that threatens short-term growth. But China's latest renewables projects \- it is already building a solar farm in its western desert that will generate three times as much power as the Three Gorges Dam \- are clearly much more than just tokenism: it already has more installed renewable capacity than Japan and Germany combined. The country is heavily invested in cleaning up and greening up. The world's progress toward a more resilient, greener global energy system can't help but be chaotic, uneven and hampered at by economic competition between nations. But it is still nonetheless progress, and neither COP26 , nor short-term market squeezes are likely to stop it. Investing.com offers an extensive set of professional tools for the financial markets.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE168","International Energy Forum commends UAE for Net-Zero 2050 Pledge","October 7, 2021 Thursday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","RIYADH, 7th October, 2021 (WAM) -- The Secretary General of the International Energy Forum, Joseph McMonigle, commended the United Arab Emirates on its pledge to reach net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. The UAE announced that the country had adopted the goal to achieve climate neutrality by mid-century. The announcement was made during the Expo2020 ahead of the COP26 climate change conference due to be held in the UK next month. ""The IEF commends the leadership of the UAE for this ambitious goal, the first such announcement by a Gulf oil exporting nation,"" said McMonigle. The announcement brings the UAE into line with several other nations that have pledged to become net-zero by mid-century, including the European Union, South Korea, Canada, and Chile. Net-zero carbon means the amount of carbon dioxide being emitted into the atmosphere is stable or falling. An economy can retain a small amount of fossil fuel use while contributing no CO2 overall, if it balances emissions by removing CO2 through initiatives such as carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration \- part of every feasible pathway to 1.5 C assessed by the IPCC \- and through tree planting. ""This highlights that there are multiple pathways that individual countries can take to reach their climate goal,"" McMonigle said. \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE169","A 'New World' of Workforce Data Will Drive Sustainability","January 28, 2022","Communicate","By Michael Cupps, Senior VP, Marketing at Activeops The term ""net-zero"" has been on the lips of climate experts, politicians, and sustainability advocates for a while now. As a result, the need to achieve this goal inevitably occupied most of the agenda at COP26 . The issues discussed during the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference had far-reaching implications, all of which have been carried into 2022. Now, as the topic continues to garner attention within the public domain, the actions needed to mitigate climate change are the utmost priority for world leaders. The scrutiny they are under has inevitably trickled down onto organizations. Now business leaders are in the spotlight and are being forced to act on it if they are to survive. Pressures to mitigate climate change intensify Social media has made it easier for people to direct their worries. This has intensified the need for companies to focus on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Therefore, organizations that aren't are environmentally responsible, are often criticized for it. In addition, this pressure towards responsible and sustainable operations will only grow. Thereby it's imperative that all organizations, from start-ups to global brand icons, recognize that running sustainable operations is the key to unlocking a positive brand reputation in the future. Data can be the light at the end of a dark tunnel With the Omicron variant spreading rapidly, the effects were felt globally. Organizations will need to adjust their plans to keep employees safe and comply with the law. The need for people to work from home makes hybrid working more prevalent and complicated as it demands better orchestration. While data requirements might seem burdensome at first, they can be a source of optimization. Workforce data could become the key to successfully navigate through these challenging times. Organizations today need to record real insights and implement operational changes that will promote cultural and performance consistency in this hybrid world. Many leaders will also recognize that capturing real-time data at aggregate and individual levels can allow organizations to uncover prominent trends that can drive overall business efficiency. In a global business environment that is both highly competitive and relentlessly volatile, access to real-time performance data \- or a lack of access to that essential data \- will make or break businesses. It is also crucial for organizations to measure the consequences when they can't gather data that is required to schedule workforce levels across departments. Shortage of resources, limited capacity, and backlogs affect the customer experience on the outside and decrease employee morale on the inside. Similarly, compromised coordination with employees can affect their work efficiency and subsequent engagement, leading to lower productivity even when organizations have a higher staff turnover rate. Businesses appreciate the value of having a data-backed structured approach to managing operations. The application of this hybrid work data is essential for three reasons: Managers can be aware of real-time work location, the team's productivity, and availability, meaning workload can be distributed where and when required. Location-based performance data expands planning opportunities for managers to identify areas where office capacity can be modified, meaning carbon footprint targets are more achievable. Sustainability teams now have access to historical data regarding the commuting impact of their employees, meaning businesses can reduce ineffectual travel, and increase work output opportunities. Technology's role in driving sustainable operations It is now possible to have a Workforce Optimization Solution (WFO) to provide sustainability managers with real-time data with respect to the location of where their employees are working and how they're performing. This will allow businesses to gather data efficiently and affordably without an extensive implementation of the whole process and help them meet their sustainability goals. Many balances need to be struck and trade-offs need to be made in the quest to minimize carbon emissions, but the goal can be fulfilled if businesses recognize what is required and act upon it promptly. A 'new era' of sustainable working Most firms are working on reducing their carbon footprint to become more sustainable. If your business is using data to support a hybrid workforce, then you should notice a reduction in these emissions on multiple fronts. You may notice reduced emissions as fewer employees commute and those who commute less. You may see a reduced need for office lighting and heating \- not to mention a reduction in office waste \- as footfall in the office decreases. The workforce data you gather to enable all this will help demonstrate a contribution to your businesses' emission reduction program \- or could even form the basis of starting one if you have not already. Due to the ongoing effects of the pandemic, many sectors of the world's economy have accelerated their digital transformation attempts. If business leaders play their cards right, they will be able to maintain satisfactory productivity levels through uncertainty. The drive to optimize organizational efficiency and productivity should no longer center solely around performance and profit but equally, revolve around sustainability. \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE170","Uniting for the Greater Good","February 28, 2022 Monday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","The UAE and Israel are innovation allies in the battle against climate change This past summer, the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued its starkest ever warning in its comprehensive assessment of the state of our planet. The report, conducted over eight years of research by hundreds of the world's leading climate scientists, painted a grim picture for humanity. It said that if nations are unable to work together to cap greenhouse gas emissions and limit global temperature increases, the resulting widespread devastation and extreme weather will put billions of people at immediate risk. UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres did not mince words in his statement upon the report's release: ""[This] is a code red for humanity. The alarm bells are deafening, and the evidence is irrefutable."" The UAE's confirmation as the host of the UN's COP28 Climate Change Summit in 2023 is a testament to the country's deep commitment and dedication to leading the global battle against the greatest challenge of our times. In that battle, it will find no greater ally than Israel. Though relatively small in territory, both Middle Eastern countries can have an outsized impact on the chances of success due to their shared specialisation in technology - the weapon that will likely be the biggest key to overcoming global warming, barring radical changes in behaviour by people and corporations. Innovation needed to shift the needle Reaching net-zero emission targets demands cooperation on a global level. It will also require the development and scaling of new technology that will enable us to maintain and advance both our economies and our everyday lives in the face of the threats. It requires virtually every industry vertical to change its ways - from the way we generate and consume electricity, manufacture products, grow food, and get around, to the way we build, heat, and cool our houses. For that reason, there is an enormous opportunity in the hands of innovators. Speaking at COP26 Since then, in November, the UAE was successful in bringing Israel and Jordan together to sign the landmark Declaration of Intent - the biggest ever regional collaboration agreement to combat climate change. The plan calls for solar photovoltaic plants to be built in Jordan, with all clean power produced to be exported to Israel, and a sustainable water desalination programme to be built in Israel to supply Jordan with water for household and agricultural needs. The UAE backed initiative proves the country is just as committed to environmental benefit as it is to regional peace. Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE's Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation said: ""We demonstrate with this declaration that all nations can work together to further the energy transition and build a more sustainable future for all."" Environmental Partnerships With both Emirati and Israeli firms boasting strong records in sustainable development technologies, the relations between the countries are already proving to be a force multiplier in the battle to tackle this unprecedented challenge for humanity. Other agreements between the countries include a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), signed between the UAE's Ministry for Food and Water Security and Israel's Agriculture Ministry to promote cooperation in areas of food production and food supply chains, as well as research and innovation. Yet another MoU was signed with Israel's Environmental Protection Ministry aimed at funding joint research efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change and to ensure biodiversity and ecosystem conservation. These partnerships have expanded beyond governments to the private sector. Soon after the signing of the accords, UAE's Masdar and Israel's EDF Renewables announced an agreement to explore renewable energy opportunities and support the countries' clean energy objectives. Another agreement was signed to launch a joint Israeli-Emirati water research programme as part of a collaboration between the Israeli Watergen company and Baynunah, a sister company of UAE's Al Dahra Group, which specialises in food security. Emirati leaders have long been at the forefront of the movement to address the climate crisis and have been ahead in the rolling out of major investments in renewables and clean technologies. The UAE is home to two of the world's largest solar plants and is soon to break ground on a third. Abu Dhabi has the Middle East's first facility for carbon capture and storage, and Masdar City has received international recognition as a pioneer in sustainable living and is on its way to becoming a global hub for clean technology. Dr Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, the UAE's Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and Special Envoy for Climate Change, delivered an open invitation from the UAE to the world for partnerships to find sustainable solutions that will tackle climate change and create sustainable economic growth with a positive social impact. Israel is uniquely positioned to answer that call. Sourcing Climate Tech in Israel Over the last 30 years, Israeli companies have been at the forefront of innovation technology, developing thousands of products and services in a wide range of sectors. Every year, these companies attract billions of dollars in investments and generate billions more in technological exports. Scores more of them are acquired to add value to market leaders in industries as diverse as fintech, smart mobility, cybersecurity, agrifoodtech, and digital health. The country is now putting a concerted effort into also becoming the primary global hub for climate change-battling innovation. In 2021, climatetech companies made up 10 per cent of the $26 billion in capital raised by the Israeli tech ecosystem and there is every reason to think that the sector will rise in significance as time progresses. But it's not only investors who have identified the potential. Large multinational corporations are also taking notice and collaborating with local companies that can provide them with the solutions they need to meet their sustainability goals in a wide range of climatetech areas: Nestl\'e9 working with Future Meat to bring cell-based meat to your table; UBER partnering with Tomorrow.IO to integrate real-time weather monitoring into drivers' paths; ASOS working with Kornit Digital to reduce the environmental impact of the fashion industry; Hitachi partnering with REE to scale-up electric transportation manufacturing; and many other examples. What are we doing? At Start-Up Nation Central, an NGO which supports and promotes Israel's tech ecosystem, we have long championed the potential of technology and innovation to address the global climate crisis. We are investing significant resources to highlight the role of groundbreaking technological solutions to meet the region's climate goals, connecting like-minded companies, investors, and innovators across the Middle East and beyond. We are identifying and mapping the Israeli tech startups that are developing solutions to help meet the net-zero emissions targets. Our preliminary mapping has identified approximately 600 Israeli startups already developing solutions for addressing climate challenges. To channel Israel's renowned entrepreneurial and innovative spirit into action, we are calling global players to join us for the Climate Solutions Prize, an unparalleled contest to incentivise climate-tech innovation, with annual prizes exceeding $2 million for Israeli researchers and startups. We are launching the Climate Solutions Prize in partnership with the Jewish National Fund of Canada and Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael Jewish National Fund (KKL-JNF), along with the special support of the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation, on January 25 at an in-person event with the participation of Isaac Herzog, the President of the State of Israel. The contest will run for nine months, until the winners are announced in October 2022 during the Climate Solutions Festival which will be the apex event of a major global climate-tech expo and conference. As we work to bring people together to achieve a shared vision for a zero-emission world, we believe the climate partnership between Israel and the UAE will be at the forefront of the movement to build a more sustainable planet. We urge innovators in both countries to make the connections so that we will reach COP28 with results and prove that innovation and cooperation are the keys to reaching sustainability.

He then pointed out the UAE is conducting pioneering work in climate change, leading the region's efforts to eliminate emissions. Speaking about the recent announcement by IRENA and the UAE during COP26 in Glasgow, UK, about the launch of the Energy Transition Accelerator Financing (ETAF) Platform in developing countries, La Camera commended the UAE's significant global efforts to promote renewable energy. Energy Transition Accelerator Financing (ETAF) Platform is an inclusive, multi-stakeholder climate finance solution managed by the International Renewable Energy Agency to advance the energy transition across the Agency's 166-strong membership. With anchor funding of USD400 million from the United Arab Emirates via the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD), the Platform serves as the first global climate finance partnership from the Middle East to the world. ETAF aims to mobilise approximately USD 1 billion of capital by 2030 from various funding partners, investors, private sector, and donors. The platform aims to attract additional investments worth $2 billion from outside donors to finance projects that will help generate 1.5 gigawatts of electricity from renewable sources by 2030.

About 30,000 people are expected to attend the annual summit, including heads of state, environmental activists, and business leaders. Brigid Shea, a Travis County Commissioner will represent the Austin area. ""The national governments have to partner with local governments to really achieve the greenhouse gas reductions that have to happen in order to reverse climate change,"" Shea contended. The 26th climate summit is considered the most important since a United Nations report declared ""a code red for humanity"" earlier this year. The summit continues through Nov. 12. Shea said 2017's Hurricane Harvey was a climate-change wake-up call for Texans, and now its effects are being felt by everyone. ""The crazy wildfires, the massive flooding, the increasing intensity of hurricanes,"" Shea outlined. ""I think people are seeing and feeling the impacts of climate change and realizing this is something deadly for humanity."" Shea believes the pandemic forced a real-time experiment, on a grand scale, to prove how well telecommuting could work to reduce fossil-fuel consumption contributing to climate change. According to Shea, Travis County government has saved more than $1 million on utility bills by allowing 75% of its workers to telecommute. ""We've reduced greenhouse gas emissions from our employee commute by over 30%, and we've increased productivity, improved employee morale,"" Shea pointed out. Shea added the pandemic inadvertently illustrated how quickly environmental damage from carbon pollution can be reversed. ""There were so many reports from India that people could finally see the night sky, and they'd never seen it before, and it was so beautiful and amazing because everybody wasn't driving all over and choking the air with fossil-fuel emissions from their cars,"" Shea observed.

The two are expected to discuss issues including trade, where China still lags its commitments under the deal it made with President Donald Trump, and Taiwan, which has been subjected to increasingly frequent and aggressive military patrolling by Chinese mainland aviation in recent months. One data point providing a favorable backdrop is that the yuan is trading close to its highest in three years against the U.S. dollar, despite a sharp slowdown in Chinese growth in the third quarter. 2. Democrats push to pass spending bill this week House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is lining up a vote on the Democrats' $2 billion spending package on education, healthcare and the energy transition as early as this week, having secured enough votes for it to break the current deadlock, according to various reports.\~The smaller infrastructure spending bill is set to become law later Monday. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk again tried to deflect blame for his substantial sales of Tesla stock on to the party at the weekend, after selling a further block of stock on Friday to meet a tax liability that is due under legislation passed by the previous Congress. Progressives have started to drop their opposition to the way the spending bill has been pruned, having been chastened by some poor performances in mayoral and gubernatorial elections two weeks ago. The likelihood of Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell - a bogeyman for the left of the party - being sacrificed as a pawn in this game of 3D chess appear to have risen, with more than one report over the weekend talking up the possibility of Biden nominating Lael Brainard to succeed him. 3. Stocks set to open higher; Planemakers in focus By 6:15 AM ET (1115 GMT), Dow Jones futures were up 100 points, or 0.3%, while S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were both up 0.2%. Stocks likely to be in focus later include Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN), which reports earnings at a time when rising food prices ahead of the holiday season are grabbing attention, and Advance Auto Parts, which has already released quarterly numbers.\~ Also in focus, as the Dubai Air Show opens, will be Airbus (OTC:EADSY) and Boeing (NYSE:BA). Airbus has already announced a 255-plane order from the stable of airlines led by private equity group Indigo Partners. 4. Coal gets a stay of execution Coal had its lease of life as an energy source extended after China and India pressured the rest of negotiators at the COP26 conference to drop a commitment to phasing it out. The final declaration from the summit spoke of a 'phasing down' of coal power instead. The reluctance of China to wean itself off coal is likely to harden opinion in Europe \- and possibly North America \- for imposing carbon taxes on imports from countries with lower environmental standards. That process may be helped \- at the edges \- by a surprising success at COP26 in moving closer to a common set of rules for carbon trading mechanisms. 5. Oil weakens on dollar strength; Farewell, 'Royal Dutch' Oil prices weakened on Monday as the dollar's strength and disappointing economic data out of the world's third-largest economy weighed. Japan said its gross domestic product shrank by an annualized 3.0% in the third quarter, more than expected. The news was only partly offset by slightly better-than-expected industrial production and retail sales data from China. By 6:30 AM ET, the January futures contract for crude oil traded at $78.67 a barrel, down 1.3% from Friday, while the Brent contract traded down 1.5% at $80.98 a barrel. Elsewhere, Royal Dutch Shell is set to become just 'Shell': the Anglo-Dutch oil major succumbed to the pressures of post-pandemic, pre-energy transition life by scrapping its dual share structure in an effort to squeeze out unnecessary costs Investing.com offers an extensive set of professional tools for the financial markets.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE174","Shaping conversations","February 27, 2022","Gulf Business","Former British servicemen, David Wiseman and Nathan Jones, have co-founded Peak State to destigmatise the subject of mental health and change the traditional messaging around it Nathan, in 2014, a routine flight you were flying resulted in a horrific incident. What happened that day? JONES: I was flying a Voyager aircraft, an Airbus A330, from the RAF Brize Norton station to Helmand Province in Afghanistan. We were in cruise mode, flying at 33,000 feet when I decided to exit the cockpit and take a break. While I was having a cup of tea, the next thing I knew was that I was pinned to the roof. I realised we were plummeting into the sea. I had to crawl on the roof, pull myself down to my seat, and then activate a button that gave me priority on my controls [to take over the aircraft]. What happened is that the captain &ndash; I was the co-pilot at the time &ndash; was taking photos of the stars with an SLR camera and got his camera jammed at the controls. So, he moved his seat forward and it knocked the autopilot out, jamming the stick all the way forward. He was there thinking the autopilot was stuck, but instead, it was the camera jamming the controls. I was severely injured from ramming into the roof. I split the back of my head open and broke my back. From 2014, I was full-time in the defence medical rehab centre, recovering from both physical and mental injuries. David, you still have a bullet in your chest from an incident in Afghanistan. Tell us about that. WISEMAN: I was an officer in the British Army in the infantry unit. It was my second tour in Afghanistan. I previously served in Baghdad. I was embedded with the Afghan National Army, with a small specialised team of nine British soldiers with me. I was in Helmand Province in 2009, and it was a terrible year for us. Over two weeks, at the back end of October and November, we dealt with 25 different casualties. On November 15th, 2009, I became the 26th casualty. We had fought the Taliban off an area and had to push them back a little bit further that day. As we crossed into the next tactical bound, we were engaged by a position, where I didn't have cover. Essentially, an enemy sniper got us in the end. One round zipped past my head and it sounded like someone had cracked a whip, and soon after, I heard the sound of the weapon firing. That one went past my head. I didn't react quickly enough because the second one slammed into my chest. The bullet hit just below my clavicle, travelled down the length of my torso, nicking my axial artery on the way, smashing through my brachial plexus and then shredding through my lung. It shattered my ribs and came to rest in my right lung where it still sits today. My chest was filling with blood and [my team] kept me alive for long enough until an American chopper landed to take me away. In fact, I stopped breathing three times, waiting on the ground. I was moved to the back of the chopper; as they strapped me down, I stopped breathing again. That's when [the paramedic] took out a blade and cut into my chest without an anaesthetic and [inserted a tube]. All that blood seeped out onto the floor of the helicopter, and I could finally breathe again. I spent a week in intensive care in Birmingham. I left the Army in 2013 after several years in and out of the fantastic Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre at Headley Court The two of you also co-founded Peak State. How did that happen and what are some of its objectives? WISEMAN: After I left the army, I went to work for Prince Harry and Prince William at The Royal Foundation. I was advising them on their philanthropic involvement with supporting those who serve. There were lots of different programmes over the years, and mental health was interwoven in a lot of those programmes. But the message with mental health has always been from a negative angle. It's always been discussing depression, anxiety or trauma &ndash; and that really isn't the whole story. There's the other spectrum about it, promoting the management of good mental health. And Peak State essentially focuses on that thinking. Peak State is a collection of tools and techniques that we've taken from across the world of sports psychology to influence and help people adopt a proactive approach to the better management of mental health. JONES: I went to university to do sports science, and sports psychology was a big part of it. When you say that your mind is the most important muscle in your body, it couldn't be more relevant now with what we're doing with Peak State. The issue with all these learnings are that the marginal gains of sports psychology are only being afforded to professional and elite athletes. It's not really being spoken about among the general public and those who arguably need it the most. What we're trying to do is destigmatise the conversation around mental health. We're giving people the option to do so through a library of tools and techniques, and we understand that it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. We've packaged something, knowing that everyone stays on this spectrum of mental health &ndash; whether they're an elite sportsperson, biohacker, or if even if they've never focused on it before &ndash; and we help them with tools such as breathwork to activate their parasympathetic nervous system, sleep nutrition and nutrition. We help them develop their knowledge to use these daily to become higher-performing individuals. By doing so, they're putting on different bits of armour. So, if something does arise, and they get stressed or anxious, they have these tools in their arsenal as coping mechanisms. Why send a soldier into battle without the armour just because you know that there's going to be someone with a plaster at the other end to fix that wound? You were at the Expo 2020 recently. What are some of the discussions you've had here in the UAE on the subject of mental health? JONES: We had a fantastic lecture at the Dubai Exhibition Center at RewirEd. I think people [here] are open to this idea of mental fitness. I think what we're offering with Peak State is exciting and isn't just for elite athletes. It isn't just for executive coaching. It is for everybody. We've got programmes running in Australia, the US, and are about to launch in Greece. We would love to do something in this region. JONES: The reason why we're here is that we created this bespoke content for different communities. It's pointless for someone here in the UAE, for example, to watch a video that was created for Australian.communities. So, we create content that is bespoke for a community, region, or nationality. One of the areas that we're now working on is youth empowerment. We've spoken at COP26 and a string of conferences on this subject. What can we expect from you in 2022? WISEMAN: If we could get our tools and techniques into the schools in this region, we're going to have some extraordinary young people becoming adults. There's this climate of anxiety. The youth are our future leaders, so you need to get this in place now &ndash; otherwise, you're just putting bandages in the future. In 2022, what we would like to do in this region is for Peak State tools to be inserted into the UK personal, social, health and economic school curriculum, supported by our app, which is coming out this year. When you have brands such as Bremont backing initiatives like Peak State, how does that help further your cause? WISEMAN: You know, people might think that Bremont makes luxury watches, so what's that got to do with [Peak State]? Well, it is about values and a crossover of those values. We see that their adventurous, forward-thinking and progressive spirit is exactly what's needed, and that's the kind of crossover we're looking at with Peak State. Bremont's tagline is &lsquo;Tested Beyond Endurance'. And if you have these Peak State tools, you can actually be tested beyond endurance. JONES: Bremont is our official timing partner. We have partnered with a variety of health tech companies and firms such as Iris, who make the audio software that goes into the headsets for Red Bull Racing. Max Verstappen's helmet and Christian Horner's headset have the same audio software that goes into Peak State. Iris creates dimensional soundscapes for us. We've partnered with world-leading companies to bridge the gaps and legitimise what we're doing. It gives the general public access to the marginal gains of elite athletes. \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE175","Russian invasion of Ukraine sparking more outrage than any other war","March 3, 2022 Thursday","Big News Network.com","Surprise and horror have defined the reaction to the Russian military intervention in Ukraine. That's likely because although the intervention has followed the contours of a modern land war, it has also marked a break with the past in a number of ways. The world has become used to military interventions by the United States. This is, however, not a U.S. intervention. That in itself is a surprise - one that has befuddled reporters and pundits alike. Even as we deplore the violence and the loss of life in Ukraine resulting from the Russian intervention (and the neofascist violence in the Donbas), it is valuable to step back and look at how the rest of the world may perceive this conflict, starting with the West's ethnocentric interest in an attack whose participants and victims they believe they share aspects of identity with - whether related to culture, religion, or skin color. White Wars War in Ukraine joins a sequence of wars that have opened sores on a very fragile planet. Wars in Africa and Asia seem endless, and some of them are rarely commented upon with any feeling in media outlets across the world or in the cascade of posts found on social media platforms. For example, the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which started in 1996 and which has resulted in millions of casualties, has not elicited the kind of sympathy from the world now seen during the reporting on Ukraine. In contrast, the startlingly frank comments from political leaders and journalists during the conflict in Ukraine have revealed the grip of racism on the imaginations of these shapers of public opinion. It was impossible recently to get major global media outlets interested in the conflict in Cabo Delgado, which grew out of the capture of the bounty of natural gas by TotalEnergies SE (France) and ExxonMobil (U.S.) and led to the deployment of the French-backed Rwandan military in Mozambique. At COP26 , I told a group of oil company executives about this intervention - which I had covered for Globetrotter - and one of them responded with precise accuracy: ""You're right about what you say, but no one cares."" No one, which is to say the political forces in the North Atlantic states, cares about the suffering of children in Africa and Asia. They are, however, gripped by the war in Ukraine, which should grip them, which distresses all of us, but which should not be allowed to be seen as worse than other conflicts taking place across the globe that are much more brutal and are likely to slip out of everyone's memory due to the lack of interest and attention given by world leaders and media outlets to them. Charlie D'Agata of CBS News said that Ukraine ""isn't a place, with all due respect, like Iraq or Afghanistan, that has seen conflict raging for decades. This is a relatively civilized, relatively European - I have to choose those words carefully, too-city, where you wouldn't expect that, or hope that [a conflict] is going to happen."" Clearly, these are the things one expects to see in Kabul (Afghanistan) or Baghdad (Iraq) or Goma (the Democratic Republic of the Congo), but not in a ""relatively civilized, relatively European"" city in Ukraine. If these are things that one expects in the former cities respectively, then there is very little need to be particularly outraged by the violence that is witnessed in these cities. You would not expect such violence in Ukraine, said the country's Deputy Chief Prosecutor David Sakvarelidze to the BBC, because of the kind of people who were caught in the crossfire: ""European people with blue eyes and blond hair being killed every day."" Sakvarelidze considers the Ukrainians to be Europeans, although D'Agata calls them ""relatively European."" But they are certainly not African or Asian, people whom - if you think carefully about what is being said here - certain world leaders and international media outlets expect to be killed by the violence unleashed against them by the global great powers and by the weapons sold to the local thugs in these regions by these great powers. Worst War? On February 23, 2022, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres - in a heartfelt statement about the Russian military intervention in Ukraine -said, ""In the name of humanity do not allow to start in Europe what could be the worst war since the beginning of the century."" The next day, on February 24, with Russia launching ""the biggest attack on a European state since World War II,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen condemned this ""barbaric attack"" and said that ""it is President Putin who is bringing war back to Europe."" ""Bringing war back to Europe"": this is instructive language from Von der Leyen. It reminded me of Aim Csaire's Discourse on Colonialism (1950), where the great poet and communist bemoaned Europe's ability to forget the terrible fascistic treatment of the peoples of Africa and Asia by the colonial powers when they spoke of fascism. Fascism, Csaire wrote, is the colonial experiment brought back to Europe. When the United States invaded Iraq in 2003, neither the United Nations secretary-general nor the president of the European Commission came forward to make any immediate condemnation of that war. Both international institutions went along with the war, allowing the destruction of Iraq, which resulted in the death of more than a million people. In 2004, a year into the U.S. war on Iraq, after reports of grave violations of human rights (including by Amnesty International on torture in the prison of Abu Ghraib) came to light, then UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan called the war ""illegal."" In 2006, three years after the war had begun, Italy's Prime Minister Romano Prodi, who had been the president of the European Commission in 2003, called the war a ""grave error."" In the case of the Russian intervention, these institutions rushed to condemn the war, which is all very well but does this mean that they will be just as quick to condemn the United States when it starts its next bombing campaign? War Stenography People often ask me, what's the most reliable news outlet? This is a hard question to answer these days, as Western news outlets are increasingly becoming stenographers of their governments (with the racist attitudes of the reporters on full display more and more often, making the apologies that come later hardly comforting). State-sponsored outlets in Russia and China now increasingly find themselves banned on social media sites. Anyone who counters Washington's narrative is dismissed as irrelevant, and these fringe voices find it hard to develop an audience. So-called cancel culture demonstrates its limits. D'Agata has apologized for his comment about Ukraine being ""relatively civilized, relatively European"" compared to Iraq and Afghanistan and has already been rehabilitated because he is on the ""right side"" of the conflict in Ukraine. Cancel culture has moved from the chatter of social media to the battlefields of geopolitics and diplomacy as far as the Russian-Ukraine conflict is concerned. Switzerland has decided to end a century of formal neutrality to cancel Russia by enforcing European sanctions against it (remember that Switzerland remained ""neutral"" as the Nazis tore through Europe during World War II, and operated as the Nazi bankers even after the war). Meanwhile, press freedom has been set aside during the current conflict in Eastern Europe, with Australia and Europe suspending the broadcast of RT, which is a Russian state-controlled international media network. D'Agata's reliability as a reporter will remain unquestioned. He ""misspoke,"" they might say, but this is a Freudian slip. Calculations of War Wars are ugly, especially wars of aggression. The role of the reporter is to explain why a country goes to war, particularly an unprovoked war. If this were 1941, I might try to explain the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor during World War II or the Japanese assumption that the Nazis would soon defeat the Soviets and then take the war across the Atlantic Ocean. But the Soviets held out, saving the world from fascism. In the same way, the Russian attack on Ukraine requires explanation: the roots of it go deep to various political and foreign policy developments, such as the post-Soviet emergence of ethnic nationalism along the spine of Eastern Europe, the eastward advance of U.S. power-through NATO-toward the Russian border, and the turbulent relationship between the major European states and their eastern neighbors (including Russia). To explain this conflict is not to justify it, for there is little to justify in the bombing of a sovereign people. Sane voices exist on all sides of ugly conflicts. In Russia, State Duma Deputy Mikhail Matveev of the Communist Party said. soon after the Russian entry into Ukraine, that he voted for the recognition of the breakaway provinces of Ukraine, he ""voted for peace, not for war,"" and he voted ""for Russia to become a shield, so that Donbas is not bombed, and not for Kyiv being bombed."" Matveev's voice confounds the current narrative: it brings into motion the plight of the Donbas since the U.S.-driven coup in Ukraine in 2014, and it sounds the alarm against the full scale of the Russian intervention.

World leaders to send on Rome for a G 20 summit, but remain far apart on forging a consensus on climate policy ahead of next week's COP26 meetings. They're closer together on the issue of global tax. Eurozone bond yields hit the highest in over a year on fears that the ECB will dial down stimulus. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) confirmed it will rebrand as Meta, and Big Oil dominates the days earnings roster. Here is what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, October 30. 1. Apple, Amazon Disappoint Apple and Amazon both disappointed with their quarterly earnings after the closing bell on Thursday, sending both stocks lower in premarket trading. Apple's sales were hit by supply chain problems, and CEO Tim Cook warned that the coming holiday quarter may be even worse in this regard. \~The issue had been flagged previously in unconfirmed reports. Amazon's problems were concentrated in higher input costs, notably for labor, which hurt profit margins at the core e-commerce business. Amazon Web Services, by contrast, continued to churn out money at a decent rate. Even so, earnings per share where some 25% below analysts' forecasts, in a rare and marked disappointment one of the market's heavyweights. 2. PCE Prices, Personal Income and Spending The last inflation- related economic data before the Federal Reserve's next policy meeting are due at 8:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), how long with figures for personal income and personal spending in September. Core prices for personal consumer expenditures are expected to have risen by 0.2% in September down from 0.3% in August and a peak of 0.7 in April. The annual rate of core PCE inflation is expected to have fallen risen to 3.7% from 3.6% a month ago. The PCE Price index is the feds preferred measure of inflation. The numbers come a day after further signs of labor market strength, as initial jobless claims fell to a new post pandemic low of 281,000. 3. Stocks likely to open lower as Big Tech drags; Oil majors eyed US stock markets are expected to set to open lower later, amid disappointment at the earnings from Apple and Amazon (and also Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), whose revenue also fell short of expectations). By 6:15 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were down 45 points or 0.1%, S&P 500 futures were down 0.5% and NASDAQ 100 futures were down 0.9%. Stocks likely to be in focus later include Facebook, which confirmed its intention to rebrand under the name Meta on Thursday, and oil and gas majors Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX), both of whom report earnings. 4. G20 to sign off on tax deal World leaders converge on Rome, Italy, for an annual summit of the G 20 group of industrial and emerging nations. At least, some of them do \- Chinese president Xi Jinping is not attending. That alone should ensure that nothing of great substance is achieved politically, especially as regards forming a consensus on climate change ahead of the COP26 meeting next week, although the group will likely sign off on a global deal to ensure a minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. That new minimum rate is a key plank of U.S. Democrats plans to raise taxes on corporations to pay for what is now a heavily pruned spending bill. President Joe Biden said on Thursday he had agreed a framework for the bill which leaves its overall price add around $1.85 trillion, having shed much of the party's list of election promises. 5. Eurozone bonds get the jitters Eurozone government bond markets got the jitters, on perceptions that European Central bank president Christine Lagarde, in her press conference on Thursday, had pushed back only half-heartedly against suggestions that interest rates may have to rise next year. The 10-Year Italian government bond yield rose 16 basis points to 1.15%, hitting a new 14 month high. Benchmark Greek bonds followed suit, Highlighting the degree to which markets have been supported by extraordinary levels of ECB support for the last 18 months.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE179","Biden doubling down on Trump's ""destabilizing"" foreign policies","January 20, 2022 Thursday","Big News Network.com","President Biden and the Democrats were highly critical of President Trump's foreign policy, so it was reasonable to expect that Biden would quickly remedy its worst impacts. As a senior member of the Obama administration, Biden surely needed no schooling on Obama's diplomatic agreements with Cuba and Iran, both of which began to resolve long-standing foreign policy problems and provided models for the renewed emphasis on diplomacy that Biden was promising. Tragically for America and the world, Biden has failed to restore Obama's progressive initiatives and has instead doubled down on many of Trump's most dangerous and destabilizing policies. It is especially ironic and sad that a president who ran so stridently on being different from Trump has been so reluctant to reverse his regressive policies. Now the Democrats' failure to deliver on their promises with respect to both domestic and foreign policy is undermining their prospects in November's midterm election. Here is our assessment of Biden's handling of ten critical foreign policy issues: 1. Prolonging the agony of the people of Afghanistan. It is perhaps symptomatic of Biden's foreign policy problems that the signal achievement of his first year in office was an initiative launched by Trump, to withdraw the United States from its 20-year war in Afghanistan. But Biden's implementation of this policy was tainted by the same failure to understand Afghanistan that doomed and dogged at least three prior administrations and the U.S.'s hostile military occupation for 20 years, leading to the speedy restoration of the Taliban government and the televised chaos of the U.S. withdrawal. Now, instead of helping the Afghan people recover from two decades of U.S.-inflicted destruction, Biden has seized $9.4 billion in Afghan foreign currency reserves, while the people of Afghanistan suffer through a desperate humanitarian crisis. It is hard to imagine how even Donald Trump could be more cruel or vindictive. 2. Provoking a crisis with Russia over Ukraine. Biden's first year in office is ending with a dangerous escalation of tensions at the Russia/Ukraine border, a situation that threatens to devolve into a military conflict between the world's two most heavily armed nuclear statesthe United States and Russia. The United States bears much responsibility for this crisis by supporting the violent overthrow of the elected government of Ukraine in 2014, backing NATO expansion right up to Russia's border, and arming and training Ukrainian forces. Biden's failure to acknowledge Russia's legitimate security concerns has led to the present impasse, and Cold Warriors within his administration are threatening Russia instead of proposing concrete measures to de-escalate the situation. 3. Escalating Cold War tensions and a dangerous arms race with China. President Trump launched a tariff war with China that economically damaged both countries, and reignited a dangerous Cold War and arms race with China and Russia to justify an ever-increasing U.S. military budget. After a decade of unprecedented U.S. military spending and aggressive military expansion under Bush II and Obama, the U.S. ""pivot to Asia"" militarily encircled China, forcing it to invest in more robust defense forces and advanced weapons. Trump, in turn, used China's strengthened defenses as a pretext for further increases in U.S. military spending, launching a new arms race that has raised the existential risk of nuclear war to a new level. Biden has only exacerbated these dangerous international tensions. Alongside the risk of war, his aggressive policies toward China have led to an ominous rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans, and created obstacles to much-needed cooperation with China to address climate change, the pandemic and other global problems. 4. Abandoning Obama's nuclear agreement with Iran. After President Obama's sanctions against Iran utterly failed to force it to halt its civilian nuclear program, he finally took a progressive, diplomatic approach, which led to the JCPOA nuclear agreement in 2015. Iran scrupulously met all its obligations under the treaty, but Trump withdrew the United States from the JCPOA in 2018. Trump's withdrawal was vigorously condemned by Democrats, including candidate Biden, and Senator Sanders promised to rejoin the JCPOA on his first day in office if he became president. Instead of immediately rejoining an agreement that worked for all parties, the Biden administration thought it could pressure Iran to negotiate a ""better deal."" Exasperated Iranians instead elected a more conservative government and Iran moved forward on enhancing its nuclear program. A year later, and after eight rounds of shuttle diplomacy in Vienna, Biden hasstill not rejoined the agreement. Ending his first year in the White House with the threat of another Middle East war is enough to give Biden an ""F"" in diplomacy. 5. Backing Big Pharma over a People's Vaccine. Biden took office as the first Covid vaccines were being approved and rolled out across the United States and the world. Severe inequities in global vaccine distribution between rich and poor countries were immediately apparent and became known as ""vaccine apartheid."" Instead of manufacturing and distributing vaccines on a non-profit basis to tackle the pandemic as the global public health crisis that it is, the United States and other Western countries chose to maintain the neoliberal regime of patents and corporate monopolies on vaccine manufacture and distribution. The failure to open up the manufacture and distribution of vaccines to poorer countries gave the Covid virus free rein to spread and mutate, leading to new global waves of infection and death from the Delta and Omicron variants. Biden belatedly agreed to support a patent waiver for Covid vaccines under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, but with no real plan for a ""People's Vaccine,"" Biden's concession has made no impact on millions of preventable deaths. 6. Ensuring catastrophic global warming at COP26 in Glasgow. After Trump stubbornly ignored the climate crisis for four years, environmentalists were encouraged when Biden used his first days in office to rejoin the Paris climate accord and cancel the Keystone XL Pipeline. But by the time Biden got to Glasgow, he had let the centerpiece of his own climate plan, the Clean Energy Performance Program (CEPP), be stripped out of the Build Back Better bill in Congress at the behest of fossil-fuel industry sock-puppet Joe Manchin, turning the U.S. pledge of a 50% cut from 2005 emissions by 2030 into an empty promise. Biden's speech in Glasgow highlighted China and Russia's failures, neglecting to mention that the United States has higher emissions per capita than either of them. Even as COP26 was taking place, the Biden administration infuriated activists by putting oil and gas leases up for auction for 730,000 acres of the American West and 80 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico. At the one-year mark, Biden has talked the talk, but when it comes to confronting Big Oil, he is not walking the walk, and the whole world is paying the price. 7. Political prosecutions of Julian Assange, Daniel Hale and Guantanamo torture victims. Under President Biden, the United States remains a country where the systematic killing of civilians and other war crimes go unpunished, while whistleblowers who muster the courage to expose these horrific crimes to the public are prosecuted and jailed as political prisoners. In July 2021, former drone pilot Daniel Hale was sentenced to 45 months in prison for exposing the killing of civilians in America's drone wars. WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange still languishes in Belmarsh Prison in England, after 11 years fighting extradition to the United States for exposing U.S. war crimes. Twenty years after it set up an illegal concentration camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to imprison 779 mostly innocent people kidnapped around the world, 39 prisoners remain there in illegal, extrajudicial detention. Despite promises to close this sordid chapter of U.S. history, the prison is still functioning and Biden is allowing the Pentagon to actually build a new, closed courtroom at Guantanamo to more easily keep the workings of this gulag hidden from public scrutiny. 8. Economic siege warfare against the people of Cuba, Venezuela, and other countries. Trump unilaterally rolled back Obama's reforms on Cuba and recognized unelected Juan Guaid as the ""president"" of Venezuela, as the United States tightened the screws on its economy with ""maximum pressure"" sanctions. Biden has continued Trump's failed economic siege warfare against countries that resist U.S. imperial dictates, inflicting endless pain on their people without seriously imperiling, let alone bringing down, their governments. Brutal U.S. sanctions and efforts at regime change have universally failed for decades, serving mainly to undermine the United States's own democratic and human rights credentials. Juan Guaido is now the least popular opposition figure in Venezuela, and genuine grassroots movements opposed to U.S. intervention are bringing popular-democratic and socialist governments to power across Latin America, in Bolivia, Peru, Chile, Honduras - and maybe Brazil in 2022. 9. Still supporting Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen and its repressive ruler. Under Trump, Democrats and a minority of Republicans in Congress gradually built a bipartisan majority that voted to withdraw from the Saudi-led coalition attacking Yemen and stop sending arms to Saudi Arabia. Trump vetoed their efforts, but the Democratic election victory in 2020 should have led to an end to the war and humanitarian crisis in Yemen. Instead, Biden only issued an order to stop selling ""offensive"" weapons to Saudi Arabia, without clearly defining that term, and went on to okay a $650 billion weapons sale. The United States still supports the Saudi war, even as the resulting humanitarian crisis kills thousands of Yemeni children. And despite Biden's pledge to treat the Saudis' cruel leader, MBS, as a pariah, Biden refused to even sanction MBS for his barbaric murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. 10. Still complicit in the illegal Israeli occupation, settlements, and war crimes. The United States is Israel's largest arms supplier, and Israel is the world's largest recipient of U.S. military aid (approximately $4 billion annually), despite its illegal occupation of Palestine, widely condemned war crimes in Gaza, and illegal settlement building. U.S. military aid and arms sales to Israel clearly violate the U.S. Leahy Laws and Arms Export Control Act. Donald Trump was flagrant in his disdain for Palestinian rights, including transferring the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to a property in Jerusalem that is only partly within Israel's internationally recognized border, a move that infuriated Palestinians and drew international condemnation. But nothing has changed under Biden. The U.S. position on Israel and Palestine is as illegitimate and contradictory as ever, and the U.S. Embassy to Israel remains on illegally occupied land. In May, Biden supported the latest Israeli assault on Gaza, which killed 256 Palestinians, half of them civilians, including 66 children. Conclusion Each part of this foreign policy fiasco costs human lives and creates regionaleven globalinstability. In every case, progressive alternative policies are readily available. The only thing lacking is political will and independence from corrupt vested interests. The United States has squandered unprecedented wealth, global goodwill and a historic position of international leadership to pursue unattainable imperial ambitions, using military force and other forms of violence and coercion in flagrant violation of the UN Charter and international law. Candidate Biden promised to restore America's position of global leadership but has instead doubled down on the policies through which the United States lost that position in the first place, under a succession of Republican and Democratic administrations. Trump was only the latest iteration in America's race to the bottom. Biden has wasted a vital year doubling down on Trump's failed policies. In the coming year, we hope that the public will remind Biden of its deep-seated aversion to war and that he will respond-albeit reluctantly-by adopting more dovish and rational ways.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE180","Schneider Electric and the Global Footprint Network partner on ""100 Days of Possibility"" initiative to promote solutions to fight climate change","August 6, 2021 Friday","Arabian Post","HONG KONG SAR -\~Media OutReach - 5 August 2021 - Schneider Electric, the leader in the digital transformation of energy management and automation, and Global Footprint Network (GFN), a research organization that tracks how the world manages natural resources, today launched the ""100 Days of Possibility"" initiative. The initiative seeks to promote solutions that help address climate change and biodiversity loss. The launch of the initiative coincides with Earth Overshoot Day \- the date when humanity exhausts all ecological resources the planet can regenerate during an entire year. The 100 days referenced in the initiative's name mark the time left until the start of the 26th annual UN Climate Conference ( COP26 ), when government officials from around the globe will gather in Glasgow, Scotland, to try to agree on effective actions to combat climate change. The solutions highlighted by the project underpin its key message: Companies, governments and individuals can act now \- there is no need to wait for decisions to be made at COP26 . Opportunities and solutions across all sectors will be revealed each day leading up to COP26 at 100DaysofPossibility.org These will highlight the many ways that everyone can #MoveTheDate of Earth Overshoot Day. Examples include proposals for 100% renewable power grids, smart homes and food waste reduction. Schneider Electric, named world's most sustainable corporation by Corporate Knights Global 100 Index \~showed its support of the initiative by submitting six of its climate solutions to the ""100 Days"" list. Other partners in the project include the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and Drawdown Europe. One of the scalable solutions Schneider has contributed is the integration of a microgrid with an electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure in a Maryland-based smart energy bus depot in the US. It will be the first of its kind and help #MoveTheDate of Earth Overshoot Day by reducing carbon emissions by 62% among other benefits. Another example is with Schneider's office building, IntenCity, in Grenoble, France. IntenCity demonstrates how public and private sectors have joined forces to build cleaner and healthier communities. The building is designed to consume 7 kilowatt-hours per square meter each year  nearly 10 times less energy than the average European building consumes. Rooftop solar panels, two onsite wind turbines, the use of groundwater, and smart technology solutions enable the complex to consume and produce equal amounts of electricity over one year. A unique microgrid partnership facilitates energy sharing and coordination with the surrounding community. Another contribution is Schneider's recent agreement with the Egyptian Electricity Holding Company, the country's national utility provider. It will be the Middle East's first ever country-wide smart grid and help Egypt meet future energy demands while advancing its sustainability strategy. All three solutions will be highlighted during the launch of the ""100 days"" initiative and Schneider's remaining three contributions will be featured throughout the project.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE181","Middle East CEOs upbeat about 2022 as the pandemic recedes","February 7, 2022 Monday","ArabianBusiness.com","Optimism among the region's CEOs is on the rise with Expo 2020, the upcoming World Cup in Qatar, the strong vaccine rollout, commodity prices, rising consumer demand and strengthening fiscal positions all putting a spring in bosses' steps as they look ahead to 2022. So say Middle East findings contained within the 25th CEO Survey by global professional services giant PwC in its annual sentiment snapshot of boardroom. For its annual global survey, PwC surveyed thousands of CEOs in 89 countries and territories in October and November of 2021. The findings from the Middle East CEOs, revealed today, painted a rosier picture than last year with more than 8 out of 10 CEOs feeling the confidence, higher than the global average, and up 10 per cent on the year before. Indeed, nearly two-thirds of bosses in the region (64 per cent) are either 'extremely or very confident about their company's revenue growth prospects in 2022', markedly higher than the global survey average of 56 per cent. Hani Ashkar, Middle East senior partner, PwC Middle East, told Arabian Business: ""In last year's survey, we noticed that there was increasing optimism across CEOs and that trend towards more optimism has increased this year. This is particularly so in this region where we see two-thirds of the CEOs surveyed very confident around the prospects, and they've singled out a few things. ""We see a focus around digital transformation with more than half the CEOs having a big digital transformation project, or they are investing in doing so. ""Egypt is an important investment area, followed by Saudi Arabia and the UAE; these are the regional markets which CEOs are quite bullish about. ""The risks that came through from the survey were around cyber risk, and we were quite surprised that cyber featured highest on the list, followed by geopolitical risk or geopolitical conflict in our region, then the health risks including the pandemic. ""Overall, there is more confidence, CEOs are looking to invest, looking to grow, doing digital transformation, and getting back to developing leadership and upskilling employees, both of which have taken a backseat for a couple of years, but now are back in force."" The CEO Survey top level findings: Strong short-term optimism among Middle East CEOs CEOs in the region, according to the survey, remain quite optimistic about their near-term economic prospects. Middle East CEOs are more optimistic about global economic growth over the next 12 months - 82 per cent believe growth will improve compared to 72 per cent last year 64 per cent of Middle East CEOs are extremely or very confident about their company's prospects for revenue growth over the next 12 months Egypt (29 per cent) and Saudi Arabia (27 per cent) continue to be the top regional growth markets for Middle East CEOs followed by the UAE (18 percent) Cyber risks are on the rise amid digital transformation CEOs' near-term worries, the research revealed, are primarily about potential revenue disruptions. The top threats on CEOs' minds are cybersecurity, geopolitical conflict, macro volatility and health risks Middle East CEOs are primarily concerned about the potential for these threats to disrupt revenue growth plus hiring and retaining talent CEOs also worry that cyber risks could inhibit their ability to innovate over the next 12 months Investing in new technologies, leadership skills and people development key to sustainable growth CEOs are reviewing their priorities for the next three years, as the Middle East returns to growth, and the region's transformation accelerates. 52 per cent of Middle East CEOs plan double digit investments in digital transformation, 46 per cent in leadership and talent development and 39 per cent in cybersecurity and data privacy Other priorities reflect the shift from short term COVID-19 crisis management to building long-term strategies in rapidly changing markets. 46 per cent plan double-digit investments in leadership and talent development, compared with 30 per cent last year. Climate change and equality  CEOs in the region have a long way to go Rapid, business-driven progress against climate goals seems unlikely without system-wide change. Only 14 per cent of Middle East CEOs say greenhouse gas (GHG) emission targets feature in their long-term corporate strategies and just 5 per cent have made net-zero commitments Only 5 per cent have GHG in their bonus and incentive plans. Only a minority of CEOs say gender (29 per cent) and race and ethnicity representation rates (14 per cent) are included in their long-term corporate strategies, significantly lower than the global average. The report called out this lacklustre response to ESG, saying: ""We believe this lack of focus regarding climate change is unsustainable, given the undertakings made by Middle East governments at last November's COP26 conference in Glasgow, and national transformation programmes to reduce energy dependency."" Hani Ashkar underlined the findings, saying ""We asked about ESG, it did not feature heavily on people's radar screens. ""We were a little bit surprised by that,"" said the PwC Middle East senior partner. ""We're talking about the climate, we are talking about the energy transformation, we're talking about diversity as well. ""It didn't feature as heavily as we would have thought, not as heavily as it did across the rest of the world as well. So we probably took that to mean that our CEOs in the region a little bit behind on ESG, only 5 five per cent had a net-zero commitment. We at PwC, have our own net-zero commitment for 2030, and we've seen that it's actually quite challenging to get there. It means a lot of changes to our business model and how we operate, and so we expected that to feature more heavily."" Away from ESG, Ashkar said the region was more optimistic than the global average for a number of reasons. He said: ""We're in the midst of a lot of change and I think the energy prices added a bit of confidence to help people out, plus the handling of the pandemic. There's a bit of a catch up element in terms of investments. I think the fundamentals are good for a region that is growing, that needs to transform digitally, and that is undergoing a major energy transition. Those underpin the visions that we're seeing as well, such as Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 and the UAE's drive to be more competitive. ""I am pleased to see that regional business leaders share my confidence that renewed growth lies ahead. CEOs who have built trust with their customers, people and wider stakeholders through the pandemic are in a very strong position. These business leaders are now looking beyond COVID-19 with a focus on delivering sustained outcomes. ""Recognising that our region is transforming at speed, CEOs are channeling their energy towards a growth agenda, new business models, customer experiences and organisational efficiencies facilitated by cloud computing and digital tools. Meanwhile, they are upskilling their workforces and developing tomorrow's leaders.""

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE182","GCC regional trade and investment outlook for 2022","January 25, 2022 Tuesday","ArabianBusiness.com","It's time for the annual crystal ball, and I was very interested to read an article in the FT last week which said that 60 percent is the magic number. Apparently, if you're predicting something with a 60 percent probability it's high enough to be credible and show conviction, but low enough to give you the wiggle room if things don't eventuate as you forecast to avoid egg on face. Who'd have thought that fence-sitting has a number? That said, given the whirlwind of changes we have seen in the last 12 months in the GCC's trade and investment landscape, even 60 percent feels like a big punt. Who called even a fraction of all of the changes, new rules and developments of 2021? However, I think you can see a few themes and trends emerging that will continue into 2022 and probably beyond which I'm confident enough to put my name to here as being trends to watch in the year ahead. Firstly, ESG is here to stay in the region's foreign direct investment landscape. Multinationals have shareholder pressure and board obligations to operate sustainably \- many now have net-zero corporate commitments to meet \- and these apply to their entire global operations. As such, to become involved in projects in the GCC, these opportunities have to meet sustainability criteria to even be considered, and this is increasingly the primary deciding factor, ahead of top and bottom-line considerations. On a very visible level, we already see this in terms of corporate accommodation with the likes of District 2020 (the legacy development for Expo 2020 Dubai) drawing significant company interest on the basis of its genuine sustainability credentials. Expect to see more of this; landlords, developers and whole jurisdictions will have to very quickly shift with the times if they want to retain and attract serious corporate tenants. As my colleague Noha Al Dahri wrote on these pages in November, we're on the cusp of a seismic shift in the GCC's approach to sustainable energy. The immense scale of the projects, spending and activity required for the region's countries to meet their COP26 net zero commitments will traditional infrastructure projects in time. Expect to see this sector becoming the major driver of FDI throughout the Middle East in the coming years. This is also a sector where the region can become a global leader given the size of the projects, the amount of capital to be deployed and staunch political commitment to change. The impact in terms of developing a large skilled local labour force, having full R&D functions in the region, inward skills and technical transfers are massive and will all become major drivers of economic growth in their own right. One of the main features of 2021 has been the real emergence of competitive \- even aggressive \- FDI attraction policies in the region. The rapid unveiling of new rules and policies has distilled what feels like decades worth of reforms into 12 months and it's unlikely we're done yet. Of course, these changes undoubtedly make the GCC as a whole more competitive in a global context and throw up interesting opportunities for companies already in the region to look at alternative structures and locations. However, coming at a time while we're still dealing with Covid-19 and all of its complications and impacts, I do wonder if the corporate world would also appreciate a pause for breath in 2022 in order to allow some of the reforms to bed. This is unlikely. On a similar note, while the competition for FDI undoubtedly benefits companies by providing new and improved options, for SMEs forced to recalibrate again, evaluate a new jurisdiction and, increasingly, make a binary choice between two or more location options, the scramble for FDI isn't all good news. You can almost hear small companies screaming ""don't make me choose"" when they're presented with another requirement for them to be established in location X or country Y. FDI by obligation rarely leads to positive outcomes, for anyone, so the development of genuinely collaborative cross-border solutions, between countries or free zones, that recognise, welcome and endorse establishments from other regional jurisdictions would be truly exceptional and would most certainly benefit the protagonists own FDI attraction prospects. Skilled local labour force, having full R&D functions in the region, inward skills and technical transfers are massive and will all become major drivers of economic growth. This year could also be the year that Brexit comes to the region. The mood music, from both sides, suggests that a free trade agreement between the UK and the GCC might be in reach in the next 12 months, or at least that significant agreement may be met on the foundational terms and issues. This would obviously be good news for the two parties involved but would also signal the GCC's return as a cohesive bloc on such matters after the challenges of recent years, something which would benefit all other trading partners and FTA aspirants too. And finally, 2022 will be the year of legacy dividends for the region. For the UAE & Qatar, it's impossible to overstate the importance of Expo 2020 Dubai and the FIFA World Cup 2022 for each country, respectively. Here's to at least 60 percent of the above coming to fruition. Joe Hepworth is the director, OCO Middle East, and founder of the British Centres for Business (BCB).

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE183","Dell's Concept Luna could be a glimpse of future green-friendly laptops","December 14, 2021 Tuesday","TechRadar","Dell has revealed Concept Luna, a new prototype for a sustainable laptop that maximizes key aspects such as easy repairs and reusability of components, as well as reducing overall carbon footprint in terms of its production. Concept Luna is a proof-of-concept which Dell has worked on in conjunction with Intel, and note that it's not a laptop which will be made \- it's merely a concept to see what might be possible if PC makers pushed forward along these lines. Key facets of the design in terms of providing better repairability \- which is crucial for extending a device's lifespan, and therefore eco-friendliness \- include vastly reducing the number of screws used. In fact, with the Concept Luna design, only four screws need undoing to get to the internal components, streamlining any repairs (or scavenging operations for reusing parts) considerably. Dell has also put forward the idea of a new (bio-based) PCB made from flax fiber (rather than plastic) in the base, with a water-soluble polymer used as glue. In other words, unlike the usual glue often found \- and overused \- in too much hardware these days, this stuff can be easily dissolved with water. On the battery front, there's an ""advanced deep-cycle cell battery"" that's designed to last across ""many years"" of usage, so it can be reused in another device once its original hardware has died. The broad idea with the easy accessibility and it being simple to remove components is that these can all be removed from a piece of hardware which has died, and then reused in another device (and so on, going forward \- for the lifespan of the components, naturally). Treading lightly Forging forward with reducing the carbon footprint of the product includes shrinking the size of the motherboard by around 75%, as this is one of the biggest energy-using components to make, Dell notes. The number of components inside the machine is also reduced by around 20% in the concept device, and the layout of the internal hardware is optimized for better cooling (putting the motherboard in the top cover of the notebook, meaning the display section, so it's against a large surface area cooled by the outside air, to help with passive cooling). These various cooling efficiency measures will help with overall power consumption, meaning a smaller battery can be used, and the machine can rely totally on passive cooling rather than needing a fan. That chassis, incidentally, is an aluminum affair made using a stamped aluminum construction (and hydro power) to reduce energy usage in the production process. Dell states: ""If all the design ideas in Concept Luna were realized, we could expect to see an estimated 50% reduction in overall product carbon footprint."" (That's compared to the current Dell Latitude 7300 Anniversary Edition, incidentally). Analysis: The gap between concept and practical implementation Even if this is just a concept, it's an impressive sounding piece of work, and points to the kind of progress we can expect to be made in terms of PC manufacturing becoming more eco-friendly. Of course, the impact of manufacturing is coming increasingly under the microscope these days given climate change (and of course the recent COP26 summit). On the other hand, while Luna sounds like it brings forth some truly laudable ideas, the actual practical application of some of the measures \- without any meaningful trade-offs or compromises, particularly in the relocation of that super-compact motherboard to the laptop lid \- could be a difficult act to pull off, at least in the shorter term. Nonetheless, it's good to see Dell (and Intel) at least thinking about strategies for future more eco-friendly laptops.

In an editorial on Sunday, Gulf News said, ""Some 25,000 delegates from around the world are now wrapping up COP26 , the critical gathering for environmentalists, scientists, governmental officials and world leaders in an attempt to put the brakes on global warming and limit the rise of the Earth's temperature to just 1.5 degrees Celsius. ""Yes, there were some breakthroughs as nations agreed to cut methane gas emissions, stop deforestation, and China and the United States have agreed to work together to reach that 1.5 degree target. Overall though, efforts at Glasgow fell short and just increase pressure on world leaders, governments, companies and businesses - all of us - to act more forcefully now."" The paper continued, ""Already between the summits in Paris six years ago and now Glasgow, our environment is more unpredictable, weather events are more extreme and there is a significant and rising death toll associated with climate change as well as a soaring cost in monetary terms and in sheer monetary terms too."" The announcement of COP28 coming to the UAE was made on Thursday by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, who said, ""we will put all our potential and capabilities to make this conference a success."" Fifty years ago, when this nation was founded, the leaders had a profound respect for the environment and how its conditions shaped its culture, history and people. Hosting COP28 is testament to the UAE's long history and commitment to fighting climate change, developing and securing alternative forms of energy, being committed to renewable energy and making decision for the right reasons for this planet, the editorial noted. The Dubai-based daily concluded by saying, ""For those of us who live in the UAE, we know when that when it puts its mind to getting things done, it succeeds. Failure is never an option. Now that same drive and energy must be harnessed to make COP28 a success as there simply is no plan B for the planet."" \"

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE188","KT Edit: Political will is what's needed to fight Delhi pollution crisis","November 17, 2021 Wednesday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","Right now, what is happening in Delhi  officially the most polluted capital city in the world  vis-\'e0-vis environmental regulations is an encapsulation of what climate change activists have been saying of the COP26 conference: that it is ""blah, blah, blah"" (articulated by Greta Thunberg). The Indian prime minister announced that the country ""pledges"" to hit net zero emissions by 2070, which is a really long way off. It's akin to saying ""in the foreseeable future"" without any commitment. But more to the point, if India is failing to contain pollution that is spiralling out of control in its capital city, how does it plan to launch a nationwide movement  even in the foreseeable future? Let's set the baseline first. According to the World Health Organisation's safety guidelines, the PM2.5 (tiny, toxic particles that can clog lungs and give rise to a host of health complications) level, should, ideally, be between the 0 and 50 a range. Delhi, currently, is reporting staggering levels: hovering around 400, and even higher (in certain areas). That is not even bad or poor; it's hazardous. The city is covered in smog, schools are being shut down, and it has devolved into a situation that can be safely classified as an emergency. For many years now, the Delhi state of affairs at this time of the year  post Diwali, pre-winter  has been debated endlessly. Everyone concerned appears to know exactly what leads to this unfailing annual episode that is getting worse by the year: the burning of farm stubble in neighbouring states, traffic and factory emissions, and fireworks during north India's biggest festival  all of which get a life of their own in the wake of changing weather as temperatures dip in the region. And yet, everyone appears to do nothing about it. What India needs immediately is enforcement. The reasons for the current crisis engulfing Delhi in a gray haze have been identified, but there is this tendency to be complacent once things get back to a semblance of normalcy: instead of addressing the issue on a war footing, it's put on the backburner and conveniently forgotten till it comes back, more intensified, the next year. Take the matter of stubble burning. What can't it be resolved? Why can't it be stopped, and an alternative recourse created? Different states will start sniping at each other, citing reasons of political ideologies and social divisions. If climate change is a global challenge, the least that can be done is to treat it as a national commitment, and rise above petty bickering and delaying tactics. \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE189","Riding High","December 28, 2021 Tuesday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","TIER, Europe's leading shared micro-mobility provider, recently announced the launch of its next-generation e-scooter  the TIER V scooter  rolling out in Dubai. The launch of the new e-scooters comes in line with the UAE's vision to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.

We would like to wish them the best and are confident for a very successful COP in the Asia Pacific region in 2023."" 30 years of climate action For more than three decades, the UAE has acted with foresight in tackling climate change. The nation has shown unwavering commitment towards investment projects aimed at mitigating and adapting to climate challenges, and more importantly, creating a positive economic impact for its people. A critical player in the region, the UAE is now calling for bolder action. This October, it launched the Net Zero by 2050 Strategy, an ambitious national drive to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. In addition, the UAE is determined to support the international community and find practical ways to implement and drive change. It is also calling for closer analysis of future climate-related risks and ""anticipatory action"" \- a humanitarian model that releases resources in advance of reliably predicted climate disasters. Dr. Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and UAE Special Envoy for Climate Change, said, ""COP 28 will be especially significant as the first stocktake of national commitments after the Paris Agreement. Our goal will be to make COP 28 as inclusive and action-oriented as possible; a solutions COP that brings together developed and developing countries and unites all sectors - public, private, academic and civil society - around a focus on tangible solutions."" Investments in clean energy projects The use of renewable energy has been integral to the UAE's multifaceted strategy to reduce emissions and ward off the worst effects of global warming. These initiatives include solar power, carbon capture, and hydrocarbon energy. In recent years, UAE has invested an estimated US$17 billion in clean energy projects in 70 countries, with a focus on developing countries. In 2021, the UAE organised the regional climate dialogue, and participated in the Leaders Summit on Climate, where it extended its commitment to sustainable agriculture and farming. Recognising that food systems account for almost one-quarter of all global carbon emissions, the UAE partnered with 39 other countries to launch the Agriculture Innovation Mission (AIM) for Climate. The UAE is home to three of the world's largest and lowest-cost solar plants. Whether achieving the world's lowest-cost solar power, introducing biodiversity conversation targets, deploying commercial-scale carbon capture technology, running a zero-carbon nuclear power plant, and pursuing hydrogen energy, the UAE has been a pioneer of significant climate initiatives in the region. Further supporting the UAE Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) has announced that it will decarbonise its power grid at scale through nuclear and solar clean energy sources, starting January 2022, marking a global-first by a major oil and gas company. A holistic approach to climate action Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, UAE Minister of Climate Change and the Environment, is keen to build on the UAE's strong track record of climate action, and says the nation wants to help create the right ecosystem to scale up innovation. This will require an equal focus on investment capital, R&D, technology commercialization and project delivery. ""We will leverage our natural and competitive advantages as a producer of the least carbon-intensive hydrocarbons for as long as the world relies on a diversified energy mix. We will use this experience as a centre of excellence to become a destination for innovation across the sustainable energy value chain,"" she said. Since the UAE first ratified the Vienna Convention for the protection of the Ozone layer in 1989, it has joined the UNFCC (1995), signed the Paris Agreement (2015) and ratified the Kyoto Protocol (2005), as well as organised the Abu Dhabi Climate meeting two years ago. Moreover, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) officially inaugurated its permanent headquarters at Masdar City in Abu Dhabi, a low-carbon urban development featuring innovative solutions in energy and water efficiency, mobility and waste reduction. \"

Previously known as the Saudi Arabian Oil Co., Aramco announced its net income more than doubled from $11.8 billion during the same three-month period one year earlier, after profits plunged dramatically last year due to a drop in oil prices caused by global lockdowns. Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said the company's third-quarter results are ""exceptional."" The 158 percent rise in earnings are due to the international loosening of COVID-19 restrictions, the higher demand for gas supplies and the increase in global vaccination rates that greatly increased prices of crude oil. On Sunday, the price of international benchmark Brent crude was trading at over $83.50 per barrel. Consumers and companies are also using more gasoline and airplane fuel, as governments relax restrictions. ""We are optimistic that energy demand will remain healthy for the foreseeable future,"" Nasser added. Crude prices have also been supported by production cuts made by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies. Shares of Aramco finished 0.4 percent higher on Sunday following the report, and the company's market capitalization was recorded at $2 trillion, just below Apple's, makes it one of the world's most valuable companies. Aramco declared a dividend of $18.8 billion in the third quarter, in line with its target, which will be paid in the fourth quarter. Free cash flow rose to $28.7 billion, solidly above the state-backed firm's quarterly dividend. Mostly directed toward pumping more oil, the firm's capital expenditure was $7.6 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 19 percent from last year. Aramco announced its earnings as COP26 began in Glasgow this week, where world leaders will discuss ways of tackling climate change. As part of a group of 100 countries, Saudi Arabia has pledged to cut its carbon emissions to net-zero by 2060, but it has no plans to give up its status as a global oil and gas production leader.

We stepped into 2021 with a heightened sense of conviction that we must challenge ourselves to think bigger and do much more in partnership with others to take care of the planet we share. Last month, Virgin Mobile UAE turned its operation Carbon Neutral. Our next step is to work towards being Carbon Negative and we hope that by launching this new digital app feature we can achieve that together with our customers. By committing to match every contribution our customers make we want to demonstrate how together we can build a better future. With these new innovations and creative ideas, we are confident that we can make Virgin Mobile UAE the first truly Carbon Negative mobile brand globally, by the end of 2022."" As the leading first fully digital customer focused mobile brand in the UAE, Virgin Mobile achieved net zero carbon emissions this year through investments in multiple business and community projects in partnership with the Dubai Carbon Centre of Excellence. With the help of Dubai Carbon Centre of Excellence, Virgin Mobile UAE received critical insights into total emissions across all elements of its business. Emissions calculations were used to create and implement wide-ranging sustainable processes for the reduction of Virgin Mobile UAE's overall operational emissions including new ways of working related to business travel, reduction and reuse of materials, energy efficiency, and sustainability awareness and education initiatives. This led Virgin Mobile to create a new app feature that allows customers to make a small contribution to offset the carbon emissions that are produced when they use their Virgin Mobile plan, for data and voice consumption. Furthermore, the organisation supports local community projects through investment and partnerships such as the first landfill gas (LFG)-to-energy project in the Middle East, located in Dubai. Led by Green Energy Solutions & Sustainability LLC (GESS) and certified by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Charge (UNFCCC), GESS focuses on waste management in the Mena region, specifically landfill gas project development which sees it convert waste gas into renewable energy.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE196","Buying an EV could get cheaper in India - here's how","December 6, 2021 Monday","TechRadar","India revised the much-vaunted FAME II policy to accelerate the adoption of EVs in the country. The federal minister for Transport Nitin Gadkari recently said the cost of electric vehicles would come down over the next couple of years. Right on cue, the government's policy think tank has brought a proposal to make them cheaper. Niti Aayog has given a proposal to bring institutional lending to purchase electric vehicles under the priority sector ambit. Simply put, this means banks loans for buying electric vehicles could become cheaper. As of now, the loans are extended under auto retail category --- among the high interest categories in India. India's central clearing bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), is now considering the proposal and a decision on this is expected after confabs with other stakeholders. Tata Motors to launch 10 new electric vehicles by 2026 Ather Energy ups the ante - ramps up its EV production with a new plant Delays expected in Ola Electric scooter deliveries Niti Aayog chief thinks there is a clear case The financial daily Economic Times has quoted Niti Aayog chief Amitabh Kant as saying ""The inclusion of EVs under PSL (priority sector lending) would not only reduce cost of finance but also provide finance to more people, thus increasing penetration of EVs in India. He added: ""Our view is that there is a case for this in the context of the impending climate change crisis and India's recent commitments at COP26 in Glasgow."" India has committed itself, at the Glasgow Climate Change Conference last month, to a target of lowering the total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes by 2030 and cutting emissions to net zero by 2070. EV manufacturers have also written to the RBI for extending priority sector lending to them. As it happens, non-banking financial lenders are also looking at the sector with keen interest. But, are the banks keen enough? While the think tank and the transport ministry are pushing the envelope to make electric vehicles cheaper in India is one thing, the banking sector, on the other hand, may not be all that warm to the idea. Lending for purchase of vehicles is among the high-risk list in India. To reduce bank lending rates is to invite more danger is the general thinking of the bankers. Banking norms mandate that 40% of lenders' total credit must be made to those branded as 'priority sector'. Currently, these include agriculture, small businesses, export credit, education, housing, social infrastructure and renewable energy. Will the RBI ride rough shod over the apprehensions of the banks? Well, it is a question that has no easy answers. Kant himself has claimed that the process for inclusion of EVs under PSL requires extensive deliberations and consultations to have a targeted outcome of increased access and reduced cost of finance to this sector. According to recent stats, electric cars saw a staggering growth of 234% in the six months of April to September 2021. During this period over 6261 personal electric vehicles were sold in the country. This number is already way more than the total number of electric car sales for the entire FY2021. In the first half of the current fiscal, in all, EV sales more than tripled to 118,000 units. But the sobering perspective is, during the same part of the fiscal year, 13,87,714 PVs were sold in the country and EVs are a mere 0.45% of the total market size. So EVs could do with priority sector lending. Best electric scooters you can buy in India right now Want to know about the latest happenings in tech?

Titled 'Energy Transition: From Commitments to Action', the assembly witnessed ministers, heads of state and decision-makers follow-up on the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) and discuss ways to implement and accelerate the commitments. Mariam Bint Mohammed Saeed Hareb Almheiri, Minister of Climate Change and Environment, in her address, pointed out that the UAE has initiated several initiatives and projects to build a sustainable future. ALSO READ: In October 2021, the UAE launched its Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative, becoming the first country in the Mena region to do so \- a drive in line with the norms set out by the 2015 Paris Agreement. ""To fulfil this ambition, the UAE is working on a sustainable economic growth model that will leverage research, development and innovation, and act as a catalyst for job creation with the aim of supporting national economy diversification."" Almheiri underlined that renewable energy will play a ""fundamental role"" in pursuing climate neutrality. The UAE, she said, through its sustained efforts over the past 15 years, has more than 2.8GW of solar PV capacity in place and expects another 2GW to become operational with the inauguration of the Al Dhafra project. ""It (Al Dhafra solar project) is set to come online within this year."" The UAE is diversifying energy sources by developing alternative, more sustainable sources of energy, including the flagship initiative of building the blue and green economy. In November 2021, the UAE and IRENA announced the Energy Transition Accelerator Financing (ETAF) Platform with an aim to secure up to $1 billion in funding to accelerate the transition to renewable energy in developing countries. ""The UAE, through the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development, has pledged $400 million in funding to the platform,"" the minister said. In December, TAQA, Mubadala and ADNOC became shareholders of Masdar, thereby creating a global powerhouse in renewables and green hydrogen. And next year, the UAE will host the COP28 with the participation of nearly 200 countries. ""I encourage everyone to work diligently to demonstrate that renewable energy is a key part of climate action over the next two years until the COP28 Conference takes place in 2023. Together, we look forward to more impactful accomplishments to build a sustainable future,"" the Emirati minister added. Alexandra Hill Tinoco, Minister of Foreign Affairs, El Salvador, who was elected as the president of the 12th session of the assembly, said: ""IRENA has 167 member countries. We have great capabilities to create synergies and bring about positive transformation worldwide."" Tinoco underlined that 80 per cent of energy produced in El Salvador comes from renewable sources. ""El Salvador is committed to working closely with IRENA and its members to achieve the vision of the future,"" she added. Teresa Ribera, Deputy Prime Minister, Spain, highlighted the need to shift discussions to the next level with regards to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees. ""The urgency to embark on the 1.5-degree pathway is palpable. It is not an impossible task. It is challenging and full of opportunities,"" the outgoing president of the assembly said. Ribera, Minister for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge, Spain, noted that the world added more than 260 GW of renewable energy capacity in 2020 \- an increase of close to 50 per cent from 2019. ""If we were able to realise this achievement in a time of unprecedented challenges and uncertainty, then we can certainly take bigger and faster steps to accelerate the energy transition in a way that is balanced, inclusive, ambitions consistent with the scientific consensus and aligned with the needs of people,"" she added. Covid-19: Unvaccinated people not allowed at public places from tomorrow in Assam CM rules out lockdown Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Saturday announced that those who are not fully vaccinated against COVID-19 will not be allowed to enter public places like district courts, hotels, markets etc. from Sunday.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE198","Net Zero City captures the UAE's path-breaking climate change policies","March 17, 2022 Thursday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","Climate change is an alarming topic, but what is often overlooked is the fact that to attain sustainability, action must begin in cities. Rapid urbanisation has resulted in overburdened infrastructure and services and unplanned sprawl. By 2050, cities will host another 2.5 billion urban dwellers, making the world's population 80 per cent urban. Net Zero City, the region's first book on the transition to Net Zero, has signalled the urgent wake-up call for swift corrective action. The book - authored by Farah Naz, a climate strategist and Lead of Specialist Services, Sustainable ESG Solutions for AECOM Middle East, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Africa and a Dubai resident since 2015, and Langdon Morris, a globally renowned author, consultant and a speaker on innovation and sustainability- is a detailed, definitive, and action-orientated roadmap to guide any city in the transition to this critical new approach. The book will be launched in Dubai, which will host the Middle East Climate Week, supported by United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), between March 28 and 31. Khaleej Times spoke with Naz ahead of the launch of the book. Morris and I shared a great concern about climate change and its impact on people and cities. The project started as a research project by Morris in the London School of Economics in 2020, where I was his industry supervisor/ partner. Globally climate and biodiversity were announced in 2019, which means a situation in which urgent action is required to reduce or halt climate change and avoid potentially irreversible environmental damage resulting from it. The effect of climate change is already causing severe disruptions in how we live, work, and play. In future, it may cause more disruptions. As we both started working together, we saw that while cities produce significant amounts of greenhouse gases, there did not seem to be a comprehensive guide that showed how cities could take an Integrated approach to reaching net zero transition from governance to technical solutions. So, we set out to write one. Work started summer of 2020 and was completed in autumn of 2021. What we have discovered through our research is that there is a tremendous amount of material available on the topic of net zero, many fine examples and initiatives to reduce greenhouse gases from all over the world. But they are point solutions, so, perhaps, our biggest challenge was coming up with an overall strategy and roadmap that integrates all the information, numerous case studies and examples into a coherent action plan. This was one of our key goals for the book, and it took quite a long time. We interviewed people globally and engaged with students and researchers to identify the path to least resistance. Even though both of us authored the book, we are only the messengers. The book encompasses a comprehensive approach to Net zero transition for cities covering five key areas: Governance, Urban Design, Circular Economy, Energy (Food energy water nexus and Energy Infrastructure), Innovation and Data Science. Finally, we were able to develop a comprehensive framework that seems to be quite useful. In the book we present a 10 Year Transformation Roadmap for cities. We believe cities can adopt a ""Climate Smart Master plan"" that addresses the Net Zero Transition as an underlying Urban Framework. This framework would enable the city to establish and better understand the Carbon emissions from key sectors like: This book addresses this very topic. We present a 10-year Transformation Roadmap for cities, providing multifaceted pathways to overcome the Climate Emergency by attaining Net Zero. This book is an open call for action for the global community to rise up to the challenge, and shows how we can choose a new way of thinking and doing How long have you been living and working as an engineer in the UAE? Since arriving in Dubai in 2015, I have been steering a sustainability and innovation agenda in the built environment across the Middle East. I have led the sustainability and innovation strategy at the Museum of the Future, Louvre Museum in Abu Dhabi, Bee£h HQ in Sharjah, Masdar Eco Housing, and the Expo 2020 Sustainability Pavilion, including liveability and energy strategy for key master planning projects across the region. While based in the United Kingdom, I was involved in creating the energy strategy for the country's first zero-energy building, Ashmount Primary School, which won the 2015 Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Sustainable Buildings Award. As an innovator, I focus on implementing best practices in the built environment by applying systems thinking related to the Food-Energy-Water Nexus, biomimetics, Capital model of Sustainability, Liveability, and Inclusive Integrated Innovation Frameworks, which I believe build the foundation of our cities and communities. What kind of initiatives is the UAE taking towards a transition to Net Zero? Last November, before the COP-26 summit, the UAE announced their commitment to becoming net-zero by 2050. The UAE Net Zero 2050 strategic initiative aligns with the Paris Agreement, which calls on countries to prepare long-term strategies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and limit the rise in global temperature to 1.5 C compared to pre-industrial levels. The Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE) will lead and coordinate efforts to execute the UAE Net Zero by 2050 strategic initiative and ensure collaboration at the national level to fulfil this objective. The following actions have been taken by the UAE to date: - An innovation Centre to support the demonstration, commercialisation, and adoption of sustainable energy technologies - A development company focused on the commercialisation of emissions reduction and clean development mechanism solutions as provided by the Kyoto Protocol - A special economic zone to host institutions investing in renewable energy technology. In the last six years, the concept of Smart Cities have evolved into Climate-Smart Cities EXPO 2020 is a Micro Scale innovation of Lab of a Futurist Climate-smart city. In Expo, we are experiencing - Inclusive Integrated Innovation, where people display and talk about Technical Innovation, even how the pavilions are built their architecture; engineering is a testament to this technical innovation. Entrepreneurs express business innovation, and businesses focus on the commercial and business development of the products and ideas to live, as well as social innovation is taking place with all the learnings and awareness. Terra Pavillion - the exhibitions inspire an individual to question his/her role in this planet and inspire a child to think outside of the box. I believe, as humans are not defined by the vision of the future, we are left with old decisions of the past. Past is important to know our roots, but it also should work as a catalyst to create the blueprint of the future. This is what I see the UAE has done. They have jumped orbits in creating a vision for the future, and now, with Net Zero Agenda and Climate-smart cities we would be experiencing another orbital jump in establishing a Climate Smart City. How serious is the climate change threat to the UAE like the rest of the world? The challenges to the natural environment today are immense. The UAE faces the impact of rapid development and the effects of climate change and global warming. Protection of the environment and sustainable development are key topics that receive great attention from the UAE Government. The UAE's rapid economic development made the country face serious environmental challenges that arise from the high pace of population growth, the increase in the demand for energy and water and the fast-paced urban development accompanied with high levels of GHG and other emissions in the UAE. According to the Living Planet Report 2010 by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the UAE was rated number one in the world for having the biggest ecological footprint. The ecological footprint is a measure of a country's sustainability that compares the use of natural resources per person per capita, which is expressed by a unit of bio-productive land called the 'global hectare' (gha). Key environment threats include: Invasive Species Limited water resource Overfishing Air and water pollution Waste generation Land degradation and desertification Which country and city in the region is most equipped to emerge as Net Zero? Most countries in the Middle East are facing the impacts of extreme weather conditions and climate change. There is no doubt now that there really is a climate emergency, but there is a lot of uncertainty about what we must do to address it. The COP 26 meeting in Glasgow in November 2021 clearly highlights the difficulties we have as a global society in coping with systemic problems of this magnitude. In Glasgow, there was essentially no disagreement about the nature and scope of the problem, but a lot of dithering about what to do. There is now no doubt that the destiny of humanity lies in our cities. The human population crossed the halfway point around 2010 on our journey toward becoming a fully urbanised civilisation, and each day the populations of our cities continue to increase while rural populations decline. This urban growth is occurring in a time of great turbulence, and due particularly to worsening climate change, the fate of these very cities is now in question. Will they thrive, or will they be overwhelmed by tumultuous storms and bitter droughts brought on by climate change? Much of the human situation during the next century will be defined according to our capacity to adapt to this new, entirely unprecedented, and frightening set of climate conditions. But in fact, we have no choice but to adapt, which also means that we must innovate and prolifically. So, perhaps, it is our ability to innovate that will largely determine our fate. Innovate well and we can survive and thrive; fail to innovate and we are doomed to prolonged suffering and decline. The necessary innovations will be developed across countless dimensions of modern society. They will involve how we build, what we build, and what we build with. They will impact our systems of food and water, our ideas about a healthy economy, our approaches to governance and decision making, and our use of technology. And perhaps most of all, they will involve a fundamental change to the energy infrastructure of civilisation, both where we get our energy from, and how we use it. CO2-producing fossil fuels will be replaced by sources that do not produce greenhouse gases, a switch that's going to be expensive and disruptive, which means it's a technological, economic, and social transformation. But with it also comes a unique and enormous opportunity. Achieving Net Zero Achieving Net Zero is a complex problem, and it will not be solved by simplistic thinking or actions. In the book we propose that to deal with it effectively we require a few key solution elements: We need a framework model to describe the system city, for which we propose an Urban System Framework consisting of five key elements that make the city what it is. There are several mega developments in the region in countries like the UAE and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Can these projects be delivered sustainably (there are ambitious sustainability targets) or does sustainability automatically suffer due to the scale of projects and the number of different components? Getting to net-zero is politically challenging as it is socially, economically, and structurally challenging. The intent of the book is to provide a comprehensive action plan describing the critical elements of the net-zero transformations we speak about. It is aimed at city leaders and business leaders, entrepreneurs and innovators, citizens and parents, professionals across all fields, including architecture, engineering, and construction. It is also for the dreamers and visionaries. It's for all of us, and its purpose is to describe actions that are already being taken all over the world as best practices that may also be applied very widely, and to provide a transformation framework for cities. All this is intended to shift the dialogue from ""wait and see"" to ""act now."" COP26 showed us that our cities and countries must start now. Therefore, we must design and engineer this transition and make it happen on a timescale that is exceptionally fast by the standards of how cities normally evolve. And so, this will apparently be the first time in the long history of human civilisation that we have attempted, or achieved, such a planned and intentional change at such a large scale and on such an accelerated timeline. The choices we make today will redefine our pathway forward, and a great deal depends on our capacity to do this well - a great deal of destruction and suffering will be avoided if we do, and so it is a practical as well as a moral imperative. How then should we approach making fundamental change to this very complex system - or more accurately, as we noted above, this system-of-systems? First, we need an organisational perspective, an Urban System Framework that enables us to understand and manage the broad complexity of the net-zero transformation challenge, the transformation of nothing less than civilisation. This we present in the book. Secondly, we need a general Theory of Social Change to guide us through the very challenging process of changing ourselves, the city, and civilisation. We present a Theory of Social Change in Chapter 5. Thirdly, we need to know what to do, and this requires a definition of the necessary action practices and examples that show us how - this we address in detail in part two of the book. And finally, we need a Transformation Roadmap showing us how to proceed, step by step, which we present in part three of the book. History will not look back favourably upon us if we fail to meet this challenge, but it will appreciate us for doing what is now clearly necessary. There are more than 100 examples presented in the book that clearly show we certainly act now and do something about it. We need to define a pathway, which we propose as a Four Phase emodel. And we need to identify the actions that you can take with respect to each sector of the framework, which address with a detailed Transformation Roadmap. The book has captured the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, who has been championing sustainability for over a decade by including examples from Dubai UAE and Expo 2020 Dubai as one of the Global Best Practices. The book is meant for city leaders as well architects, engineers and urban designers, the public, youth, and indeed anyone who is interested in or working in the Built Environment. And especially it is for everyone who is concerned about climate change and wishes to understand the actions that are needed to overcome it. Most critically, the book is an open call for Climate Action to transform new and existing cities into Net Zero Cities, and by offering the Net Zero Transformation Roadmap to get there. The book echoes the visionary leadership of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, through the following words. The future does not wait for the hesitant people. how much more we can achieve. We may not live for hundreds of years, but the products of our creativity can leave a legacy long after we are gone.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE200","MENA Fintech Association launches Sustainable Fintech Alliance","January 13, 2022 Thursday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","The MENA Fintech Association (MFTA), the leading voice of the Fintech community in the region, has launched the Sustainable Fintech Alliance, with the mission of helping its members create positive impacts in the face of the increasingly urgent environmental and social challenges of today. The world is at a critical juncture and the MENA region is set to take the centre stage in the quest for resolving the most defining issue of our time, climate change. After the recent conclusion of COP26 in Glasgow, the torch is in fact being passed to Egypt and the UAE as hosts of COP27 and COP28 respectively. Sustainability is broader than climate change. It is about enabling a society where future generations can thrive, and everyone needs to contribute their fair share. Nameer Khan, Chairman and Founding Board Member of MFTA said: ""We are extremely excited to be launching the Sustainable Fintech Alliance as part of MFTA's core initiatives. We see momentum picking up in the region and, as an Association that brings together stakeholders from across the region, with excellent relationships with central banks and regulators, MFTA has a key role in supporting the transition towards a more sustainable society. We want to help Fintechs embrace sustainability as part of their organizations' culture and values, and ensure they have access to high quality knowledge and resources. Problem-solving is built into the DNA of Fintechs, and we believe they are also uniquely positioned to think creatively and collaboratively to bring sustainability front and centre in consumers' lives. I am personally invested in harnessing technology and innovation to reimagine financial services from the lens of sustainability, and I am committed to making this a core priority of MFTA's engagement with Fintechs and regulators going forward."" By joining the Alliance, members commit to gradually implementing credible and transparent sustainability strategies within their organisations, which contribute towards the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and also the Net Zero pledges made by several countries across the region. Companies are at different levels of maturity when it comes to embed sustainability within their organisations, and Fintechs are no different. This is why education and awareness will be central to achieving the Alliance's mission. The Sustainable Fintech Alliance is therefore committing to a phased, three steps approach: Education As a first, critical step in this journey, MFTA is working with institutional and academic partners to design a robust educational programme that will equip Fintechs with the knowledge base they need to develop solid sustainability strategies that are right for them. This will be based on international best practice and will be delivered with support from leading experts, as well as a knowledge exchange platform between members. Implementation Having obtained the right knowledge and learnt about leading global standards, Fintechs will be able to set credible sustainability and climate-related goals that align to their company's values and customers' expectations, while making a positive contribution towards the achievement of the SDGs. At this stage, members can publicly disclose their strategy and commitments. Realisation Transparency is critical in order to gain people's trust. So once the strategy and commitments have been communicated, these will need to be consistently followed up and measured. At this stage, members will feel confident to track the progress made and, through the Alliance, they will have continuous access to all the help and support they need. MFTA passionately believes that the Fintech community has a critical role to play in finding solutions for the most urgent issues we face as a society. This is why, in addition to helping members embrace sustainability within their organisations, the Alliance will also enable collaboration between the Fintech community and policymakers within the financial sector and beyond, with the aim of putting technology at the service of purposeful change. Christian Kunz, Head of Group Strategy and Innovation at DIFC Authority, and Chair of the Dubai Sustainable Finance Working Group said: ""We are proud to be member of this founding group and a part of the Sustainable Fintech Alliance, aiming to create a positive impact with the help of the different partners, beginning with education. In line with the UAE's recently announced strategic initiative to achieve net zero emission production by 2050, we recognise the importance of sustainability and are committed to being at the forefront of important issues such as this in the region. Today, the market capitalisation of ESG-inspired Sukuk and bonds is growing at a high pace in DIFC, now making up over 11.7 per cent of the total outstanding bonds, in excess of $12.15 billion. At DIFC, we are continuing our efforts to cement our position as the leading innovation ecosystem in the UAE, unlocking future growth through the Future of Finance and Future Economies."" Mercedes Vela Monserrate Head of Sustainable Finance at ADGM: ""ADGM is committed to working in line with the UAE's vision to achieving its Net Zero by 2050 strategic Initiative. The Sustainable Fintech Alliance serves as a significant contributor to the progression of innovative sustainable solutions to unlock and catalyse multiple sources of financing in alignment with ADGM's FinTech and Sustainable Finance Initiatives. It is with pride that ADGM ascribes to the Sustainable Fintech Alliance as a founding member and we look forward to supporting the collective effort towards a sustainable future for tomorrow's generation."" Kareem Refaay, Managing Director, The London Institute of Banking & Finance MENA said: ""At LIBF, we are the lifelong partner in financial education, and as such, designing and developing a programme centred around sustainability in finance and fintech is at the core of LIBF. With our research centres in both niches, our expert faculty and industry practitioners, it is our pleasure to be part of such an initiative in partnership with stakeholders.

""When we held the Climate Conversations earlier this year to prepare the Climate Action Plan, one of the key messages from the public was that they want Government to support and incentivise the kind of changes we need to make at community level. While government will make major investments through the National Development Plan, I encourage people to apply for this community funding to find creative solutions at a local level, whether that's promoting biodiversity or funding an electric vehicle for a community group to make greener transport more accessible."" Minister of State at the Department of Rural and Community Development with special responsibility for Community Development and Charities, Joe O'Brien added: ""The community and voluntary sector will be a crucial partner in ensuring that people in local communities across Ireland, and indeed the world, are engaged in, and feel part of, the required changes. The sector will also play a crucial role in helping us to ensure that the most vulnerable are protected and we achieve a truly Just Transition. The Climate Conversations were a crucial piece of work but we must ensure that ongoing dialogue is central to how we proceed with the climate actions necessary to improve all our lives."" \"

Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray told officials on Wednesday that even as the state opens up gradually, citizens must be encouraged to opt for vaccination. Mumbai, Pune, Thane and Nagpur were among the worst-hit cities in India because of a spike in Covid-19-related fatalities. However, there has been a sharp decline in viral outbreaks over the past few weeks. On Tuesday, three deaths were recorded in Mumbai  the lowest in 70 days  while active cases dipped sharply since the deadly disease ravaged the western Indian state. The total number of active cases in Maharashtra is below 15,500, and in Mumbai, 4,250 people are still battling the disease. ALSO READ: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who returned to India after attending the G20 and COP26 meetings in Rome and Glasgow, respectively, told officials of 40 districts with low Covid-19 vaccination coverage on Wednesday, including a few in Maharashtra. ""The doors of all houses will be knocked where people have still not received both doses of vaccine,"" Modi told the officials from districts in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand and a few others in the northeast. ""They say one must never underestimate disease and enemies. They have to be fought against till the very end,"" he added. Officials are worried about a likely spike in Covid-19 cases amid the festive season and Diwali being celebrated tomorrow. Many popular shopping hubs in cities, including Mumbai and Pune, saw thousands of people thronging over the past few days, many not wearing masks. ""Citizens must be made aware that although infection has decreased, Covid has not gone yet,"" said Thackeray. ""In addition to vaccination, awareness campaigns should be carried out to keep people aware to curb Covid,"" he added. Most of the major markets in Mumbai are witnessing a massive turnout of shoppers. However, Mumbai civic officials are hoping that the massive vaccination programme will prevent a spurt in the number of new Covid cases. Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), said there were concerns of a spike in Covid-19 cases after the Ganpati festival and Navratri. ""But we have not seen any spurt post the festivals,"" she pointed out. ""But our strategy of increased testing and awareness to get the vaccination will continue,"" she added. \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE203","Bahrain and Kuwait talk transition","November 16, 2021","Middle East Oil & Gas Monitor","Another two Gulf states have spoken of their plans to embrace the energy transition in the wake of COP26 . Why: Despite having nimbler economies, they trail Gulf energy transition trailblazers Saudi Arabia and the UAE. What Next: Despite their green intentions, both countries are aiming to make significant increases to oil production over the coming decades. Bahrain and Kuwait used this week's ADIPEC conference in Abu Dhabi as the opportunity to speak about their plans to belatedly join the energy transition, though for both countries, oil and gas will remain important pillars of their economies. The countries follow in the footsteps of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar and Oman, which have sought to lead the way with rebranding exercises and investment in low-carbon and renewable energies ahead of COP26 , which concluded last week. Island intentions Bahrain is preparing to set up a new agency focused on renewable and low-carbon energies following the abolition in September of the National Oil & Gas Authority (NOGA). The announcement comes just two weeks after the country's Cabinet said the Gulf intends to achieve net-zero carbon emissions in 2060. Speaking at ADIPEC, Mohamed bin Mubarak Bin Daina, special envoy for Climate Affairs and CEO of Bahrain's Supreme Council for Environment, said that NOGA would be transformed into a vehicle that will help the Kingdom diversify its energy supplies. Bahrain's renewable energy target is to achieve 700 MW of power generation capacity by 2030 solar, wind and energy-from-waste. The Ministry of Oil (MoO) assumed the functions of NOGA in September following the entity's abolition by king Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa. ""We're now looking at the future of transition, transferring this company from an oil and gas company into an energy company. That will help us look at the climate change impact, the energy mix and the diversification of energy sources,"" Bin Daina told journalists on the sidelines of the event. Cashing in Bin Daina noted though that nothing was planned imminently, but once it has been re-launched, the company could look to return to debt markets following the successful completion of an eight-year sukuk bond issuance in late March by NOGA's investment arm nogaholding. The issuance raised $600mn at a price of 5.25%, according to Reuters, with initial guidance having estimated a price of 5.75-5.875%. The raise represents a significant increase from the expected $500mn, with the company having received demand of nearly $3bn. Bahrain's approach appears to be following a similar trajectory to that of Oman, which transferred the assets of Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) to the newly launched Energy Development Oman (EDO) last year and has subsequently raised around $2.5bn of debt leveraged against the reserves of the Sultanate's giant Block 6 concession. In May, Bahraini Oil Minister Mohammed bin Khalifa Al Khalifa said that the Kingdom was considering monetising its oil and gas assets, including the 112-km Saudi-Bahrain A-B oil pipeline and the Bahrain LNG import terminal. Meanwhile, the minister remains optimistic that the country remains on track to commence production from the offshore Khaleej Al Bahrain (KAB) shale deposit despite limited progress to date. KAB is estimated to contain 80bn barrels of tight oil. In November 2020, NOGA subsidiary Tatweer Petroleum announced plans to drill eight new offshore wells to a depth of 8,000-13,000 feet (2,438-3,962 metres) and a horizontal extension of 914-3,000 metres. The Ministry believes that KAB has potential to produce around 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil, which would be transformative for the Kingdom's economy, significantly reducing its reliance on crude imports. For now, though, the onshore Awali field, the site of the Gulf Co-operation Council's (GCC) first oil find in 1932, remains the kingdom's sole source of domestic production and has a capacity of around 46,000 bpd. Kuwaiti caution Kuwaiti Oil Minister Mohammed Al Fares this week repeated his country's intentions to ramp up oil production, though he made some preliminary comments about the country's plans to embark on the energy transition. He added: ""We are putting a plan right now where we are trying to look at all different mixtures. And we are starting, [since] everybody is starting in this region with renewables related to solar."" Plans appear to centre around a 2-GW wind and solar project, which Al Fares said would be tendered by the Kuwait Authority for Partnership Projects and would take the form of a ""joint venture between the government and the private sector"". He added: ""Kuwait is not far away from whatever you see in this region. But again, I want to make sure that what we say is what we want to deliver."" Noting that plans to develop renewables and hydrogen were part of a ""parallel path"", Al Fares' comments are noteworthy even if not particularly inspiring compared to the advanced and ambitious plans of some of its neighbours. Oil optimism In October, the Kuwaiti Ministry of Oil and state-owned Kuwait Petroleum Corp. (KPC) said separately that Kuwaiti oil output capacity would reach 3.5mn bpd\~by 2025 and 4mn bpd a decade later, with the latter target brought forward by five years. The move comes amid optimism from KPC about the future of output from the partitioned neutral zone (PNZ) shared with Saudi Arabia, though sentiment from the Saudi side appears to be less positive. Speaking to the official Kuwait News Agency (KUNA), KPC CEO Hashem Hashem said the company's upstream subsidiary Kuwait Oil Co. (KOC) would achieve the increase through work on gathering centres, the expansion of water handling and water injection facilities as well as upgrades to existing Jurassic production facilities and the addition of new production units and wells. KOC's projects included\~""upgrading current Jurassic production facilities and [establishing] two additional facilities to increase light crude production. This plan will be implemented in combination with an integrated drilling programme of 500 wells per year on average and around 2,000 wells workover,"" according to KUNA. Hashem said the drilling campaign would be carried out using 71 drilling rigs and 62 workover rigs working across Kuwait. Meanwhile, in September a company source was quoted as saying that KOC would drill an extra 300 wells per year, taking the annual total to 700, as part of a $6.1bn capital expenditure on exploration activities over the next five years. While the two states are separated by several million bpd of oil production, their energy transition plans both pale in comparison to those of their ambitious neighbours. However, it is illustrative of economic reality that as they take steps towards a greener future, both countries remain focused on significantly increasing oil production. \"

Shining Star International School in Abu Dhabi and Dubai's Pristine Private School have been recognised by Climate Action Project and Cartoon Network for their work on environmental awareness. The Climate Action Project is a six-week initiative launched by US-based non-profit Take Action Global, involving more than 2.7 million teachers and students across 146 countries. It is conducted in collaboration with World Wildlife Fund, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) and backed by conservationist Jane Goodall, Ireland President Michael D. Higgins and environmental activist Kumi Naidoo. The project aims to help students learn and discuss issues related to climate change. As part of the project, between September 25 and November 4 (climate action day), schools had to make different presentations related to environmental protection. Principal Abhilasha Singh said that Shining Star collaborated with educational institutes in India and Poland to find solutions to the climate crisis. ""Our students contributed to air quality improvement by planting trees on the school campus. We pledged to minimise our carbon usage. We managed to reduce our carbon footprint to 128.1kg, ranking us at 115 among 2.5 million classrooms globally.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE206","Youth have a greater role to play in climate campaign","October 19, 2021 Tuesday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","Climate activists hold a protest at the US Chamber of Commerce in Washington, DC. \- AFP At the beginning of the summer, I noted how the climate-change narrative had changed in recent years, thanks to tremendous technological progress that has made green energy more competitive and often less costly than older carbon-based technologies. This is certainly true for new power investments, although for a while it will still be cheaper to produce electricity from older assets with sunk costs than to build new green plants. But in the medium term, I argued, ""the new win-win story"" implies that ""national gains and commercial profit can now drive progress"" toward a green transformation. The climate debate is thus no longer only about the costs of mitigation and how to share them in an equitable and politically feasible way. Instead, as Nicholas Stern has said in his report to the G7, ""the transition to a zero-emissions and climate-resilient world provides the greatest economic, business, and commercial opportunity of our time"". With the crucial United Nations climate-change summit ( COP26 ) in Glasgow less than two weeks away, the positive developments in green energy certainly provide grounds for optimism. But an important caveat is in order. It would be easy but incorrect to interpret the recent advances in green technologies as making emissions reduction less of a global public good (GPG). This GPG is measured by reductions in atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations due to human activity. Less accumulation of these gases due to mitigation efforts remains a pure GPG: the benefits are non-rival and not excludable. Technological changes do not alter that fact. The ""addition"" to the GPG is the lowering of total greenhouse-gas concentrations due to a country's own mitigation, and a given amount of mitigation anywhere will produce the same global benefit. At the same time, the net benefit of an isolated mitigation action \- the difference between its benefits and its costs \- will vary across countries. In the past, technological constraints meant the net benefit in terms of GDP was negative. It is quickly becoming positive for many countries, making a green transformation increasingly feasible. The point is necessary to bear in mind because the recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change made clear that the aggregate result of countries following their own most profitable development strategies would not provide enough global mitigation to limit climate change to an acceptable level. The damage and risks associated with global warming have become greater and more imminent, with broader and more volatile effects. In particular, the frequency and severity of extreme weather events directly linked to climate change has increased substantially. Moreover, the imminence of the threat means that frontloading mitigation \- including earlier decommissioning of old power plants, among many other measures \- is crucial. If every country chose its preferred development strategy, the resulting non-cooperative outcome would result in unacceptably risky levels of emissions. The incentive problem has not disappeared. Yes, in many countries, technology will increasingly allow positive economic gains from mitigation. But these countries will still not have the incentive to mitigate with the same intensity and urgency that they would if the global benefits were part of their cost-benefit calculation. So, while the emergence of net national economic benefits from emissions-reduction efforts is certainly a welcome development, an optimal global solution will require more and earlier mitigation than would result if each country responded only to its own incentives. In fact, the latest IPCC report suggests that the gap between the sum of national strategies and a globally optimal approach may even have increased. The IPCC report should temper the optimism fuelled by recognition of green energy's profitability. It should foster broad acceptance of the need for multilateral efforts to provide sufficient incentives for climate-change mitigation, and to mobilise financial resources to enable all countries to make large green investments that are profitable in the long term. As for incentives, some form of carbon pricing is a powerful spur, and together with regulations \- such as banning the production of cars powered by internal combustion engines after a certain date \- can set expectations and drive the necessary shift in investments. Fortunately, an important feature of the new climate narrative \- not related to the economic cost-benefit analysis concerning mitigation \- should facilitate the cooperative solutions that are still needed. This is the stronger support for ambitious climate policies, rooted in ethical considerations, from civil society around the world. For many, the preservation of the planet as we know it, including its species and biodiversity, is a near-absolute ethical imperative. A lot of people in green movements in developed countries not only support frontloaded mitigation at home but also seem ready to commit some of their income to finance the green transition in poorer countries. We don't know exactly how many would be willing to give up how much, but climate ethics has become a significant political force, particularly among young people. This should help make possible the ambitious climate policies required, including the mobilisation of resources for developing countries in support of early mitigation measures. In an age shaped by the re-emergence of populist nationalism, green internationalism may provide an increasingly influential counterweight. The COP26 gathering will provide a telling indication of its current strength.  Project Syndicate Click/tap here to subscribe to Khaleej Times news alerts on Telegram. \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE207","Planet needs circular economy. Are businesses listening?","January 10, 2022 Monday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","Having spent a fair amount of time in a remote village, I had a revelation of sorts. This wasn't some Eat Pray Love moment. But something rather mundane. I had piled up a significant amount of plastic waste despite my attempt to lead a simple life. Ironically, Amazon delivery could reach where a municipal truck could not. So, every time I ordered some bare necessity, like food or hygiene products, I essentially ordered more plastic. It's when the municipal truck does not roll in that the full magnitude of the plastic waste problem becomes apparent. It just keeps mounting. The challenge of treating plastic waste in an environmentally safe manner became an obsession for me. I could fully appreciate the importance of transitioning to a Circular Economy (CE). Studies show that the shift to renewable energy can only fix 55 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions; the balance 45 per cent comes from how we make and use food, clothes, cars, and products of daily use. Circular economy offers a clear path out of the climate mess. It has been more than nine months since I first wrote about Circular Economy. Since then, the chatter on adopting CE practices has grown, signalling strong gusts of change. The year 2021 saw an unprecedented momentum for CE and not the least because of Cop26 held in Glasgow late last year. Goals were set, pledges made, reports published, and conferences attended. Yet, did words translate into action? Have businesses started to build regenerative systems to design out waste? What does the CE scorecard look like for businesses? Early signs include a sustainability report and the appointment of a CE manager. The job role tells you the general intent of the organisation. The Circular Economy paradigm demands a rethinking at a fundamental level. The task ahead appears daunting because we need to transform production and consumption mechanisms; how we create and how we use; how we build and how we consume, how we treat and reuse our waste. A widespread adoption of CE practices is yet to happen. In each industry vertical, a few companies, possibly leaders have embarked on a CE journey. But CE can become mainstream only if entire supply chains make a transition. Sociology suggests that organisational isomorphism occurs because of coercive, mimetic, and normative forces. Coercive pressures typically come from regulation, compelling companies to take action to avoid penalties. Current regulations have forced organizations to recycle, treat effluents, and adopt clean energy. Nearly a fifth of 2,000 public companies globally have committed to net zero, which involves reducing or offsetting emissions by green initiatives. The targets set by these companies are not always backed by the 'how'. This attracts criticisms of green washing. Agri-food businesses are doing away with single use plastic for consumers. Yet, while Amazon delivered my food items in cartons and brown paper, the individual food items came in plastic bags. I wish I could have returned the packaging through the delivery person for the seller to reuse. Can food containers be designed for reuse? Can the customer be incentivized to use reverse logistics? This will happen when normative and mimetic pressures come into play. Normative pressures come from social norms. Consumer expectations borne out of climate change awareness is one such example. Some industry verticals have an influential customer segment that advocates affirmative action against climate change. They buy brands that behave responsibly and are vocal about their choices. Industries such as fashion have taken small steps to address take-make-waste practices. It is not uncommon to find tags on clothes stating the percentage of the product that came from recycled or reused material. Energy companies are already being pressured by investor and climate activism because of a disproportionate reliance on fossil fuel, especially coal. Energy companies have, however, largely focused on plastic waste management as opposed to transitioning to renewable energy. Some are merely looking to spin off their coal assets rather than dealing with them responsibly. Recent acquisitions of Synova by Total suggests that Tech Startups will play a major role in helping energy companies transition to CE. These are still baby steps because normative pressures are not strong enough. Not all customers are open to used products. Consumer attitude towards used products could range from strong aversion to mild hesitancy, especially when the pandemic hasn't ended. However, consumer mindset is shifting from ownership to usage and performance. Imagine buying 1,000 wash cycles in a washing machine. Bosch is educating customers to use its DIY tools to upcycle old material into garden fixtures. Lastly mimetic pressures involve imitating industry best practices borne out of shared concepts and beliefs. Once companies begin to feel mimetic pressures, we will see a more widespread adoption of CE practices. Why would businesses take the trouble to cooperate in transitioning to CE? While currently institutional pressures outweigh other drivers for a vast majority of businesses, economic drivers will provide the major force for an industry-wide shift. Unless it makes business sense, companies are not going to budge. A key economic driver is to extract maximum value out of products by keeping them in use. Additionally, companies are looking at extracting maximum value from materials such as aluminum, steel, lithium, even after reaching product end of life. This reduces risks related to material price volatility and supply chain disruptions. Businesses need to take a long hard look at the problem of waste. The goal set by the Paris Agreement on climate change requires Circular Economy. Many factors need to converge for Circular Economy to go beyond a conceptual framework. When the perfect storm arises, no company would want to be left behind. Shalini Verma is CEO of PIVOT technologies, a Dubai-based cognitive innovation company. \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE208","Intuitive Networks: The Foundation for Smart and Sustainable Cities","December 8, 2021","Reseller Middle East","By Reem Asaad, Vice President of Cisco Middle East and Africa As more citizens relocate to cities with hopes of better access to education, careers and economic prosperity, urban infrastructure and the environment are coming under increasing strain. Demand for public services and consumption are on the increase and smart, yet sustainable cities are now a critical endeavour for all. To create, maintain and evolve a connected and environmentally aware city, the network infrastructure is foundational. Unlimited connectivity that securely transports data makes all other life enhancing innovations within our cities possible. Technologies such as Wi-Fi 6, 5G, AI and the cloud are all based on effective network connectivity. Our communities of the future must be in harmony with the environment and offer increasingly efficient daily lives for people; green and digital go hand in hand. For each city to successfully get smart, networks must be scaled and optimised \- delivering low latency connectivity for decisionmakers to gain actionable insights. The use of IoT devices and connections can enable a city to receive real-time updates on air quality, traffic flow and waste management. Leaders of technology have a responsibility to be a driver of this change, both within our internal operations, by enabling our customers and partners to meet their sustainability goals with our products and innovation solutions and in the way we collaborate and influence broader communities to take positive action. When the world united for COP26 , digital technologies proved to be a fundamental lifeline. Cisco's collaboration platform, Webex enabled crucial conversations between delegates both virtually and in person on issues that define the future of our planet. Today, whether we consider our schools, hospitals or workplaces, we are witnessing a shift to hybrid environments, where technology is the key accelerator. While such environments offer a greater degree of convenience, they also have financial and sustainable benefits. Virtual meetings offer the ability to replace the day-to-day commute and business travel. Smart building management systems provide insight into the consumption of energy and work to improve efficiencies. Focusing on the UAE, Expo 2020 Dubai serves as a shining example of how a city can leverage the best of technology to operate in a smart and sustainable manner. As the Official Digital Network Partner of Expo 2020 Dubai, Cisco has established the secure intelligent foundation for connectivity with our intent-based network. This technology constantly learns, adapts and protects to keep the mega project running. The network works with a number of other solutions located at the site, including Cisco's Wi-Fi technology to deliver ultra-fast yet secure connectivity to all who enter and operate the site. In the first 25 days of Expo 2020 Dubai opening its doors, over 606,200 users connected to the Wi-Fi network. On the 8th of October alone, there were over 50,000 peak users \- illustrating just how important reliable connectivity is. Beyond connecting people and increasing operational efficiencies, Cisco's network is also helping to reduce food surplus at Expo 2020's restaurants, food halls and workforce catering areas \- distributed to local charities with the logistical support of the UAE Food Bank throughout the duration of the event. As the first of its kind in the UAE, the Expo 2020 Dubai Food Rescue Programme utilises Replate, a Cisco grantee, and state-of-the-art technology, to automate the food rescue process and connect donors to charities and communities in need. Furthermore, it tracks the environmental impact of all donations. Replate is also used to alert the UAE Food Bank about pick-ups at the Expo site and enables UAE Food Bank drivers to distribute food to those in need with greater ease. With the UAE now set to host COP28 in 2023 and a number of landmark projects underway with sustainability and technology at their core, the nation will continue to set the benchmark for smart green cities \- inspiring others to act for the good of the environment. \"

As we focus on the Agenda: 2030, our main thrust would be to ensure the core principles of Sustainable Development: 'inclusiveness' and 'leaving no one behind'. To that end, the main focus areas would be: Build a resilient and sustained health system in my country; ensure full vaccination to all my people; ensure an effective vaccine procurement supply line; the possibility of manufacturing/producing Covid-19 vaccine domestically; bring the momentum of our impressive GDP growth back; revive airways industry/hotel/tourism/service industry; strengthen the ICT sector to cope with the new normal situation; deliver on the 2030 promise timely and continue taking special care of the most marginal and vulnerable segment of the people as well as the middle class of the society who suffered most during the pandemic and are still suffering. How is the country preparing to weather the impacts when trade concessions offered as an LDC would be withdrawn? Graduation will bring both challenges and opportunities for us. First of all, graduation will surely enhance our image in the world and help our campaign of branding our country. The improved business climate in the country will eventually attract a higher flow of foreign direct investment (FDI) and generate employment. With graduation and strong financial indicators, Bangladesh will have more opportunities to secure commercial loans from the international market at a competitive interest rate. The current mega projects which are under construction in Bangladesh like Padma Bridge, Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant, Karnaphuli Tunnel, Payra Port, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Industrial City, Terminal-3 of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, Metro Rail, etc. will be completed soon. Upon completion, these mega projects will hugely increase the business competitiveness of Bangladesh, offsetting any possible challenge faced from the LDC graduation. It is true that Bangladesh will face some challenges due to the withdrawal of the LDC-specific International Support Measures (ISMs) after graduation. For Bangladesh, the trade-related ISMs are the most important ones, in particular duty-free and quota-free (DFQF) market access along with flexible Rules of Origin. After graduation from the LDC status, Bangladesh will no longer remain eligible for the DFQF facilities. However, Bangladesh's economy is well prepared to cushion out any short-term pressure faced from the LDC graduation. You are aware that though Bangladesh is not receiving any tariff benefit from the US for its garments products, it is one of the top exporters of RMG (ready-made garments) in the US, which shows the resilience of Bangladesh's export industry whether it receives any preferential support or not. What are the key strategies to realise your vision of transforming Bangladesh into a developed country by 2041? Vision 2041 articulates Bangladesh's vision to attain upper middle income country status by 2031 and a developed nation by 2041. Our economy is transforming from agriculture based to a more manufacturing based one. Apart from RMG, Bangladesh is exporting electronics, pharmaceuticals, processed agricultural products, leather products. We have the second biggest online workforce in the world. We are gradually diversifying our economy to a broader range of export products. By doing so, we are in the process of establishing 100 economic zones by 2030 to encourage foreign direct investment in different categories of industries. We have already received investment from Japan, EU, Canada, Korea, China, India, US, Singapore, Thailand among others. Our strategy in this regard is to make this country a regional business hub by taking advantage of its geographical position. To make this happen, we have undertaken dozens of transformational mega projects on infrastructure such as Padma Bridge, deep seaport, metro rail, nuclear power plant, rail link, airport, elevated expressway, four-lane highways etc. I hope our economy will experience double digit growth very soon. As Bangladesh and the UAE are both marking their golden jubilees, how have bilateral relations evolved over the past years, and what's the agenda for this visit and outlook for future cooperation? Bangladesh gained its independence and the UAE was founded in the same year of 1971 and since then the fraternal relations between the two countries expanded and consolidated in different sectors. The foundation of the relationship between the two countries was laid by the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman during his historic visit to the UAE in 1974. The people of Bangladesh fondly remember the 10-day visit of the UAE's Founding Father Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al Nahyan to Bangladesh in 1984 that took the bilateral relations to a new height. Current annual trade volume between Bangladesh and UAE is around $1.5 billion. The UAE is presently the fifth largest foreign investor in Bangladesh investing nearly $2.5 billion. On the eve of celebrating the Golden Jubilee of both of our nationhood, it is the high time to take our relationship to a new height. I am aware of the UAE's centennial vision 2071 and Initiatives of the next 50. We also have Vision 2041 and Delta Plan 2100. To realise the above-mentioned development targets and visions, Bangladesh is keen to work together with the UAE by establishing a 'comprehensive economic partnership' with a view to tapping maximum mutual benefit from huge potentials the two countries offer to each other. We need huge investments in human resource development, physical infrastructure, power, energy, manufacturing, and service sectors. UAE investors are welcome to invest more in Bangladesh in the fields of physical infrastructure like construction of tunnels, bridges and other communication networks, power and energy, agro-food processing, tourism, blue economy, scientific research and innovation, artificial intelligence and other potential sectors. We are ready to contribute to the UAE's food security programme through uninterrupted supply of food items from Bangladesh with engagement of the UAE authorities in every stage of the supply chain from production to processing to shipment. We are ready for participation in the UAE's leased framing in third countries by providing skilled farmers to work in those farms. Two apex trade bodies (FBCCI and UAE CCI) are going to launch Joint Business Council (JBC) during this visit. And that it will comprise sector-wise leading business leaders from both sides. We have a lot to offer in the UAE job market. We would welcome the technical and financial support from the UAE for skill development of our work force following the sector-based needs of the UAE job market. We look forward to working with the UAE in non-conventional areas like artificial intelligence, digital integration, financial management etc. Bangladesh enjoys a high level of remittances from expatriate workers. How is the government creating a workforce with skills for the future? We have initiated a plan to create a huge technologically skilled workforce keeping in consideration the requirements of Fourth Industrial Revolution. The government is currently training the workforce in six Institute of Marine Technology and in 55 types of trades in 64 Technical Training Institutes (TTIs) countrywide. In FY 2020-21, we have provided skills development training to 300,000 people. For women workers to be employed in the RMG sector, we are providing women workers six-month long training in the TTIs. We are running training programmes for those who want to take up domestic help jobs abroad. Our Technical Education Board has included 8 new trades in its training curriculum and 9 new trades have been included in the scheme titled Skills for Employment Investment Programme. The government is training up to 200,000 people to take up driving jobs. What are measures taken to ensure women empowerment and improve living standards of citizens? Free education for girls up to Grade 12, stipends, free textbooks, sustained training, skill development programme, collateral free credits are some of our strategies that have opened up immense opportunities for economic empowerment of women. Initiatives, such as a one-stop crisis centre, DNA profiling lab, toll free 24/7 hotlines have offered women and girls increased protection from violence. We have also prioritised ICT for women empowerment. My country pledged to increase women's participation in the workforce leading to 50-50 by 2041. Bangladesh is promoting an inclusive growth strategy, focusing on sustained economic growth and human development. Our government has adopted strong Social Safety Net Programmes (SSNP). Education stipends, adult allowances, maternal allowances, allowances for the widow, deserted and destitute women, My-house-My-farm project, Ashrayan (shelter) project, food-for-work programme, life enhancement programmes for the disadvantaged population, lifelong development programmes for the transgender people, Vulnerable Group Development, and Char livelihood programme are being implemented under SSNP. The government is in the process of finalising the National Household Database to streamline the selection process of beneficiaries of different social protection programmes. How Bangladesh aims to tackle the crisis of climate change and work on Sustainable Development Goals? Despite being a climate vulnerable country, Bangladesh has placed much emphasis both in policy and action in ground for addressing climate change impacts. Before the COP26 that was held in Glasgow in November, we had submitted an updated and more ambitious Nationally Determined Contribution to the UNFCCC aiming at significantly reducing the carbon footprint. We are working on formulation of a National Adaptation Plan, which will enhance the climate resilience of the country. We are going to implement the 'Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan' to achieve low carbon economic growth for optimised prosperity and partnership. We have achieved remarkable success in providing access to electricity to over 20 million people by installing more than 6 million solar-home systems - the largest of this kind in the world. As the current Chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, we are promoting the interests of the climate vulnerable countries in the international platforms. Based on the success of the implementation of many of the Millennium Development Goals targets, Bangladesh has adopted the Whole-of-the-Society approach for implementation of SDGs. We have involved government machinery, NGOs, INGOs, civil society, development partners, private sector, businesspeople, academia, professionals, local authority, Members of Parliament, and other relevant stakeholders to implement the SDGs. What does the future hold for Myanmar's Rohingya refugees in the camps of Cox's Bazar? We have been trying our best, with the support of the international community, to ensure safety and wellbeing of the Rohingya. We developed an island called Bhasan Char with proper amenities, spending about $350 million from our own resources to de-risk and decongest the squalid camps in Cox's Bazar. After the exodus of 2017, Bangladesh again primarily relied on bilateral engagements with Myanmar and concluded three instruments on return. According to the arrangements, Myanmar agreed to ensure safe return of the Rohingya to their homes, facilitate freedom of movement, basic services and livelihood. In the backdrop of frustrating progress in the bilateral engagements Bangladesh took it up at the global community. Bangladesh engaged China under an informal tripartite mechanism to commence the repatriation. The political developments in Myanmar since February 1, 2021, and the ongoing instability have stalled all the process. Myanmar might not fully comply with its obligations to ensure protection and sustained return of Rohingya unless it is compelled to do so through an effective and well-calibrated engagement on the part of the international community. Bangladesh is not in a position to shoulder the enormous burden for an indefinite period. The ultimate solution to the problem lies in the sustainable repatriation of the Rohingya. How do you want to be remembered? Well, I take this as an opportunity to devote my life for the welfare of a nation which my father liberated. Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman dedicated his life to establishing a democratic, peaceful, poverty-free, hunger-exploitation and discrimination-free society. Unfortunately, before he could accomplish his dream, he, along with 18 members of our family, including my 10-year-old brother were brutally assassinated on August 15, 1975. My life-long devotion is to realise the unfulfilled dream of my father by transforming Bangladesh into a prosperous, inclusive, knowledge-based developed country where no one will be left behind. I believe that when I will not be there, people will remember me as a faithful servant to the country who wanted nothing less than the best for the country and for the people. \"

This statement was made by Mark Samways, Director of Well-being at The Free Spirit Collective during his address titled 'Future of Wellbeing' at the ongoing GESS Dubai 2021 conference and exhibition at the Dubai World Trade Centre. ""I think we need to have a greater focus on well-being and have an integrated system in place whereby it's part of their everyday life and everyday culture. It's an explicit curriculum where we teach about well-being and the science of well-being, and also implicitly across the school in our everyday interactions and how our community works and making sure that we're involving the students and having their voices heard involving parents to make sure they're educated in the science of well-being, and then they can continue that journey at home, and have those conversations with their children and trying to protect them as they grow,"" said Samways. The unprecedented disruption caused to education by Covid-19 has accelerated greater awareness of mental health issues in schools. Education systems are struggling to reconnect with learners and supporting the well-being of millions of young people. Meanwhile, Rachael Pryce, founder of EducationYalla, spoke about the skills gap in the labour market which presents an opportunity for various stakeholders, including the education sector, to work together to spot the missing skills and enable young people to acquire them. During her presentation, Pryce revealed that around 70 per cent of CEOs say that their current workforce do not have the skills needed to adapt. On the other hand, more than 40 per cent of employees said that they are likely to leave their current jobs as they are not learning enough. Giving reference to the latest survey of Udemy, she said that there is increased awareness around the skills gap, which continues to grow over the years as technology changes and employers demand new skills. The survey findings reveal that more than 70 per cent of employees worldwide believe that skills are changing so fast that our current skills are becoming obsolete. It also revealed that more than 65 per cent of people believe that a college education doesn't equip them with skills that make them effective at work. GESS Dubai continues on its final day with still a few more opportunities for school leaders and teachers to learn from leading local and international education experts. Revathi Srinivasan, Director, Singhania Group of Schools will talk about Education 4.0 - The Future of Learning while Abdullah Zakariya, Head of Department, Kuwait Ministry of Education, will discuss Educational Games \- for a more fun way of teaching. With COP26 ""We continue to get positive feedback about our conference agenda, but also delighted that visitors are coming to see a range of products and solutions from more than 400 companies showcasing their products and solutions on the exhibition floor,"" said Matt Thompson, Project Director Tarsus, which organises GESS Dubai in partnership with the UAE Ministry of Education.

This research found that nearly 70 percent of people trust climate scientists, up from 57 percent in 2019 The Climate Progress Survey: Business and Consumer Worries and Hopes, a global study of public opinion published by the World Economic Forum in collaboration with SAP and Qualtrics, finds that while trust in climate science has surged, optimism is in short supply. Most participants felt a strong personal responsibility to the environment, even as they felt businesses and governments could do more to make a difference. The majority of respondents felt that everyone should work together to tackle climate change. This research found that nearly 70 percent of people trust climate scientists, up from 57 percent in 2019, when this poll question was first asked. In Eastern Europe and Central Asia, the jump was particularly dramatic, with trust nearly doubling, from 38 percent in 2019 to 65 percent in 2021. 74 percent of respondents agree climate change is caused by humans, a number that rose from 67 percent in 2020. This question has been settled within climate science for some time (99 percent of climate research agrees that climate change is man-made) but the question remains a topic of political circles. Most people (59 percent) felt their governments could do more to protect the environment and only around a fourth trusted business sustainability claims. Respondents in the Middle East & North Africa are fairly neutral compared to other regions as they neither lead nor lag on any major KPI. 71 percent trust scientists, believe climate change is mostly human-caused and feel extremely or very personally responsible for addressing climate change. Around half are optimistic about the progress needed to reduce emissions. Among corporate respondents, 53 percent face notable risk from climate change and 59 percent of those who use ESG metrics say they are extremely or very useful. The global study asked more than 11,000 people in 28 countries about their experience with climate change. Around 70 percent of its respondents represent the global population with the remaining 30 percent representing the corporate world (those working at least 40 hours per week for for-profit companies). The study reinforces the World Economic Forum's message that the climate crisis will require urgent cross-sector collaboration using every mechanism available to make meaningful action possible, including policy, finance, technology and education. The report's findings align with other recent World Economic Forum reports that drive home a critical reality: leaders do not need to choose between the economy and the climate. The Climate Progress Survey's release coincides with COP26 , a critical global climate summit held in Glasgow, Scotland. \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE213","UK PM Johnson to announce series of green taxes","October 13, 2021 Wednesday","Big News Network.com","LONDON, England: Despite ongoing fuel shortages and rising prices in the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson will announce a plan to introduce a series of green taxes aimed at funding low-carbon heating plans. The Times reported Johnson's plan to adopt a carbon pricing scheme by 2023, which will be published ahead of the United Nation's COP26 climate conference in Glasgow next month, with the government warning that average yearly energy bills could be as high as \£32,000. Under the plan, UK households could see a rise of \£3170 in their average annual gas bill, and gas boilers will also be phased out in favor of significantly more expensive heat pumps. A \£3400 million national subsidy will also be used to reduce the cost of heat pumps from some \£310,000 to \£35,000 over the next three years. Gas price fluctuations highlight the need to transition from fossil fuels, the government stressed, but critics warned the plan could negatively affect the industry. Gareth Stace, director-general of UK Steel, said the electricity bills of British steel producers are already 50 to 80 percent higher than their German counterparts, stressing increases in green taxes could damage the steel industry. ""At the moment, there is an energy crisis. If the government does nothing, tomorrow there will be a steel crisis,"" he added, as quoted by The Times. Conservative MP Craig Mackinlay, head of the Net Zero Scrutiny Group of more than 40 Tory MPs, said the plan should be ""discounted and discarded immediately,"" as the UK is already experiencing ""energy poverty."" The conservative wing of the Tory Party also called for the opening of the North Sea to the fracking industry, to make the country less reliant for energy on Russia and the Middle East. Due to claims of drilling causing earthquake tremors, a moratorium was placed on the fracking industry in England in 2019. Despite the government's previously supporting fracking, calling it a potential creator of jobs and a solution to the nation's energy problems, Johnson is now focusing on green alternatives to meet the goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. But his net-zero plan could cost the UK over \£33 trillion, or \£3100,000 per household, according to a Global Warming Policy Foundation report released in February 2020. \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE214","Analysis: COP 28: Global recognition for UAE' anti-warming efforts","November 12, 2021 Friday","Emirates News Agency (WAM) - Business (English)","By Mohammed Jalal Al Rayssi, Director General of the Emirates News Agency (WAM) ABU DHABI, 12th November, 2021 (WAM) -- The UN's decision in Glasgow on Thursday night to accept the UAE's bid to host the 28th UN global climate talks in 2023 translates in no uncertain terms the international confidence in the country's decade-long anti-global warming efforts and its forward-thinking vision for economic growth. ""There being no objections; it is decided,"" so declared COP26 President Alok Sharma the UAE's win of hosting the highly significant session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 28) in 2023. The successful bid comes to corroborate the UAE's determination to ""working with the international community to accelerate global efforts to address climate change & environmental protection & create a more sustainable economic future,"" as His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, put it. In a report echoing the UAE's anti-warming efforts, CNBC said that ""playing host for COP28 would be an achievement in the climate sphere for the Middle East the world's hottest, driest and most water-scarce region. By 2030, temperatures are expected to increase more than twice the global average. ""The UAE plans to increase its oil production capacity to more than 5 million barrels per day by 2030, and is constructing a coal fired power plant. Nevertheless, its pitch to host COP28 seeks to elevate its efforts to make climate action a pillar of its domestic and foreign policy and national economic strategy, according to a 19-page official document reviewed by CNBC."" This global recognition of the UAE's climate action had been accentuated before by the man steering the helm of this pressing file in the United States, Mr John Kerry, the United States Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, who led congratulations from world leaders and prominent environmental policy-makers to the UAE for its Net Zero 2050 Strategic Initiative, calling it an ""incredibly important"" step in combating climate change. It goes without saying that climate action has become a burning issue for the future of humanity at large, and therefore the UAE has adopted a forward-looking vision decades ago to address it in the best possible manner. The ambitious Net Zero 2050 Strategic Initiative announced in October meant AED600 billion will be invested in clean and renewable energy sources in the next three decades. The groundbreaking move came in unison with the longstanding vision of the UAE and its people to make a significant contribution to global sustainability efforts while supporting economic and human development both at home and around the world. Not to mention the track record UAE boasts in organising key global events. After winning the UN's approval to host this global conference, the UAE will continue to forge ahead with its endeavours to ensure collective climate action and take advantage of the opportunities up for grabs to help protect key natural resources for ours and future generations. The UAE ushers into its next 50 year-journey with high ambition and determination to make a paradigm shift in international response to climate change challenges in order to turn them into promising opportunities for sustained growth and prosperity.

In an announcement on October 23, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince, Deputy Prime Minister and Supreme Committee for Green Saudi Arabia chairman HRH Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud said that the Kingdom will plant 450 million trees and rehabilitate 8 million hectares of degraded lands by 2030 as part of the first set of Saudi Green Initiative (SGI) strategies. As part of the Kingdom's first ever SGI, Prince Mohammed also unveiled a regional road map to protect the environment. He noted that Saudi Arabia has already launched initiatives in the energy sector to reduce carbon emissions by 278 million tonnes annually by 2030 \- more than double the targeted emissions reduction. This is in line with the country's plan to reach Net Zero carbon impact by 2060, while preserving its role in the security and stability of global energy markets. During the inaugural Saudi Green Initiatives (SGI) forum, Prince Salman said the initiative is based on the Kingdom's role in confronting shared international issues, its belief in the need for collaborative efforts to confront climate change and the necessity of the green transformation to deliver social and economic prosperity to the Kingdom. The Crown Prince added that the Kingdom's ambition to reach net zero emissions aligns with its economic diversification and development plans and the 'Dynamic Baseline' for emissions reduction. He stated, ""The Saudi Green Initiative will provide huge investment opportunities for the private sector, quality job opportunities for the next generation of leaders in the Kingdom and enhanced international relationships that will have a positive impact on the region and the world."" In his opening remarks at the forum, the Crown Prince announced a diverse set of initiatives as a roadmap to protect the environment and address climate change challenges, while achieving SGI's ambitious targets. He added that the first wave of initiatives that will deliver against the targets under the Saudi Green Initiative include programmes that aim to achieve more than 278 Mtpa carbon emissions reduction by 2030 \- this is said to be more than double the emissions reduction target set at the announcement of the Saudi Green Initiative earlier this year. The Kingdom said it will also join the Global Methane Pledge to contribute to cutting global methane emissions by 30% by 2030, as part of its commitment to deliver a cleaner, greener future. In addition, the Crown Prince said the Kingdom plan to plant 450 million trees and rehabilitate eight million hectares of degraded lands will lead to a reduction of 200 million tons of carbon emissions with additional initiatives to be announced in the future. The transformation of Riyadh into one of the world's most sustainable cities is already underway, with an extensive set of sustainability solutions. He went on to state that an increasing area of land is being designated for protection in the coming years, to achieve the first 20% of the goal to protect over 30% of the Kingdom's total land area, with initiatives to deliver the final 10% to be announced at a later stage. The transition to net zero carbon emissions will be delivered in a manner that preserves the Kingdom's leading role in enhancing the security and stability of global energy markets, particularly considering the maturity and availability of technologies necessary to manage and reduce emissions, he explained. To further amplify its protection of terrestrial, marine and coastal environments, the Crown Prince announced that Saudi Arabia is joining the Global Ocean Alliance, establishing the Ocean Exploration Foundation and announcing a number of initiatives \- including a Global Center for Tourism Sustainability. The tree planting and land rehabilitation programmes come on the heels of Bahrain's nationwide campaign to plant more than 50,000 trees and shrubs, which will be launched in phases by the National Initiative for Agricultural Development (NIAD). The campaign, 'Forever Green', will be held under the patronage of Her Royal Highness Princess Sabeeka bint Ibrahim Al Khalifa, wife of His Majesty King Hamad and NIAD Consultative Council president. It aims to support the country's strategies to sustain the development of the agricultural sector, expand the green area and highlight the aesthetic features of the kingdom. ""The trees and shrubs will be planted in the four governorates on an area covering more than 70,000sqm and more than 21,000 linear metres during the first stage that runs until March 2022,"" a statement from NIAD said. The two forums will lead up to the UN Climate Change Conference COP26 , due to start at the end of the month. Saudi Arabia also intends to join the Global Oceans Alliance, the Alliance to Eliminate Plastic Wastes in Oceans and Beaches and the Sports for Climate Action Agreement, in addition to establishing a global centre for sustainable tourism, and a non-profit foundation to explore the seas and oceans. The move has received global praise. Britain's Prince Charles, in recorded remarks at the environment event in Saudi Arabia yesterday, said there was a 'dangerously narrow window' to accelerate climate change action. COP26 must have nationally determined contributions. The Prince of Wales said the Saudi Green Initiative and a wider Middle East Green Initiative, which Riyadh will host, would help £ccelerate' the great progress already made. Riyadh will host a wider Middle East Green Initiative, which, together with the Saudi Green Initiative, will include the plantation of 50 billion trees in the region, the protection of marine and coastal environments and the generation of 50 percent of Saudi Arabia's energy from renewable sources. Leaders from all around the world are expected to take part in the Middle East Green Initiative, including an American delegation led by the US climate envoy John Kerry and Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan. \"

NOMD: Will Five Teens Save The Day for Planet Earth? written by Arnab Sengupta is a climate science fiction thriller that was recently released on Amazon, a year after the author's debut book \- a poetry anthology called Iridescence \- 50 Poems by a Teenage Dreamer. The book's timely release comes at the heels of the COP26 2021 United Nations climate change conference, where more than 100 countries committed to a series of initiatives to cut emissions and avoid land degradation. Bahrain, for its part, committed to reaching net-zero emissions by 2060, while quadrupling its mangrove coverage, doubling the number of trees and directly investing in new carbon capture technologies. Over the last decade, impending climate change has sparked protests led by a new generation of young climate activists, including Swedish 18-year-old Greta Thunberg, Indian Disha Ravi and American Xiye Bastida. ""When we think of heroes, we think of men and women with capes but today, they wear lab coats, not capes, and are mere 13-year-old teenagers,"" the 15-year-old told GulfWeekly. ""In NOMD, which stands for Naturally Occurring Manmade Disasters, they are up against the International Criminal Syndicate - maleficent, malevolent beings of darkness who want to destroy the planet using human-induced 'natural disasters'."" Arnab penned the 10-chapter book within two weeks shortly after getting to Bahrain two years ago, during a break between his studies. Editing, illustrating and creating the cover art has taken the major chunk of the last two years, during which time the Bhavans Bahrain Indian School student published his debut book. ""The book was written during the abundant free time that I got during my break, and was slowly built piece-by-piece where it felt like I was simply an onlooker to an alternate universe, and that I was just writing what I saw in my journal,"" he added. ""My favourite part of the story is the willingness of the characters to fight the stereotypes and misconceptions about youth, and them trying to save the world, by not only using tactful and scientific measures, but also by changing how most of us think.""

By 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), U.S. crude futures were up 1.4% at $84.75 a barrel, while Brent futures climbed 1.4% at $84.91 a barrel. U.S. Gasoline RBOB Futures were up 1.3% at $2.4015 a gallon. Oil prices surged to multi-year highs last week, helped by post-pandemic demand rebounding around the globe. This continued Monday as data showed that diesel consumption in India, the third largest energy consumer in the world, rose above pre-Covid levels for the first time in a year. This was helped by increased industrial activity ahead of the festival season. ""We estimate that oil demand is nearing 100 million b/d, its pre-COVID level, with winter seasonality and the recovery in international jet demand set to bring demand to record highs by early next year,"" said analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), in a note. This news helped overturn the earlier negative sentiment caused by a rare official statement from the Chinese government confirming that it had released gasoline and diesel reserves to increase market supply and support price stability in some regions. Attention now turns to Thursday's meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies including Russia, a group called OPEC+, to discuss future supply levels. These top producers are widely expected to stick to their plan to add 400,000 barrels per day of supply in December, although they are under increasing pressure from consuming countries to increase output by more significant amounts to reduce prices. For example, U.S. President Joe Biden on Saturday urged major G20 energy producing countries with spare capacity to boost production to ensure a stronger global economic recovery. ""Other than the potential for the market returning to surplus next year, the other factor holding back the group is the uncertainty over if and when Iranian supply could return to the market,"" said analysts at ING, in a note. ""Iran nuclear talks are set to resume this month and the group would not want to increase output if there is the potential for higher Iranian flows."" Adding to the positive tone Monday was the failure of the leaders of the Group of 20 major economies to agree to any concrete action over the weekend to limit global warming, making it tricky for the broader United Nations COP26 climate summit in Scotland to come to a meaningful conclusion.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE219","Acer will plant 100 trees for every Chromebook Spin 513 sold","November 9, 2021 Tuesday","TechRadar","If you're looking to purchase a new Chromebook, then Acer has a compelling argument to buy the Spin 513, having announced its partnership with Ecologi UK to plant 100 trees for every purchase. The Acer Chromebook Spin 513 was well received at launch and scored favorably in our own review, so this feels like a feature that sweetens the deal of an already great product, rather than something designed to sell a poor quality device. The first Chromebook to use Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c, you can expect plenty of flexibility thanks to that adjustable display that flips between laptop and tablet mode, and over 12 hours of battery life. Not only that, but just using the Spin 513 over a laptop or desktop computer will also allegedly help the pledge to better support the environment. Acer reports that PX3, an IT consulting company specializing in sustainability in IT, benchmarked the ACER Chromebook Spin 513 LTE to see how it would compare against over market-leading notebooks and found that it was 84% more energy efficient than a legacy desktop PC. Partnering with Ecology UK is yet another way to help cut carbon emissions that result from manufacturing and transportation, with the green charity having a clear and transparent ethos on its website on how it helps to plant trees, both in the UK and across the world. If there's any doubt, you can check the Ecologi Public Impact and Operations Ledger for yourself. You can purchase the Acer Chromebook Spin 513 for \£3399 from popular high street retailers like Argos, John Lewis and Currys, but remember to register your device on the Acer website to get those trees planted. (Image credit: Acer) We're seeing a lot of tech companies getting on board with campaigns aimed to reduce environmental impact, and for good reason. Outside of COP26 , concerns have been raised for years on the effect that our devices are having, from greenhouse gases being produced as a result of manufacturing, to human welfare in regards to collecting and creating the required components to build them in the first place. Companies like Apple have also previously been criticized and investigated for 'planned obsolescence', allegedly having built-in redundancy to encourage customers to purchase new devices rather than retain and update existing hardware. It's difficult to see what is and isn't an attempt at 'greenwashing'. With consumers now being more eco-conscious than ever, having a good environmental policy is a big selling point. It's not always clear what's a genuine campaign or a marketing gimmick, but thankfully many brands do seem to be taking things very seriously these days. With the inclusion of an outside consultancy and a well-established and transparent charity, this effort to plant 100 trees does feel refreshing and genuine, especially when you consider that Acer has the recently released Vero line of green products to back up its intentions. With any luck, we'll start to see more large brands pushing eco-initiatives in the coming months, hopefully, sooner rather than later. We only have one planet after all.

At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.2%. These small gains in Europe come after more of a mixed session in Asia, with mixed Chinese PMI data weighing on the positive tone but a decisive victory for Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's Liberal Democratic Party in a general election raising hopes for stability and more stimulus ahead. Attention on Monday will also focus on the COP26 conference in Glasgow, a U.N. conference aimed at limiting the effects of climate change, a day after the G20 big economies failed to agree on a deadline for halting net carbon emissions. However, most eyes this week will be on the two-day policy meeting of the Federal Reserve, concluding on Wednesday, which is widely expected to result in the start of the tapering of its bond purchases. The gathering could also provide clues about when the central bank will increase interest rates, a move that could have a dramatic impact on global equity markets. Both the Bank of England and the Reserve Bank of Australia also hold policy-setting meetings, and both these central banks are also expected to tighten their accommodative monetary policies. Back in Europe, low-cost airline Ryanair (LON:RYA) reported its first quarterly profit since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, but still warned that it would still make a hefty full-year loss. U.K. bank Barclays (LON:BARC) will also be in the spotlight after the announcement that CEO Jes Staley is to step down after investigations into his links with disgraced financier and convicted sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein. In economic news, German retail sales slumped 2.5% on the month in September, down 0.9% on the year, as the resurgence of Covid cases weighed on consumer sentiment.

The Statement was also issued on the side-lines of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ), under the presidency of the United Kingdom and in partnership with Italy, wherein the UAE is a committed partner striving to safeguard the environment, drive down emissions and create lasting economic opportunity. The Statement follows on from the UAE Core Regulators' Group which began its work in 2019. It builds upon the commitments set out in the UAE Guiding Principles on Sustainable Finance, published in 2020, which serve to guide the implementation and integration of consistent sustainable practices among the UAE's financial entities, contributing to the health and resilience of the nation's economy. The UAE Sustainable Finance Working Group issuing the Statement, now operates in an expanded forum to scale up the development of sustainable finance policies in the UAE. It includes the UAE Ministry of Economy, the UAE Ministry of Finance, the Office of the UAE's Special Envoy for Climate Change, the UAE Ministry of Climate Change and Environment, the Central Bank of the UAE, the Securities and Commodities Authority, ADGM, the Dubai Financial Services Authority, the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange, Dubai Financial Market, and Nasdaq Dubai. The Statement sets a clear and much needed roadmap for the participating authorities to contribute to the UAE's sustainable and climate change objectives, outlined in global frameworks, such as the Paris Agreement, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, which the UAE is fully supporting, and the nation's own UAE Net Zero by 2050 strategic initiative. Outlined in the Statement are three key deliverables the UAE authorities will strive to achieve to give a concrete expression to these international commitments. The deliverables include: a targeted study aimed at encouraging consistent Environmental Social and Governance corporate disclosure standards across the UAE, examining how to strengthen good corporate governance by UAE companies to contribute to driving the sustainability agenda, and, crucially, develop a UAE taxonomy of sustainable activities, which constitutes a major milestone defining the path for economic transition to sustainable development. The implementation of the deliverables will be achieved through both legislative and non-legislative means and in coordination with the authorities on the monitoring and technical support required to incorporate sustainability into regulatory frameworks. The directives set out in the Statement follow the establishment of the UAE Sustainable Finance Working Group in 2019, now comprising a range of regulatory authorities, exchanges, governmental bodies, and ministries in the UAE in charge of developing environmentally sustainable finance policies. The Statement is also an advancement in the authorities' development of the UAE Guiding Principles on Sustainable Finance, which serve to guide the implementation and integration of consistent sustainable practices among the UAE's financial entities, contributing to the health and tenacity of the nation's economy. \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE223","New report warns of climate catastrophe without urgent action to cut meat consumption","November 5, 2021 Friday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","GLASGOW, 5th November, 2021 (WAM) -- Global meat and dairy consumption must be dramatically reduced if we are to avert a climate catastrophe \- that's the clear conclusion of a new report released Friday at COP26 by the international charity Compassion in World Farming. The report, ""Breaking the Taboo: Why Diets Must Change to Tackle Climate Emergency"", sets out the clear scientific case that without an urgent and dramatic global reduction in meat consumption we will be unable to meet the targets agreed in the 2015 Paris Agreement to avert a climate catastrophe. Fossil fuels, energy and transport tend to dominate climate discussions. Governments largely ignore livestock's contribution to climate change, terrified of taking on the powerful vested interests that drive expanding global consumption of meat and dairy. The report reveals that: -The livestock sector is responsible for 14.5% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. -The food system is responsible for one third of all GHG emissions - 75% of agriculture's emissions are from livestock. -To meet the Paris Agreement targets, all sectors need to reduce their emissions. However, if global meat and dairy consumption continues at the same rate, emissions from food and agriculture will rise significantly, and meeting the Paris Agreement targets will be very difficult. -Changes to our diets could contribute up to a fifth of the mitigation needed to meet the Paris Agreement targets. In order to turn the tide on the crisis, governments and policy makers must act urgently in several key areas, according to the charity. This includes reducing meat production in industrial monogastric farming (for example, pigs and poultry) and the feedlot cattle sectors. Most meat and dairy should come from farms where animals are able to graze on well-managed biodiverse grassland, and the amount of land devoted to livestock should also be reduced to support natural climate solutions like restoration of forests and peatland. The report highlights that policies developed to solve the issue must integrate key considerations including: food security, resource efficiency, biodiversity loss, deforestation, detrimental impacts on soils and water, and animal welfare, as well as the use of antimicrobials and the risk of future pandemics. Finally, in order to ensure action is taken, governments must encourage and incentivise reduced levels of meat and dairy production and consumption, other than in countries where levels are already low. Author of the report and Chief Policy Adviser at Compassion in World Farming, Peter Stevenson, said: ""The central role that food and agriculture plays in the climate crisis has been virtually overlooked by world leaders. ""Today, we're breaking the taboo and saying what has to be said through our new report \- that livestock production is a major driver of the climate crisis. Without an urgent and dramatic global reduction in meat and dairy consumption we will be unable to meet the Paris Agreement targets needed to avert a climate catastrophe. Are we really prepared to risk destroying the planet simply because we cannot curb our excessive consumption of meat and dairy? ""World leaders must seize the opportunity of Nature Day tomorrow (6th November) to commit to taking urgent and definitive action to reverse this calamitous path, before it's too late. The world is watching and waiting."" \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE224","World food prices reach highest level in more than a decade:FAO","November 5, 2021 Friday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","ROME, 5th November, 2021 (WAM) -- The UN barometer of world food prices has surged to a new peak, reaching its highest level since July 2011, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) announced. The FAO Food Price Index, which tracks the international?prices?of a basket of food?commodities, is up 3.9 percent from September, rising for a third consecutive month. Cereal prices overall increased by 3.2 percent, with wheat rising five percent, due to reduced harvests in major exporting nations, including Canada, Russia and the United States. Prices?of all other major cereals also increased. The vegetable oil index went up 9.6 percent, hitting an all-time high, and dairy rose by 2.6 points, with increased demand for butter, skimmed milk powder and whole milk powder, as buyers try to replenish low stocks. By contrast, cheese prices remained stable. For the third consecutive month, the meat index declined, amid reduced purchases of pork products from China, and a sharp decline in beef from Brazil. Poultry and sheep prices rose. After six consecutive monthly increases, sugar prices also dropped, by 1.8 percent, amidst limited global demand and large surpluses for export. Compared to last year, global cereal production for 2021, is anticipated to increase and reach a new record level, of some 2,793 million tonnes. World cereal consumption for 2021/22 is heading towards a 1.7?per cent gain, led by an anticipated increase in global food consumption of wheat, rising in tandem with a growing global population. The production, distribution and consumption of all this food, uses about a third of the world's total energy, according to a new report launched on Thursday on the sidelines of the UN's Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow. Feeding the world population is also responsible for about a third of global greenhouse gas emissions, making it a priority in the fight against climate change. The report, Renewable energy for agri-food systems \- Towards the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement, shares several examples of how that can be accomplished. Solar irrigation, for example, can improve access to water, enabling multiple cropping cycles and increasing resilience to changing rainfall patterns. In India, the use of solar irrigation pumps has raised farmers' incomes by at least 50 percent compared to when rain was the only option. In Rwanda, smallholder farmers' yields have grown by about a third. In a video message, FAO Director-General, Qu Dongyu, argued that the report ""shows that there are many opportunities to implement renewable energy solutions across agri-food systems."" The publication also provides recommendations, including better data collection to guide renewable energy investments, improved access to finance, and a greater focus on raising awareness and building capacity. According to the report, that growth has been mainly driven by mechanisation in Asia, such as irrigation pumps, farm machinery, processing equipment and inputs such as fertilisers. Energy use in Africa, which hosts around 15 percent of the global population, has remained largely constant, and only accounts for about 4 percent of the global consumption. The report is the result of a joint effort between FAO and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) \"

The UAE welcomes the opportunity to share its capabilities and experience in best-in-class methane performance with signatories to the EU-US led initiative that aims to cut global methane emissions by 30 per cent by the end of the decade. The UAE has long acted as a regional leader in methane reduction. Over five decades, the country has successfully reduced the volume of natural gas flared in the domestic energy sector by more than 90%. In turn, the UAE's hydrocarbon industry today holds one of the world's lowest methane intensities of 0.01%. The UAE will build on this foundation of ultra-low methane intensity in the energy sector to further improve its methane performance. The UAE aims to achieve the Oil & Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 ""gold standard"" by deploying advanced technology from drones to satellites, and to decarbonise natural gas to create low carbon blue hydrogen for industry. Dr. Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, UAE Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and Special Envoy for Climate Change, said: ""We are delighted to join the Global Methane Pledge, in this special year celebrating the Golden Jubilee of our nation. The UAE has continued to lead firsts in methane, since the UAE's founding father, the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, set up the first LNG production company in the Arabian Gulf, reduced flaring and achieved one of lowest methane intensities, still leading today."" He added: ""The UAE is also turning methane into opportunity with our ambitions to convert waste to energy. Together, this makes the UAE a unique leader in methane stewardship. We are delighted to help others, to share our experiences with the world, and commit to the Global Methane Pledge."" Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, UAE Minister of Climate Change and the Environment, expressed appreciation to the US and EU for leading the call to the Global Methane Pledge that will mobilise tangible actions in endorsing countries. She also thanked the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) for their work on the Global Methane Assessment report, published in May 2021. The document shows that reducing human-caused methane emissions is one of the most cost-effective and impactful strategies to slow down the rate of global warming. She added: ""The UAE is a keen supporter of the global efforts to address climate change. Recognising the urgent need for multilateral cooperation in this regard, we are proud to join the Global Methane Pledge and reaffirm our commitment to cutting down on methane emissions through domestic policy-making and developing innovative solutions."" The Global Methane Pledge acknowledges that ""readily available cost-effective methane emission measures have the potential to avoid over 0.2 degrees C of warming by 2050 while yielding important co-benefits, including improving public health and agricultural productivity."" The nation's methane mitigation strategy is part of a holistic approach to climate action. Recognising that agriculture contributes to global emissions, the nation has also partnered with the US and over 30 nations to launch the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate, a global initiative aimed at accelerating investments in R&D for climate-smart agri-tech. \"

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE227","UAE keen to seize economic opportunities of energy transition: Sultan Al Jaber","January 17, 2022 Monday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","DUBAI, 17th January, 2022 (WAM) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is keen to seize the economic opportunities presented by the energy transition, according to Dr. Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology, Special Envoy for Climate Change and Chairman of Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company (Masdar). Dr. Al Jaber made the remarks during the opening ceremony of Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ADSW) and awards ceremony of the Zayed Sustainability Prize at Expo 2020 Dubai, in the presence of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai. Delivering the opening address at the first major global sustainability event after COP26 (the UN Climate Conference), Dr. Al Jaber appreciated the wise leadership's keenness to ensure the safety of UAE citizens, visitors and residents. ""Thanks to the efforts and vision of the leadership, the UAE has become the most vaccinated country against COVID-19 in the world, and we have also strengthened our resilience while extending a helping hand to more than 135 countries in need."" Speaking to a live audience that included heads of states, ministers and policymakers, Dr. Al Jaber went on to detail how the UAE's Founding Father, the late Sheikh Zayed, laid the foundation for the country's progressive approach to climate change and sustainability and explained that the country is well-positioned to capitalise on the opportunities created by the energy transition. ""As the UAE celebrates its Golden Jubilee, we have seen 50 years of incredible progress. Our founding father, Sheikh Zayed, invested the wealth of a nation in the health of a nation. He balanced economic development with environmental responsibility. He believed that sharing made good nations great and guided the UAE to become one of the world's leading humanitarian donors. And, more than this, he taught the people of this nation to aim for the stars, so that one day we would explore Mars, Venus and beyond."" Dr. Al Jaber noted the world has also been transformed for the better over the last 50 years but this has posed fundamental questions of how to keep moving forward, while turning back the clock on emissions and how to enhance global prosperity. ""Finding the answers to these questions has been the mission of the Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week and the Zayed Sustainability Prize. A mission that builds on the UAE's position as a pioneer in clean energy. When we began investing in the renewables space more than 15 years ago, our leadership had a theory of the future that has been proven right over time. Today, the UAE is home to the largest and lowest cost solar plants in the world."" Dr. Al Jaber added, ""Globally, we see a bright future for the renewable energy sector as at least $3 trillion will be invested in renewable energy over the next 10 years. Through Masdar, we have invested in solar and wind energy projects in 40 countries around the world. Last month, under the direction of His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, three of the largest energy companies in the UAE entered into a strategic partnership to consolidate Masdar's position and turn it into a global leader in the field of clean energy. ""Thanks to this partnership, Masdar doubled its total renewable energy capacity, and our ambition is to build on these solid foundations and reach 100 gigawatts, and then double it to 200 gigawatts. This represents a massive opportunity, and the UAE and Masdar extend an open invitation to all our partners, public and private, to join us on this ambitious journey. This growth will contribute to creating job opportunities, new sectors and skills, and opening a new door of hope for present and future generations."" As the first country in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region to announce a Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative, the UAE is adopting a low carbon pathway to a high growth destination and is keen to accelerate progress on this journey as hosts of COP28, according to Dr. Al Jaber. Expanding on COP28, which is set to be held in Abu Dhabi in 2023, Dr. Al Jaber took the opportunity to thank President Moon Jae-in of the Republic of Korea and the Asia Pacific Group for their support in confirming the UAE as hosts. He went on to provide an insight into the UAE's approach. ""The UAE is looking forward to playing its role as host of COP28 and we take on this role with humility and a sense of great pride and responsibility. We will work closely with the COP presidencies of the UK and Egypt and build on their momentum. We will take a practical approach, that moves from pledges to action, focused on commercially viable climate solutions. ""We will give an equal voice to the developing world, align the public and the private sector, academics and engineers, civil society and industry. And that means all industry, including the hydrocarbon industry. Because, if there is one thing that the history of every energy transition tells us, it is that they take time. You cannot simply flip a switch,"" stressed Dr. Al Jaber. ""To successfully navigate a complex transition to the energy system of tomorrow, we can't just unplug from the energy system of today. We must remain pragmatic, while being progressive. We should look for the solutions where the energy expertise exists. And we should always remember that our goal is to hold back emissions, not progress."" While the world still needs oil and gas, the UAE is committed to making the current energy system work more efficiently with much less carbon, according to Dr. Al Jaber. He highlighted that ADNOC produces one of the least carbon intensive hydrocarbons in the world and, as of 17 days ago, 100 percent of ADNOC's grid power now comes from zero carbon energy sources. Dr. Al Jaber added that this is a first for the oil and gas industry and it is reducing emissions at scale, shaping the market for clean energy and making a direct contribution to the UAE's net zero push, not tomorrow, but today. Concluding his remarks, Dr. Al Jaber highlighted the importance of the Zayed Sustainability Prize, the UAE's pioneering global award in sustainability. ""Fifty years ago Sheikh Zayed instilled in the UAE a commitment to inclusive sustainable and humanitarian development that continues to this day.

The survey, conducted among 3,400 in face-to-face interviews with Arab youth aged 18 to 24 in 50 cities in 17 states in the Middle East and North Africa region from June 6 to 30, 2021, was released to coincide with the COP26 in Glasgow. Sunil John, president, Mena, BCW and founder of Asda£ BCW, said: ""In 2008, during the inaugural Arab Youth Survey, just 11 per cent of youth surveyed felt climate change and the environment were the biggest challenges facing the world. ""Fast forward 13 years, and climate change dominates the youth agenda, with 56 per cent saying they are concerned by the issues. This is an eye-opener for governments and private enterprises in the region on the urgent need to embrace positive climate action."" Technology can help overcome climate challenge ""If we view the survey as a barometer of sentiment, it seems the aspiration of young Arabs is one of encouraging governments and businesses to take a strong stance on sustainability,"" he said. Youth in the GCC show far more faith in meeting climate change challenges using technology than their counterparts in the Levant and North Africa, who expect climate issues to be addressed by changing the way we live our lives. Confidence in government action Around 43 per cent of survey respondents feel Arab governments should be doing more than other countries to address climate change, and therefore take a leading position on the world stage to address the important issues. Further, 37 per cent of youth think their governments have the same responsibility as others globally, and only 20 per cent say their government should be doing less than others. An overwhelming majority of 79 per cent of youth in the GCC strongly feel their government is capable of driving effective climate change mitigation measures, while in North Africa, 43 per cent of people feel their governments will be capable of dealing with climate change issues. ALSO READ: However, only 26 per cent of those surveyed in the Levant region believe their government is up to the task of dealing with climate change, showing wide disparities in the region. Further, in the GCC, some 44 per cent of respondents said Arab nations should be doing more than other nations. In North Africa, 39 per cent expect strong leadership action, compared to 45 per cent in the Levant - suggesting it is a regional imperative to show global leadership on climate issues. \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE229","China factories, malls, stores close due to power outages","September 30, 2021 Thursday","Big News Network.com","BEIJING China: China's growing power shortage, driven by tight coal supplies and toughening emission standards has, for weeks, halted production at several factories in key industrial hubs on the eastern and southern coasts, including many supplying Apple and Tesla factories. Meanwhile, shops and malls in the northeast, only lit by candlelight, shut early as the economic toll of the power squeeze worsened. The strong demand from manufacturers and industry has further aggravated the power shortage by pushing coal prices to record highs. The steel, aluminum and cement industries have also been hard hit by the output curbs, with about 7 percent of aluminum production capacity suspended and a drop of 29 percent in the nation's cement production, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a Monday note. Paper and glass could be the next industries to face supply disruptions, they said. Producers of chemicals, dyes, furniture and soymeal have also been affected. Rationing has been carried out during peak hours in many parts of northeastern China since last week, and residents of cities, including Changchun, said power outages were occurring sooner and lasting longer, state media reported. On Monday, State Grid Corp pledged to ensure basic power supplies and avoid electricity cuts. Meanwhile, the National Energy Administration has told coal and natural gas firms to guarantee that sufficient energy supplies are maintained to keep homes warm during the coming winter. China has vowed to cut energy intensity - the amount of energy consumed per unit of economic growth - by around 3 percent in 2021 to meet its climate goals. Its focus on energy intensity and decarbonization is unlikely to abate, analysts said, ahead of COP26 climate talks, which will be held in November in Glasgow when world leaders will lay out their climate agendas. The fallout of the power shortage has prompted some analysts to downgrade their 2021 growth outlook. Morgan Stanley analysts said production cuts, if prolonged, could reduce China's GDP growth in the fourth quarter by 1 percentage point. Last week, major coal producers in China met to try and resolve shortages and curb price increases. China, the world's largest energy consumer and source of climate-warming greenhouse gases, has said it aims to bring carbon emissions to a peak by 2030 and then decline to reach net zero by 2060. \"

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE231","5G, consolidation and sustainability: Five mobile industry trends to watch in 2022","December 29, 2021 Wednesday","TechRadar","The mobile industry continued to play a crucial role in society during 2021, helping billions of people around the globe stay connected to friends, family, and colleagues as lockdowns and pandemic-related disruptions continued into a second year. 5G rollouts continued at pace, new smartphones wowed consumers and businesses, while telcos diversified into new areas to meet demand for sophisticated collaboration and remote working technologies. Meanwhile the year ended with discussions of the metaverse and what role mobile communications can play in making this vision of an immersive, inter-connected future a reality. In the current climate it feels more difficult than ever to make any predictions with a degree of certainty. Covid-19 and an ever-changing technological landscape make sure of that. But that doesn't stop us trying. Here are five things to look out for in 2022. 5G adoption will rise but handset shortages will persist The first prediction is hardly one that would have required the alleged skills of Nostradamus, but 5G coverage will continue to expand during 2022 and adoption will rise. Ericsson says there will be 600 million 5G subscribers by the end of the year, boosted by operator rollouts, strong demand in China and North America, and the availability of cheaper compatible handsets. However as has been repeatedly stated by various industry observers in recent years, 5G is the first generation of mobile infrastructure where network availability is more prevalent than handset adoption. Although the pandemic has had an inevitable impact on network construction, the global chip shortage is having longer-lasting effects. The smartphone market showed some signs of recovery in early 2021 but a lack of key components contributed to a decline of 6.8% in Q3, according to Gartner. Although the premium segment is less affected by the shortage of key components such as radio frequency units, power management circuits, and other chips, a lack of 5G handsets in the mid and low end of the market could hamper adoption. Deloitte predicts that the shortage will last until at least 2022 and possibly even 2023. However some analysts are optimistic about the market's prospects next year. CCS Insight predicts 900 million 5G devices will be sold in 2022, accounting for half of all sales, so long as vendors and operators do their best to drive enthusiasm among consumers. (Image credit: Christoph Scholz/Flickr)Is telco consolidation back on the cards? In 2016, Three and O2 abandoned their planned \£310.25 billion merger because of hostility from UK and European regulators who feared a reduction from four operators into three would impact competition. The proposal followed similar transactions in other European countries where research suggested prices had risen as a result. Both parties moved on, with O2 merging with Virgin Media earlier this year, and Three looking for other areas to grow as a pure-play operator in the UK. However crucially, in 2020, Three's parent company CK Hutchison successfully challenged the EU's decision to block the deal. Fast forward to 2021 and operator are once again calling for consolidation to help cut costs and fund investments in full fibre and 5G. Mergers and partnerships have been seen elsewhere in the world and it appears as though regulators in Europe are more receptive to such moves given the importance of telecoms to wider economic strategies and society in a post-pandemic world. OpenRAN and the great diversification drive The OpenRAN ecosystem went from strength to strength in 2021, with signs that the telecoms industry is moving beyond a small group of big suppliers in the 5G era. Five of Europe's leading mobile operator groups - Deutsche Telekom, Orange, Telefonica, TIM, and Vodafone \- have agreed to work together on open networking technologies, and governments around the world are lending their support to R&D and commercialisation efforts. Some of this assistance is motivated by geopolitics. The UK government in particular has been a keen supporter of OpenRAN following the decision to ban Huawei from the rollout of 5G in Britain. However, OpenRAN could also reduce costs and increase innovation by removing the barriers to entry for smaller players in the market. Vodafone UK has committed to deploying OpenRAN at least 2,500 sites by 2027. Expect to see more trials \- especially with regards to interoperability - and more partnerships in 2022. (Image credit: Pixabay)5G will start to make an impact on the business world Nearly all commercial 5G deployments to date have relied on non-standalone 5G (NSA 5G), which uses new radio technologies but still relies on the underlying 4G core. However, 2021 saw the shift towards Standalone 5G (SA 5G), which uses a virtual cloud-based core that allows data to be processed closer to the point of collection and enables features like network slicing. SA 5G offers guaranteed speeds, enhanced reliability, and ultra-low latency \- features that will enable the most revolutionary 5G applications and drive the most significant revenue opportunities for operators. These include the Industrial Internet of Things (IoT), advanced robotics, and mixed reality (MR). Supported by partnerships with the IT industry that will allow operators to diversify their offering, businesses will increasingly use or at least explore the use of 5G for private networks, edge computing, and Internet of Things (IoT) services. Sustainability will remain a key issue The mobile industry has long positioned itself not only as an enabler of economic growth but a force for good \- especially when it comes to environmental issues. The warnings of the UN's report into climate change and the COP26 conference brought sustainability into the public's consciousness like never before and operators have been eager to tout their green credentials. The shift to renewable sources of power, the adoption of more energy efficient network standards like 5G, and the development of services such as IoT that allow customers to reduce their carbon footprint are three examples of this. Expect to see much more of this in 2022. However, it's also important that the entire industry continues and accelerates its efforts. Deloitte predicts that smartphones will generate 146 million tonnes of CO2 in 2022 and although this is less of 0.5% of global emissions, analysts believe this can be reduced. Production should be more energy efficient, devices and materials should be recycled wherever possible, and handsets should be easier to repair. All of these measures will reduce emissions and e-waste, allowing the mobile industry to fulfil its environmental potential. Recent events suggest there is room for optimism.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE232","Why sustainable engineering is good business","December 22, 2021 Wednesday","ArabianBusiness.com","COP26 saw nations come together and make new environmental pledges, including a US-China agreement to boost cooperation in combating climate change, India's pledge to achieve net zero by 2070 and 23 countries committing to phasing out coal. However, we all know that it will take more than government pledges to keep the global temperature rise below 1.50 Celsius. Industry has a key role to play in fighting climate change, which is why we're seeing the prioritisation of environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals growing across all sectors, with many organisations making a pledge to achieve net zero by 2040. Investors now focus on sustainable outcomes This is, of course, the right thing to do, but it's also becoming a business necessity as investors turn their back on investments that don't support sustainable outcomes. Investment and asset management firm BlackRock, for example, has made commitments to extend funding exclusively to companies that demonstrate progress against their specific ESG initiatives. Today, moving towards greener capital projects and operations isn't only to gain regulatory approval, it's also needed to secure access to funding. And investors aren't doing this out of the kindness of their heart. They understand that sustainable engineering and operations aren't just ethically commendable, they're good business, too. Sustainable engineering and operations offer financial gains There's a growing body of evidence pointing out that higher sustainability performance converts into a better financial performance. An impressive 90 percent of studies on the topic found that high ESG standards reduced companies' capital costs and that 80 percent show a positive correlation between stock price performance and good sustainability practices. One of the easiest ways to discover potential sustainability gains is through digital transformation. The latest technologies can help you design sustainable plants more quickly, and also build and run them more efficiently. According to Deloitte, digital transformation can provide a 5-10 percent reduction in build costs and a 10-20 percent reduction in operational costs. Digital transformation also benefits existing brownfield sites by enabling improved decision-making and real-time performance optimisation. Driving both efficiency and sustainability initiatives forward simultaneously, benefits can include reduced energy consumption, waste and emissions. This is achieved through the use of technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), process simulation, cloud computing, big data analytics and digital twins to operate assets sustainably by understanding their performance, and predicting future behavior. The insights provided can help reduce operational and maintenance costs by approximately 20 percent, dramatically reduce fuel costs by 28 percent, significantly improve asset safety, efficiency and reliability, and drive productivity, all by providing fast and accurate data about what is happening across the business. Sustainability is driving digital transformation Two thirds of organisations believe the ability to share data sets across teams in real time will have the greatest impact on sustainability, while significant sustainability gains can also come from solutions such as data monitoring. Digital solutions like cloud computing, machine learning, AI, and digital twins will be needed to achieve these capabilities. Take multinational business Henkel, for example. The laundry and homecare giant used an energy monitoring system to analyse and lower energy use by 16 percent year-on-year, saving it EUR37 million to date and playing its part to shape a more sustainable future. Another example of digital transformation's effect on sustainability comes from Covestro, which used process simulation to improve the energy efficiency, and therefore sustainability, of its Germany-based brownfield sites. ""Process simulation can directly determine the optimal energy efficient process by simulation-based optimisation. When comparing the optimal process with the actual energy consumption directly it reveals the inefficiencies of our processes and opportunities for improvement,"" said Christian Redepenning, Covestro's Global Technology Expert, at a recent AVEVA webinar on building a sustainable chemical industry. Then there's Aker Carbon Capture's implementation of a single engineering platform. This helped develop new sustainable processes such as carbon capture by breaking down data silos and increasing engineering and design efficiency. Using integrated engineering and project execution technologies on the cloud, Aker was able to improve collaboration between teams, resulting in increased engineering efficiency which allows them to deliver new carbon capture facilities 50 percent faster. David Phillips, head of UK and investor relations at Aker Carbon Capture. ""Working in the cloud has meant that our people have been able to engage much more easily across projects and geographies and we've been able to optimise the way we work together,"" said David Phillips, head of UK and investor relations at Aker Carbon Capture. ""As a company we're really focused on accelerating the uptake of carbon capture and to do that we need to reduce the cost of the process and end product we'll supply our customers. We've found digital transformation has helped us standardise our processes and improve efficiency and we've been able to reduce our engineering man hours dramatically."" Sustainability's good for business As organisations focus on sustainability and look for ways to accelerate their path to net zero, they're discovering more and more that sustainable engineering and operations isn't just good for the environment, but also for their bottom line. Digital transformation unlocks the performance benefits of advanced technology to gain efficiencies that both improve sustainability and lower costs.

A new report for the UK Cities Climate Investment Commission (UKCCIC) calls for 'place-based demonstrators' or neighbourhood pilots where green investment opportunities can be gathered together as a package, stating that this will attract returns in the form of savings, additional revenue streams and other social and environmental benefits. The UKCCIC is a partnership between Connected Places Catapult, Core Cities UK and London Councils and aims to explore new ways of helping UK cities reach their net zero targets. Together London Councils and the Core Cities represent almost half of the UK population. The report will be showcased to international investors at an event in the Blue Zone of COP 26 in Glasgow on November 3 featuring local and international politicians. It also outlines other investment opportunities including commercial and domestic building decarbonisation and green transport, but states that renewable electricity generation is likely the most attractive opportunity for investors. The report adds that the total costs of getting London and the Core Cities to net zero could top \£3200 billion, a figure that would be impossible to raise without private sector investment. Cllr Nick Forbes, Chair of Core Cities UK and Leader of Newcastle City Council said: ""This report underlines the scale of the investment potential across our 11 Core Cities and London, and the essential role that private finance can play to support the transition to net zero. ""Life for many of our 30 million citizens will change dramatically over the next few years. It is our job to map out the path to net zero, and to then work with private finance to lead our cities on that journey, ensuring everyone benefits from a greener, healthier future."" Professor Greg Clark, Chair of Connected Places Catapult said: ""The UKCCIC will accelerate opportunities for public and private investment in net zero transitions for UK cities by making the investment case and combined scale of opportunity clearer and more bankable."" Mayor Philip Glanville, Chair of London Councils' Transport and Environment Committee, said: ""London boroughs and the UK's 11 Core Cities have a huge responsibility as economic and population centres to create solutions to reach net zero targets. Securing private finance will be critical to meeting our climate ambitions and today's report outlines the substantial opportunities available to invest in and be part of our net zero journey."" ""This commission highlights the need to work with government and private investors, but also with people and communities who, through investment, will be able to make changes and play a part in reducing the UK's carbon emissions and supporting a green economic recovery. ""We're excited about securing investment for the neighbourhood pilots outlined in the report, which will enable us to connect climate action, improving public health, reducing inequalities and supporting a just transition that can also address issues like fuel poverty and the cost of living crisis,"" he added. Keith Bottomley, Chairman of the City of London Corporation's Environmental Services Committee, said: ""With COP26 just weeks away, there is now real momentum in the UK and across the world to take positive, radical action to address the climate crisis which threatens us all. In the City we're committed to working towards a net zero Square Mile by 2040, but private sector investment is crucial in enabling the rest of the country to reach net zero status.""  \"

Therefore, the summit will provide opportunities for creative minds in this field to exchange ideas and innovations, which will ensure a sustainable future. The summit will take place at an ideal time, as Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states have begun utilising various energy sources, leading the region's related efforts. Under this framework, several countries in the region have pledged to establish the infrastructure to reduce dependency on fossil fuels, especially with the emergence of green hydrogen production projects. Oman plans to build the largest green hydrogen production factory in the world worth US$30 billion, which will operate at full capacity in 2038 and generate 25 watts from wind and solar power. The US also plans to invest an additional $550 billion in clean energy while China has already issued green bonds worth $154.7 billion. In the UAE, Masdar, in cooperation with its partners, Siemens Energy and Marubeni, plans to develop a pilot green hydrogen production plant in Masdar City. Mubadala, the company that owns Masdar, recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and the Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding Company (ADQ) to form an alliance to produce green and blue hydrogen. Dubai inaugurated the first green hydrogen production facility in the Middle East and North Africa that operates with solar power, with total investments amounting to $11 million.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE236","Greening the hardest sectors is crucial","September 29, 2021 Wednesday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","Reuters World leaders are making increasingly ambitious commitments to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and limit the catastrophic effects of climate change. But to convert commitments into results, more must be done to decarbonise all sectors of the global economy rapidly. This process will be relatively easier for sectors like electricity and passenger cars, where clean-energy solutions are ready for deployment at scale. But it will be much more difficult for aviation, cement, shipping, steel, and other ""hard-to-abate"" sectors. Achieving net-zero emissions in these sectors requires the rapid commercialisation of technologies that are not yet quite ready for deployment at scale; and commercialisation, in turn, will require coordination across industries. Suppliers of products such as steel need to align with their customers, financial partners, policymakers, and other stakeholders to agree on a decarbonisation pathway for their industries. Such a consensus is necessary to ensure that everyone understands which technologies are progressing and at what pace. With that knowledge, everyone can align on the process of investing in low-carbon assets with long life cycles, such as steel mills, cement factories, ships, and airplanes. Achieving this level of alignment across global industries is not easy, but it can be done. Consider the shipping industry, which has already developed a global decarbonisation pathway under the leadership of the Global Maritime Forum's Getting to Zero Coalition. This four-step alignment process, enshrined in the Poseidon Principles, is now being replicated across other hard-to-abate sectors under the leadership of the Mission Possible Partnership. The MPP is a global coalition of industrial and climate leaders focused on supercharging efforts to decarbonise some of the world's highest-emitting industries in the next ten years. Its immediate priority this year is to shine a spotlight on the leading hard-to-abate sectors at the COP26 climate-change conference in Glasgow this November. While the previous United Nations climate-change conferences have focused primarily on national commitments and policymaking, additional mechanisms need to be activated to accelerate the pace of emissions reductions. Ambitious climate targets will not be within reach until the leaders of the industries that produce the most emissions have decarbonised their entire global supply chains. As my former colleague Paul Bodnar of BlackRock likes to say, ""The real economy is not a side show"". Elevating industry to the same level of importance as national governments is critical. A few key technologies will be essential to decarbonisation efforts across all hard-to-abate sectors. Chief among these is green hydrogen produced with renewable electricity and electrolysers. Efforts to scale up green hydrogen production are already underway with programs such as the Green Hydrogen Catapult and the US Department of Energy's recently announced Hydrogen Shot, which is modelled after the successful SunShot programme that rapidly brought down solar-panel costs. Moreover, there are early signs of rising industrial demand for the low-emissions products that green hydrogen enables. The automaker Volvo, for example, has announced that it will source fossil-fuel-free steel from the Swedish green-steel venture HYBRIT. Technologies to improve efficiency are another key (though less exciting) ingredient in decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors. Whether it means deploying lightweight aircraft or constructing buildings with less steel, the less energy an industry uses overall, the easier the process becomes. A recent analysis from the Energy Transitions Commission (ETC) shows that the first step to building a net-zero global economy by 2050 is simply to use less energy, followed by scaling up and universalising clean-energy sources. The ETC also highlights the importance of carbon capture and sequestration, which will be needed not only to offset industrial processes that cannot be fully decarbonised, but also to reduce the level of carbon dioxide already emitted into the atmosphere. Accounting for historic emissions is a complex process that most industrial leaders have yet to consider fully. But they had better start thinking about it now, because any realistic pathway to keep global warming within 1.5\'b0 Celsius of pre-industrial levels will have to include reducing atmospheric CO2. Not only do we need to remove massive quantities of CO2 from the atmosphere; we also must find long-term storage solutions to keep it locked away for hundreds or even thousands of years. This is where the gap between the net-zero objective and existing technologies is the largest. Who should bear the costs of tackling this problem? Certainly, many argue that the countries and companies responsible for the largest share of historic global emissions should assume a corresponding responsibility for CO2 removal. In an upcoming article, the World Economic Forum's Global Future Council on Net-Zero Transition will explore this issue and describe different approaches for how we might reach a consensus on responsibility for historic emissions. As we look towards COP26 , we must pay ample attention to all these challenges. National governments and global industries alike need to act immediately to reduce emissions; merely committing to act in the future is no longer acceptable. The longer we fail to lock in more sustainable development pathways, the harder it will be to keep global temperatures at a safe level. Even if we do reduce annual emissions somewhat, it is the cumulative amount of CO2 in the atmosphere that matters. If that is still growing, the problem will not be solved. We need global leaders everywhere to understand the scale and urgency of the crisis we face. Radical collaboration and coordinated action are required right now, from everyone. It is not just future generations that are depending on us. So too are the tens of millions of people already suffering in terrible heatwaves, fires, floods, droughts, and storms. From California and Texas to entire regions of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, the catastrophic consequences of the climate crisis are compounding. While the costs of reducing emissions are significant, they are negligible compared to the costs of failing to do so. - Jules Kortenhorst is CEO of RMI.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE237","The rise and rise of veganism in Britain","October 29, 2021 Friday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","Going vegan or vegetarian has become mainstream in Britain, as new coverts join the momentum to switch to a plant-based diet File photo What do global movers and shakers eat when they meet and confabulate about major issues? Next week, world leaders will congregate in Glasgow for the COP26 summit, with mixed hopes among billions across the globe of what the event will eventually achieve in terms of global warming and climate change. But keeping with the event's aspirations, one aspect has already been decided: plant-based dishes will dominate the menu, with 80 per cent of the food seasonal and sourced in Scotland. Overall, 95 per cent of the food will be from the United Kingdom, focused on the idea that sustainability should be at the heart of catering for the summit, reducing emissions and promoting environment-friendly food production. Campaigners wanted a 100 per cent vegan menu to be served, but the fact that most of the dishes will be plant-based at such a high-profile international event is music to their ears. Each item will have an estimate of its carbon footprint, helping delegates make climate-friendly choices. Items will include Edinburgh's Mara Seaweed, which is abundant, sustainable, does not require fertiliser, fresh water or soil to grow, as well as Benzies carrots and potatoes that use wind turbines to power their cool storage, biomass to provide heating and actively recycle the water they use. Cups used to serve drinks will be reusable, washable 1,000 times; it is estimated that this approach will save up to 250,000 single-use cups. Says Alok Sharma, Cabinet minister in the Boris Johnson government and COP26 president: ""There will be a tremendous amount of work to be done at COP26 , with many hours of negotiations and long days, so the choice of food that we serve our visiting delegations, staff and all our volunteers is very important. It is exciting to see such innovation in the menus that will be on offer and to understand the thought and effort that has gone into making dishes both healthy, sustainable and suitable for different diets and requirements. We very much look forward to giving our international visitors a flavour of the wide-ranging cuisine the UK has to offer."" This focus on a plant-based menu at the Glasgow summit seems inevitable given the growing momentum in Britain in recent years to switching to a vegan diet, which is a step further than a vegetarian diet, since it excludes dairy products ('vegan' was coined from the first three and last two letters of 'vegetarian' in 1944, when The Vegan Society was formed with just 25 members). According to the society, ""A vegan is someone who tries to live without exploiting animals, for the benefit of animals, people and the planet. Vegans eat a plant-based diet, with nothing coming from animals  no meat, milk, eggs or honey, for example."" The momentum is driven by philosophical, religious and other reasons, but mainly by widely-publicised scientific research that animal agriculture and animal products are disastrous for the planet, and that cutting out animal products from the diet is the single-most effective action an individual can take to help fight climate change. A vegan supply chain From the United Nations calling for a wider global uptake of plant-based diet in 2010, to a host of studies and mass awareness drives by campaign groups subsequently, veganism has gone mainstream, with superstores, restaurants as well as manufacturers of cosmetics, medicines, toiletries, fashion and textiles making it known that their food and goods are vegan, catering to a growing niche customer base. Coffee lovers can now enjoy a flat white with soy, oat, coconut or almond milk instead of whole milk, besides a large number of dishes that earlier used dairy products. Cadbury hit the headlines when it announced that from November there would be a vegan alternative to its signature Dairy Milk chocolate bar. The new Cadbury Plant Bar would substitute almond paste for the 'glass and a half of milk' that is supposed to be in the Dairy Milk bar. 'Veganuary', a charity organisation that encourages people to try vegan diet in January and beyond, enlisted pledges of more than 580,000 people this year. Says senior journalist Syed Zubair Ahmed: ""It's been over a year since I last had meat. My journey to being vegetarian was slow. First, I gave up eating beef way back in 1984 when I was a university student. I tried to give up eating meat completely several times since then but it was difficult to resist. Gradually, I stopped cooking meat at home. And then in the first month of Covid I decided to cut out meat completely... Going vegan or vegetarian appears to be a fad in the West but those who have turned vegetarian or eating vegan food know what they are getting into. Even when I ate meat I believed vegetarianism is a higher form of living. Eating meat was fine when we lived with nature 12-13,000 years ago. We have a choice now. Giving up animal products is achieving that higher form of living I have always been hankering after. My next goal is to stop eating all animal products, including milk and eggs. I love oat milk anyway. I believe being vegan is being more civilised."" According to new research by The Vegan Society, a large number of Britons reduced the amount of animal products they consume since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. It found that 1 in 5 (20 per cent) people have reduced the amount of meat they are eating while 12 per cent said they have minimised their eggs and dairy intake. Seven per cent of respondents revealed they have cut down on all three, meaning that 1 in 4 (25 per cent) have actively cut back on some form of animal products since the first lockdown. It also found that more than a third (34 per cent) people are spending more time with their companion animals, and 32 per cent are thinking more about their personal impact on the planet. In a second survey aimed at those who had cut back on animal products, 35 per cent said they were mainly motivated by health concerns, with that figure rising to 39 per cent for those aged 55+, while 30 per cent said the environment was their primary motivation, and almost 1 in 4 (21 per cent) said it was down to animal rights issues. Louisianna Waring, Insight and Commercial Policy Officer at the society, says: ""It's fantastic to see that not only are people consciously cutting back on animal products, but that this trend has continued over the last 12 months. It's no surprise that the pandemic has inspired so many consumers to make the switch to plant-based alternatives and adopt a more planet-friendly diet. Covid-19 has certainly made people think twice about what they're eating and where it's coming from. This is highlighted by the large number of people cutting down on animal products because of their own health concerns."" New research published in the British Medical Journal says that plant-based or pescatarian diets were associated with lower odds of moderate-to-severe Covid-19. The Vegan Society will make its presence felt at Glasgow through its various campaigns ('Plate Up for the Planet'), adverts and messaging on buses, digital billboards, subway stations, performances and an outreach stand in a shopping mall. The legislation debate Campaigners would like the turn to veganism to be backed by legislation, with subsidies for plant-based food, but opinion within the Johnson government is mixed. According to the independent Climate Change Committee, people should be encouraged by the government to cut the amount of meat and dairy they eat, recommending a 20 per cent shift away from those products by 2030, since reducing meat and dairy consumption will cut emissions from agriculture and release land to plant trees to help absorb carbon dioxide. But the Johnson government has said it will maintain people's freedom of choice in their diet. Business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has spoken to the media about the importance of veganism to climate change. He may adopt a vegan diet at some point to play his part in the global climate effort, since lifestyle changes would be needed across society if the UK government is to hit its new emissions target: cut by 78 per cent on 1990 levels by 2035. He says: ""I'm certainly reducing my meat consumption, not only for environmental reasons but also for health reasons. I'm eating a lot more fish than I ever did before and maybe I can move to a full vegan diet at some point. The number of people who are vegans, who are reducing their meat intake, is going up all the time. I think that there is a lot of societal change that will actually help us and drive the progress to 2035"", admitting that the government should ""accelerate the change"" and praised the boom in plant-based diets, which is taking place ""without government legislation"". Kwarteng's views about veganism stand in sharp contrast to Johnson's. According to the prime minister, veganism is a ""crime against cheese lovers"". Asked recently on BBC about his 2020 resolution to lose weight and if he would be ditching meat and dairy products from his diet, he said it would require ""too much concentration"", adding that while he ""tipped his hat off to vegans who can handle it"", a vegan diet is ""a crime against cheese lovers"". Campaigners were quick to point out that vegan-friendly cheeses are now available in every grocery store, besides other alternatives to dairy products. The latest alt-milk to hit the market  besides almond, soy, coconut, oat  is potato milk; the market for plant milk alone is estimated to be \£3400 million a year, while the global plant-based alternatives market is pegged at over \£3115 billion. The Vegan Trademark is already established, helping users identify that a product is free from animal ingredients since 1990. Over 56,000 products worldwide, including cosmetics, clothing, food, drink, household items, and many more display the Vegan Trademark. In 2019 alone, The Vegan Society registered 14,262 products with the Vegan Trademark, which was an increase from 2018, when 9,590 products were registered. The Vegan Trademark is present in 108 countries, with over 50 per cent of products registered coming from companies based outside of the UK. Vegan and plant-based foods are the fastest-growing category of foods people are ordering, according to leading food-delivery companies in the United States, Canada and the UK. Campaigners say globally the number of vegans is nearly 80 million; of those in the UK, 66 per cent are women. A new report by think-tank Chatham House says post-Covid economic recovery efforts by governments across the globe provide a unique opportunity to put in place measures for a 'green recovery'. Its report, Food System Impacts On Biodiversity Loss, says: ""Over the past 50 years, the conversion of natural ecosystems for crop production or pasture has been the principal cause of habitat loss, in turn reducing biodiversity Without reform of our food system, biodiversity loss will continue to accelerate Reform will rely on the use of three principal levers: Firstly, global dietary patterns need to converge around diets based more on plants, owing to the disproportionate impact of animal farming on biodiversity, land use and the environment Secondly, more land needs to be protected and set aside for nature Thirdly, we need to farm in a more nature-friendly, biodiversity-supporting way, limiting the use of inputs and replacing monoculture with polyculture farming practices Dietary change and a reduction in food waste are critical to breaking the system lock-ins that have driven the intensification of agriculture and the continued conversion of native ecosystems to crop production and pasture."" The flip side For all the enthusiasm to adopt veganism and stick to it rigorously, it has many critics, besides attracting the old joke: ""How do you known someone's a vegan? Answer: They'll tell you"". There is also the fact that almost everything edible involves some kind of animal suffering; all one can do is try and minimise it through food choices. One website is dedicated to its point that almonds are not vegan. It may be impossible to be 100 per cent vegan, since plants get nutrients from the soil, which often contains decayed remains of animals, besides pollination by bees and others species. The jury is out and both sides hold on to their positions passionately. Ward Clark, author of Misplaced Compassion: The Animal Rights Movement Exposed, writes in an online essay titled ""The Myth of the 'Ethical Vegan'"": ""Unfortunately for the ethical vegan, the production of their food alone reduces their claim to impossibility. Animals are killed in untold millions, in the course of plant agriculture. Some are killed accidentally in the course of mechanised farming; some are killed deliberately in the course of pest control... Every potato, every stick of celery, every cup of rice, and every carrot has a blood trail leading from field to plate Ethical vegans, as a class, fail utterly to put any of their professed ethics into action. They claim to not cause harm to animals, but they do; when confronted, they claim to cause less harm to animals than the non-vegan, but they are utterly unable to show that to be true... They are intimately involved, every day, in an activity that causes the deaths of millions of animals..."" (Prasun is a journalist based in London. He tweets @PrasunSonwalkar) \"

Patron Sponsor of the United Nations Global Compact SDG Ambition, 3M, in collaboration with The American Business Council in Dubai (AmCham Dubai), hosted an exclusive conference titled 'Sustainability: The Business of Saving the World' in line with its commitment to invest $1 billion over the next 20 years to accelerate new environmental goals. The day-long event featured a series of discussions and insight-driven symposium at the USA Pavilion in the Opportunity District of Expo 2020 Dubai, a platform that is currently bringing the world together for sustainable change. The timely conference, focused on scaling public and private sector cross-collaboration towards a more sustainable future, was held alongside the 26th UN Climate Change Conference, COP26 . The powerful collection of sustainability leaders shared their views ranged from international and local entities across two panel sessions moderated by the Managing Director of the American Chambers of Commerce, Cara Nazari. Local and international sustainability thought leaders shared their response to business challenges and how they are embedding sustainability throughout their strategy to improve lives. Laszlo Svinger, Vice-President and Managing Director at 3M Middle East & Africa, said: ""3M is all about harnessing the power of partnership and collaboration to shape a better tomorrow and meet our UN SDG commitments without leaving anyone behind. Expo 2020 Dubai has provided the perfect platform for companies like ours to come together and strategically map out a future with purpose. To achieve this in Middle East & Africa, we need to join hands with countries, companies, multilateral organizations, educational institutions and, of course, our customers, who are at the centre of everything we do."" Cara Nazari, Managing Director of the American Chambers of Commerce, added: ""What we are doing today is going beyond mere discussion and bringing cross-societal dialogue for change. We have all the necessary elements for mapping out a brighter future represented in our symposium today and the time is ripe to make a difference. The combination of government, business and community is irresistible, we must all define a path that works best for all of us from today, to deliver grassroots impact from tomorrow."" 91 percent of respondents in the 3M State of Science Index 2021, a third-party, independent research study which was recently expanded to include the UAE, agree that the world should work together on scientific solutions to address pressing issues, including future pandemics and climate change. 3M has led a comprehensive global response to country-specific needs since the pandemic began. Earlier this year, the company's global innovation leader announced new environmental goals to help mitigate climate change, achieve cleaner air, improve water quality, and reduce waste including:  Investing approximately $1 billion over the next 20 years to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, reduce water usage by 25 percent at its facilities, and return higher quality water to the environment after use in manufacturing operations.  Reducing dependence on virgin fossil-based plastic by 125 million pounds by 2025. 3M has already begun installing technologies at its facilities worldwide including the Middle East to accelerate these environmental goals. The company will continue to collaborate with customers, governments, and global partners to address the challenges associated with climate change  including water use, water quality and waste  and use its science-based approach to innovate new products and solutions.

For instance, with our solar PV projects, including the flagship 1,177 MW Noor Abu Dhabi and the 2GW Al Dhafra single-site solar PV plant as well as the Barakah peaceful nuclear power plant, we expect the emirate's electricity in 2025 to be almost 7% from solar and 47% from nuclear. This means, in just five years Abu Dhabi will be producing almost 55% of its electricity from clean sources, halving the CO2 emissions associated with the power sector. ""Moreover, the Abu Dhabi Demand Side Management and Energy Efficiency Strategy is already in action and anticipated to reduce the emirate's electricity consumption by 22% and water consumption by 32% by 2030, avoiding the emission of more than 9 million tons of CO2 from the atmosphere. ""Such rigorous initiatives to building clean energy capacity are backed by forward-looking policies and a flexible regulatory framework that we continuously optimize to steer the energy sector's transformation into a system that enables socio-economic growth, ensures secure and affordable supply, and promotes environmental sustainability. ""The UAE net zero announcement creates momentum for us ahead of the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow next month and cements our state's position as a major contributor to the global effort to reduce the impacts of climate change. We embrace our role in fast-tracking a green transition that capitalizes on economic growth and environmental protection and will continue to leverage our resources and initiatives to provide sustainable energy and water solutions that benefit our emirate, our nation and the world we live in.""

UAE's investments in renewables and climate smart-agriculture will generate wealth, jobs, stability The UAE is using modern technology and innovation in agriculture as it looks forward to producing its own food so as to reduce relying on imported food products in the future, said Mariam Almheiri, Minister for Climate Change and Environment. During a virtual discussion on UAE's climate strategy and food security on Tuesday evening, Almheiri noted that the UAE was implementing a sustainable approach to food security by adopting modern technology and innovation as an integral aspect of its National Food Security Strategy. ""This strategy includes launching numerous initiatives that utilise modern agricultural technology \- or 'AgTech' \- that is powered by research and development to find solutions to climate and environmental challenges of the current food systems,"" she said. More than 90 percent of the food in the UAE is being imported from various countries across the world. She noted that one of the potential projects that will bring overall benefit to economy, environment and food security is Abu Dhabi's ambitious Seawater Energy and Agriculture System (SEAS) project that aims at producing alternative aviation biofuel along with seafood. The SEAS projects will bolster the economy by supporting the growth of multiple sectors in the country, such as aviation, oil refining, agriculture and aquaculture, according to Almheiri. ""The project is creating a new agriculture industry using salt water and desert land to grow salt-resistant cash crops producing biofuel in the UAE,"" she said. The UAE minister explained that greenhouses, closed-system firms, closed-environment agriculture, vertical farms that can control the environment are some of the innovative agricultural systems picking up in the country as well, not only for the production of vegetables but also on the side of aquaculture. She noted that the Agricultural Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for Climate) initiative also represents an important step towards activating a global movement that aims to enhance food security, achieve global climate targets, and support the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals. The UAE and the United States, with support from the United Kingdom and other nations, had in April this year announced the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate at President Biden's Leaders Summit on Climate. AIM for Climate seeks to address the principal challenges related to the agricultural sector and climate change, including emissions, food security, and water security.

It was only when they started to diversify their economies away from oil and engage in economic transformation, they raised prospects for sustainable growth. For instance, Saudi Arabia, following the launch of its national transformation programme Vision 2030, five years ago, increased investment and government resources into putting the country on a more environmentally sustainable footing. However, a surge of new net zero pledges from the Middle East's oil producing nations, last month, has raised expectations ahead of the United Nations COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow starting October 31. MEGA PLANS The world's top oil exporter Saudi Arabia announced late last month that it would aim to reach net zero emissions by 2060 by investing more than $186 billion into a green economy over that time - or roughly one to two years' worth of its current oil revenue, reported Reuters. Saudi Arabia estimated that revenue at SR412 billion ($110 billion) in 2020, and expects to rake in SR770 billion ($205 billion) this year as oil price recover. Bahrain made the same net zero commitment, just days after the United Arab Emirates said it would hit that target by 2050 and invest $163 billion in renewable energy. The three nations - along with fellow crude exporters Qatar and Kuwait - are among the world's top 10 carbon dioxide emitters per capita, according to the World Bank. In his speech at the Middle East Green Initiative Summit, His Royal Highness Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman said the kingdom, which is the world's top oil exporter, would contribute 15 per cent of the funds and would work with other states and development funds on the funding and execution of the initiatives. ""As part of the kingdom's leading role in developing energy markets, it will work to establish an investment fund for carbon circular economy solutions in the region and an initiative to offer clean energy solutions to help feed more than 750 million people worldwide,"" he said. When plans for the Middle East Green Initiative were first announced in March, the prince said it aimed to reduce carbon emissions in the region's hydrocarbon industry by 60 per cent and reverse desertification in one of world's most water-stressed regions by planting billions of trees. No investment figure was provided for the Middle East Green Initiative. Saudi Arabia has said its own Saudi Green Initiative programme would involve investments of over SR700 billion ($190 billion) by 2030. In his speech, Crown Prince Mohammed said the kingdom would work to establish a regional early storm warning center. He also announced that a regional center for climate change would be established, a regional center for carbon capture and storage would be developed and the establishment of a regional center for the sustainable development of fisheries and a regional cloud seeding program as well as the establishment of the ""Green Initiative Foundation,"" a non-profit organization to support the summit's work in the future. Last March, Saudi Arabia announced the launch of the Green Saudi Arabia and Green Middle East initiatives to improve the quality of life by increasing reliance on clean energy, neutralising the effects of oil and protecting the environment. Notably, these initiatives aim to plant 50 billion trees in the region and reduce carbon emissions by more than 10 per cent of global contributions. Emissions are mostly produced by burning fossil fuels and achieving net zero means a country emits no more greenhouse gases than it can capture or absorb. Saudi Arabia would help create the necessary infrastructure by working to establish a regional carbon capture and storage centre, a regional early storm warning centre, a regional cloud seeding programme and a hub for climate change, Crown Prince Mohammed said. Wealthy Gulf Opec members like Saudi Arabia and the UAE are investing in renewable and clean energy while also stressing the continued importance of hydrocarbons for global energy security at a time of growing calls for a shift away from fossil fuels. Gulf states, whose economies still rely heavily on oil income, have also increased focus on food security in a region heavily reliant on imports.  \"

The forum convened governments, companies, financial actors, and non-state leaders to raise ambition on forests and land use in a way that delivers for the climate, people, economic development, and biodiversity.Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, Minister of Climate Change and Environment, said: ""When forests are lost and land is degraded, we are at a risk of losing the countless services these vital ecosystems offer, such as providing critical habitats for biodiversity and acting as natural carbon sinks to regulate climate at the forefront. We believe in the multilateral process as key to solving global challenges. Therefore, the UAE has endorsed the Glasgow Leaders' Declaration on Forests and Land Use, and will work with other like-minded nations to end and reverse forest loss and land degradation worldwide. We urge all leaders to join forces in the global transition to sustainable land use.""In the fight against land degradation, the UAE reinforces its blue carbon ecosystems \- coastal vegetation such as mangrove forests, saltmarshes, and seagrass meadows. Mangrove forests serve as powerful carbon sinks that sequester CO2 and enhance environmental resilience, thus offering considerable climate change mitigation and adaption benefits as well as providing critical habitats for biodiversity.To expand its blue carbon ecosystems, the country has committed to planting 30 million mangroves by 2030 in its second Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC).The UAE has rolled out the National Blue Carbon Project that aims to enhance understanding about carbon storage and other services provided by the coastal ecosystems in the country. The project provides options for integrating these learnings into policy and management, leading to the sustainable use of these ecosystems and their services, and their preservation for future generations.The UAE is employing modern technologies and innovative solutions in its efforts to combat land degradation, including leveraging drones to map agricultural areas and sow tree seeds to reduce sand encroachment. Drones have helped disperse 6 million acacia seeds and 250,000 ghaf seeds across 25 sites nationwide.In addition, the UAE is leveraging highly innovative drone planting technology to sow mangrove seeds. This goal is supported by the ambitious Plantation Rehabilitation Program that involves the rehabilitation of all types of plants, especially rare species and those on the brink of extinction.The country is currently establishing the Abu Dhabi Plant Genetic Resources Centre (Gene Bank) that will be the largest in the region with a capacity to store 20,000 samples once completed in 2022. The facility aims to preserve plant biological diversity in the UAE and the wider region, and to help reproduce it in nature.Recognizing that protected areas play a key role in conserving endangered species and their habitats, the UAE has 49 protected areas that account for 15.5 percent of the country's territory.To guide the country's efforts to protect and restore its natural environment, the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE) is updating the National Strategy to Combat Desertification that focuses on preserving ecosystems and mitigating the effects of desertification.To boost community participation in the government's drive to protect and restore the natural habitats of indigenous flora, MOCCAE launched the Gheras app, offering the public access to a complete database of local plant species and ways to care for them.The Ministry is also working on the UAE Smart Map of Natural Capital using remote sensing that will inform policies and decision-making on land use, investment, and business improvement in line with the country's economic vision and the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The high-resolution map will identify local biodiversity-rich ecosystems and services they provide to the environment, in addition to an economic valuation of these services. \"

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE248","The IMF's misstep on climate finance","December 15, 2021 Wednesday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) seems determined to dilute one of the best examples of global cooperation in response to the economic disruptions induced by the Covid-19 pandemic and climate change. It must change course now, before it is too late. The IMF's allocation of $650 billion in special drawing rights (SDRs, the Fund's reserve asset) in August was long encouraged and widely welcomed. Given the IMF's tight rules, it was clear from the start that the vast majority of SDRs would go to countries that did not need them. As a result, G7 leaders pledged to re-channel upwards of $100 billion of their allocations to ""countries most in need of pandemic [support to] stabilise their economies, and mount a green and global recovery  aligned with shared development and climate goals"". While these moves seem small compared to the $17 trillion that rich countries have spent to support their economies during the pandemic, they were nonetheless significant. In October, just two months after the allocation, the G20 backed a plan by the IMF and the World Bank to develop and implement a Resilience and Sustainability Trust, which would allow wealthy countries to channel their allotments to low- and middle-income countries vulnerable to economic shocks. Because the RST could be used to address risks related to climate change, it would fill a glaring gap in international finance. The IMF announced that it would have a proposal ready for its 2022 spring meetings. But will it be enough? Extreme weather events like floods and hurricanes can trigger financial instability in vulnerable countries as they wipe out capital stock and sources of foreign exchange. Likewise, countries dependent on fossil-fuel exports face fiscal uncertainty as demand for oil and gas decreases to meet climate goals. In both cases, spillover effects can negatively affect trade. Countries confronting such conditions must undertake a structural transformation of their economies. But many low- and middle-income countries lack access to the cost-effective, flexible financing they need. A well-designed RST would make the IMF criteria for resource allocation and country eligibility more adaptable. Unfortunately, five design flaws in the IMF's approach would render the planned RST ineffective for most climate-vulnerable countries. The first flaw concerns eligibility. IMF programmes discriminate on the basis of income, but climate change does not. While the G20 explicitly called for the establishment of an RST covering low-income and climate-vulnerable middle-income countries, the IMF has adopted a narrow interpretation according to which middle-income countries would be eligible only if they do not exceed a certain income threshold. But traditional measures of income are a poor criterion for determining eligibility. The IMF must adjust its thinking to actual circumstances and ensure that eligibility is based on climate vulnerability. It should not be controversial to integrate into the criteria simple measures such as susceptibility to physical climate risks like floods, droughts, and hurricanes, or economic factors like the share of fossil-fuel exports in total foreign-exchange earnings. Second, there is a problem with the terms and accessibility of the funds. Developing countries lack the fiscal space to mobilize domestic resources to address the structural changes their economies need. Many also lack access to external resources on reasonable borrowing terms. But the IMF is proposing that RST users be charged the SDR interest rate (currently five basis points and on the rise) plus a margin of up to 100 basis points. These rates are not very different from what the Fund currently charges middle-income countries. More problematic is the access limits, which would be 100 per cent of quota, or less than the SDR equivalent of $1 billion. These guidelines would do little to address the financing needs of all but the smallest countries. The third flaw is the IMF's insistence on conditionality. The Fund sees the RST as a top-up scheme for existing programs. This is deeply troubling. According to the IMF's own research, its existing lending facilities are stigmatized, owing to their high levels of conditionality and low levels of performance with respect to economic recovery and other social outcomes. The RST was supposed to be a new instrument that recognises and channels resources to the countries that are most vulnerable to climate change. But what the IMF plans is repackaged business as usual. The fourth flaw is that even though the IMF is only now devising a climate-change strategy, it would head the RST. Multilateral and regional development banks are also prescribed SDR institutions, and they have a longer view and a stronger track record on climate policy. They need to be part of the RST's governance. Lastly, there is the question of scale. IMF managindirector Kristalina Georgieva has said the RST would be funded with around $30 billion initially and then scaled up to $50 billion. While the RST alone cannot be expected to substitute finance needed to address the intensifying effects of climate change, the needs assessment released by the Standing Committee on Finance of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change put the figure at $6 trillion, and other estimates are significantly higher. At the recent UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ), Barbados Prime Minister Mia Amor Mottley, whose country is among the world's most vulnerable, proposed an annual increase in SDRs of $500 billion for 20 years to finance resilience and sustainability. The IMF's shareholders and stakeholders must reconsider the RST's design. To succeed, it must include all climate-vulnerable developing countries, regardless of income level. It must provide low-cost financing that does not undermine members' debt sustainability and is not linked to pre-existing IMF programs with onerous conditionalities. It must be governed by key stakeholders in development-finance institutions. And it must scale appropriately over time. The IMF must make the necessary adjustments to its proposal for the RST. If it cannot, creditor countries should refrain from capitalizing it. Sara Jane Ahmed is finance adviser to the Vulnerable Twenty Group of Ministers of Finance.

If you're certain you want to get your hands on the best smart plugs now, rather than read on to find out if they can save energy, then check out these great deals for some of the best on the market. So, can smart plugs save energy? The simple answer is yes \- indirectly, many models can make you more aware of the energy you're using, how much it's costing you and where you could be saving money. Smart plugs from brands such as Eve Energy and TP-Link will monitor how much energy the appliance connected to them is using. Some even let you input your electricity supplier's prices, so when you open the app you can see in black-and-white just how much running that appliance is costing. For some of us, this may be enough to make us more conscious of switching these devices off when you're not using them. Keeping track of how much energy we use isn't the only way they can help. You are probably aware that keeping devices on standby accounts for a chunk of totally unnecessary energy use. By having items such as your TV, set-top box, and games console on standby, or charging your laptop and tablet all the time they're not in use, you're continuously using electricity. In fact, the Energy Saving Trust believes the average UK home wastes \£335 ( around $50 / AU$65) per year through appliances left on standby. However, for many of us these appliances, home entertainment equipment in particular, may not be easy to switch on and off at the wall socket regularly. However, a smart plug ensures you can use your smartphone, rather than fiddling about behind furniture trying to find the switch. If you're forgetful and prone to leaving the house with appliances still switched on, whether that's a steam iron, hair straighteners, or even the coffee maker, plugging it in via a smart plug will ensure that it doesn't need to be left on all day, wasting energy. Nor does it require you to make yourself late by returning home simply to switch it off. Instead, you'll be able to use your smartphone to turn the appliance off, even if you're not at home. It's safer too. What is a smart plug, and how it can stop your fear of leaving the coffee maker on?

If you know you tend to nod off when watching late-night TV, activating the sleep timer can ensure it's not blasting away while you're enjoying 40 winks. If you have an energy tariff that offers cheaper electricity at night rather than during the day, you can also use a smart plug to set the tumble dryer to turn on and off between these times, rather than having to wake up and set it going.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE250","UN chief urges G20 finance chiefs to support global COVID vaccine plan, climate finance","July 9, 2021 Friday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","NEW YORK, 9th July, 2021 (WAM) -- UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday urged the world's largest economies to spearhead a global COVID-19 vaccination plan, expand debt relief to developing countries battered by the pandemic, and step up funding for climate action. ""To restore trust in multilateralism, we need to deliver on vaccines, economic recovery and climate finance,"" he said in a video message to G20 finance ministers meeting in Venice, Italy. ""With your leadership and political will, we can do it."" The Secretary-General warned of the threat posed by the ""global vaccine gap"" as the coronavirus mutates. ""Pledges of doses and funds are welcome \- but they are not enough,"" he said. ""We need at least eleven billion doses to vaccinate 70 percent of the world and end this pandemic."" The UN chief repeated his call for a Global Vaccine Plan that would double production and ensure equitable distribution of doses through the COVAX solidarity mechanism. Finance Ministers and Central Bank chiefs were also urged to support a new $50 billion investment roadmap, announced last month and to be led by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), aimed at ending the pandemic and driving a fast recovery. As many developing countries are ""teetering on the verge of debt default"", the Secretary-General encouraged the G20 to channel unused Special Drawing Rights, a type of foreign reserve asset developed by the IMF, to the Fund's new resilience and sustainability plan for these nations. ""Special Drawing Rights also need to be considered as additional funding, not deducted from Official Development Assistance,"" he added. With the world still struggling to keep global temperature rise to the 1.5 degree target under the Paris Agreement, the UN chief stressed the need for action to reduce emissions as the latest UN climate change conference, known as COP26 , draws closer. ""If COP26 ""Developing countries also need reassurance that their ambition will be met with financial and technical support,"" he added. The Secretary-General recalled the commitment richer countries made more than a decade ago to mobilize $100 billion annually for action towards climate mitigation and adaption in developing countries. However, this agreement has not been kept. ""A clear plan to fulfil this pledge is not just about the economics of climate change; it is about establishing trust in the multilateral system,"" he said. Developing countries will also need help in transitioning from fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, to renewable energy sources, he continued. Here, support from development banks will be essential, he said, but now large scale private financing is also available through a global alliance of more than 160 financial firms committed to the net-zero goal. ""To reinforce these efforts, the G20 must set ambitious, clear and credible climate policies, and ensure the private sector has the framework it needs through mandatory climate-related financial disclosures,"" he said, adding ""and we need all financiers to commit to no new international funding for coal, by the end of 2021."" \"

The UNFCCC confirmation followed unanimous endorsement by the Asia Pacific Group of nations during COP26 In response, H.H. Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, said: ""We are pleased and honored by the UNFCCC decision to select the United Arab Emirates to host the UN Climate Change Conference in 2023 and commit ourselves as a nation to supporting the entire international community in accelerating our combined efforts to overcome the very real threat of climate change. ""The founding father of the UAE had the highest regard for the environment, and it is his legacy which has inspired the progress we have made over the past 50 years to diversify our economy \- and will continue to inspire us as we strive to safeguard the well-being of present and future generations. ""COP28 in 2023 will and must be a 'solutions COP' \- and I am confident that the rich experience of this young, inclusive nation in advancing practical, viable and shareable solutions to the world's most pressing challenges will again come to the fore as we host the world for the UN Climate Change Conference in two years' time. ""The UAE Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative, announced earlier this year, shows our own unwavering commitment to promoting climate action. Further, through new investment commitments and partnerships, we are illustrating our determination to support the world in addressing climate change. ""We look forward to welcoming the world at COP28. The voice of every nation and stakeholder will be heard, ensuring that, together, we not only help mitigate the effects of global warming, but also unlock new opportunities to realize greater prosperity and a better life for future generations."" A holistic approach for economic progress Dr Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, UAE Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and Special Envoy for Climate Change, said the decision to host COP28 in the UAE is a direct result of the vision of its leadership and the commitment of its founding father, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan to sustainable development. He added that the decision is a direct reflection of the nation's decades long commitment to progressive climate action. He said: "" We very much look forward to the opportunity of uniting the world in an effort to raise ambitions for climate action and to advance progress for humanity. COP 28 will be a crucial global stock-take, measuring how far we have come, and how far we still need to go, to fulfill the Paris Agreement. Our guiding principle for COP 28 will be inclusivity. We want to reflect the views and invite the contribution of both developed and developing countries, the public and private sectors, academics and civil society. The UAE adopts this approach, because we truly believe that partnership promotes progress."" Highlighting the UAE focus on promoting an inclusive approach, Dr Al Jaber added: ""In this spirit, everyone will have a seat at the table. Developed countries alongside developing nation, the public alongside the private sector, scientists alongside civil society and also. importantly the voices of youth. It is together that we will succeed."" Dr Al Jaber congratulated the Arab Republic of Egypt for being announced as host of the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties, highlighting that the UAE will cooperate with partners everywhere to identify lessons learned in order to achieve effective results. He added that the UAE will work to ensure that all segments of society are part of this great effort to allow humanity to change course to a better future; extending an open invitation to the world to advance real climate action through inclusion, transparency and responsibility. Turning challenges into opportunities Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, UAE Minister of Climate Change and Environment, said: ""At a time of rapidly rising climate risks that threaten all countries, we welcome the responsibility of hosting COP28, and are determined to support the international community in pursuing a practical agenda that focuses on implementation, ambition, opportunities and transformation."" She added: ""Due to our wise leadership's vision and foresight, the UAE has become an internationally acclaimed driver of collective climate action. In 2023, world leaders will convene to tackle climate change on a global scale \- and where better to do so than the United Arab Emirates, the home of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and a country that has a strong track record in hosting high-profile international events. ""At COP28, we will address the planetary and economic aftermath of climate change as two sides of the same coin, exploring solutions that put us on a path towards limiting global warming to 1.5 C and are economically viable at the same time. We are keen to share our successful approach of turning challenges into opportunities to leave a healthier planet to our children."" ""We firmly believe in young people's right to have a say in shaping their future, and are dedicated to supporting the highest levels of youth participation in delegations and formal proceedings at COP28."" Path-breaking initiatives at COP-26 At COP26 The UAE has pledged US$1 billion of increased investment as part of this initiative, which aims to increase and accelerate agricultural and food systems innovation in support of climate action. AIM for Climate is focused on leveraging high-potential economic returns and job creation from innovation investment in a sector that employs over 2 billion people and feeds the world's growing population. The UAE also joined the Global Methane Pledge building on its position as one of the least methane intense nations in the world. The nation will share its capabilities and experience in best-in-class methane performance with signatories to the EU-US led initiative that aims to cut global methane emissions by 30 per cent by the end of the decade. The UAE has long acted as a regional leader in methane reduction. Over five decades, the country has successfully reduced the volume of natural gas flared in the domestic energy sector by more than 90 per cent. In turn, the UAE's hydrocarbon industry today holds one of the world's lowest methane intensities of 0.01 per cent. The UAE will build on this foundation of ultra-low methane intensity in the energy sector to further improve its methane performance. Further, IRENA and the UAE announced the Energy Transition Accelerator Financing (ETAF) Platform, a new global climate finance facility to accelerate the transition to renewable energy in developing countries. The UAE committed US$400 million in funding provided by the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD) toward the platform's goal of securing a minimum of US$1 billion in total funding. The UAE, represented by the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure (MOEI) also announced the Hydrogen Leadership Roadmap, a comprehensive national blueprint to support domestic, low-carbon industries, contribute to the country's net-zero ambition and establish the country as a competitive exporter of hydrogen. The Hydrogen Leadership Roadmap comprises three core objectives: unlocking new sources of value creation through exports of low carbon hydrogen, derivatives and products to key importing regions, fostering new hydrogen derivative opportunities through low-carbon steel, sustainable kerosene as well as other priority UAE industries and contributing to the UAE's 2050 net zero commitments. Moreover, the UAE has raised the mangrove-planting target in its second Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement from 30 million to 100 million by 2030. The move consolidates the nation's position as a global leader in nature-based climate change solutions, and will expand local mangrove forests to cover 483 square kilometers, sequestering nearly 115,000 tons of CO2 per year. A testament to the UAE's 30 years of positive climate action The road to COP 28 is a testament to the positive climate action initiated by the UAE for over three decades. The UAE was the first country in the Middle East & North Africa to ratify the Paris Agreement and commit to lowering its carbon emissions. It was also a pioneer in setting the region's first renewable energy and biodiversity conservation targets to match its climate ambitions. Among many sustainability achievements, the UAE has brought the cost of solar energy below that of all other electricity sources and built one of the world's first large-scale carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) facilities. It has invested close to US$17 billion in solar, wind and battery storage projects across six continents worldwide, including in 27 climate-vulnerable island nations. The Barakah Nuclear Power Plant, which started commercial operations in April this year, will eliminate almost a quarter of the greenhouse gas emissions of the UAE's power sector once its four reactors are operational. The UAE was the first country in the Middle East & North Africa to announce a Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative \- a national drive to make the country carbon-neutral by mid-century. Following the Strategic Initiative's launch, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) vowed to decarbonise its electrical grid at scale, starting January 2022. This bold move makes ADNOC the first oil & gas company to source up to 100 per cent of its grid power requirements from solar and nuclear energy. The UAE's long history of commitment to climate change started in 1989 when it first ratified the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone layer. Since then, it has joined the UNFCCC (1995) and ratified the Kyoto Protocol (2005). Two years ago, the UAE hosted the Abu Dhabi Climate Meeting, attended by the United Nations Secretary-General Ant?nio Guterres. \"

The new net zero emissions target was at least a decade earlier than the 2070 target, President Joko Widodo said in March. While Indonesia maintained its headline target to lower greenhouse gas emission by 41 per cent by 2030 with international assistance, the country has updated its adaptation measures and included a new long-term strategy for low carbon development in the document filed to the UN recently. Coordinating Minister for Maritime and Investment Affairs Luhut Pandjaitan told a virtual seminar he was optimistic Indonesia, the world's eighth-biggest greenhouse gas emitter, could reach net zero emissions within 50 years. In the energy sector, the government plans to stop using coal, oil and gas by 2060 and aims to have 85 per cent of its energy needs from renewable sources and the rest from nuclear energy, according to a document Luhut presented at the seminar. Indonesia, the world's top thermal coal exporter, currently sources 60% of its energy from coal. Luhut said Indonesia was also looking into utilising energy storage and hydrogen fuel cell technology.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE253","Saudi Xerox Targets Net Zero","November 28, 2021","MEprinter.com","Saudi Xerox boasts a clear blueprint on how to bring company's net-zero plans in line with Xerox corporate responsibility strategy. As a socially responsible company and a trusted partner to the Saudi government for implementation of Vision 2030, Saudi Xerox is no stranger to sustainable practices. The company is already involved in a number of high profile and government sponsored sustainable projects such as E-invoicing and other mega projects. Nevertheless, when it comes to climate action, knowing where to start is key and Saudi Xerox knows that sustainability begins at home. In its recently published 2021 Corporate Social Responsibility Report Xerox outlined company's global strategy to fight climate change. According to the report the company fast-tracked its net zero goal by 10 years and established a new goal of 2040. Based on this road map Xerox is determined to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions drastically and achieve net-zero emissions through a blend of projects in order to improve operational efficiency, create new technology innovations, and carbon compensation mechanisms. Innovative and sustainable products and services As part of its overall sustainability strategy, packaging and distribution are integral considerations of Saudi Xerox product commercialization process. The company strives to eliminate, reduce, reuse and recycle packaging whenever feasible. End-of-life management of equipment Saudi Xerox has long been committed to the responsible end-of-life management of equipment. The proliferation of e-waste regulations has created a need for many separate programs in different countries and even states. Saudi Xerox carefully provides recycling and waste disposal services to ensure that its clients' returned equipment is protected from data breaches and improper disposal. To that end Saudi Xerox is in liaison with a well-known local body for recycling of its electronic wastes. This activity is carried out periodically and recently the company had delivered over 50 tons of electronic wastes for recycling. Thou shall not waste! Waste is bad news and Saudi Xerox has already devised a detailed plan for reducing the amount of waste, based on Xerox corporate guidelines and Saudi Arabia Circular Economy approach which advocates reduce, reuse, recycle and remove. During 2020 Xerox managed almost 68% of hazardous waste generated throughout the company, while non -hazardous wastes were also reduced by almost 30% comparing to 2019. In 2021 further reductions have been achieved which proves the company is on the right track. The global economic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic had a direct impact on Saudi Xerox's ability to accelerate its plan for managing waste and offer practical solutions to its customers to reduce, reuse and recycle. The seal of approval Recognition of Xerox's sustainability credentials is reflected in the award by His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales of the inaugural Terra Carta Seal. The Seal was presented at a ceremony during the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ), where Xerox is the print provider. The Terra Carta Seal is awarded to companies who hold a leadership position within their industry and who have credible transition roadmaps underpinned by globally recognized, scientific metrics for achieving net zero by 2050 or earlier. And the future? Saudi Arabia, one of the world's largest oil producers, has already pledged aims to reach ""net- zero"" greenhouse gas emissions by 2060. Being an active partner of Saudi government and part of a global manufacturer with impressive pedigree in innovation and sustainable strategy Saudi Xerox is matching Xerox global standards, aligning sustainability with business goals. Sustainable development requires meeting the needs of the present without compromising the needs of future generations. Saudi Xerox is constantly striving to reduce its carbon footprint and solve problems affecting the businesses in Saudi in order to stabilize or reduce environmental burden. Saudi Xerox is confident the solutions it offers, which are based on Xerox corporate responsibility frame work, will reduce its impact and its customer's impact on environment and help society and planet as a whole. ""As a pioneering company in promoting circular economy and a major partner of Saudi government's Vision 2030 project we have adopted a multifaceted approach to sustainability. While we are constantly striving to champion sustainability, we are encouraging businesses in Saudi Arabia to implement digital technology and solutions.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE254","Where are the green sovereign funds?","August 9, 2021 Monday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","Reuters Institutional investors are increasingly embracing the effort to achieve net-zero greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. Some are already implementing portfolio measures and incorporating climate factors into their decision-making. The United Nations-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (which one of us chairs) has already welcomed 46 members, comprising pension funds and insurance companies representing some $6.7 trillion in assets under management (AUM). The steps taken this decade will be decisive as regards hitting the mid-century target. Of the Alliance's members, 23 have publicly issued GHG-reduction targets for 2025, which means they are committed to acting immediately. The remaining five members that are required to set targets this year will declare similar interim goals soon. Net-zero initiatives are also being established in the investment-management and banking industries, representing $43 trillion and $37 trillion in AUM, respectively. And yet, sovereign wealth funds (SWFs)  representing AUM totalling around $10 trillion  are conspicuously absent, even though some are owned by governments that have adopted ambitious climate objectives. Under existing international agreements, GHG emissions are measured at the country level, which understates the potential climate impact of countries with large foreign-asset holdings. For example, the Norwegian SWF's total asset holdings are three times the size of Norway's economy, and its equity-portfolio carbon emissions are around twice the country's own total emissions. Norway is not alone. A recent report by the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds (IFSWF) shows that SWFs around the world are lagging behind. About three-quarters report having less than 10 per cent of their holdings in climate-related strategies, while only 14 per cent have made divestment decisions related to climate or environmental targets. While 24 per cent of SWFs consider climate action part of a broader ESG (environmental, social, and governance) framework, only 12 per cent have an explicit climate-change policy. To be sure, IFSWF's own Generally Accepted Principles and Practices (the ""Santiago Principles"") do not specify sustainability requirements for SWFs. But governments of countries that have SWFs should view the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow ( COP26 ) in November as an opportunity to commit fully to the net-zero programme. There are several reasons why they should do this. For starters, 2050 net-zero targets are becoming a mainstream expectation for all large institutional investors. If a government chooses not to commit its SWF to this goal, it will be free riding on the growing share of the private financial sector that is already going green  a paradox of climate finance if there ever was one. The domestic focus of international climate agreements should not be interpreted as a free pass for emissions associated with foreign investments. Instead, governments should be using their SWFs' financial weight to drive climate action internationally. Last but not least, the transition to a low-carbon economy represents the biggest investment opportunity in decades. Shifting from ""brown"" to ""green"" will require changes on the scale of another industrial revolution; those who create new markets or enter them early stand to reap massive returns. As one of the few SWFs with an explicit emissions-reduction objective, the New Zealand Superannuation Fund has already begun to seize these new opportunities. Between 2017 and 2020, the fund's low-carbon benchmark portfolio, which comprises 40 per cent of its total assets, generated returns that were 0.6 per cent higher than its standard benchmark portfolio. By contrast, Norway's SWF missed out on $126 billion in potential returns during the same period, because it invested in oil and gas instead of green stocks. Because many countries with SWFs have historically been heavily dependent on their oil and gas sector, the transition away from fossil fuels exposes them to larger economic risks. But governments can mitigate these risks by aligning their SWFs with climate targets. Countries like France, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, and Singapore are well placed to lead a global SWF movement towards net-zero commitments at COP26 . If they do, other funds with large investment teams and sophisticated operations may soon follow, and those with fewer resources would, one hopes, be close behind them. Most SWFs were established as savings vehicles for future generations. It stands to reason that these funds should contribute to the conservation of the climate on which those generations will depend.

In an editorial on Sunday, The National said, ""The recognition puts Abu Dhabi in good company; other UCI-recognised biker-friendly cities include Copenhagen, Bergen, Paris and Glasgow, where the climate summit, Cop26 , is well under way and where the UAE reiterated its climate change commitments. ""A peloton of bikers at first glance may not seem like the people most obviously associated with climate change, but cycling has an undeniable link with sustainability and keeping carbon emissions down. For one, there is less pollution where there are more bikers. When more people in the city take to cycling, even for short distances, it lowers emissions as much as it reduces the use of cars. It is, of course, incumbent on drivers of cars anywhere in the world to learn to give way to those on two wheels. But besides the sporting, fitness and traffic etiquette aspect of pedalling, there is a sense of community fostered when cycling is given as much priority as it is in the UAE."" The UAE is working at developing cycle tracks that can even help people to cycle to offices and back, for those thus inclined, the paper said. The culture of cycling benefits people. It affects a city in numerous positive ways, promoting a sense of well-being that comes from being outdoors and incorporating exercise into a daily regimen. The editorial continued, ""As those in the cycling community know firsthand, it is a way of life easily adopted and encouraged. The UAE already has a sizeable community of cyclists. The two-time winner of the Tour de France title, UAE Team Emirates rider Tadej Pogacar, would agree. The 23-year-old cyclist last month even added the Giro di Lombardia crown to his Tour de France titles. ""For younger people just taking up the sport and the lifestyle, role models such as Pogacar are often just the sort of nudge and healthy influence they need to pick up a helmet and take to biking for life, along the way bettering one's chances of managing diabetes, obesity and other lifestyle diseases. ""With velodromes in the works on Abu Dhabi's Hudayriyat Island and plans for a new 109-kilometre designated cycling track, the direction of urban development in Abu Dhabi is heartening. In the coming decade, the landscape of the city is likely to undergo an enormous shift. For one, the UAE will plant 30 million mangroves by 2030. As people who take their bikes out early morning to pedal by the water know, the sight of sunrise is an enormous draw for cyclists anywhere in the world. ""Abu Dhabi will have a natural edge in this regard as residents are already afforded the luxury of being able to pedal along the Eastern Mangroves, taking in the air that comes from being around these underwater carbon sinks, an environment unparalleled in tranquility."" And despite the pandemic affecting momentum, as it has globally, there are redevelopment projects planned for Abu Dhabi's parks, as part of Ghadan 21, a far-reaching AED50 billion package of reforms that aims to improve every aspect of residents' lives. Even in neighbouring Dubai, H.H. Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of Dubai Executive Council, regularly promotes the sport, is a known cyclist and motivator for people to adopt lifestyles that centre around fitness. Just this past weekend, 33,000 people participated in the Dubai Ride. Among other expansions for the city's bikers, a new cycle track spanning 16km along Jumeirah Beach in Dubai is ongoing. There are already more than 460km of cycle paths in Dubai, and like in Abu Dhabi, this landscape will expand dramatically over the next few years. ""For reluctant exercisers in our families and social circles \- and we all know a few \- these biker-friendly plans could be spokes in the wheels. For all avid cyclists in the UAE, however, these are only more reasons to rejoice,"" concluded the Abu Dhabi-based daily. \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE256","UAE: Construction of Barakah nuclear plant's Unit 3 complete","November 4, 2021 Thursday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","The Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC) continues to deliver on the clean energy vision of the UAE with the successful completion of the construction of Unit 3 of the Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant, the Arab World's first multi-unit operating nuclear energy plant located in the Al Dhafra region of Abu Dhabi. The unit has now been handed over for operational readiness activities and is on track to start up and deliver clean electricity in 2023, joining Unit 1 which is fully operational and Unit 2 which is connected to the UAE grid and undergoing testing while raising power levels, a statement issued on Thursday said. The announcement, made on the sidelines of the United Nations Conference of the Parties (COP) 26 on climate change during Energy Day, demonstrates the UAE's progress in transitioning to cleaner energy sources, rapidly decarbonising the power sector, cutting carbon emissions, and increasing power supply to meet the growing electricity demand. As the UAE's bid to host COP 28 in 2023 is endorsed by the member states of the UN's Asia Pacific group, the tangible efforts the Nation is making in cutting carbon emissions as part of its climate commitments and the recently launched 2050 Net Zero Initiative are clear. This milestone means that the Barakah plant will soons deliver yet another 1400MW of zero emissions electricity, highlighting the UAE's leading role as a clean energy leader. The Barakah Plant is leading large-scale decarbonization of the UAE's power sector with Unit 1 becoming the largest single electricity generator in the region in April 2021 and producing clean electricity 24/7. The connection of Unit 2 to the UAE grid in September 2021 propelled Barakah to the forefront of the nation's emissions reduction efforts, well on the way to doubling clean energy production. By 2025, it is projected that the Barakah plant will have cut Abu Dhabi Emirate's carbon emissions by 50 per cent.The focus of Unit 3 in the next phase will shift to complete the operational readiness preparations, testing, regulatory inspections, and international assessments required to obtain the Operating License for Unit 3 from the UAE's independent nuclear regulator, the Federal Authority for Nuclear Regulation (FANR). Mohamed Ibrahim Al Hammadi, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of ENEC, commented: ""With Unit 1 already commercially operating and Unit 2 recently connected to the UAE grid, Unit 3 construction completion demonstrates the steady progress we are making with the development of the Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant. As the world gathers at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, the need for concrete actions to tackle climate change is indisputable and urgent. ""We are tackling climate change directly today and will do for the next 60 years to come. We thank our leadership for the vision in diversifying the UAE's power sources 15 years ago, and their unwavering support as we deliver the four units of the Barakah plant and make history in this year of the UAE's Golden Jubilee."" added Al Hammadi. Testing of plant Unit 3 of the Barakah Plant has already successfully completed a number of individual and combined system tests, including Cold Hydrostatic Testing (CHT), the Structural Integrity Test (SIT), and Integrated Leak Rate Test (ILRT), and the Hot Functional Test as part of the first phase of its Initial Testing Program (ITP). The ITP aims to ensure that the Unit's systems operate in accordance with the highest industry standards and will continue to do so during the operation of the plant over the coming decades. Prior to granting such approval via the issuance of the Operating License for Unit 3, FANR is carrying out detailed inspections and reviews of all aspects of the plant and the operating organization. In addition to FANR's extensive review process, and in line with the commitments made by the UAE in 2008 to adhere to the highest standards of safety, security, quality, non-proliferation and operational transparency, Unit 3 and its operating team will now undergo a number of assessments by independent international nuclear energy experts from the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO). The Barakah Plant, located in the Al Dhafra region of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, is one of the largest nuclear energy plants in the world, with four APR-1400 units. Construction of the Plant began in 2012 and has progressed steadily ever since. The development of the Barakah Plant as a whole is now more than 96 per cent complete. When fully operational, the plant will produce 5.6 gigawatts of free carbon electricity for more than 60 years to come. \"

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE258","Capping global temperatures hinges on transforming carbon-intensive sectors, hears UK-UAE industrial conference","November 25, 2021 Thursday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","DUBAI, 25th November, 2021 (WAM) -- Ministers, trade officials, and business leaders from the UAE and UK have stressed the importance of bilateral agreements and investments between the two countries to ensure the most carbon-intensive sectors can contribute to national 2050 net-zero targets. The Global Manufacturing and Industrialisation Summit (GMIS) Week today heard how the two nations have a thought leadership role to play in helping the global manufacturing, aerospace, and construction sectors decarbonise by leveraging Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies and developing innovation ecosystems. Following the 26th UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow earlier this month, around 90% of the world economy is now covered by a 2050 net-zero commitment, Simon Penney, UK Trade Commissioner for the Middle East and UK Consul General in Dubai, told the audience at the UAE-UK Conference during the GMIS Week. But net-zero goals ""will not be met unless government and industry work together,"" he said. Ahmed Ali Al Sayegh, UAE Minister of State and UAE Co-Chair of the UAE-UK Business Council, said: ""Manufacturing, engineering, and construction will need to change if we are to achieve 2050 net-zero goals. With the construction sector contributing nearly 40% of global energy-related emissions, retrofitting existing buildings and developing greener and more efficient buildings will be an important factor in keeping global warming below 1.5 C."" He added: ""I hope that today's discussion will lead to new partnerships between the UK and UAE in delivering the transformation of the manufacturing, aerospace, and construction sectors as we begin our journey to net zero."" During an opening address, Lord Udny-Lister, UK Co-Chair of the UAE-UK Business Council, said: ""We are going through a transformation of the industrial sector. Manufacturing is a key driver of the UK economy, representing half of our exports and contributing nearly US$200 billion to the economy. But many of the sectors depend on carbon-intensive processes, and collectively they represent around 12% of the UK's direct greenhouse emissions. Reaching net zero by 2050 will require much more fundamental change."" Referring to the UAE's recent US$10 billion investment in the UK, he noted that the Gulf country's investors are playing ""an increasingly important role"" in pursuing the UK's decarbonisation objective. At the conference's first session, dedicated to advanced manufacturing, Hussain Al Mahmoudi, CEO of Sharjah Research, Technology & Innovation (SRTI) Park, said: ""Governments have a big role in incentivising the private sector to adopt technologies related to additive manufacturing. The private sector doesn't want to disrupt its operations and spend money on things they don't necessarily understand. The role of the government is to raise awareness of these technologies and raise skills. Through collaboration with the UK, we can accelerate the deployment of these machines."" But new technologies and techniques need to be supported by a skilled workforce. The manufacturing sector is currently facing a significant skills shortage. In a panel discussion called 'Addressing the Skills Gap in Manufacturing', Jan Ward, CEO of Corrotherm, noted that net-zero targets in industry cannot be achieved without the constant development of skills, and stressed the need for governments to support this priority. Ali Al Marzouqi, Acting Deputy Director General of Abu Dhabi Centre for Technical and Vocational Education and Training (ACTVET) and President of EmiratesSkills, said the UAE is attracting the young generation to the manufacturing sector by ""making it exciting"". ""This is the new way, and I advise other countries to follow it. In the UAE, the interest has increased dramatically."" During a session on 'Decarbonisation of Aerospace', Mariam Al Qubaisi, Head of Sustainability & Business Excellence at Etihad Aviation Group, said: ""The lowest-hanging fruit is carbon credits."" Ana Haurie, Co-Founder and CEO or Respira, echoed her comments: ""We need to support nature because it's available to use right now. Technology will take time."" Mansoor Janahi, Deputy Group CEO of Sanad, added: ""There must be an incentive for decarbonisation. Becoming carbon-neutral will come at a cost, so there has to be a concerted effort. There has to be an offset."" In the 'Decarbonisation of Construction and Infrastructure' panel, the group of experts discussed the need for collaboration between governments, academia, and the private sector to reduce the carbon footprint of the built environment, which contributes some 39% of total global emissions. One of the key areas to address is retrofitting existing building stock, according to Jonathan Holyoak, Policy and Net Zero Programme Director at Atkins, who demanded ""meaningful regulation, not just targets"" from policymakers. Rob Jackson, Chief Growth Officer at Asite, said: ""Of the 39%, almost 75% comes from existing buildings and 25% is from the construction itself. How do we drive efficiency into that existing building stock? Technologies such as digital twins can support that."" He added: ""It would be great if all countries could adopt international standards. One of the key areas of collaboration between the UK and UAE is to establish common standards. That would help to inform investors and de-risk investments."" The GMIS Week included the two-day #GMIS2021 Summit on 22-23 November, The Green Chain Conference and The Global Prosperity Conference on 24 November, and country-focused conferences in partnership with the UK, Australia, and Italy. Throughout the six-day event, a manufacturing and advanced technology exhibition is featuring over 30 world-class exhibitors to highlight the UAE government's 'Make it in the Emirates' campaign, a first-of-its-kind initiative to encourage local and international investors, developers, and innovators to benefit from the facilities and incentives offered by the country's industrial sector. \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE259","Time to overhaul global financial system to help poor nations","December 6, 2021 Monday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","At last month's COP26 climate summit, hundreds of financial institutions declared that they would put trillions of dollars to work to finance solutions to climate change. Yet a major barrier stands in the way: The world's financial system actually impedes the flow of finance to developing countries, creating a financial death trap for many. Economic development depends on investments in three main kinds of capital: human capital (health and education), infrastructure (power, digital, transport, and urban), and businesses. Poorer countries have lower levels per person of each kind of capital and, therefore, also have the potential to grow rapidly by investing in a balanced way across them. These days, that growth can and should be green and digital, avoiding the high-pollution growth of the past. Global bond markets and banking systems should provide sufficient funds for the high-growth ""catch-up"" phase of sustainable development, yet this doesn't happen. The flow of funds from global bond markets and banks to developing countries remains small, costly to the borrowers, and unstable. Developing-country borrowers pay interest charges that are often 5-10 per cent higher per year than the borrowing costs paid by rich countries. Developing country borrowers as a group are regarded as high risk. The bond rating agencies assign lower ratings by mechanical formula to countries just because they are poor. Yet these perceived high risks are exaggerated, and often become a self-fulfilling prophecy. When a government floats bonds to finance public investments, it generally counts on the ability to refinance some or all of the bonds as they fall due, provided that the long-term trajectory of its debt relative to government revenues is acceptable. If the government suddenly finds itself unable to refinance the debts falling due, it likely will be pushed into default \- not out of bad faith or because of long-term insolvency, but for lack of cash on hand. This is what happens to far too many developing-country governments. International lenders (or rating agencies) come to believe, often for an arbitrary reason, that Country X has become uncreditworthy. This perception results in a ""sudden stop"" of new lending to the government. Without access to refinancing, the government is forced into a default, thus ""justifying"" the preceding fears. The government then usually turns to the International Monetary Fund for emergency financing. The restoration of the government's global financial reputation typically takes years or even decades. Rich-country governments that borrow internationally in their own currencies do not face the same risk of a sudden stop, because their own central banks act as lenders of last resort. Lending to the United States government is considered safe in no small part because the Federal Reserve can buy Treasury bonds in the open market, ensuring in effect that the government can roll over debts falling due. The same is true for eurozone countries, assuming that the European Central Bank acts as the lender of last resort. When the ECB briefly failed to play that role in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, several eurozone countries (including Greece, Ireland, and Portugal) temporarily lost access to international capital markets. After that debacle \- a near-death experience for the eurozone \- the ECB stepped up its lender-of-last-resort function, engaged in quantitative easing through massive purchases of eurozone bonds, and thereby eased borrowing conditions for the affected countries. Rich countries thus generally borrow in their own currencies, at low cost, and with little risk of illiquidity, except at moments of exceptional policy mismanagement (such as by the US government in 2008, and by the ECB soon thereafter). Low- and lower-middle-income countries, by contrast, borrow in foreign currencies (mainly dollars and euros), pay exceptionally high interest rates, and suffer sudden stops. For example, Ghana's debt-to-GDP ratio (83.5 per cent) is far lower than Greece's (206.7 per cent) or Portugal's (130.8 per cent), yet Moody's rates the creditworthiness of Ghana's government bonds at B3, several notches below those of Greece (Ba3) and Portugal (Baa2). Ghana pays around 9 per cent on 10-year borrowing, whereas Greece and Portugal pay just 1.3 per cent and 0.4 per cent, respectively. The major credit-rating agencies (Fitch, Moody's, and S&P Global) assign investment-grade ratings to most rich countries and to many upper-middle-income countries, but assign sub-investment-grade ratings to nearly all lower-middle-income countries and to all low-income countries. Moody's, for example, currently assigns an investment grade to just two lower-middle-income countries (Indonesia and the Philippines). Trillions of dollars in pension, insurance, bank, and other investment funds are channeled by law, regulation, or internal practice away from sub-investment-grade securities. Once lost, an investment-grade sovereign rating is extremely hard to recover unless the government enjoys the backing of a major central bank. During the 2010s, 20 governments \- including Barbados, Brazil, Greece, Tunisia, and Turkey \- were downgraded to below-investment grade. Out of the five that have since recovered their investment-grade rating, four are in the EU (Hungary, Ireland, Portugal, and Slovenia), and none are in Latin America, Africa, or Asia (the fifth is Russia). An overhaul of the global financial system is, therefore, urgent and long overdue. Developing countries with good growth prospects and vital development needs should be able to borrow reliably on decent market terms. To this end, the G20 and the IMF should devise a new and improved credit-rating system that accounts for each country's growth prospects and long-term debt sustainability. Banking regulations, such as those of the Bank for International Settlements, should then be revised according to the improved credit-rating system to facilitate more bank lending to developing countries. To help end the sudden stops, the G20 and the IMF should use their financial firepower to support a liquid secondary market in developing-country sovereign bonds. The Fed, ECB, and other key central banks should establish currency swap lines with central banks in low-income and lower-middle-income countries. The World Bank and other development finance institutions also should greatly increase their grants and concessional loans to developing countries, especially the poorest. Last but not least, if rich countries and regions, including several US states, stopped sponsoring money laundering and tax havens, developing countries would have more revenues to fund investments in sustainable development.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE260","America's big oil problem puts climate goals on slippery path","September 8, 2021 Wednesday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","Reuters The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is unambiguous. Humanity has already emitted enough greenhouse gases to raise the atmospheric temperature by at least 1.5\'b0 Celsius above pre-industrial levels. This will cause extreme and irreversible climate change over the next two decades. There is still time to prevent catastrophic global warming, but it will require reducing carbon dioxide emissions 80 per cent by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2050. And while United Nations Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres has called the latest report a ""code red for humanity"", an effective response remains far from guaranteed. As it stands, the UN's annual Emissions Gap Report 2020 shows that the rich OECD countries are not reducing their emissions fast enough, and developing economies are on track to continue increasing theirs. In advance of November's UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, world leaders are rushing to agree on more ambitious emissions-reduction goals  so-called nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Recognition of the need for climate action has never been stronger. Nonetheless, the plans under consideration remain grossly inadequate, and the political will needed to change that is sorely missing. This ""gap between rhetoric and action,"" the International Energy Agency (IEA) warns, ""needs to close if we are to have a fighting chance of reaching net zero by 2050 and limiting the rise in global temperatures to 1.5\'b0C"". Success will require ""nothing short of a total transformation of the energy systems that underpin our economies"". The IEA has proposed a roadmap for getting the global energy sector to net-zero emissions by 2050. The IPCC report also charts several pathways to creating a net-zero world. Unfortunately, the world's largest historical emitter, the United States, is not following any of them. Consider the $1 trillion infrastructure bill that the US Senate just passed. It was supposed to include a number of climate-related provisions, such as creating a clean electricity standard, funding zero-emissions public transit, building a national electric-vehicle charging infrastructure, and establishing a Civilian Climate Corps. But over months of contentious negotiations, those provisions were largely removed, resulting in a policy that, if passed in the House, would support outmoded fossil-fuel energy and transportation systems. Senate Democrats are hoping to make up for this loss with a $3.5 trillion budget plan, which would support climate action and significantly expand the social safety net. But the bill itself has yet to be written; that is a job for congressional committees. And many elements of it  particularly with regard to climate  are likely to be lost or watered down as it works its way through each committee. This does not bode well for US Democrats, who rely on the electoral support of younger voters, for whom climate change is a high priority. If Democrats lose power  say, in next year's midterm elections  the chances that the US will take effective action to protect the planet will be further diminished. Even now, pressure from the fossil-fuel industry lobby and from Republicans is so strong that US President Joe Biden's administration has not only failed to curb petroleum production on public and tribal lands, but has approved over 2,100 drilling permits. Americans want stronger climate policies. In one recent poll, 53 per cent of registered voters said that global warming should be a high or very high priority for the government, and 66 per cent said that developing sources of clean energy should be a high or very high priority. Another poll showed that roughly two-thirds of likely voters  including almost half of Republicans  think oil and gas companies have too much power. They are right. For decades, the oil industry has produced manipulative studies and funded major marketing campaigns to convince the public that oil and ""natural"" gas were essential for economic growth and not harmful to the planet. It has also spent liberally to influence lawmakers at the national and state levels, including in California, a climate leader, thereby blocking climate-related legislation and policies. US lawmakers must start listening to voters, escape the grip of oil and gas lobbyists, and enact policies that recognise the scale of the climate crisis. This means lowering the country's carbon-equivalent emissions drastically. Although national emissions have lately grown more slowly than output, the IEA warns that the US economy's carbon intensity remains much too high. The decoupling of emissions and economic growth needs to accelerate sharply. The US has the technology and resources to create a modern, clean-energy economy. It simply lacks the political will. This has far-reaching implications. As the world's largest economy, with the highest per capita CO2 emissions, the US is vital to the success of COP26 . For decades, Big Oil has wielded more power than US voters have. The IPCC's latest report shows unequivocally why this must change. To keep our planet habitable, popular majorities in favor of climate action  beginning with Americans  must come together and demand that their government do what is needed.

The opening 31 days also saw the first two Thematic Weeks from Expo's Programme for People and Planet, which is designed to inspire collective and meaningful action to address the world's most critical challenges and opportunities. A truly international cast came together for Climate and Biodiversity Week, which took place ahead of the vital COP26 global environment summit, before Space Week blasted off into orbit to explore how the final frontier can help life on Earth. Eight further Thematic Weeks will be held between now and the end of March, with Urban and Rural Development Week currently underway until 6th November. A total of 1938 government leaders, including ministers, presidents, prime ministers and heads of state, have graced the Expo site to open their country's pavilions, speak at official events or celebrate their nation's Expo National Day. And many of the 192 Country Pavilions - the first time in World Expo history that every participating nation has its own pavilion - have proved especially popular. The Saudi Arabia Pavilion, one of the largest on the Expo site, has attracted half a million visitors already. Throughout the first month, a number of Expo 2020 National Days and Honour Days were commemorated, with highlights including spectacular aerobatics from the French Air Force team Patrouille de France; Switzerland unveiling an inspiring supersize artwork by artist Saype; and international ensemble the Emirates Youth Symphony Orchestra delivering a message of peace and understanding for UN Honour Day. Ticket-holders have eagerly availed of their Expo Passports, with 695,437 sold in the first month, as fans compete to get the most country stamps in a single day. A staggering 5,610 official events have been staged across the Expo site during the first month of operations. Crowds have been attracted to a stellar line-up of regional and international music artists, including Amr Diab, Kadim Al Sahir and Sami Yusuf. There have also been appearances by major sporting stars, from the basketball skills of the Harlem Globetrotters to the Rajasthan Royals cricket team. Individual countries have flown in musicians and performers, and there have been panel discussions featuring everyone from business leaders to astronauts. As the UAE moves into its winter months and the weather become more temperate, visitor numbers are expected to steadily increase, enticed also by Expo's ongoing programme of events. November alone will feature the conclusion of a week of events marking Diwali, Nancy Ajram and Ragheb Alama headlining the second of Expo's Infinite Nights concert series, and the beginning of a packed schedule of celebrations for the UAE's Golden Jubilee. Bringing Expo 2020 Dubai to a global digital audience, the number of virtual visitors has amounted to 12.8 million since 1st October.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE262","Construction of Unit 3 at Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant complete says ENEC","November 7, 2021","The Big Project Middle East","Construction of Unit 3 at the Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant has been completed said Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC). The move is said to demonstrate the UAE's progress in transitioning to cleaner energy sources, rapidly decarbonising the power sector, cutting carbon emissions, and increasing power supply to meet the growing electricity demand. According to a statement, Unit 3 has now been handed over for operational readiness activities and is on track to start up and deliver clean electricity in 2023, joining Unit 1, which is fully operational. Unit 2 is connected to the UAE grid and undergoing testing while raising power levels, ENEC explained. As the UAE's bid to host COP 28 in 2023 is endorsed by the member states of the UN's Asia Pacific group, the tangible efforts the nation is making in cutting carbon emissions as part of its climate commitments and the recently launched 2050 Net Zero Initiative are clear. This milestone means that the Barakah Plant will soon deliver yet another 1,400MW of zero emissions electricity, highlighting the UAE's leading role as a clean energy leader, ENEC stated. ""With Unit 1 already commercially operating and Unit 2 recently connected to the UAE grid, Unit 3 construction completion demonstrates the steady progress we are making with the development of the Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant. As the world gathers at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, the need for concrete actions to tackle climate change is indisputable and urgent. The Barakah Plant, with its rapid decarbonisation of the power sector, is delivering climate solutions today and with Unit 3 construction now complete, we are progressing smoothly towards supplying a quarter of the UAE's electricity needs completely carbon free,"" commented Mohamed Ibrahim Al Hammadi, MD & CEO of ENEC. With Unit 3 completing construction, ENEC is said to be demonstrating the significant progress made in delivering climate solutions today, and fulfilling the UAE's promise of clean energy using nuclear technology to provide the baseload clean electricity needed to support intermittent renewable energy sources. By 2025 it is projected that the Barakah plant will have cut Abu Dhabi's carbon emissions by 50%, demonstrating the significant abilities of nuclear energy in producing baseload electricity without generating carbon emissions. The focus of Unit 3 in the next phase will shift to complete the operational readiness preparations, testing, regulatory inspections, and international assessments required to obtain the Operating License for Unit 3 from the UAE's independent nuclear regulator, the Federal Authority for Nuclear Regulation (FANR), the statement noted. Al Hammadi added, ""By developing nuclear energy in the UAE, ENEC is enabling sustainable growth and prosperity for the Nation through the provision of abundant, 24/7 clean electricity, whilst underpinning intermittent renewables and creating a bridge to other clean energy technologies like green hydrogen. We are tackling climate change directly today and will do for the next 60 years to come. We thank our Leadership for the vision in diversifying the UAE's power sources 15 years ago, and their unwavering support as we deliver the four units of the Barakah plant and make history in this year of the UAE's Golden Jubilee."" ENEC said that Unit 3 has already successfully completed several individual and combined system tests, including Cold Hydrostatic Testing (CHT), the Structural Integrity Test (SIT), and Integrated Leak Rate Test (ILRT), and the Hot Functional Test as part of the first phase of its Initial Testing Programme (ITP). The ITP aims to ensure that the Unit's systems operate in accordance with the highest industry standards and will continue to do so during the operation of the plant over the coming decades. Prior to granting such approval via the issuance of the Operating License for Unit 3, FANR is carrying out detailed inspections and reviews of all aspects of the plant and the operating organisation. In addition to FANR's extensive review process, and in line with the commitments made by the UAE in 2008 to adhere to the highest standards of safety, security, quality, non-proliferation and operational transparency, Unit 3 and its operating team will now undergo a number of assessments by independent international nuclear energy experts from the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO). Construction of the Plant began in 2012 and has progressed steadily ever since. The development of the Barakah Plant as a whole is now more than 96% complete. When fully operational, the plant will produce 5.6 gigawatts of free carbon electricity for more than 60 years, the statement concluded.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE263","UAE Press: What Cop28 in the UAE will offer a planet in crisis","November 13, 2021 Saturday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","ABU DHABI, 13th November, 2021 (WAM) -- A UAE newspaper has said that climate change is coming fast to the Middle East, but so is the desire to do something about it. In an editorial on Saturday, The National said, ""At this year's Cop26 , the world saw the many different ways the region's countries are joining the conversation. And now, the Middle East is showing it wants to not just be part of the solution, but a home for it, too. The latest example came on Thursday, when it was announced that the UAE will host Cop28, scheduled to be held in 2023. ""The UAE's leaders congratulated the country for winning the bid to host the ""most important"" of meetings."" His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, tweeted after the announcement that the UAE would put everything towards making Cop28 a success. His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, said the UAE looked forward ""to working with the international community to accelerate global efforts to address climate change and environmental protection and create a more sustainable economic future"". After the decision, H.H. Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, offered a reminder that it was the late Sheikh Zayed, the Founding Father of the UAE, who has inspired ""us as we strive to safeguard the well-being of present and future generations"". ""Cop28 in 2023 will and must be a 'solutions Cop' - and I am confident that the rich experience of this young, inclusive nation in advancing practical, viable and shareable solutions to the world's most pressing challenges will again come to the fore as we host the world for the UN Climate Change Conference in two years' time,"" he said, according to Wam. ""The UAE Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative, announced earlier this year, shows our own unwavering commitment to promoting climate action. Further, through new investment commitments and partnerships, we are illustrating our determination to support the world in addressing climate change,"" he added. The editorial continued, ""Choosing the UAE to host Cop28 is also another huge moment for the environmental movement in the region, which will follow in the footsteps of Cop27, to be held in Egypt. ""Having back-to-back conferences in the Middle East and North Africa is a sign of how the event is changing. Its early years were confined to Europe, when the foresight of countries such as Germany spotted the need for it as far back as the 1990s. But, as the global significance of the issue at hand becomes clear, Cop has been held all over the world. Now, it is very much in its Middle Eastern phase. ""And that has much to offer the world. In the most basic sense, the region is an early example of the dangers ahead. It is the most water-stressed part of the planet, with a rising temperature double the global average. This burden will be borne by some of the most fragile societies, made up of people who often have known few of the highly polluting luxuries for which the developed world is largely responsible. ""But reconfiguring this conversation is not just about the UAE's efforts; the successful bid would not have been possible without the backing a number of other countries, including all member states of the UN's Asia-Pacific Group and the Arab League. It is this ability to rally global support that will also make Cop28 one to watch. At this year's meeting, the atmosphere between the world's biggest emitters has not been easy, something that may stop the event reaching its full potential. Agreement may become easier as the conversation shifts to new geographies. And Cop is not just about getting governments on board, but industry, too. Earlier this month, The National spoke to Claire O'Neill, managing director of climate and energy for the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. Discussing the prospect of upcoming conferences in the Middle East, Ms O'Neill said, ""I think the next Cop cycle will be a new chance to amplify those of the world's most sustainable businesses who are committed to net zero by 2050, nature positive and committed to reducing inequality and total transparency in reporting."" The National added in its editorial that ""a hub for international business, the UAE would also be a particularly strong location for major industries to discuss how they might contribute to fighting climate change outside western contexts. After all, a corporate sustainability strategy that works in the US or Scandinavia might well not work in the Middle East or the rest of the world. We are already seeing this mixing of expertise at work at Expo 2020 Dubai, where a number of countries and companies from all over the world are providing sustainable engineering for the UAE's desert location.

During interviews conducted at Berlin's International Hotel Investment Conference (IHIC) and London's Business Travel Show in September, participants from ground transport to travel management companies and airlines to hotels spoke of sustainability. Cynics will say we have been here before. Similar noises have been made in the past, and what followed the statements of intent was price cutting, expansion and growth. Will this time be di erent? Perhaps it will, because the world has changed. Interviewees all mentioned the pandemic, which has not only forced a re-think of the way companies and individuals organise their business travel and thrown up questions about whether all trips are necessary, but also the intention of many governments \- and perhaps societies \- to 'build back better'. ere is also the renewed focus on the environment, not just because of the recent COP26 , but because the scienti c evidence for climate change, con rmed amongst the majority of scientists for decades is now increasingly showing itself in natural disasters. Estimates for the contribution transport makes to carbon and other missions varies, but as other industries and market sectors reduce emissions, those of transport \- and particularly aviation \- come into focus. Add to this the focus on ESG investments (Environmental, Social and Governance) by the nancial community \- airlines, hotels and transport companies rely on nance just like other sectors, and so will rely on ESG ratings to continue to attract money \- and the millions of employees working in the industry who expect companies to 'do the right thing', and it could be that this time is di erent.

""Remember that governments have not regulated us on how to clean the hotels. When COVID hit, every company was doing their own protocols and so many of the hotel companies helped to come up with the WTTC Safe Travels so that any country in the world could apply. at means the regulators didn't need to regulate, but if we had not done this, then they would have done. ""We as an industry want to be net zero"" ""The same can be true of sustainability. We have been talking with many other hotel companies to push beyond the situation where every brand has its own programme, which is confusing, and instead come up with global hotel hospitality standards, and that would be 10 or 15 things so that any hotel in the world should be able to do them. We as an industry want to be net zero, but is it realistic for an independent hotel in the middle of nowhere? They would say ""How do I start? I don't even know how to measure it."" And so, we have the protocols, which start with not using plastic, looking at waste, recycling and so on. We need to create those standards and I am convinced we will do i ""If any consumer wants to come to Radisson because we are sustainable, then that's great, but if we market it as a point of diIn November, Radisson Hotels Group was one of several major hospitality entities to launch an initiative designed to set a common definition of hotel sustainability, working in partnership with the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) and the Sustainable Hospitality Alliance The Basic Sustainability framework, set for launch in March 2022, will provide a common starting point for hotel sustainability, accessible to all properties worldwide, whether they are part of a large international group or independent.

We have also made human tra cking training mandatory and we now have engagement tools to ensure hotels are keeping engaged with the sta . Hospitality needs to be interesting again. It needs to be something the young see as a career path. ""Part of that comes from having a social purpose. In India, franchisees told me they were proud hotels gave food to the local community. We opened up rooms for them to stay in when they didn't have hospital beds, so that sense of purpose is important and we shouldn't let go of it. ""Whether it's food waste or the environment, these are meaningful actions that all of us in hospitality need to take care of. We need to remind ourselves of this every time we do a deal for a new hotel or bring new partners in. Hospitality is about the passion people have and that's been shown in how hotels responded during the pandemic. The repurposing of jobs will be a big thing in our industry, and this feeds in to the 'Social' part of ESG.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE266","How Dubai played a leading role in helping to reshape chambers of commerce","November 29, 2021 Monday","ArabianBusiness.com","How did the 12th World Chambers Conference (12WCC) explore ways to turn digital disruption into opportunities? There were various fascinating ways in which the 12WCC examined this crucial topic during a very useful exchange of ideas and meeting of minds. Held under the theme 'Generation Next: Chambers 4.0 \- Transforming Disruption into Opportunity for Global Business', the Congress provided a tremendous opportunity to share valuable insights and unique perspectives on what Chambers 4.0 means to chambers of commerce from around the world, offering a glimpse into what the chambers of the future will look like. One of the true highlights of the Congress was a new white paper released by Dubai Chamber, which noted that governments need to enact reforms that incorporate digital requirements in trade agreements, with digitally-enabled trade shown to provide significant economic benefits, efficiency gains and environmental rewards. Digitalisation \- alongside automation and data intelligence chains \- was also highlighted as being essential to modernise and boost the efficiency of supply chains, the vulnerabilities of which were exposed during the Covid-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, the Digital Fitness Test \- a new and innovative tool designed to test the digital fitness of chambers of commerce \- was launched at the 12WCC to great acclaim from everyone who attended. During a very fun and interactive session at the Congress, titled 'Fit For Digital: Know Thyself', participants took the Digital Fitness Test comprising a 12-question self-assessment via a QR code, meaning that virtual attendees at the congress could also participate. Test criteria for chambers included the presence of unified and comprehensive digital strategies; organisational cultures with digital mindsets; disaster-recovery plans; and documented programmes to identify security breaches. What compelling objectives were discussed to maintain chambers' roles as trusted and relevant leaders in the 21st century? Among the key ones were that chambers must work to cultivate an entrepreneurial ecosystem to support small and medium-sized companies that will continue to play a vital role in the global economy; environmental, social and governance principles will be key drivers of business in the future; and businesses must orientate themselves towards the challenge of achieving net-zero carbon emissions. In 2021, it is obvious that the world is at a crossroads. We strongly advise, therefore, that governments and businesses must adapt to the new normal and learn to navigate a world in which workplace habits have been completely upended. The climate crisis has become more pressing than ever, too, as the United Nations' 26th Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) recently showed, and threats to international trade and global cooperation still persist. As such, we firmly believe it is the responsibility of chambers of commerce to navigate trade in a world of disruption and innovate in order to remain relevant to their members. Otherwise, a panel discussion at the 12WCC revealed that chambers of commerce around the world are looking to younger generations for inspiration as they adopt new innovation-focused strategies. I would stress that it is imperative that business leaders pay serious attention to major trends and defining traits of the young generation, and how their voice can enable chambers to stay relevant. After all, young people are the lifeblood of any successful organisation with their abundant energy and ideas. How do you think technology can help in terms of boosting collaboration and strengthening connections? Well, it is obvious that technology is already revolutionising the global trading system and reshaping the way we do business. Collaboration and open, constructive dialogue are essential to ensure the success and prosperity of future generations. I think that has become abundantly clear during the Covid-19 pandemic when people rallied together in the face of adversity and discovered that communication has become more important than ever. As new technologies emerge, so do new challenges and opportunities. I was delighted that a report launched at the 12WCC explored how the next generation of chambers of commerce can help businesses harness new technologies to continue the digital transformations that were accelerated during the Covid-19 pandemic. The report examines how small and medium-sized enterprises have had to adapt since the onset of the pandemic, and how 'Generation Next: Chambers 4.0' can continue supporting this core pillar of the global economy. How can chambers promote innovation within their strategies to enhance their competitiveness and preparedness in the post-Covid era? Among the key recommendations of the whitepaper on Chambers 4.0 released during the Congress was the need for chambers of commerce to realign the services they provide their members to remain effective advocates of businesses in the post-pandemic era. Examining the state of innovation in cities around the world during a time of unprecedented turmoil and change, the latest edition of the Dubai Innovation Index states that at the start of a new era, the global exchange of knowledge and learning is more important than ever. Key takeaways from this year's index are that digitalisation underpins the transformation and success of the most innovative cities; governments in top innovative cities do more to promote innovation than just set policies, oversee regulations and provide incentives; and the collaboration that has resulted from the pandemic has accelerated innovation by offering innovators enhanced opportunities for knowledge sharing, market access and funding. Chamber Model Innovation was one of the most important initiatives launched at this edition of the World Chambers Congress, it was universally agreed. CMI was designed to fast-track chamber-led innovation around the world and guide chambers as they adopt a more customer-centric approach. This model has been piloted by several chambers from around the world, which saw promising results and major benefits. I am confident that many more chambers will adopt it with the end goal of fostering a culture of innovation within the global chambers community.

Benamar notes that by decarbonising using hydrogen technology, investment is maximised in the long term, in contrast to gas technology which, while attractive currently, will not be able to completely decarbonise in the future. Hayes explains that in terms of efforts to decarbonise, hydrogen investment represents the biggest ""bang for your buck,"" given the opportunities to use the technology to decarbonise markets that are difficult to electrify. The flexibility of how hydrogen can be developed and used is a key advantage of the technology, Hayes adds. ""In theory, you could go all the way from having hydrogen injecting into your existing gas pipeline network, all the way through to planes, using hydrogen as a fuel source. This flexibility is what has helped to generate the excitement around hydrogen as a decarbonisation fuel,"" Hayes says. Meanwhile, Singh notes that in terms of commercial scalability, he believes hydrogen is still 5 to 10 years away, and the energy industry is making an effort to capitalise on the potential of hydrogen. He compares it to the solar energy market, where he says energy majors generally missed ""a great opportunity"" a few years ago because ""they always thought solar PV was much further away than they thought it would be."" As such, international oil companies are now taking the energy transition much more seriously and becoming ""a little bit more aggressive around their hydrogen strategy."" ""They don't want to be caught napping with being two steps behind. So this time around, it's the large IOCs and the NOCs who are stepping up beginning to put their money where their mouth is and say 'we want to be the first movers in this space.' And that's creating some serious buzz in the market around this discussion,"" Singh explains. The GCC, and especially Saudi Arabia and the UAE, were highlighted by Raghothamarao as ""potentially attractive locations"" for hydrogen investment. In particular, Raghothamarao notes that the region will likely need to embrace both blue hydrogen and green hydrogen to tap the innate resources of the region. ""I agree that we shouldn't forget the discussion on blue hydrogen this part of the world given the decline in oil prices, and some of the challenges that companies are facing,"" Kaur comments. Benamar likewise notes that the advantage of blue hydrogen over green can currently be found looking at the difference in volumes. As an example, Benamar points to the world's biggest green hydrogen project in NEOM, Saudi Arabia. When completed, the facility is set to produce 650 tonnes of green hydrogen daily, but it requires a huge investment, carrying a price tag of $5 billion. ""One of our latest technology gas turbines will consume that in a single day  so making such volumes available with green hydrogen is quite a major investment today  I think blue hydrogen is more important than the other colours. I think we need all those streams to make sure that we supply enough volume,"" Benamar adds. Oil and gas firms are inherently in a positive position to pivot to blue hydrogen as the essential ingredients needed to make the product can generally be found using waste gas and existing infrastructure. ""I think these companies, the big oil companies, have an interest to provide blue hydrogen, because this is what will sustain the industry, the oil industry in the region, and make enough hydrogen available for the different industries,"" he notes. Contrasting this view point, Singh notes that the oil and gas industry buzz around blue hydrogen is simply because it represents ""a very small natural diversification of their current portfolio to step up production  this is what the commercial realities are today."" The excitement around green hydrogen, however, is quite different, with the enthusiasm focused on the possibility of bringing costs down to the same level as blue hydrogen. Singh also notes that it is important to pay attention to the way in which the world is dividing into ""a couple of large centres of hydrogen production for export."" In this regard, the Middle East has a natural advantage, although the nature of scaling up green hydrogen production for a global market still leaves some questions unanswered, Hayes says. ""In terms of how that affects the Middle East, [the question is] what's the cost advantage that can be achieved by the traditional definition of green hydrogen in the Middle East? ""If we can deliver something along the timetable that we've seen in the solar sector, then we're looking at by the end of this decade, or not that much longer, for green hydrogen to be cost competitive,"" Hayes says. While the general excitement around hydrogen has continued, the way in which the fuel is produced is quite varied. Most industry conversation has focused on green and blue hydrogen, but other alternatives exist, such as turquoise and pink hydrogen. The colour refers to the different method in which the fuel is produced, and can also stand as a reference as to how climate friendly it is in production. However, these differences mean that pricing hydrogen as a whole is a difficult process, with the climate friendly nature of different types of hydrogen proving a challenge. Instead, Hayes suggests that developing a new classification system is key to delivering a global hydrogen market at scale. ""We're looking at something that completely gets rid of the colour designations. And you have what is developing in other commodity markets where you have carbon accounted commodities,"" he says ""You don't really think about the production route or whether it's green or blue, you just say this production route has this much amount of carbon attached to it, and you almost separate that from the molecule. And then in that way, you bring the whole hydrogen market together as one to facilitate the scaling up that we're trying to deliver for the hydrogen economy on a global basis,"" Hayes explains. This change would combine ""all of the different colours of the rainbow into one hydrogen market where you can easily trade across regions because you understand the carbon intensity of my hydrogen versus your hydrogen,"" he notes. ""My own view is that the colour coding is a proxy for the carbon content that you're talking about. So people are just using that as a simple way of [designating the type of hydrogen they want], which is like Germany saying, 'I'm happy to take green hydrogen from anywhere in the world, but I will not take blue hydrogen,'"" Singh says. More regulatory work needed In the Middle East, Kaur points to the regulatory framework as a key challenge facing hydrogen development, noting that it's ""really quite undeveloped at the moment."" Without a solid regulatory framework, ""there's no clear incentive to actually move the industry in one way or the other,"" she says. In comparison to the solar industry, frameworks on how to distribute solar power and legislation were put in place to try and incentivise the market, and a similar push is needed for green hydrogen, Kaur explains. Meanwhile, Raghothamarao notes that the lack of specific country wide and national hydrogen strategies has left different governments in the GCC with ""complete freedom"" without a specific path to decarbonisation and hydrogen development. While from the outset this may appear as a negative, Singh explains that when examining the evolution of the power and renewable energy sectors, regulations tended to follow the introduction of large scale investment. ""I think incentives are quite important. As we've seen with renewables, in this area the incentives will be key,"" Benamar says, noting the incentive structure could take different forms. Incentives could be linked, ""to the fuel itself, or to the carbon emission,"" he adds. ""I think both can be a good play to make sure that the introduction of hydrogen goes faster than what we are seeing,"" Benamar comments. However, despite the importance of these incentives, Benamar notes that these have been absent from the Middle East so far, despite conversations ongoing. Opposing the likelihood of these incentives, however, Kaur explains that the introduction of these incentives would be against the historical development of the Middle East. ""I think traditionally in this part of the world you wouldn't see the sort of incentives that [Benamar] mentioned,"" Kaur comments. ""I think we've discussed and tried this a few times when solar was first talked about, but it never eventuated in any sort of regulatory policies  I very much doubt that you will see that sort of incentives and it will be more along the lines of giving probably tax holidays or some kind of investment support."" Looking to the future Given the ongoing nature of the hydrogen discussion, all participants were asked for their outlook on the future and what developments are likely to occur over the next three months and further into 2022: ""I think next year is going to be connecting ammonia and hydrogen together to deliver the potential for hubs like the Middle East, to get the hydrogen out into the world. We can look 10 years down the line and there will be more vessels potentially, that are capable of moving hydrogen. But there are markets that exist right now and technologies that exist right now to transport blue ammonia out of the Middle East and into the rest of the world. And I think that is going to become much more part of the conversation as we get into next year,"" Hayes says. ""I think over three months we will definitely see multiple decarbonisation pathways with probably more focus on how to keep the costs coming down further, more improvements in technologies, in enterprise capacities, and also probably even government support in establishing new hydrogen programs and initiatives to drive forward different goals of different GCC countries,"" Raghothamarao says. ""I think what will be interesting is to see the development in Oman and elsewhere, with new players coming in. So more and more private sector players moving away from just the companies that we've heard so far  I also think there'll be more discussion about storage and transport of hydrogen, because in order to get to a truly global market  what we really need to discuss is storage and transport,"" Kaur says. ""With this short term I think what we will see is more conversion of those announcements about long term objectives, and people trying to lay out the path to achieve those objectives. I think we will see every country, every industry, laying out that path in the short term. And also this will be especially true for the region. I think this will be pushed by the organisation of COP27 and COP28 in Egypt and the UAE,"" Benamar says. ""I think Abu Dhabi will start taking pole position in our region, I would be hopeful to see some development, positive development in Saudi Arabia, because I think at the moment, there's more talk there, but I want to see some action. And I would be delighted to hear an announcement of an actual project or some sort of initiative that's happening  And then, of course, the regulation and development. I think, hopefully Abu Dhabi will, by that time, have appointed their advisors, which demonstrates, I think, another positive step on the ground,"" Singh says.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE272","UAE, Spain issue joint statement on visit of President of Government of Spain","February 2, 2022 Wednesday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","ABU DHABI, 2nd February, 2022 (WAM) -- The United Arab Emirates and Spain have agreed to establish a strategic partnership in various fields, ranging from upgraded political consultations to an enhanced framework for investment and economic cooperation. This came in a joint statement issued this evening by the two nations on the visit paid by the President of Government of Spain, Pedro S?nchez, to the UAE today. Following is the joint statement: ""1. His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, and Pedro S?nchez, President of the Government of Spain, met in Abu Dhabi on February 2nd. The leaders agreed to establish a new and ambitious framework of relations between the United Arab Emirates and Spain, based on their shared determination to work together for a fair and sustainable collective recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic, to continue expanding their bilateral relations for the benefit of their two peoples, and to make their contribution to regional and global peace and prosperity. The UAE and Spain enjoy excellent relations at all levels, thanks to the deep historic and cultural ties that bond them together. They also share a strong commitment to a multilateral approach for more cooperative and integrated international relations. Looking to the future of their relationship, Spain and the UAE agreed to establish a strategic partnership in various fields, ranging from upgraded political consultations to an enhanced framework for investment and economic cooperation; increased collaboration in sectors such as health, the environment, renewable energy, scientific and educational cooperation, sports and culture; and to open new chapters of cooperation in areas such as cybersecurity, climate action, and industry. 2. The President of Spain congratulated the United Arab Emirates on the continued success of Expo 2020 Dubai in providing a platform that has encouraged global dialogue and innovation to work towards a more sustainable future. The Spanish pavilion, through its theme ""Intelligence for Life"", has focused on accounts of Spanish history, culture, and ties to Arab civilization as well as the sustainable practices Spain has undertaken and galvanized. Through their participation at Expo, Spain's programming has been rich and diverse with a variety of cultural events. 3. President S?nchez congratulated the United Arab Emirates on the fiftieth anniversary of its founding in 1971, and for having recently celebrated its Golden Jubilee. This auspicious historical occasion is marked by the extraordinary achievements in social and economic progress the United Arab Emirates has made in the last 50 years, and also by the stature and prestige the United Arab Emirates has deservedly gained in regional and world affairs, including the United Arab Emirates' hosting of the Expo 2020 Dubai. They agreed to further cooperate in advancing shared priorities during the United Arab Emirates' term on the UN Security Council for 2022-2023, its current three-year membership of the United Nations Council on Human Rights, as well as towards COP 28 arrangements in 2023. 4. Sheikh Mohammed highlighted Spain's role in the European Union, the G20, and the United Nations, and commended Spain on its efforts to promote effective multilateralism and committed solidarity, and to make progress in the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, as well as to contribute to the empowerment of women and youth at a global scale. The important role that Spain will play in 2022 as the host country of the NATO Summit in June, as well as the Spanish presidency of the Council of the European Union in the second semester of 2023, illustrates the leadership of Spain. His Highness also commended Spain's vision and leadership to develop Euro-Mediterranean relations, in particular by successfully hosting in Barcelona the sixth Regional Forum of the Union for the Mediterranean and the third ministerial meeting of the EU and its Southern Neighborhood, as well as Spain's special role in Latin America and the Sahel, among other regions, in its efforts to contribute to the advancement of peace, security and stability through dialogue, provide economic support to developing countries, deliver humanitarian action and support the fight against terrorism. 5. Regarding the COVID pandemic, the United Arab Emirates and Spain are both very advanced in their vaccination campaigns. With over 90% of the population fully vaccinated, both countries rank among the top ten in the world. The two leaders underlined that these efforts must continue until the pandemic is over everywhere, and they agreed on an action programme to share their capabilities and expertise in support of multilateral efforts to curb the disease, in particular in the framework of the COVAX initiative and the WHO. Furthermore, they agreed to coordinate their work to promote resilience and recovery in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in developing countries, but also in middle-income countries, in order to avert the risks of backsliding in the Sustainable Development Goals Agenda. 6. The leaders recalled the importance of the next round of Political Consultations, which will take place in Spain, be presided over by the two Ministers of Foreign Affairs, and will continue the dialogue on global and regional issues of common interest in a spirit of mutual trust and full cooperation. 7. The two leaders agreed that climate change constitutes a direct and existential threat to the global community and to human livelihoods, which requires strong and ambitious action by all countries. Both countries stressed the need for urgently stepping up global climate change ambition to limit global warming to 1.5 C, especially taking into account the outcomes of the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) in Glasgow. In this regard, both leaders noted the commitment of Spain to reach net zero emissions by 2050 and of the UAE's Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative. With regards to adaptation, both countries acknowledge their vulnerability to the impacts of climate change, as both are prone to extreme weather events, and are already experiencing longer, more frequent and intensive heat waves and droughts. Both countries are also vulnerable to sea level rise, which could affect critical infrastructures located in coastal areas. In the light of the above, both countries committed to: Enhancing cooperation in the field of climate change with a particular focus on water management and coastal management strategies, considering their particular vulnerabilities to the impacts of climate change. 8. Both sides further recognized the growing importance and high potential of cooperation in the field of climate change by welcoming the signing of the MoU on Cooperation in the Field of Energy and Climate Action between the Office of the UAE Special Envoy for Climate Change and the Spanish Ministry of Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge, and welcomed this progress. 9. Both leaders agreed that the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC) has become a platform for intercultural dialogue, understanding and cooperation, solidly anchored in the UN system and remains a useful tool of preventive diplomacy, with great potential to contribute to conflict resolution. UAE and Spain remain today solid partners of the alliance and are committed to supporting the efforts of the UN Secretary General, Ant?nio Guterres, and High Representative Miguel ?ngel Moratinos, as part of the Alliance's Action Plan for 2019-2023. Furthermore, the international peacebuilding and security architecture of the UN requires new international alliances, incorporating new technologies, artificial intelligence and technological diplomacy. The Alliance of Civilizations needs to become one of the leading actors in this process, which will define a new Agenda for Peace to be adopted at the Summit for the Future proposed by the UN Secretary General. 10. The United Arab Emirates and Spain share an important trade and investment relationship, with a total trade of 2.3 billion Euros in recent years, and a total two-way investment stock of 7.7 billion Euros, promoting innovation, jobs and economic development in the UAE and Spain. The two leaders set out their ambition to expand the economic relationship further, and discussed opportunities for economic cooperation presented by new and emerging sectors including technology, aerospace and defence, smart mobility, healthcare and life sciences, agrotechnology, water and clean and renewable energy, among others. 11. With the aim to increase bilateral investment flows, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Investment Company and COFIDES, the Spanish state-owned financial institution. The MoU aims to identify potential co-investment opportunities in Spain and enable both institutions to explore business opportunities and investments of common interest, with a special focus on Spanish companies and their foreign subsidiaries, as well as investment funds. Potential co-investments will focus on a range of sectors including energy transition, sustainable mobility, transportation, circular economy, as well as digitalization, biotechnology, and agribusiness. Additionally, the MoU will have the potential to strengthen and support reform and innovation plans for the Spanish economy and create additional opportunities to leverage funds for projects of mutual interest. 12. Willing to raise the level of ambition for the prosperity of the two economies and to increase bilateral investment flows, the leaders took positive note of the initialling of the Agreement on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (BIT, Bilateral Investment Treaty) between the United Arab Emirates and Spain. Once in force, the new BIT will promote and enhance further bilateral investment and business opportunities. 13. The two leaders also considered positively the importance and future impact of the Spanish Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan, under the broader initiative Next Generation EU funds. 14. The leaders welcomed the signature of a Memorandum of Understanding between the Ministry of Health and Prevention of the United Arab Emirates and the Ministry of Health of the Kingdom of Spain to strengthen cooperation in all fields of healthcare, with a particular focus to encourage cooperation in various aspects of the transplantation of human organs and tissues. 15. The leaders committed to speed up the entry into force of the Agreement on Cooperation on Security and the Fight Against Crime between the countries, signed in Abu Dhabi on 7 February 2021, and welcomed the ongoing cooperation between the security forces of the United Arab Emirates and Spain in fields such as the fight against illicit finance and money laundering, border security and surveillance, the fight against cybercrime, international terrorism and drug trafficking. 16. The leaders reaffirmed that collaboration in the field of defence and security is gaining pace, as is the programme for future aircraft airworthiness certification entrusted to Spain's ISDEFE, and encouraged further contacts for local industrial collaboration with other stakeholders in both countries, including Tawazun Economic Council and EDGE Group. 17. The leaders also welcomed the signature of a Memorandum of Understanding on Cybersecurity, to promote cooperation and to conduct exchanges in ICT-related fields, with particular attention to international cooperation, legislative and regulatory solutions, judicial and police activities, deterrence, prevention and responses to cyber-attacks, awareness-building and educational programs, scientific and technological research and development, and business and economic exchanges. 18. Recognising the importance of cooperating in the field of education at all levels (primary, secondary, higher and post-graduate) and the promotion of an active exchange of talent for the benefit of both societies, the leaders welcomed the initiative of the signature of a Memorandum of Understanding between the Ministry of Education of the United Arab Emirates and the Ministry of Universities of Spain in the Fields of Higher Education and Scientific Research. The MoU aims to further the existing cooperation in the fields of higher education and scientific research through the direct links among institutions of both countries. Among other objectives, both ministries will support joint research, exchanges and programmmes, sharing information on national legislation and the standards for the licensing of institutions and for the adoption of their educational programs in order to provide mutual recognition of scientific degrees, academic titles and diplomas of higher education, in accordance to the regulations applicable in each country. 19. Furthermore, the two leaders welcomed the signature of an Addendum to the existing MoU between the Ministry of Education of the UAE and the Ministry of Education and Vocational Training of Spain, in order to enlarge the Visiting Teachers Program for the Teaching of the Spanish Language. Both leaders also recognised the role of the Spanish school in Abu Dhabi. 20. The relevant presence in different Emirati institutions of Spanish scientists and researchers, gathered in the Association of Spanish Scientist and Researchers in the EAU (ACIEEAU), as well as the bilateral Committee for Technological Cooperation are valuable tools the two leaders agreed to continue further develop. They highlighted the important results achieved in this ongoing cooperation through the UAE's Technological Innovation Institute, in particular in the project to build the first nanocomputer in the country, as the best expression of joint potential in cutting edge technologies, and their future impact in areas such as precision medicine, smart technologies and artificial intelligence, among others. The two leaders decided that new alliances shall be actively encouraged through the relevant institutions of both countries in order to strengthen entrepreneurship, based on instruments to support technology-based companies and the alignment of venture capital funds in technologies of common interest, such as the aerospace sector, applied technologies for sustainability, biotechnology, food safety and ICT applied to various uses such as agriculture or personalized medicine. 21. In line with their common objective to advance cooperation in priority sectors, the two leaders also welcomed efforts to conclude the MoU on Industries and Advanced Technologies by the UAE Ministry of Industry and Advanced Technology and Spain's Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism. 22. The leaders recalled the importance of bringing the peoples of the United Arab Emirates and Spain closer together and building on the existing mutual appreciation of their cultures. A commitment was made to deepen cultural exchanges, a good example of which is the 42nd Edition of the Sharjah International Book Fair, during which Spain was the international Guest of Honour. The bilateral Commission on Culture, that met recently, examined important issues relating to the preservation of cultural heritage and the improvement of cultural industries. The advancement of cultural exchange and mutual appreciation between the people of the United Arab Emirates and Spain will act as a powerful driving force in the continued rapprochement between the two nations. 23. Both leaders agreed to mutually collaborate in the ""Government Exchange Experience Programme"", in line with governance principles, for the purpose to exchange knowledge and experience in spheres related to good government, and looked forward to further enhancing this collaboration through the conclusion of a Memorandum of Understanding on Governance Collaboration. 24. The two leaders discussed regional issues, and recalled the importance of maintaining and strengthening peace in the Middle East. They reiterated that dialogue and cooperation must be the cornerstone of a more integrated, stable and prosperous region, and Spain welcomed the outlook of the UAE in this respect. Both leaders agreed to support international efforts to maintain peace and security in the region and resolve regional conflicts, including efforts to support the reactivation of the Middle East Peace Process in line with the two-state solution and based on the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions and previous agreements between the parties. They expressed hope that the Abraham Accords will contribute to regional peace and create positive change for the Middle East region. 25. The two leaders reaffirmed their joint commitment to the fight against extremism and terrorism, in all forms, at both regional and international levels. They agreed to deepen their bilateral cooperation in the fight against terrorism, terrorist financing and extremism. In this context, they emphasized the importance of promoting the values of peace, moderation, coexistence and tolerance among peoples, and stressed the need for all forms of terrorism, extremism, violence, hatred, discrimination and incitement to be renounced. 26. The leaders also discussed regional issues of mutual interest in Africa and in the Mediterranean basin, sharing views about the need to preserve peace and stability in full respect of the principles of dialogue, respect for sovereignty and independence of all States in the region and compliance with international law and United Nations resolutions. They exchanged views on ongoing and future joint efforts to contribute to stability and prosperity in the region, in support of the United Nations and other regional organizations. 27. In relation to the Horn of Africa, the two leaders expressed their concern about the conflict in Ethiopia and their support to the mediation efforts carried out by the African Union Special Envoy Obasanjo to find a political solution to the conflict. Regarding Sudan, both leaders expressed their hope for the success of the transitional period through an inclusive peace process. 28. With regard to Yemen, the two leaders encouraged a political solution to the crisis based on the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, and committed to maintaining humanitarian efforts to alleviate the suffering of the Yemeni people. They also reiterated their strong condemnation of the recent escalation of terrorist attacks by the Houthis against Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. 29. On the Iranian nuclear programme, both leaders discussed the ongoing talks in Vienna and emphasized the importance of a negotiated solution to Iran's nuclear programme. 30. Regarding Afghanistan, the leaders underscored the high importance of stability in the country and of an inclusive coordinated approach by the international community. They expressed appreciation for the successful coordination between their two countries in August last year, which allowed Spain and the United Arab Emirates to serve as central hubs for the international humanitarian effort. Spain expressed appreciation for the UAE's humanitarian role and support in facilitating the safe transit of nationals of Spain, as well as Afghan nationals and nationals of other countries, from Afghanistan through the UAE. The leaders furthermore expressed concern at the deteriorating economic situation in Afghanistan and the need to restore basic services that may help stabilize and reverse the present state of things. Bearing in mind the serious humanitarian and refugee situation, they highlighted the importance of upholding human rights for all, noting that achievements in women's and girls' education and rights must be preserved and built upon further. 31. Both leaders shared the need for a renewed and robust relationship between the European Union and the UAE, welcoming the plans to foster a renewed relationship between the EU and the GCC, as well as the commitment to advance regional cooperation with a view to develop key partnerships in strategic sectors. They encouraged further efforts in order to successfully and swiftly conclude the EU-GCC Free Trade Agreement. In that respect, they welcomed holding the EU-GCC ministerial meeting on 21 February 2022 which will help advance further engagement between both regions and promote regional cooperation, and encouraged accelerating the work on the EU-GCC FTA. 32. President S?nchez thanked Sheikh Mohamed for his extraordinary hospitality and warmth and invited His Highness to visit Spain."" \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE273","Why now is the time for GCC exports to shift strategy","August 24, 2021 Tuesday","ArabianBusiness.com","The UAE operates the second largest aluminium plant in the world. The world is heating up \- and so are countries' efforts to slow that change. The European Union has introduced a new carbon border tariff that is set to be phased in that would place import fees on high-carbon products. In the US, Democrats have proposed similar legislation. Between 2025 and 2035, the carbon border-adjustment mechanism will see subsidies for carbon-intensive exports phased out, and importers will have to buy a new type of pollution permit. ""The policy is, in effect, a tariff intended to compensate for the fact that foreign firms may face no carbon price, or one that is lower than Europe's,"" according to the Economist. For the Gulf, which produces large quantities of steel, aluminium, fertiliser, electricity, cement \- all of which will be taxed under the new EU legislation \- now is the time to get industrial sectors ready for the change. ""It's going to be a challenge to [the Gulf's] competitiveness,"" Strafor Middle East analyst Ryan Bohl told Arabian Business about the new border tariff. But the Gulf is likely to maintain its competitive edge in these sectors for now, experts told Arabian Business. ""It would be a bigger issue for Gulf countries if this type of legislation was emerging in Asia's major economies, which are a key focus area of the Gulf,"" said Robert Mogielnicki, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington DC. In the next two decades, as climate change continues to accelerate, the attitude in places like China, South Korea and Japan may shift more in line with the EU's, putting further pressure on the Gulf's carbon-intensive exports. Omar Al-Ubaydli, director of research at Derasat. The EU produces just 8 percent of global emissions, but the bloc is betting that its new legislation will prompt action from other major economies when they meet in November in Glasgow for COP26 , the major climate change conference, Reuters reported. However, Qais Al Suwaidi, head of the UAE's Ministry of Climate Change and Environment, said in an interview with Bloomberg that the country is unlikely to set a net-zero emissions target before the talks start. ""Don't expect us to announce anything by the COP26 , but we are considering a net-zero target like any other part of the world,"" he said. The UAE is considering such a goal, but its extreme heat and dry conditions make reducing greenhouse gas emissions difficult because plenty of energy is needed for cooling and desalination, according to Al Suwaidi. While the cost of energy to produce goods is less of a concern when energy is cheap \- like it is in the Gulf \- it becomes expensive when industrialists have to pay the fine for using energy intensive methods when they export goods. Officials the Economist spoke to estimate that by 2030 the carbon border-adjustment mechanism and associated environmental policies will reduce emissions in the affected sectors by 14 percent, compared with a scenario in which nothing changes. However, imports would be 12 percent lower, because tariffs depress trade. Gulf governments have a choice: Prepare for the tariffs and make adjustments to meet new standards; or integrate the tariff into their profit margins. And they have put climate change issues at the core of their agendas, from increased investment in green hydrogen, solar, and wind technology, to pledging to make the aforementioned net-zero carbon emission goals. Robert Mogielnicki, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington DC. Given the rapid rate of climate change, it's unsurprising that the ""US and EU are getting serious about fees on carbon embedded in foreign goods"", said Mogielnicki, who is also an adjunct assistant professor at Georgetown University. ""Of course, this type of legislation also protects domestic industries from competitors in countries with lighter climate regulations."" Exports from the Gulf While Gulf governments have taken steps to address climate issues and diversify their economies away from oil, upon which they are currently dependent, challenges remain if the region is to meet its carbon and climate goals. ""A good deal of the Gulf region's push to diversify their economies away from hydrocarbons relies on energy-intensive economic activities,"" Mogielnicki said. The imports subject to the EU tariff represent about 5 percent of goods brought into the bloc from around the world, Reuters reported. Statistics from the European Commission show that 6.9 percent of the GCC's exports in 2020 went to the EU, with fuel, mining products, and chemicals making up the bulk. Steel, among the three biggest producers of carbon dioxide, accounts for a share of GCC exports to the EU. The GCC's aluminium export market is massive, with most products going to China, but also to Europe - the UAE operates the second largest aluminium plant in the world. Like aluminium, the GCC's fertiliser industry is heavily export-oriented, shipping to 80 countries globally, with India, Brazil and the US receiving the majority in 2018, according to the Gulf Petrochemicals and Chemicals Association. While steel, among the three biggest producers of carbon dioxide, also accounts for a share of GCC exports to the EU, which imports 52 million euros worth from the UAE in iron and steel, 14m euros from Saudi Arabia, 18m euros from Oman, 3m euros from Kuwait, and only 1m from Bahrain. Work is underway to decarbonise the steel sector, with emphasis on establishing or switching to hydrogen (H2) steel production. To make the switch, however, new facilities have to be developed or be retrofitted with the right technology. For investors and the private sector, opportunity looms. Scott Livermore, ICAEW economic advisor and chief economist at Oxford Economics. ""Compared to other countries, the Gulf is in a unique position because it has these ambitious development agendas; it's got significant financial resources,"" Scott Livermore, ICAEW economic advisor and chief economist at Oxford Economics, told Arabian Business. ""So they can really kind of accelerate the change."" Opportunity on the horizon There's a lot of work to be done, and exporting industries need to become more carbon-efficient with the energy they consume, Livermore said. Steel, aluminium and cement are going to be part of the industrial mix for years to come as greener alternatives remain costly and their use not widely adopted. ""So if you can become the most energy efficient producers of these products, then within this lies opportunity,"" he added. ""Eventually, the energy efficiency can become a competitive advantage.""

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE274","EXCLUSIVE: 240,000 tourists annually, economic ties reflect strong relations with UAE, Swiss President says","October 30, 2021 Saturday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","By Binsal Abdulkader ABU DHABI, 30th October, 2021 (WAM) -- About 240,000 annual two-way tourist traffic between Switzerland and the UAE, the presence of the region's largest Swiss expatriate community in the Emirates, and robust bilateral business and investment ties make the UAE ""an important partner for Switzerland in the Middle East,"" the Swiss President told Emirates News Agency (WAM). ""With almost 3000 people, the UAE is host to the largest community of Swiss citizens in the Middle East and North Africa region. Generally, about 140,000 Emiratis travel to Switzerland every year in summer to enjoy its beautiful nature. On the other hand, an estimated 100,000 Swiss citizens visit the UAE yearly,"" said Guy Parmelin, President of the Swiss Confederation. In an exclusive interview in Dubai, he added, ""The UAE is today Switzerland's 11th most important trading partner worldwide."" UAE as an important partner in MENA The UAE is an important partner for Switzerland in the Middle East and North Africa region, Parmelin stressed. ""According to the MENA strategy adopted by the Swiss government, our priorities [for relations] with the UAE include economy, finance and science, sustainable development, digitalization, as well as peace, security and human rights."" The economic relations with the UAE remain strong despite the setback from the COVID-19 pandemic, the President pointed out. ""Trade between us reached US$13 billion in 2020 and Switzerland remains an important investor with Swiss businesses creating approximately 10,000 jobs in the UAE alone,"" he said, adding that more than 200 Swiss companies are operating in the UAE. Officials talks on bilateral ties, global issues The president will also be meeting with other top Emirati officials as well ""to discuss how we can deepen an already very strong relationship, especially when it comes to business and investment."" The bilateral talks will also address global issues such as climate change, including the urgency for ambitious climate action by each country and the necessity to agree at the upcoming UN climate conference in Glasgow ( COP26 ) on a robust rule book under the Paris Agreement, he revealed. ""I believe that there are various areas, in which we could support dialogue and cooperation in the region. The UAE is an important and influential actor in the Middle East and North Africa. Therefore, we regularly discuss political developments in the wider region together, including what is happening in Afghanistan,"" he said. ""We aim to intensify these exchanges in the run up to the year 2023, when the UAE, and - hopefully - Switzerland too, will be a member of the UN Security Council."" Expo is unique He attended the official Swiss National Day at the Expo 2020 on Friday. ""The Swiss pavilion is a unique architectural experience and I hope many Emiratis will come and see for themselves."" The Expo is unique as it is the first of its kind to be held in the Middle East, Parmelin noted. ""Secondly, it takes place at a very special moment and essentially offers the first real opportunity for meeting people from all over the world on a large scale since the beginning of the pandemic,"" he said, adding that it will also offer a chance to increase the bilateral cooperation on matters related to education, research and innovation. 'UAE reminds me of Switzerland' This is his first official visit to the UAE. ""I can only say that I am impressed. What this country has achieved in the merely 50 years since its foundation deserves praise and admiration. I see a country that is both modern and open to the world and at the same time cherishes its traditions and culture. As such, the UAE reminds me of Switzerland."" He welcomed the National Climate Change Plan of the UAE with its comprehensive strategic priorities that includes the ""UAE Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative,"" a national drive to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, making the Emirates the first MENA nation to do so. ""At the same time, all of our efforts must concentrate on reaching the global goals set for greenhouse gas emission reduction by 2030. Given the negative impact of COVID-19 on the economic growth situation, financing the transition to clean energy has become an even greater challenge,"" he stressed. Switzerland will host a Hydropower Conference in Geneva in the fall of 2022, taking up the topic of financing, the President said. Farmer-turned president Parmelin, 61, had an academic background in agriculture and worked as a farmer. ""It has influenced me; it is my identity. My education and previous work as a farmer have taught me one thing above all: you need to be rooted in the land you come from to move into the future with calm and confidence. Also, you can only harvest if you have sown in time,"" he explained. \"

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE278","A human-rights approach is key to tackling global challenges","July 14, 2021 Wednesday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","Reuters The Covid-19 pandemic has recast the world for millions of people. Or, more correctly, the pandemic has exposed and aggravated deep inequalities of race, gender, and class across societies, and highlighted the inability of many political systems to respond in ways that protect individual human rights and dignity. The world will neither rebuild from this crisis, nor have any chance of tackling wider existential threats such as climate change, until we can once more instill a sense of hope in political and civic life. Fortunately, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a roadmap already exists to help humanity chart a path forward. The declaration, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948, is as relevant today as it was amid the physical and moral devastation caused by World War II. Article 1 of the declaration states an abiding truth with resounding clarity: ""All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights."" To realise this vision today, we must push leaders to go beyond warm words and commit to meaningful, feasible, and measurable actions. In particular, they need to ensure equitable global distribution of Covid-19 vaccines and provide adequate financial support to countries most vulnerable to the ravages of climate change. For starters, high-income countries must take steps to achieve the Gavi Covax Advance Market Commitment target of providing at least one billion vaccine doses to the world's poorest countries no later than September 1, 2021, and more than two billion doses by mid-2022. It is both morally unjust and  in health and economic terms  myopic for rich countries to hoard Covid-19 vaccines for their own populations. The longer the coronavirus persists and mutates in poorer countries with fewer resources, the further away humanity as a whole will be from fully vanquishing the threat to lives and livelihoods. In the same spirit, G7 and G20 leaders should support calls at the World Health Organisation and the World Trade Organisation for voluntary licensing and technology transfer for production of vaccines. Failing that, they should back an immediate waiver of certain intellectual-property rights under WTO rules  a move that US President Joe Biden recently supported. Sadly, at their recent summit in the United Kingdom, G7 leaders failed to show an understanding of the scale of their responsibility to address the inequalities exacerbated by the pandemic. More broadly, Covid-19 has exposed the shortcomings of narrow nationalism and populist policies that disdain scientific evidence and empathy. No country, regardless of its power or size, can tackle the public-health threat effectively on its own. It is essential that leaders learn from their mistakes and heed the recommendations of the expert Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response. Only properly financed, integrated, and organised health systems will be able to withstand future pandemics and health emergencies. As matters stand, however, the rich world's failures in tackling Covid-19 have increased the trust deficit between the Global North and South. This, in turn, will make it more difficult to reach an agreement at the next critical international diplomatic gathering: the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November. All countries need to ratchet up their near-term emissions-reduction targets ahead of COP26 , and we are still waiting for the major emitters to do so. In addition, rich countries must rebuild trust by showing how they will increase their climate finance contributions \- including a greater share for adaptation \- to deliver the long-pledged $100 billion per year to help developing countries combat global warming and its effects. Two common threads run through the shared challenges we face in defending human rights, overcoming the pandemic, and tackling the climate crisis: the need for vigilance against complacency, and the responsibility to act for the greater good. In these testing times, we can all draw inspiration from a leader who never wavered in his commitment to human rights and justice: Nelson Mandela. It is a historical irony that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted in the same year that South Africa established its apartheid regime. But Mandela immediately saw the declaration's power and potential. Speaking in 1997 as president of South Africa, he reflected: ""For all the opponents of this pernicious system, the simple and noble words of the Universal Declaration were a sudden ray of hope at one of our darkest moments."" Today, more than ever, we need to rediscover and reassert the declaration's principles of solidarity and common endeavour that Mandela so powerfully articulated throughout his life. Our task now is not to ""build back better"", because we cannot build back from a status quo ante that produced inequitable and dysfunctional systems. Rather, we must ""build forward better,"" marshaling our efforts with hope, discipline, and determination to build a sustainable, peaceful, and just world for future generations.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE279","Is buying refurbished tech the best way to find Black Friday deals?","November 13, 2021 Saturday","TechRadar","Even with the discounts, we're likely to see thanks to upcoming Black Friday deals, the latest tech rarely comes cheap. On the hunt for a bargain, your eyes might have been drawn to the reduced price of refurbished tech, but should you steer clear of these tempting offers or not? Refurbished, used and like-new devices may be less expensive than their out-of-the-box counterparts, but they also come with a degree of uncertainty - is the item just a little scuffed or are we paying out for a plastic brick? Thanks to our experience with buying tech secondhand we're here to highlight why the refurbished tag shouldn't immediately scare you away, but also what you need to look out for when buying something used. Old to them, new to you The reduced cost of refurbished tech is likely the biggest draw, attracting those on the hunt for reasonable prices. Even outside of Black Friday you can typically find savings of around 10-20% on gadgets that might be only a few months old. During Black Friday the deals will often get even sweeter as the sale prices on new products are carried over to their secondhand counterparts; with the refurbished discount being added on top you can potentially save a significant amount compared with the device's usual RRP. We've had success buying second-hand games consoles, webcams, smartphones, and more - all of it at a much lower price than we would have otherwise paid. We further compounded the savings by trading in our own old tech at the same time, sometimes paying nothing to get our hands on the device we were after. Savings aren't the only draw though, with another driving force being that secondhand purchases reduce electronic waste. (Image credit: Shutterstock / Morten B) Following the recent COP26 conference, climate change, its effects, and what we can do to prevent the situation from worsening have been on the minds of citizens across the globe. One way we can do our bit is by buying up older but usable tech rather than sending it to landfill. Recent efforts are only starting to make electronic waste easier to recycle - the UK's Royal Mint unveiled its high-tech solution very recently - so for now we need to find other ways of keeping our old technology out of the trash and using it for as long as we can. While this won't convince as many people to buy used as the discounts available, the feeling that you're doing the right thing is an added benefit that you won't get from buying new. One person's trash is another person's... trash Before you head straight for the secondhand sites you need to be careful though, as not all refurbished and used items are equal. Like all things, tech components will get worn out with use, and if you aren't careful you could end up buying a gadget that's more worn down than its age might have you believe. With any piece of secondhand kit you expect the odd scuff or scrape on the outer shell - but it's the internal components (the ones you can't see) that you need to worry about. If you're looking to save more over and above the best Black Friday OLED TV deals that are out there then a refurbished offering can seem like a good bet - especially given how expensive these screens can be. Unfortunately, we'd recommend you steer clear of second-hand OLEDs unless you can see them in action or they're from a retailer with quality guarantees. That's because OLED screens can be damaged by an effect called burn-in - where an image has been on display for too long and becomes permanently branded into the screen. Manufacturers say that - especially with newer OLED screens - burn-in is much less of a concern than it used to be and isn't something that the average user should worry about. However, it's the kind of damage that might make someone else want to abandon their TV and get a new one - potentially leaving the damaged tech with whichever sucker buys it off them. Customers after a high-end PC that takes advantage of Black Friday gaming laptop deals should be on the lookout, too. Cryptocurrency mining has become massive these past few years, causing most of the best components to be sold out almost instantly - laptops using GPUs like the RTX 3080 and equally powerful processors have also been snatched up quickly. Mining is an intensive process that puts strain on these components though, and eventually, they'll be too worn out to function properly. At this point, a shady character might decide to sell them on as 'used', offering them up for a very reasonable price online; in actuality, you're paying $500 for the equivalent of a pet rock. How 'new' is that new GPU? (Image credit: Future) Instead, we'd recommend buying from sites that offer a warranty on the refurbished items. In the US that's stores like Best Buy, Walmart, and the device's original manufacturer. If you're in the UK you can also turn to the original manufacturers as well as the store CEX. Amazon also offers refurbished and used items, but they aren't always from Amazon-certified sellers so be sure you understand all the terms before you check out. Beyond that, our recommendation would be to make sure you're actually paying less when buying secondhand. Sometimes you'll find secondhand items are actually more expensive than if you'd bought the item new, and that's especially likely during Black Friday as some vendors may offer savings that beat out the savings from buying used. Sought-after gadgets like the PS5 and Xbox Series X may also be sold at a premium second hand, so it's always worth double-checking the price against what you can find elsewhere - ur Black Friday guides are a great place to start if you want to compare prices you see online.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE280","Abu Dhabi Department of Energy confirms plans to support UAE's ambitious Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative","November 5, 2021 Friday","Emirates News Agency (WAM) - Business (English)","ABU DHABI, 5th November, 2021 (WAM) -- The Abu Dhabi Department of Energy today confirmed key sector initiatives over the next decade to help accelerate the UAE's sustainable economic growth while supporting its ambitious Net Zero By 2050 Strategic Initiative, during COP26 in Glasgow.The DoE outlined nine existing and planned projects focused on clean energy generation from solar and nuclear sources, electrification of the water production system through reverse osmosis (RO) technology and enabling policies and energy efficiency measures. When combined they can reduce emissions associated with power generation and water production by at least 50 percent in the next 10 years.Eng. Awaidha Al Marar, Chairman of the Abu Dhabi Department of Energy, said, ""Building on a 15-year track record of climate innovation and the UAE's enduring support for the Paris Climate Agreement, our commitment is underpinned by a strategic shift to low-carbon technologies with large-scale investment in solar and nuclear energy to drive down emissions. For instance, Abu Dhabi has developed a world-class sustainability investment vehicle through the launch of Masdar City in 2008 as one of the world's first carbon-neutral developments. Since then, we have taken the lead regionally in deploying renewable energy.""Our 1.2GW Noor Abu Dhabi Solar PV plant has increased the share of renewables in our energy mix to six percent of the emirate's total installed capacity in 2021, and the launch of the first reactor of the Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant in 2020 has also increased the share of carbon-free energy production in the emirate's energy mix to 7 percent in 2021.""With more upcoming renewable deployments like Abu Dhabi's 2GW Al Dhafra Solar PV project due by 2023, as well as the baseload nuclear energy expected upon full operation of the Barakah plant, the total clean power generation capacity in the emirate will reach 8.8GW in 2025. That increases the share of clean energy capacity in the energy mix to 31 percent by 2025 from 13 percent in 2021.""Al Marar added, ""With these solar and nuclear projects, it could influence electricity generation by 2025 to be seven percent produced from solar PV sources and 47 percent from nuclear power.""This means 55 percent of Abu Dhabi's electricity in 2025 will be generated from clean sources and can cut power generation emissions from 40 million tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2020 to approximately 20 million tonnes in 2025.""The DoE is a partner of the whole-of-country, whole-of-government UAE Net Zero by 2050 Initiative led by the UAE Ministry of Climate Change and Environment which reflects the ""Principles of the 50"" \- the UAE's roadmap for accelerating development that was launched in September to mark the country's Golden Jubilee.The UAE Initiative comprises key existing and planned projects from Abu Dhabi's energy sector that could drive total emission reductions of more than 29 million tonnes per year by 2030. These include: Noor Abu Dhabi Solar PV plant projected to avoid up to 1 million tonnes of CO2 emissions per year Barakah Nuclear Power Plant to avoid 21 million tonnes of CO2 emissions per year Al Dhafra 2GW Single Site Solar PV Plant which could reduce 2.4 million tonnes of CO2 emissions Two additional solar projects with a combined capacity of 2GW and potential to avoid 2.6 million tonnes of CO2 emissions Two waste-to-energy plants in Abu Dhabi and Al Ain are expected to help reduce 2.4 million tonnes of CO2 emissions.Additionally, Abu Dhabi is contributing a new planned water production electrification project to support the energy transition and ensure that the UAE Net Zero ambition becomes a reality in the future.Commenting on the importance of decarbonising the water sector, Al Marar said, ""Water is a vital resource and a national priority to cover the present and future water demands of our population, maintain our food security, and sustain our economic growth.""Four of our current desalination plants in Abu Dhabi utilise RO technology and represent 24 percent of the emirate's desalinated water production in 2021. This share is expected to grow to 43 percent by 2025 as new RO projects are implemented including the Al Taweelah RO desalination facility which is expected to be the largest in the world with a combined production capacity of 200 MIGD and the potential to avoid 1.2 million CO2 emissions per year.""Additional RO projects through 2030 with an approximate total capacity of 680 million gallons per day are expected to increase the share of RO in Abu Dhabi's total water production to 80 percent and reduce four million tonnes of CO2 emissions per year.""The UAE Net Zero Strategic Initiative also outlines a package of proposals to make the UAE's energy, environment, industry, and transportation policies fit for enabling the necessary acceleration of greenhouse gas emission reductions in the next decade.A notable initiative in this regard is the Abu Dhabi Demand Side Management and Energy Rationalisation Strategy which DoE designed to address supply and demand issues through a nine-programme multi-stakeholder approach. It aims to reduce electricity consumption by 22 percent and water consumption by 32 percent by 2030.The strategic implementation could avoid the emission of more than 9 mt of CO2 emissions from the atmosphere \- the equivalent of removing 1.5 million vehicles from the road for an entire year.Between 2019 and 2020 Abu Dhabi's DSM initiatives have contributed to achieving 6,183 GWh of cumulative annual electricity savings and 230 Mm3 of annual water savings, which represent short-term costs savings in the order of AED1.1 billion, avoiding the emission of approximately 3.2 million tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere.Today, the DoE announcement highlights the UAE's track record and ambition in progressive climate action as the country extends its offer to host COP28 in Abu Dhabi in 2023.

The DoE outlined nine existing and planned projects focused on clean energy generation from solar and nuclear sources, electrification of the water production system through reverse osmosis (RO) technology. It also outlined enabling policies and energy efficiency measures that combined can reduce emissions associated with power generation and water production by at least 50 per cent in the next 10 years. The UAE Initiative comprises key existing and planned projects from Abu Dhabi's energy sector that could drive total emission reductions of more than 29 million tonnes per year by 2030. These include: Noor Abu Dhabi Solar PV plant projected to avoid up to 1 million tonne of CO2 emissions per year Barakah Nuclear Power Plant to avoid 21 million tonnes of CO2 emissions per year Al Dhafra 2GW Single Site Solar PV Plant which could reduce 2.4 million tonnes of CO2 emissions Two additional solar projects with a combined capacity of 2GW and potential to avoid 2.6 million tonnes of CO2 emissions Two waste-to-energy plants in Abu Dhabi and Al Ain expected to help reduce 2.4 million tonnes of CO2 emissions. These clean energy initiatives alone ALSO READ: Awaidha Al Marar, Chairman of the Abu Dhabi Department of Energy, reaffirmed that Abu Dhabi has been committed to leading the transition to renewable and clean energy in line with the UAE strategies to achieve sustainable economic growth over the next 50 years. ""Building on a 15-year track record of climate innovation and on the UAE's enduring support for the Paris Climate Agreement, our commitment is underpinned by a strategic shift to low-carbon technologies with large-scale investment in solar and nuclear energy to drive down emissions,"" he said. ""For instance, Abu Dhabi has developed a world-class sustainability investment vehicle through the launch of Masdar City in 2008 as one of the world's first carbon neutral developments. Since then, we've taken the lead regionally in deploying renewable energy."" ""Our 1.2GW Noor Abu Dhabi Solar PV plant has increased the share of renewables in our energy mix to 6 per cent of the emirate's total installed capacity in 2021 and the launch of the first reactor of the Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant in 2020 has also increased the share of carbon-free energy production in the emirate's energy mix to 7 per cent in 2021."" ""With more upcoming renewable deployments like Abu Dhabi's 2GW Al Dhafra Solar PV project due by 2023, as well as the baseload nuclear energy expected upon full operation of the Barakah plant, the total clean power generation capacity in the emirate will reach 8.8GW in 2025, increasing the share of clean energy capacity in the energy mix to 31 per cent by 2025 from 13 per cent in 2021."" Al Marar added: ""With these solar and nuclear projects, it is predicted to influence electricity generation by 2025 to be 7 per cent produced from solar PV sources and 47 per cent from nuclear. ""This means 55 per cent of Abu Dhabi's electricity in 2025 will be generated from clean sources and is expected to cut power generation emissions from 40 million tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2020 to approximately 20 million tonnes in 2025."" The DoE is a partner of the whole-of-country, whole-of-government UAE Net Zero by 2050 Initiative led by the UAE Ministry of Climate Change and Environment which reflects the ""Principles of the 50"" \- the UAE's roadmap for accelerating development that was launched in September to mark the country's Golden Jubilee.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE284","UAE announces Hydrogen Leadership Roadmap, reinforcing Nation's commitment to driving economic opportunity through decisive climate action","November 4, 2021 Thursday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","GLASGOW, 4th November, 2021 (WAM) -- The UAE, represented by the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure (MOEI) today announced the Hydrogen Leadership Roadmap, a comprehensive national blueprint to support domestic, low-carbon industries, contribute to the country's net-zero ambition and establish the country as a competitive exporter of hydrogen. The Roadmap's ambitions underscore the UAE leadership's enduring legacy of progressive solutions to global climate challenges, as recently demonstrated by the announcement of ""UAE's Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative"". The UAE became the first country in the Middle East and North Africa region to announce a net zero strategic initiative by 2050 in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement. The unveiling of the Hydrogen Leadership Roadmap came during the crucial COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, where countries from across the globe are expected to commit to enhanced pledges to cut emissions for the first time since the Paris accord was signed. Suhail bin Mohammed Al Mazrouei, Minister of Energy and Infrastructure, said, ""The United Arab Emirates today launches UAE's Hydrogen Roadmap a key enabler in line with UAE leadership's enduring tradition to contribute progressive solutions to global climate challenges with the announcement of 'UAE's Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative'. The Net Zero Initiative is aimed at creating a vibrant ecosystem transiting towards a new model of sustainable economic growth trajectory that leverages research, development, innovation, and clean technology. Plans, strategies, and implementation of the necessary initiatives and projects are under development by stakeholders in UAE's key sectors, including energy, economy, industry, infrastructure, transport, waste, agriculture, and the environment. The UAE is well positioned to be a leader in low carbon hydrogen with natural competitive advantages for both blue and green hydrogen, however, green hydrogen production remains in its infancy, requiring an international collaboration to accelerate its development. Green hydrogen is envisaged to play a significant role in UAE's domestic strategy to meet the UAE 2050 Net-Zero goals and which will also assist globally by exporting hydrogen."" Dr. Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and UAE Special Envoy for Climate Change said, ""The potential of the clean hydrogen market in the UAE and globally is immense and, through the Hydrogen Leadership Roadmap, our nation will be well placed to continue delivering on ambitious growth projects across the clean hydrogen value chain, leveraging the UAE's existing position as an early mover in low and no-carbon industries and technologies. And within the vision outlined by the recently announced UAE Net Zero Strategic Initiative, the Roadmap will, through fast-emerging growth opportunities in clean hydrogen and its carrier fuels, accelerate efforts to create a vibrant ecosystem for the UAE's sustainable economic growth trajectory and enable direct positive impact on the country's GDP."" Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, Minister of Climate Change and the Environment, said, ""Perceived by many as the sustainable fuel of the future, clean hydrogen is an important tool in decarbonizing economies. The UAE Hydrogen Leadership Roadmap seeks to leverage the country's investments and experience in affordable renewable energy to develop the clean hydrogen sector. The Roadmap will play a key role in advancing the UAE's transition to a sustainable, low-carbon economy."" The Hydrogen Leadership Roadmap comprises three core objectives: unlocking new sources of value creation through exports of low carbon hydrogen, derivatives and products to key importing regions, fostering new hydrogen derivative opportunities through low-carbon steel, sustainable kerosene as well as other priority UAE industries and contributing to the UAE's 2050 net zero commitments. As outlined in the Roadmap, the UAE aims to support the low-carbon hydrogen business through five critical enablers: a clear regulatory framework backed by policies, incentives, standards, and certifications; best-in-class technology through value-add partnerships and the vibrant and robust UAE domestic research and development structure; access to existing and new Government-to-Government relationships to accelerate growth of a domestic ecosystem; readily available land and infrastructure resources to support domestic production; and green financing within the UAE and in international capital markets. The UAE is well on its way to meet its ambition to be a global leader in low carbon hydrogen with more than seven projects already underway which will target 25 percent market share in the key export markets, including Japan, South Korea, Germany, and India initially along with additional high-potential markets in Europe and East Asia. Today, the global market for [clean hydrogen] is estimated to be valued at between 400 billion and one trillion dollars and will be an essential means of the UAE's ongoing efforts to transition to lower emissions energy sources and capitalise on new growth opportunities within the low and no carbon economy. The UAE is already well positioned to be a leader in clean hydrogen with natural competitive advantages for both blue and green hydrogen, including abundant and competitive hydrocarbons, existing large-scale hydrogen and ammonia production facilities, access to some of the world's most cost-competitive solar PV energy and large-scale carbon capture and storage capacities, which national oil company ADNOC already possesses and continues to advance. The UAE Hydrogen Leadership Roadmap is already being underpinned by National Champions with world-leading low carbon hydrogen projects, pilots, and test cargoes. The UAE plans currently include 7+ projects which are either completed or underway via the main stakeholders, such as the Abu Dhabi Hydrogen Alliance (ADNOC, Mubadala, & ADQ ) and DEWA, including; first solar PV and green hydrogen producing facility in the MENA region, blue ammonia production plant, green hydrogen demonstration plant (initially for road transport, then expanding to e-kerosene synthesis and ocean shipping), establishing a UAE hydrogen hub in coloboration with BP, green ammonia project powered by solar based electrolyzer facility, and a large-scale green hydrogen project enabling the first green steel produced in the MENA region. Additionally, the UAE also have four test cargos of blue ammonia already sold by ADNOC. Although the UAE is well positioned to be a leader in low carbon hydrogen with natural competitive advantages for both blue and green hydrogen, green hydrogen production remains in its infancy, requiring an international collaboration to accelerate its development. Green hydrogen is envisaged to play a significant role in UAE's domestic strategy to meet the UAE 2050 Net-Zero goals and which will also assist globally by exporting hydrogen. \"

MPCs allow a producer to sell instruments representing zero methane emission natural gas production. As part of the inaugural launch, Macquarie Energy Canada, Ltd. a wholly owned subsidiary of Macquarie Group (""Macquarie""), arranged the first MPC trade between Pacific Canbriam and industrial gas customer Skeena Bioenergy Ltd, a manufacturer of wood pellets exported to the UK, EU, and Japan, displacing coal in electricity generation. S&P Global Platts and Xpansiv, the global marketplace for ESG commodities, worked together to launch this innovative new way to measure and price methane performance in natural gas production. Pacific Canbriam and other natural gas providers who qualify will issue MPCs that register the carbon intensity of their natural gas, proving that fugitive methane emissions fall below strict, quantifiable thresholds. The MPCs evidence the stringent environmental standards in B.C. and the low methane intensity of Pacific Canbriam's natural gas. Only natural gas produced below a threshold of 0.1% methane emissions intensity (MEI) qualifies under the S&P Global Platts protocol. This standard reflects the market value of low methane emissions in natural gas production. Pacific Canbriam Energy is a world-leader in minimizing methane leaks and vents in its operations, and its natural gas involved in this transaction is well below the 0.1% Platts threshold; the number of MPCs are calculated relative to an average methane emissions rate for North America[1].

We're excited and proud to supply MPCs to Skeena that demonstrate the exceptionally low methane intensity associated with the development of our natural gas."" With global attention on climate change in the run-up to COP26 , upstream energy carbon intensity is being closely watched and has prompted investors, consumers, and producers to seek new ways to reduce their carbon footprint. This has created an increased demand for low-carbon fuels. ""We chose to purchase Methane Performance Certificates from Pacific Canbriam Energy to voluntarily reduce the supply chain methane emissions intensity associated with our natural gas,"" said Skeena President Roger Keery. ""It's an important step forward in lowering our overall GHG footprint."" MPCs are registered, issued, transacted, and retired in accordance with the Xpansiv Digital Fuels Program to eliminate double counting. Xpansiv's DF Registry maintains a complete record of the MPC and its associated environmental claims, ensuring data quality. ""MPCs allow the market to reward producers like Pacific Canbriam with low methane leakage, creating a clear market price related to fugitive methane emissions,"" said Andrew Pisano, Head of XRegistries at Xpansiv. ""We're pleased to support natural gas market participants on their path to reach their ESG targets and climate commitments, and hope this incentivizes other producers to make similar measurable progress.""

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE286","Energising Green Growth","December 12, 2021 Sunday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","At the COP26 held at Glasgow in November 2021, the newly appointed Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida pledged net-zero by 2050. In a speech at the gathering, he said: ""Japan will realise this goal under our newly adopted long-term strategy. I assure that Japan aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 46 per cent in the fiscal year 2030 from its fiscal year 2013 levels, and that Japan will continue strenuous efforts in its challenge to meet the lofty goal of cutting its emissions by 50 per cent."" At a webinar with Khaleej Times, Daisuke Suginoo, Assistant Director, Energy Strategy Office, Policy Planning and Coordination Division, Commissioner's Secretariat, Agency for Natural Resources and Energy, The Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI), talked about why Japan is taking preventative measures to counteract carbon emissions. Suginoo says: ""Japan emits a large volume of CO2 every year. As critical conditions arise due to climate change, it is paramount that Japan takes corrective measures. 90% of all the CO2 emissions is energy related. Keeping that goal in mind, the new Strategic Energy Plan announced in October 2021, aims to show the path of the energy policy to realise carbon neutrality by 2050 and new GHG emission reduction target in FY2030. The new plan indicates the overall direction of the country's policy. The message also includes that not only dealing with climate change is important but ensuring security and stability of the supply is also important, that the prices must be affordable in order to ensure international competitiveness as well as maintaining the livelihood of those involved in the supply chain. The Energy Mix Vision for 2030 Suginoo adds: ""Another important theme is to overcome the challenges Japan's energy supply-demand structure faces. On the major premise of safety, efforts will be made for energy security and economic efficiency of energy while promoting climate change countermeasures (S+3E). In the new plan, in the power sector, the country expects to lower themal power ratio on the major premise of its stable power suply, and move to new energy mix that includes more than doubling renewable energy supply (FY'19 - 18 per cent to FY'30 -36 to 38 per cent) as well as positioning hydrogen and ammonia (FY'19 - nil to FY'30 - 41 per cent) as fuel. Hydrogen is key for carbon neutrality Hydrogen is increasingly being viewed as an important tool for reducing carbon emissions, because the use of hydrogen for energy generates no direct carbon dioxide emissions. Hiroki Yoshida, Deputy Director, Hydrogen and Fuel Cells Strategy Office, Advanced Energy Systems and Structure Division, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Department, METI, adds: ""We are trying to make cleaner power generation and the renewable energy is also being expanded including solar power and wind, but renewable energy is intermittent and inconsistent. In this case, hydrogen can be stored as power storage and/or can be used for power generation. By using hydrogen, we believe that the potential of the RE can be leveraged to the maximum."" With regards to the contribution of hydrogen, it can be used for operating power plants and in other areas where it is difficult to decarbonise such as industry or modern commercial sectors which mainly depend on fossil fuels. Currently in Japan, there are 167 hydrogen stations, including 12 under construction. Most of them are in Kanto region, followed by Chukyo, Kansai & Shikoku, Chugoku & Kyushu, Hokkaido & Tohoku and Hokuriko. Japan's target is 320 stations by 2025, 1,000 stations by 2030. ""At the moment we are trying to expand the use of hydrogen in Japan but expanding the consumption means, supply has to be expanded as well,"" Hiroki adds. The Fukushima Hydrogen Energy Research Field (FH2R), a renewable energy-powered 10 MW-class hydrogen production unit, is currently the largest facility. Going forward if Japan enters a full-fledged hydrogen-based society then larger facilities of the same scale will be required, adds Hiroki. Now, Japan's annual consumption of hydrogen is 2 million tonnes, and by 2030, by the virtue of supply and demand, the expected consumption will rise to 3 million tonnes. By 2050, the target is to be 20 million tonnes a year. On the road to 'Beyond Zero' Naoto Okura, Deputy Director, International Affairs Division, Commissioner's Secretariat, Agency for Natural Resources and Energy, METI, said that Japan takes its energy policies very seriously. In October 2020, Japan declared the goal of realizing a carbon-neutral, decarbonised society by 2050. To achieve this goal, Japan will lead decarbonization globally by establishing and implementing innovative technologies and mobilising all measures toward the ""Beyond Zero"" initiative, whose goal is not only global carbon neutrality, but also retroactive reduction of CO2 emissions through the stock base approach. He added: ""This year, from October 4 to 8, METI held the Tokyo Beyond Zero Week with eight conferences - online and hybrid - were concentrated into a week period to hold wide-ranging discussions on individual challenges toward the realisation of ""Beyond Zero,"" as well as pathways and methods to address these challenges within society. A total of about 17,000 people from about 90 countries participated."" Based on the declaration of carbon neutrality by 2050, three concepts were presented as the overall concept to communicate Japan's stance toward carbon neutrality. He detailed each concept as ""Various Pathways"" - To achieve carbon neutrality based on actual circumstances of each country and realistic and pragmatic energy transition, meaning that there is no 'one size that fits all'. ""Innovation"" - Need for innovation to achieve carbon neutrality which must be an elevated level of ambition. This means not only leveraging existing technologies but inventing innovative technologies must be added like hydrogen, fuel ammonia and CCUS. Innovation capabilities must be used in full scale. ""Engagement"" - For the entire world to go carbon neutral, just developed economies working on their own will not be sufficient. So, the concept is to have thorough engagement across all the countries of the world wherein the advanced economies might offer support and cooperation to the developing nations to be decarbonised. Energy Transition via partnership Shota Inagaki, Deputy Director, Petroleum and Natural Gas Division, Natural Resources and Fuel Department, Agency for Natural Resources and Energy, METI, spoke about the Asia Energy Transition Initiative (AETI) that Japan is leading by example. He begins by saying that climate change is one of the most critical issues in the world and to achieve carbon neutrality it is essential for all nations to achieve this goal by the middle of this century. But it is not easy in Asian countries. ""This is why Japan is supporting energy transitions in Asia in realistic and gradual manner because it is very essential in Asia. To support this, in May this year, Japan announced AETI that includes a variety of support for various and pragmatic energy transitions in the region."" The pillars Support for formulating energy transition roadmaps 2. US$10 billion financial support for renewable energy, energy efficiency, LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas), CCUS and other projects 3. Technology development and deployment, utilising the achievement of Green Innovation fund that was established a year ago. 4. Human resource development, knowledge sharing and rulemaking on decarbonisation technologies. As part of this initiative on Oct 4, Asia Green Growth Partnership Ministerial Meeting was convened wherein 20 countries participated at ministerial levels including the UAE and Saudi Arabia. The participants discussed the need to achieve green growth and accelerate various and realistic energy transitions toward global carbon neutrality in the earliest possible time. They affirmed that there is no single pathway to achieve carbon neutrality, but there are diverse pathways for each country, and that promoting innovation and actively engaging Asian countries will be important. Japan and the UAE At the Asia Green Growth Partnership meeting, Dr Sultan Al Jaber, CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and Minister for Industry and Advanced Technology and the UAE's special envoy for climate change, welcomed Japan's initiative and shared their views to achieve green growth and studied energy transitions in Asia. They also realised the emphasis of various realistic and timely growth. The UAE is aiming to expand bilateral economic and trade relations with Japan as it drives post-Covid economic growth and ADNOC is leveraging its status as a long-standing reliable and stable supplier of oil and gas to Japan to nurture new partnership opportunities between both countries. Japan is ADNOC's largest international importer of oil and gas products with approximately 25 per cent of its crude oil imported from the UAE. In July this year, ADNOC announced a joint study agreement (JSA) with two Japanese companies \- INPEX Corporation (INPEX), JERA Co., Inc. (JERA), and a government agency, the Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC) \- to explore the commercial potential of blue ammonia production in the UAE. ADNOC is already embarking on a world-scale blue ammonia production facility at the TA'ZIZ Industrial Chemicals Zone in Ruwais which will have a capacity of 1,000 kilotons per annum, and further opportunities in blue ammonia will be explored under the new agreement. In January, ADNOC and METI signed the MoC on ammonia fuel and carbon recycling and in April, and another was signed between METI and Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure Suhail Mohamed Al Mazrouei about the cooperation in the field of hydrogen. Why should you consider FCEVs over EVs? Everyone wants to own a Tesla. The cost that comes with it is huge but so does your responsibility to the environment. EVs pose their own challenges and are still overlooked by a majority due to the cost factor and limited range of coverage in a single charge, topped by limited charging spaces. However, vehicles that run on fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), expensive, are now gaining concentration in cities. Currently in use are 6,500 FCEVs across Japan. Considering the nature and characteristics of FCEVs, it can run for longer distances and the speed of charging is faster than EVs. So, there is a possibility of introducing these in transportation vehicles. Therefore, there is an emphasis on technological advancements for the purpose of using it for larger vehicles.

But the following two days were far less lighthearted as Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, the man often credited with saving the euro, attempted to demonstrate as host that the G20 is also robust and prepared to meet the multiple serious crises of our time. Comprised of countries that together generate 80 per cent of global GDP and over 75 per cent of greenhouse gases (GHG), the Rome G20 was the first in-person summit since the pandemic began and held as the initial element in a rare overlap of global conferences. After the G20 concluded on Sunday, most major participants immediately decamped for Glasgow, Scotland, where the COP26 forum on climate change organized by the United Nations was already under way. As world leaders arrived in Rome for the G20 and prepared to consider the serious issues at hand, many and their entourage took some time to enjoy the climate, beauty and stunning history of the Eternal City that for a few days turned to be Caput Mundi again. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson used the backdrop of the Colosseum to muse about the decline of civilisations. He seemed to glory in a private visit to the iconic symbol, but warned: ""We must be careful not to end up like the Roman Empire."" ""We will end up there if we do not intervene seriously, quickly and clearly on climate change,"" said the prime minister, who holds a degree in Classic languages and has a keen interest in history. ""These amazing ruins are the symbol of how progress can stop if human arrogance is not controlled. In the fifth century, progress stopped and we came to live in a dark era. We hope it will not happen again."" As Indian Premier Narendra Modi arrived for his first official visit to Italy, he also met the pope, to whom he gave a silver candelabra and a book on climate change. The two discussed poverty and also the pandemic. Later Modi invited the Pope to India. Italian first lady Serena Draghi guided participants' wives and husbands through some of Rome's best sites including the Baths of Emperor Diocletian, Villa Pamphilj, the Vatican Museums, the Sistine Chapel and the Colosseum, among others. In remarks to open the G20 conference, Italian Prime Minister Draghi said the world is rebounding from the economic impacts of the pandemic as counties ""work together to build a new economic model"". ""It is clear that multilateralism is the best answer to the problems that we face today,"" he told other world leaders in attendance at Rome's Nuvola Convention Centre. ""In many ways, it is the only possible answer. From the pandemic to climate change to fair and equitable taxation, going it alone is simply not an option."" But he said the vast gulf in vaccination rates between affluent and poor countries threatens the recovery, noting about 70 per cent of citizens in wealthier countries have received at least one dose while the figure is just three per cent in poor countries, a disparity Draghi termed ""morally unacceptable"". Proving they can find common ground, on the first day of the conference leaders agreed to support a unified 15 per cent tax on multinationals, a move targeting global corporations and particularly tech giants  including Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple  that move operations to low-tax countries. ""This is more than just a tax deal  it's diplomacy reshaping our global economy and delivering for our people,"" said US President Biden. The new rules also aim to put an end to decades of tax competition between governments to attract foreign investment. ""There are good things to report here,"" said outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel. ""The world community has agreed on minimum taxation of companies. That is a clear signal of justice in times of digitalization."" In its final communique at the end of the conference, the G20 said it supports a target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, but the firm details on how to do that are scant. And instead of setting a clear date for all countries to reach ""carbon zero"" when the level of GHG produced and removed is equal \- the final communique said it should be reached ""by or around mid-century"". The statement from G20 members agreed to stop funding new dirty coal plants abroad by the end of this year and reaffirmed the previously unmet commitment for $100 billion yearly for developing countries to battle climate change. And in the fight against the pandemic, leaders vowed to support the WHO's goal of vaccinating at least 40 per cent of the world's population by the end of this year and 70 per cent by the middle of 2022 by boosting the supply of vaccines in developing countries and removing supply and financing constraints. While lacking the muscle many wanted, the summit perhaps had a sanguine conclusion. On a sunny day, participants absorbed the beauty of Rome, likely embracing the sublime that humanity stands to lose on this planet if it doesn't change its ways. Maybe the most inspiring act was a display of hope as world leaders stood together at the Trevi Fountain and tossed a special one euro coin over their shoulders into the Baroque masterpiece. Intended as a playful counterpoint to a sober summit, it hints that a little stroke of luck would be most helpful.

The official also said the mega event shows that countries can put their differences aside and work together. ""Expo is a great symbol of unity,"" he said. Reflecting on the far-reaching impact of the pandemic, the 76th UNGA President noted how, over the last 18 months, the world has ""seen humanity suffer"". ""People have lost their loved ones and jobs. They have been in depression The opening up of Expo 2022 gives a very clear message of hope to humanity that with vaccination and proper protocols, we can, in fact, start transmitting to a new normal,"" the 76th UNGA President said. The official noted how, after almost a year of virtual diplomacy, the first in-person United Nations General Assembly could be held last week, thanks to vaccines and proper protocols. ""Vaccines are the way forward. And what is happening here and at the Expo gives us that assurance. Yes, it can be done. This is what my 'presidency of hope' is all about: moving forward in the right direction, with the promise that there is the possibility of a better tomorrow."" Shahid is in the UAE as part of a three-country visit that will also cover Maldives and Serbia. During his visit to the Expo 2020 venue on October 4 and 5, the UN official  who is also the Foreign Minister of Maldives  will take part in several events on climate change and biodiversity, the first thematic week held at the world fair. He said the UAE is a ""knowledge hub"" and a ""symbol of tolerance and humanity"". ""The UAE has taken the lead in science and technology and renewable energy; it has sent astronauts into space, and is the first Arab country that sent a mission to Mars,"" said the official. He added that the Expo, which has the participation of more than 200 countries, is also an apt platform to reinforce the message that no one is safe until everyone is safe. ""This minute virus has delivered a very strong message: only together can humanity survive. Because the virus does not discriminate the rich from the poor, or the north from the south, it has no borders. The only way to fight it is through vaccines,"" said Shahid. The UNGA President also said it is ""highly, highly unacceptable"" that, while many nations have started administering booster doses to their citizens, only three per cent of Africa or developing countries are vaccinated. The official is convening a high-level meeting in January at the United Nations to bring countries together, he said, because he ""sincerely believes"" that humanity has the capacity to vaccinate the entire world by the end of 2022. ""If we can't do that, then we have not learned the lesson that the pandemic has taught us: that no one is safe until everyone is safe. Let us not deceive ourselves; let us have the courage to transcend whatever difficulties we have, because only collectively will we survive."" ALSO READ: >> Covid-19: UAE makes push for vaccination for all On the Expo's focus on sustainability and how the world fair is bringing together thought leaders and decision makers, Shahid said he is confident that the mega fair will contribute in a ""very, very positive manner"" to the climate change issue.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE289","'Africa Oil Week' features key discussions to drive positive change to its energy sector amid huge representation from African market","November 10, 2021 Wednesday","Emirates News Agency (WAM) - Business (English)","DUBAI, 10th November, 2021 (WAM) -- Africa Oil Week (AOW) 2021 has turned out to be a platform for intense discussions and decision making for the future of Africa's energy sector through a series of keynote speeches, engaging panel discussions, National Energy Showcases and networking opportunities involving individuals and companies from all over the world that have a strong interest in the African market. Taken beyond the borders of the African continent and hosted in Dubai for the first time since its inception, the four-day event will conclude on 11th November. AOW will be held in its original destination of Cape Town next year. The event has witnessed attendance from more than 35 heads of government departments from the African continent and the Middle East and high-level delegations, including executives from some of the biggest global oil and gas companies. Day two of the event was packed with numerous engaging conversations and networking opportunities, bringing together stakeholders from across the energy value chain to host a progressive discussion around sustainable energy development for the continent. It featured representatives from organisations including Wood Mackenzie, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), Eni, ReconAfrica, EITI, Herbert Smith Freehills, TotalEnergies, Africa Oil Corp, Equinor, Tullow Oil, and Fugro, among others. Several National Energy Showcases were held as part of the event's agenda to attract investments into the African energy sector, where countries like Uganda, Kenya, Gabon, Mozambique, Djibouti, Eritrea, Mauritania, Senegal, and The Gambia showcased investment opportunities in their respective countries, represented by their governments. Over 24 National Energy Showcases will be hosted throughout the week, providing a dedicated investment platform for Ministers, NOCs, Utilities and Regulators to broker deals and meet new partners, where government stakeholders will present an in-depth analysis of their national energy strategies, including prospective asset and investment opportunities, geological data and analysis, bidding rounds and open tenders, fiscal and operating policies. Speaking on the sidelines of the event, Fafa Sanyang, the Minister of Energy & Petroleum, Republic of The Gambia, said, ""The Africa Oil Week is one of the most important global events now. It's at the forefront when it comes to promoting the African oil and energy sector. I have been attending the Africa Oil Week for seven years now, so I know this is a suitable event and correct platform to highlight the African energy sector. ""I'll be announcing the licensing round, so my speech will be around the importance of oil and gas in Africa and The Gambia. The revenue that we generate from oil and gas can help us accelerate our other energies and environmental issues,"" he added. Abdessalam Ould Mohamed Saleh, Minister of Petroleum, Mines & Energy Islamic Republic of Mauritania, explained, ""With a large number of ministers and representatives of big oil companies and others, the AOW 2021 is an opportunity to exchange on various important and hot topics, in particular energy transition. We are just out of the COP26 , so I think it's fantastic to exchange perspectives with our African counterparts. We are having a really good week, and it's also excellent to hear from the oil companies from various perspectives. This is a unique opportunity for all the people who matter to get together, and from that perspective, the Africa Oil Week has been a great experience. I would invite all the ministers to this platform.' 'Hopefully, this will happen again and again with more representation from African governments and more oil and gas companies because we need that exchange of experience between the international operators, national operators and between the African nations."" The event's second day started with a powerful opening address by the Hon. Thomas Camara, the Minister of Mines, Petroleum & Energy, C\'f4te d'Ivoire, followed by a speech on 'Reimagining the African Upstream by Wood Mackenzie, which explored how the industry has responded to a changing market landscape, identifying opportunities for new players and high-value assets on the horizon, besides analysing the macro-effects of the global energy transition on the African upstream. One of the most dominant panel for the day was the 'Energy Transition Policies for a Changing Landscape: Stimulating National Economic Growth and Investment', which featured ministers from the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, the Republic of Ghana, Republic of Uganda, and C\'f4te d'Ivoire. The panel included comprehensive discussions on the renewed pressure on fossil fuel-dependent African governments to improve their fiscal and regulatory terms and explore new industries or policies to diversify their economies. Towards the end of day two, the EITI convened a closed, high-level, invite-only Africa Energy Dialogue that included discussions around critical factors that will drive the transition to a sustainable, decarbonised economy. The dialogue aimed to provide policymakers with an opportunity to exchange ideas on emerging trends and critical questions on achieving sustainable energy transition, the role of the extractive sector in revenue generation, developing policies to attract quality investment, and how can governments engage in a constructive public debate to bring about sustainable reforms, among others. With the UAE's investments in Africa reaching $5.64 billion in recent years, AOW will serve as a platform to fuel future collaborations and partnerships that can result in additional high-value deals in the energy sector. In a keynote address, Suhail Al Mazrouei, Minister of Energy and Infrastructure in the UAE, emphasised the UAE's long-standing ties with African nations and highlighted the country's position as an emerging global financial hub. Catering to Africa's energy needs Over the next couple of days, AOW will include a power-packed agenda with discussions on key topics like energy transition and energy access, policies and regulations in the market, green economy, ESG practices in the sector, onshore exploration, the role of digitalisation and technology in Africa's future energy mix, opportunities, and challenges in the sector in the post-pandemic world, achieving a clean and competitive energy future for the continent, among others. Wamkele Keabetswe Mene, Secretary-General, Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), said, ""It is an honour to be a part of AOW this year as the event is being held in Dubai, UAE. The host country has gained a global financial and economic hub with a rich oil and gas history. Through strategic discussions and collaborations, we hope to utilise the nation's expertise to help us in our united drive to eradicate energy poverty as part of the African Union 2063 and boost trade in the energy sector. We are certain that our talks with heads of governments from Africa and the UAE will facilitate the development of the local market and improve Africa's competitiveness both in its markets and globally, while also attracting quality foreign direct investment."" Nicolas Terraz, President Exploration and Production and member of the Executive Committee of TotalEnergies, who attended the event with a delegation of 40 officials, said, ""It was a pleasure to speak at the Africa Oil Week 2021. As one of Africa's biggest oil producers, TotalEnergies remains committed to exploration in Africa."" Besides discussing the impact of digitalisation in the oil and gas sector, the event serves as an ideal platform for experts to design an economic blueprint for developing the African energy sector. It will also help governments and key organisations formulate their approach towards achieving a clean energy future for the continent, thus enabling the transition to a green economy. \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE290","Race is on to limit extreme weather impact on most vulnerable: says UN chief on World Humanitarian Day","August 20, 2021 Friday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","NEW YORK, 20th August, 2021 (WAM) -- As the global aid community marked World Humanitarian Day on Thursday, UN chief Ant?nio Guterres paid tribute to all those who help people in need and urged support for the day's #TheHumanRace campaign, which aims to protect the most vulnerable people from the climate emergency. ""Humanitarian workers are here to help the world's most vulnerable people when disaster strikes,"" the Secretary-General said. ""But around the world, aid workers face growing threats. In the past 20 years, shootings, kidnappings, and other attacks on humanitarian organizations have increased tenfold. This year alone, at least 72 humanitarian workers have been killed in conflict zones."" This year's campaign for World Humanitarian Day - #TheHumanRace - underscores how climate extremes are wreeaking havoc across the world and overwhelming frontline responders. Mr. Guterres warned that the climate emergency ""is a race we are losing. But it's a race we can and must win."" Hosted on exercise platform Strava, participants are asked to clock 100 minutes of exercise for the World Humanitarian Day campaign. ""They can run, roll, ride, walk, swim, kick or hit a ball, each action will count towards helping us carry our message to world leaders when they meet at the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in November,"" said UN humanitarian coordinating office, OCHA, which organisd the campaign. The UN system across the world commemorated the day solemnly and words of support for the families of aid workers injured or killed while helping others. In Switzerland, UN Geneva Director-General Tatiana Valovaya and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet laid a wreath in memory of the fallen, against the backdrop a UN flag all-but-obliterated by the 2003 suicide bombing of the Canal Hotel in Baghdad, where 22 UN staff lost their lives. Noting with concern the fast-evolving situation in Afghanistan where more than 18 million people need emergency assistance, Ms. Valovaya insisted that aid workers would ""remain faithful to their mission of providing vital services to affected communities"". Ms. Bachelet paid tribute to the ""courage and commitment"" of all those who had been killed in the service of human right, saying ""our work breaks down hatred and violence. We are creating better, more resourceful societies \- where fewer tragedies occur \- but when they do, we equip people to surmount them."" Insisting that climate change is the ""defining issue of our times', the UN migration agency (IOM) pointed to the global experience of extreme temperatures, rising sea levels, drought and storms. For World Humanitarian Day 2021, IOM Director-General Antonio Vitorino urged the international community to focus on the vulnerable populations worst-hit by climate change \- and the many ""climate migrants"" that will likely be forced away from their communities. ""Last year, more than half of all new displacements worldwide were due to weather-related disasters,' Mr. Vitorino said. ""Millions lost their homes, access to food and water and their entire livelihoods due to worsening and more frequent climate hazards.' With additional pressures on humanitarian aid delivery created by the COVID-19 pandemic, the IOM chief underscored how frontline workers were stretched even further than before. ""The climate emergency is a race against time,' he said, urging Governments, the private sector and concerned citizens to help scale up emergency preparedness and resilience building, along with climate change adaptation and mitigation. \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE291","KT Long Read: The Attenborough effect on plastic pollution","December 9, 2021 Thursday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","One of the key aspects of Media Studies I used to teach during my previous life in academia is 'media effects': the idea that the media can influence people's behaviour, attitudes and actions. But the degree of that influence, as well as who is most impacted, when, how and why, has been the subject of much debate among scholars for nearly a century; for example, does violence on television and films lead to violence in society? The jury is still out, but there is some consensus that the 'media effects' need not be overt  they can be subtle, whose influence on action and behaviour may not be clear immediately. I did not have to look far to find a good example of 'media effects': my home. At one point, I was closely following the documentary series Blue Planet (2001) and Blue Planet II (2017) on BBC, marvelling at their production values and the less known world of issues facing oceans and endangering marine life, narrated brilliantly by the iconic natural historian David Attenborough. One evening, while unpacking after returning from the supermarket, I realised the extent of packaging that came with items of everyday use: it almost filled the kitchen bin. Almost every item, particularly vegetables and other food items, came in attractive plastic packaging. I looked around the kitchen and the house, and saw how widespread plastic is present, and recalled episodes in Blue Planet II that graphically showed how plastic pollution kills and endangers marine life and ultimately affects the ecosystem. The documentary's 'effect' on me was clear: I soon changed shopping habits, from the supermarket to farmers' market stalls, bought plastic goods to the bare minimum, and generated less waste for the local council's bin collection, from one black bin bag in a week to one every three weeks, if not longer. Since plastic cannot be recycled in full and remains a major challenge, who knows where the discarded packaging will end up? Damage to environment I was not alone to experience the 'Attenborough Effect'. The Blue Planet series was watched across the globe and clearly helped raise awareness of how human anthropogenic activity puts marine life and the environment in danger. Much outrage was expressed about plastic pollution after the series was broadcast. It was suddenly a hot topic and people who had never done it before started taking reusable jute, cloth and other bags to supermarkets and grocery stores, refusing plastic packaging. Several surveys showed that the vast majority of people who watched the series changed their shopping habits, if not lifestyles. The series was seen by millions across China, particularly Blue Planet II, which reportedly slowed the country's Internet at the time. When Theresa May visited Beijing as prime minister in 2018, she presented President Xi Jinping with a Blue Planet box-set, with a special message from Attenborough. As May says, ""We look back in horror at some of the damage done to our environment in the past and wonder how anyone could have thought that, for example, dumping toxic chemicals untreated into rivers was ever the right thing to do. In the UK alone, the amount of single-use plastic wasted every year would fill 1,000 Royal Albert Halls."" Delighted with Blue Planet's impact, Attenborough says: ""We hoped that Blue Planet II would open people's eyes to the damage that we are doing to our oceans and the creatures that live in them. I've been absolutely astonished at the result that that programme has had. I never imagined there would be quite so many of you who would be inspired to want change. The strength of response has not gone unnoticed in the corridors of power, or in business boardrooms. The actions of any just one of us may seem to be trivial and to have no effect. But the knowledge that there are thousands, hundreds of thousands of people who are doing the same thing  that rally does have an effect. I think we're all shifting our behaviour, I really do. I think we are changing our habits, and the world is waking up to what we've done to the planet. It is high time we turn our attention fully to one of the most pressing problems of today  averting the plastic pollution crisis."" The good, bad and ugly of plastic Plastic itself is incredibly useful. It has an excellent strength-to-weight ratio; it is durable and inexpensive, making it the material of choice for most disposable medical tools, equipment and packaging. The big problem is single-use plastics and the quantities in which they are used. A plastic bag, for example, is used on average for a short duration, but could take 100 to 300 years to fragment. But the British Plastics Federation's (BPF) position is that single-use plastics also have an important role to play in modern life. It contends that plastics packaging saves resources and, ""it is lighter, uses less energy and produces less greenhouse gas emissions than alternatives"". According to the BPF, the main benefits of plastic packaging are: resource efficient, safe, hygienic, lightweight, secure, durable and versatile. But despite much innovation and advances in recycling technology, a big question mark remains; not all plastics can be recycled, including some resins. Even for some plastics that can be partly recycled, the process can use a lot of energy, and plastic cannot be recycled indefinitely, unlike glass or aluminium. Every time plastic is recycled, its quality decreases, so on average a plastic product can only be recycled two to three times before it is no longer used. As Prime Minister Boris Johnson remarked before the COP26 summit in Glasgow, sparking a row with campaigners, recycling plastic ""doesn't work"" and ""is not the answer"" to threats to global oceans and marine wildlife. Reusing plastics ""doesn't begin to address the problem"", he said, suggesting that instead ""we've all got to cut down our use of plastic"". A large number of experts, organisations and governments across the globe are engaged in dealing with plastic pollution, producing voluminous reports and research papers. The figures are stark: every day approximately 8 million pieces of plastic pollution find their way into oceans; 12 million tonnes of plastic are poured into the ocean every year; scientists have recently discovered microplastics embedded deep in the Arctic ice; plastics consistently make up 80 per cent of all marine debris studied; there may now be around 5.25 trillion macro and microplastic pieces floating in the open ocean, weighing up to 269,000 tonnes; 100,000 marine mammals and turtles and 1 million sea birds are killed by marine plastic pollution annually; approximately 5,000 items of marine plastic pollution have been found per mile of beach in the UK; 90 per cent of plastic is produced from feedstock obtained from fossil oil and gas; producing one tonne of plastic generates up to 2.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide; plastic production has been forecast to grow by 60 per cent by 2030 and to treble by 2050; and less than a third of all plastic in the UK is recycled. ALSO READ: The Covid-19 pandemic's demand for single use plastic medical equipment has added to the pollution, as new research in the American academic journal PNAS shows. More than eight million tonnes of pandemic-associated plastic waste has been generated globally, with more than 25,000 tonnnes entering the global ocean. Most of the plastic is from medical waste generated by hospitals that dwarfs the contribution from personal protection equipment and online shopping package material. The research found that hospital waste represents the bulk of the global discharge (73 per cent), which calls for better management of medical waste. Warriors of plastic pollution Remedial steps across the globe may be small given the scale of the problem, but check out several urban areas and you see groups of volunteers of all ages picking up plastic litter from parks, woods, waterways and roads, collecting and depositing it in centres for recycling. I often find such groups along the picturesque Thames Path, Richmond Park and elsewhere in London, particularly on weekends, including elderly men and women wearing aprons, with a black bin bag in one hand and a litter-grabbing stick in the other, chatting and joking among themselves at what they find. ""We pick up all kinds of plastic stuff, and I mean all kinds,"" says Jane Arthurs, a resident of Putney, with a smile. Similar groups of people can be seen at various beaches across Britain, spaces where a large number of people gather, particularly during the summer, and usually leave behind mountains ofplastic. But things are beginning to change, as Attenborough notes. The Marine Conservation Society found in a new survey that the amount of waste washing up on the UK's beaches is falling. Volunteers found 385 pieces of litter for every 100 metres of beach on average, down from 425 in 2020 and 558 in 2019. Single-use plastic bags have fallen from a high of 13 for every 100 metres in 2013 to just three in 2021. Plastic cotton bud sticks dropped out of the top 10 most common types of rubbish following a ban in Scotland in 2019 and in England in 2020. Wet wipes have consistently featured in the top 10 most common items on Scottish beaches, while levels of PPE found this year were similar to 2020, when masks were made mandatory across the UK. Lizzie Prior, Beachwatch Manager at MCS, says: ""The ongoing downward trend we're seeing in litter levels on UK beaches is a positive sign that the actions we're taking at a personal, local and national level are working. But we can't sit back and relax, now is the time for even more ambitious action."" Another example is the success of the UK government imposing a charge for single-use plastic bags in supermarkets and retailers. There was a 95 per cent drop in the use of such bags when a charge of 5 pence per bag was levied in 2015, which was raised to 10 pence in May this year. The average person now buys only four single use bags in a year from the supermarkets, compared with 140 in 2014, and there is much pressure on supermarkets to cut packaging. Since the introduction of the charge, retailers have donated over \£3150 million to charity, volunteering, the environment, and the health sectors. As Environment Minister Rebecca Pow says: ""The introduction of the 5 pence charge has been a phenomenal success, driving down sales of harmful plastic bags in supermarkets by a remarkable 95 per cent. We know we must go further to protect our natural environment and oceans, which is why we are now extending this charge to all businesses. A plastic packaging tax is to be introduced from April 2022 for products that do not have at least 30 per cent recycled content."" Prasun Sonwalkar is a journalist based in London.

This comes as the Government pledged to part-fund Siemens Gamesa's \£3186m upgrade to its site at Hull's Alexandra Dock, via a grant from its 'Offshore Wind Manufacturing Investment Support Scheme'. The project promises to bring up to 200 extra green sector jobs to the area and will help with the continued rollout and development of offshore wind farms around the country's shores. In turn, this will support the UK's 2050 'net zero' carbon targets and could lead to increased production of clean renewable energy and even subsequent cheaper energy bills in the long run. Want to go greener with your energy? Find the best deals in your area now Setting a positive example for other nations The potential of the plant's expansion was praised by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and he alluded to it being a positive example for other nations to look towards with their sustainability. He said: ""The Humber region embodies the UK's green industrial revolution, with new investment into developing the next generation of wind turbines set to create new jobs, export opportunities and clean power across the country. ""With less than 100 days to go until the climate summit Cop26 , we need to see more countries embracing new technologies, building green industries and phasing out coal power for a sustainable future."" This was echoed by Clark MacFarlane, Siemens Gamesa's UK managing director, who said: ""Our investment in our existing offshore blade factory, logistics, and harbour facilities in Hull has been a key driver of the growth of the UK's world-leading offshore wind industry."" This 'growth' is now set to become even more substantial as the new turbines will be used to supply and expand projects such as the new offshore wind 'Hornsea Two' development, located near the plant off the Yorkshire coast. When finished, the 1.4-gigawatt farm will be the world's largest offshore wind provider, powering upwards of 1.3 million homes with clean renewable energy. Start going green today The promise of increased production of renewables, additional jobs and cheaper energy bills is of course something very positive to look forward to, but it will be several years before the expansion fulfils its potential. However, if you want to reduce your energy bills and go greener now, you can carry out an online energy comparison to find and switch to a new energy provider. All you need to do is use an energy comparison service and you'll see the best energy deals in your area that feature renewables or which have a greener fuel mix.

The summit, held under the theme 'Galvanising Action for a Sustainable Recovery' brought together many prominent speakers from across the globe, in addition to dignitaries and representatives from government organisations, academicians, experts and the media. HE Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Vice Chairman of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, MD & CEO of Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA), and Chairman of WGES, announced the Dubai Declaration 2021 at the conclusion of WGES 2021, expressing his gratitude and appreciation to His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, for his patronage of the Summit. He also thanked His Highness Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Chairman of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, for his presence at the opening ceremony of the summit and to everyone who contributed to the success of this summit. ""The summit's 7th edition was held amid exceptional events and activities under the theme 'Galvanising Action for a Sustainable Recovery' and in conjunction with the historic Expo 2020 Dubai under the theme 'Connecting Minds, Creating the Future'. These two themes are consistent with the UAE's efforts to promote innovation and develop creative solutions in support of the country's sustainable development goals and economic growth across all areas. The UAE has been a pioneer and a leading nation in adopting innovative solutions to advance its transformation into a green economy. Thanks to the directives and tireless efforts of HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Dubai has sustained its bid to be the global capital of the green economy. Dubai has been at the forefront of enhancing international cooperation to solve global challenges, especially those related to climate change, the environment and achieving a secure and sustainable future for all. The summit witnessed high-level dialogues, panel discussions, and seminars on ways to develop innovative sustainable solutions and stimulate innovation to support sustainable development. These were centred around the Summit's four main themes: Youth; Innovation and Smart Technologies; Green Economy and Policies; and Green Finance,"" said Al Tayer. ""In line with the vision of our wise leadership, we have a clear strategy and specific goals to increase the share of clean and renewable energy in Dubai's energy mix. Within this direction of our government, we have launched pioneering projects and initiatives to diversify clean energy sources. These include different clean and renewable energy sources and technologies such as solar photovoltaic systems, Concentrated Solar Power (CSP), green hydrogen production using solar power to be a new clean energy source in the future, pumped-storage water technology at Hatta hydroelectric power plant, and studying electricity generation technology from wind power. We will continue to work hard to achieve these ambitious goals. One of our key projects is the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, the largest single-site solar park in the world based on the Independent Power Producer (IPP) model, with a planned capacity of 5,000 megawatts (MW) by 2030 and investments of up to AED 50 billion ($13.6 billion). The Solar Park's projects constitute one of the key pillars of the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050, which aims to provide 75% of Dubai's total power capacity from clean energy sources by 2050. The UAE has served as a global model of resilience in times of crisis. This is evident in its immediate successful response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Thanks to our wise leadership, the country has been steadily recovering from this global health crisis, with our nation emerging stronger and more resilient,"" added Al Tayer. Dubai Declaration  We recognise that climate change is an urgent global threat with impacts that reach beyond the environment agenda to include economic, social, and environmental challenges.  We acknowledge that sustainable and green recovery should steer our efforts to rebuild the economy after the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to limit the temperature increase to well below 2C aiming for 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, in line with the Paris Agreement ""COP21"".  We encourage inclusive partnerships in which governments, businesses and civil society are part of collective action, for current and future generations.  We encourage further support towards low carbon transition by developing a strategy and a roadmap for green hydrogen in Dubai.  The World Green Economy Organization (WGEO) will continue as the leading platform and partnership enabler for international cooperation, knowledge-sharing and technology transfer between developed and developing countries, taking account of the special needs and circumstances of Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States, aiming to promote design and implementation of green economy policies at national, regional and global levels.  We look forward to the fulfillment of commitments to the goals of the Paris Agreement, while rendering our full support for a successful UNFCCC COP26 to be held in November 2021 in Scotland, UK.  We will coordinate and align the regional response to climate change for an effective implementation of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and other national climate strategies and policies through UNFCCC WGEO Regional Collaboration Centre in Dubai, during MENA Climate Week 2022. This will coincide with the next World Green Economy Summit here in Expo 2020 Dubai in March 2022. Source: Media Office, Government of Dubai, UAE Load-Date: \~October 8, 2021 \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE294","Organisations have to diversify renewable energy portfolios","October 5, 2021 Tuesday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","Wetex 2021 and Dubai Solar have attracted the participation of more than 1,200 companies from 55 countries, with 61 sponsors and 10 country pavilions Organisations across the UAE and the Middle East have to look into actively diversifying their renewable energy portfolios in order to tackle the challenges posed by climate change, experts said at the 23rd edition of the Water, Energy, Technology, and Environment, Exhibition (Wetex 2021) and Dubai Solar Show. Organised by the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (Dewa), the event is being held under the directives of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, and under the patronage of Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, chairman of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy and chairman of the Expo 2020 Dubai Higher Committee. Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum inaugurated the event on October 5, 2021 at the Dubai Exhibition Centre at Expo 2020 Dubai under the theme 'At the Forefront of Sustainability'. The exhibition has attracted the participation of more than 1,200 companies from 55 countries, with 61 sponsors and 10 country pavilions. Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum said that the exhibition reflects Dewa's successful efforts to promote the transition towards using clean and renewable energy for major projects in collaboration with the private sector. Organising the exhibition this year at Expo 2020 Dubai underlines the importance of sustainability, which is one of the UAE's top priorities, he said. ""This aligns with Dubai and the UAE's efforts to host the most sustainable world expo ever. Sustainability is ingrained in everything we've been doing - from buildings and construction to establishing a lasting legacy long after Expo 2020 Dubai is over."" Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, MD and CEO of Dewa, and founder and chairman of Wetex and Dubai Solar Show, said that the events are important for organisations and investors in the water, environment, oil, gas, conventional and renewable energy, and green development sectors from the region and the world to showcase their solutions and products, make deals, build partnerships, and promote green technologies. ""This is especially important after announcing the 'Projects of the 50' through which the UAE aims to enhance public-private partnerships and provide promising investment opportunities in the country,"" he said. Speaking to the media on the sidelines of the event, he spoke about Dubai's recovery from the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic, especially the heartening performance of the retail and F&B sectors. ""Life is slowly returning back to normal across Dubai. Over the next five years, we will have Dh86 billion investments in power and water spread across various projects such as substation expansion and distribution to support recovery and growth."" He also revealed that Dewa was exploring other alternative forms of energy. ""We are studying Hydrogen now; already we have gone commercial with it and are linked to the grid. In the future, we are going to tender for Hydrogen energy, because we believe that Hydrogen is the future. We have to have a strategy ready first; after that, we will lay down a road map to ensure that we are on the right track. However, this is all provided that the cost of Hydrogen is competitive to solar."" Similarly, Dr. Mostafa Al Guezeri, managing director for the UAE, Gulf, Near East & Pakistan region at Hitachi ABB Power Grids, noted that this edition of Wetex comes at a crucial time for businesses anticipating a post-pandemic economic growth surge. He said that this year's physical exhibition is a testimony of the tenacity of the UAE in weathering the pandemic and normalising the situation to pave the way for business and economic growth. ""Our key focus this year is on sustainability and digitalisation, as well as demonstrating our versatile range of technology and electricity solutions that will reinforce a carbon-neutral future,"" he said. ""The solutions and services are aimed at helping customers overcome complexity, increase efficiency, and accelerate the shift towards a carbon-neutral energy future."" Sustainability for Hitachi, he said, begins ""at home across our facilities"", where the company has taken various steps to reduce their carbon footprint. ""We recently set out Sustainability 2030, our new strategic plan and commitment towards a sustainable energy future with our electric solutions supporting the four key pillars of planet, people, peace, and partnerships contributing to creating social, environmental, and economic values. Electricity will be the backbone of the entire energy system and solar energy will be the one of the most competitive renewable energy in the coming decade, contributing to a carbon-neutral future."" Al Guezeri also highlighted the importance of knowledge sharing to create effective solutions to current challenges, a topic which it will highlight at the upcoming 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) in Glasgow. ""Education and sharing knowledge benefits the whole ecosystem and we have always been dedicated to the mission of sustainability set by the wise leadership of the UAE.""

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE295","Lighting the path to an equitable renewable energy transition in Small Island Developing States","October 5, 2021 Tuesday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","DUBAI, 5th October, 2021 (WAM) -- A lively debate on transforming energy in Small Island Developing States (SIDS), and how the developed world should do more to facilitate this transition, took place on day three of Expo 2020's Climate and Biodiversity Week. The ministerial-level event held on Tuesday at Expo 2020's Nexus for People and Planet was co-curated by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD) and Masdar. Mariam Hareb Almheiri, UAE Minister of Climate Change and Environment, urged everyone to play a part in the energy transition: ""The solutions we develop must be inclusive, and should engage women and youth. Right now, we're in the middle of a global energy transition: renewable energy has undergone a huge cost reduction and become highly commercially viable. Additionally, new technologies are evolving quickly, and we must capitalise on that. We look forward to working with you on new renewable clean energy projects that will benefit local communities and allow them to actively contribute to the energy transition. An inclusive and just energy transition is an absolute necessity."" Francesco La Camera, Director General, IRENA, said: ""We come together at a critical moment in history: a crisis that once seemed far away is now on our doorstep,"" while also praising Expo 2020 for being a ""melting pot for ideas, culture and innovation, and the fitting location for addressing the pressing issues of our time."" With the target of net zero by 2050 high on everyone's agenda, La Camera stressed that aside from the additional USD60 billion needed for climate control, the world has to work hand-in-hand to bring together those key stakeholders who have championed clean energy transition by developing renewable solutions. Aminath Shauna, Minister of Climate Change, Environment and Technology, Maldives, said that island nations, including her own, were the most vulnerable to climate change. ""We depend entirely on imports, so we need to transition to an economy that is fuelled by sunshine and renewables. Although we have sunshine in abundance, we don't have the land needed to install large-scale solar panels, which is why we're also looking at renewable sources for energy. We need access that is affordable, accessible and long-term; I don't think this is a very big ask."" The crux lies in an effective electricity roadmap that reduces greenhouse emissions while ensuring that access to energy \- a basic human right \- is not at risk. ""Energy poverty is a firm part of the energy-transition journey. I welcome the conversations today, and I welcome the UAE's initiatives in policy and funding to allow for implementation on-ground for vital energy projects, ensuring that no-one is left behind,"" said Damilola Ogunbiyi, CEO of Sustainable Energy for All and Co-Chair of UN Energy. The numbers, she said, speak volumes. ""There are 759 million people with no access to electricity, and 2.6 billion have no access to clean cooking. Many of our economies are based on diesel or petrol."" But Ogunbiyi insisted that developing countries do have solid, well-thought-out plans for transition, and yet in spite of this were still being denied financing. She said: ""The policies are in place, so let's stop talking and let's start acting. We have to demand this going into COP26 . This is a crisis."" Highlighting the stark truth that island states contribute the least to climate change, but are disproportionately affected, Ogunbiyi added: ""I don't like the notion that these countries are asking for handouts, because they're not the ones that have caused the problems. You can't blame countries for using fossil fuels if you don't give them a clean offer. We have to be unapologetic that we are putting an emphasis on the people who need it the most \- and the UAE has an opportunity to help."" While there were different views regarding access to financing, Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi, CEO Masdar, agreed that the UAE was in a unique position to be at the forefront of the renewable movement. He said: ""After 15 years, Masdar has become one of the world leaders in renewable energy. No-one cared to talk about renewable energy back then, especially in a country where the energy is based on fossil fuel. But change is a must, and today our region is accelerating renewables. In 2019, we built the largest 10 megawatt solar farm in the region. Two years later, we are developing two-gigawatt projects \- that's how far we've come."" Affirming that the financing for developing island countries was available, Al Ramahi said it was just a matter of providing the investors with the right environment and the right opportunities: ""Masdar has already worked with 11 countries in the Pacific, at least three in the Indian Ocean, and three in the Caribbean, with seven projects under construction and seven in development \- we're providing both the funds and the technical support, this is key. We have to work hard with the host countries to deploy these opportunities and make them a reality."" Binu Parthan, Regional Head of IRENA, told Expo News: ""Today has been important, because foreign ministers and key delegates have articulated the urgency of time in addressing climate action. Solutions for addressing the climate change problems do exist, and finance needs to be made accessible."" \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE296","Saudi sets sights on net zero","October 26, 2021","Middle East Oil & Gas Monitor","The Saudi state and its main energy arm this week set ambitious net-zero targets but oil will remain key to the Kingdom's economy. What: Riyadh anticipates reaching net zero by 2060, with Aramco to cut Scope 1 and 2 emissions from its operations to the same level by 2050. Why: The move stops short of including Scope 3 emissions, which Aramco has not yet begun reporting. What Next: Blue hydrogen will feature heavily for Aramco and the Kingdom's energy minister said that the Jafurah gas field will be leveraged to generate hydrogen. Saudi Arabia this week announced that it would reduce emissions from the Kingdom to `net zero' by 2060, with oil firm Saudi Aramco also setting an ambitious target for emissions. Aramco's target is to reach `net zero' Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, suggesting that both goals will rely heavily on the offshoring of emissions, with Riyadh set to remain reliant on crude oil exports for decades to come. Saudi's improbable target was announced by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MbS) during the Kingdom's Saudi Green Initiative Forum ahead of the COP26 climate conference. He said that 450mn trees would be planted across Saudi Arabia amid efforts to rehabilitate large areas of degraded land by 2030 and the mitigation of 200mn tonnes of emissions. Meanwhile, a statement released by Aramco disclosed the company's ""ambition to achieve net-zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions across its wholly owned operated assets by 2050"". It added: ""This ambition is an important part of the company's focus on long-term shareholder value creation by advancing its goals through a company-wide approach [to] sustainability."" Scope 1 and 2 emissions cover direct emissions from company-owned or controlled sources as well as indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating and cooling consumed by company. Meanwhile, Scope 3 includes all other indirect emissions that occur throughout the company's value chain. The omission of Scope 3 is unsurprising, as Aramco has not yet reported these indirect emissions in the three years since it began external reporting. The company did, however, expand the reporting boundaries of Scope 2 in 2019 to include affiliates under Aramco's control, which include Saudi Aramco Jubail Refinery (SASREF), Motiva in the US and Netherlands-based chemicals specialist Arlanxeo. However, most of the company's extensive downstream slate is not included in Scope 1 and 2 reporting and it remains to be seen whether Scope 3 emissions will be covered in Aramco's long-awaited Sustainability Report when it is published in mid-2022. President and CEO Amin Nasser said: ""The road ahead will be complex, as the world's transition to a more sustainable energy future will require collective action and major technological breakthroughs. But we remain focused on delivering reliable and affordable energy, investing for the long term as our efforts to further reduce emissions gain momentum."" Hydrogen hopes Aramco's strategic repositioning has been in the works for some time and despite the effort to reduce the emissions of its operations, hydrocarbons will remain firmly at the core of the business. This was highlighted during the Saudi Green Initiative Forum by Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, who said that the giant Jafurah unconventional gas basin would be leveraged to produce blue hydrogen as the country seeks to extend its leadership of the oil sector into hydrogen. ""We are the biggest adventurers when it comes to blue hydrogen,"" he said. Prince Abdulaziz added: ""We're putting our money where our mouth is on hydrogen. We have a terrific gas base in Jafurah we will use it to generate blue hydrogen."" Under its preliminary $110bn plans, Aramco intends to kick off production at Jafurah in early 2024 and achieve 2.2bn cubic feet (62mn cubic metres) per day of sales gas by 2036. It is also expected to produce around 550,000 barrels per day (bpd) of NGLs and condensates. The first phase is seen producing 1.1 bcf (31 mcm) per day of raw gas, which will be processed at a facility on-site. Aramco announced that it had received regulatory approval from the Ministry of Energy to proceed with the expansion of the Kingdom's unconventional gas production capabilities in February 2020. The main focus of the initiative is Jafurah, which holds an estimated 200 trillion cubic feet of gas (5.7 trillion cubic metres), around half of which is comprised of liquids. The field is Saudi Arabia's largest deposit of unconventional gas. The comments mark the first time either Aramco or Riyadh have put any flesh on the bones of loose plans to become a major player in the nascent hydrogen industry. In June, Aramco's chief technology officer Ahmad al-Khowaiter said: ""We're going to have a large share"" of the market. However, reiterating views aired during a company event in February, he added: ""The scale up isn't going to happen before 2030. We're not going to see large volumes of blue ammonia before then."" He added: ""From the time you make clear off-take agreements, you're talking about a five- to six-year capital cycle to invest in the production and conversion requirements ... You're talking about a pretty long timescale."" In February, he had said that Aramco doesn't ""see much growth in [the] market until 2030, when the infrastructure and policies will be in place. We think Japan and South Korea will be where the first hydrogen trading markets will begin in the end of 2020s, early 2030s."" With that said, the executive anticipates that Aramco may spend around $1bn to capture carbon for every 1mn tonnes of blue ammonia it produces, excluding the cost of gas production. The company has already dipped its toe into the emerging market with a pilot project alongside the Japan's Institute of Energy Economics (IEEJ) last year. In September, Aramco shipped its first cargo of blue ammonia to Japan to be used in zero-carbon power generation. The 40-tonne shipment was generated by Aramco and was made in collaboration with Saudi Arabian Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) and IEEJ. Aramco said that during the process of generating the ammonia, it had captured 50 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2). 30 tonnes will be used in methanol production at SABIC's Ibn-Sina facility, with the remainder to be used in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) at Aramco's `Uthmaniyah field. In a presentation, Aramco said that the production of blue ammonia had spanned the entire value chain, supporting the company's recent claims of investing in the circular economy. Natural gas was taken from `Uthmaniyah and converted to hydrogen at a dedicated facility in Jubail, with the CO2 captured at a nearby facility and returned to `Uthmaniyah and sent to Jubail Methanol Plant. Nitrogen was added to the hydrogen at the Jubail Ammonia Plant to create blue ammonia, which was then dispatched by sea to Japan, where it will be separated and used to power the 50-kW Koriyama micro gas turbine, the 2-MW Yokohama gas turbine and a co-firing boiler in Aioi. For Aramco, blue hydrogen and ammonia appear to be the perfect solution to the company's desire to reduce emissions while remaining relevant in a market that is demanding cleaner fuels. \"

His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed and Johnson also tackled several regional and international issues of mutual interest. This came during the UK Prime Minister's meeting with His Highness Sheikh Mohamed and his accompanying delegation in London. The UK Prime Minister welcomed the visit of His Highness Sheikh Mohamed to Britain and emphasised that ""it represents strong support for the development of relations between the two countries"". As the meeting commenced, His Highness Sheikh Mohamed extended his heartfelt condolences for Johnson and his family on the death of his mother. Johnson extended thanks and appreciation for His Highness Sheikh Mohamed's warm feelings. His Highness Sheikh Mohamed and the UK Prime Minister reviewed cooperation and the promising opportunities to enhance it in the investment, economic and trade fields and other vital sectors as part of the ambitious economic, trade and investment programme that the two countries agreed upon last year. The meeting touched on the latest COVID-19 pandemic developments, and the efforts to contain its humanitarian and economic repercussions and the importance of strengthening international solidarity during these circumstances to overcome this common global challenge. It also highlighted the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ), which will be hosted by the UK next November as well as its importance in advancing global efforts to address the climate change challenge. Moreover, the two sides exchanged views on regional and global issues of mutual interest and the current developments in the Middle East region and the Mediterranean and the efforts to find a peaceful solution to the ongoing conflicts. His Highness Sheikh Mohamed emphasised that the UAE attaches special importance to its relations with the UK, is keen on developing them, especially in the economic, trade, technological domains and others, as part of implementing the ""economic, trade and investment cooperation programme"" that the two countries agreed upon in December 2020. His Highness Sheikh Mohamed said, ""One of the most important aspects of our developmental projects for the next 50 years is promoting developmental partnerships with various countries of the world, especially with the UK."" He also stressed that Britain shares historic ties and strategic interests with the Arab Gulf region and the Middle East and has a significant role in ensuring their security and stability and dealing with their issues. The UK Prime Minister emphasised that his country attaches special importance to enhancing its ties with the UAE. He also extended thanks and appreciation for the UAE's support in evacuating UK citizens, and citizens of many other countries, from Afghanistan. His Highness Sheikh Mohamed and Johnson drew attention to the importance of the ""Partnership for the Future"", which the two sides agreed to establish, and which is based on two main pillars: driving sustainable prosperity and addressing global issues, in addition to using this partnership as a launch pad to develop new mechanisms that enhance trade, investment, innovation and enhance cooperation in areas including life sciences, innovation, energy, regional issues, illicit finance, education, security, development, culture, climate, health and food security. His Highness Sheikh Mohamed and the British Prime Minister welcomed the signing of a partnership agreement between Mubadala Investment Company and the UK Office for Investment (OfI), worth ?10 billion, which aims to expand the scope of the sovereign investment partnership between the two countries.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE298","UAE's SME landscape","October 31, 2021","Gulf Business","With an estimated windfall of more than $30bn in value add, Expo 2020 Dubai is forecast to have a significant impact not only on Dubai's economy but on that of the UAE and the wider Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region well into the future. In the year that the UAE celebrates the 50th anniversary of its formation as a federation, Dubai and the UAE will be front and centre of the world stage for business and innovation. This is also the year in which Dubai Plan 2021 and the UAE's Vision 2021 plan move closer to fruition \- ambitious targets, outlining optimistic and aspirational strategic goals for the economy, people and government. But what specific benefits can Expo 2020 bring, and how can it boost the SME landscape to help entrepreneurs in the UAE and beyond? BOOST TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT Expo 2020 Dubai is a big deal. This is the first time in its entire history that the event has been hosted in the MENA region. Being held amid the coronavirus pandemic, it will be the largest global gathering since 2019, with between 20 and 25 million visits expected over six months. In short, it will be a face-to-face celebration of the triumph of innovation and the power of human collaboration \- a chance to underscore the post-pandemic relevance of its three subthemes: opportunity, mobility and sustainability. This appeal is expected to bring in between $100bn and $150bn in foreign direct investment (FDI) across sectors such as financial services, tourism, hospitality, real estate and infrastructure, and construction. With the focus moving inevitably towards sustainability ( COP26 opens just weeks after Expo 2020 kicks off), the event will be a chance to show off the UAE's green credentials, as it invests heavily in renewable and sustainable energy and promotes green growth. Expo 2020 itself has a target to obtain 50 per cent of its energy requirement from renewables, including the first mega-sized application of integrated solar and photovoltaic generation. Entrepreneurs and business owners keen to take advantage of the greener landscape are thus more likely to see the UAE as a natural place to seek investment for green innovation technology. And the figures speak for themselves: despite the pandemic's negative impact on FDI flows, Dubai maintained high investor confidence in 2020, with total estimated FDI capital flows reaching Dhs24.7bn, not far off the Dhs28.6bn total for 2015. How could this benefit your SME? Even if you're not currently looking for inward investment, the greater the foreign investment interested in the UAE, the greater the economic boost to the region. The entire business ecosystem and economy will be positively affected, which means that SMEs here \- both local and international \- will see a boost in activity and business. International investors have long been attracted to Dubai because it represents an increasingly favourable destination for FDI. Major legislative steps have already been taken to promote Dubai as worthy of international investment; the 2016 bankruptcy law modernised the UAE's previously unpredictable insolvency laws. And a 2018 UAE investment law has, for the first time, allowed foreign equity ownership of up to 100 per cent of onshore UAE companies in certain strategic sectors. In addition, foreign investors see it as an ideal access point into regional markets. As the gateway between east and west, and within an eight-hour flight of two-thirds of the world's population, it presents an opportunity to gain access to more than 1.7 billion consumers in MENA, Pakistan and India. This further enhances Dubai's reputation as a global platform for trade and investment. As the world focuses on Dubai and the UAE, Expo 2020 will give the region a unique chance to showcase those advantages. INCREASE IN JOBS AND THE TALENT POOL Enhanced economic activity is expected to create nearly 300,000 new jobs in Dubai and throughout the UAE, and attract an entirely new talent pool. Some predict that Expo 2020 will have a significant impact on the wider region too, with 60 jobs being generated across the MENA region for every one created in the UAE. In total, up to 905,200 job-years are forecast to be supported by the Expo between 2013-2031 \- the equivalent to approximately 49,700 full-time-equivalent (FTE) jobs per annum. How could this benefit your SME? Enhanced economic activity will attract more talent to the UAE and create more business opportunities for SME owners and entrepreneurs. Expo 2020 has awarded 4,500 contracts, more than half of which have been won by SMEs, representing an investment of nearly Dhs5bn and guaranteeing some 12,600 job-years. In addition, entrepreneurs, startups and small businesses can take advantage of the government's District 2020 strategic partnerships with Dubai SME and the Mohammed Bin Rashid Innovation Fund, to pursue expansion through the District 2020 platform. During its legacy period (April 2022 to December 2031), Expo 2020 site will be redeveloped to further ease new business set-ups; over 80 per cent is planned to be retained for District 2020, and it will eventually provide a home for a mix of corporations and SMEs. District 2020's development is designed to embody the UAE's Vision 2021 by supporting sustainable economic development and creating a business ecosystem that underpins growth industries like transport, tourism, construction and education. NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES With several companies having opened offices in the UAE in the lead-up to the Expo, more business opportunities have been created and will continue to be created over the next six-eight months and beyond. How can we be so sure? Because, even without the added boost of a World Expo, the region has been relentlessly pushing an SME agenda to encourage growth. In the UAE, the government has, for many years, been championing small businesses, with Dubai SME offering support to entrepreneurs in all phases of development. Further aid has been available from agencies such as Dubai Future Accelerators, which helps entrepreneurs to use the city as a 'testbed for creating solutions to the global challenges of tomorrow'. Initiatives like these have, over the last few years, translated into tangible benefits for SME owners, with the UAE ranking 21st out of 190 in The World Bank's Doing Business 2018 report, jumping to 16th place in its 2020 ease of doing business ranking. In addition, government-backed accelerators like StartAd in Abu Dhabi, not to mention Abu Dhabi's own Khalifa Fund,have been helping to create a flourishing ecosystem to encourage SMEs to thrive. The massive influx of investment as a result of Expo 2020 can only enhance these opportunities further. How could this benefit your SME? With roughly 25 million visits expected at Expo 2020, startups and SMEs will enjoy significantly more exposure to potential investors, partners and collaborators. It's the perfect time to leverage your products and services, and a unique opportunity for enhanced networking in an environment where people are open and willing to engage. Expo 2020 presents business owners with a unique international business platform for marketing your business to an audience of local, regional, and global consumers and investors.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE299","Denmark supports UAE, US initiative on Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate","July 14, 2021 Wednesday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","By Binsal Abdulkader ABU DHABI, 14th July, 2021 (WAM) -- Denmark has put its weight behind a joint climate initiative of the UAE and the USA, according to a top Danish diplomat. ""Denmark is proud to support the United Arab Emirates' and the United States' Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate initiative along with several others,"" Franz-Michael S. Mellbin, Danish Ambassador to UAE and Qatar, told Emirates News Agency (WAM). The UAE and the USA, with support from the United Kingdom, Brazil, Denmark, Israel, Singapore, Australia, and Uruguay, announced the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for Climate) at President Biden's Leaders Summit on Climate on 23rd April 2021. It aims to increase and accelerate global agricultural innovation and research and development (R&D) over the next five years, to address climate change. The Initiative was unveiled during the remarks made by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, and Ruler of Dubai during the second day of the Leaders Summit on Climate, and leverages international cooperation on a vital challenge of global significance. The Danish envoy pointed out that Agriculture is a critical sector for the world, and more innovation is needed to successfully balance the difficult nexus between climate change, food security and sustainability. Denmark has very high ambitions for its own agricultural sector and has set a goal of reducing the sector's emissions with 0.5 million tonnes of CO2. This will be done by improving growth technologies such as more frequent leaching of manure, he said. The government is also investing in new technologies, such as pyrolysis and biorefining of grass, which may reduce CO2 emissions with as much as 5 million tonnes. ""Overall, we believe that the transition to climate-smart agriculture will benefit the sector in the long run,"" the envoy noted. ""Denmark looks forward to working with our partners to advance the AIM for Climate initiative and we hope more countries will join the initiative towards COP26 in Glasgow,"" the ambassador said. As announced earlier, AIM for Climate will address the principal challenges related to the agricultural sector and climate change, including emissions, food security and water security. The sector is currently responsible for 24 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions, and as the world's population continues to grow, innovations in efficient, productive farming techniques can reduce the sector's environmental impacts, make healthy food more available and create new economic opportunities, skills and jobs.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE300","G7 agrees to stop international funding of coal","May 26, 2021 Wednesday","Big News Network.com","LONDON, England: The G7 countries, representing the world's seven largest advanced economies, will stop funding coal projects that emit carbon by the end of 2021, the group agreed late last week. Representatives of the countries also agreed to end support for all fossil fuels. In a communique, the Group of Seven nations - the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan - plus the European Union, declared ""international investments in unabated coal must stop now"". ""(We) commit to take concrete steps towards an absolute end to new direct government support for unabated international thermal coal power generation by the end of 2021, including through Official Development Assistance, export finance, investment, and financial and trade promotion support,"" the countries said in their agreement. Alok Sharma, president of the COP26 climate summit, has made halting international coal financing a ""personal priority"" to help end the world's reliance on fossil fuels. He called on China to set out its ""near-term policies that will then help to deliver the longer-term targets and the whole of the Chinese system needs to deliver on what President Xi Jinping has set out as his policy goals"". The G7 statement also said that its member countries will ""work with other global partners to accelerate the deployment of zero-emission vehicles"", ""overwhelmingly"" decarbonising the power sector in the 2030s and moving away from international fossil fuel financing. The G7 countries repeated their commitment to the 2015 Paris Agreement goal to cap the rise in temperatures to as close as possible to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times. Some environmental groups urged the G7 to set a stricter timetable. Observers have noted that even if all environmental goals are met, there will still be 22 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide worldwide in 2050, which they claim would lead to a temperature increase of some 2.1C by 2100. \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE301","Ireland hosting two-day meeting of OECD development ministers","June 16, 2021 Wednesday","Big News Network.com","DUBLIN, Ireland - Development ministers from 29 OECD countries, including the UK, U.S., and EU states have joined convenors in Dublin, for a two-day meeting to discuss responses to a significant rise in global poverty linked to COVID-19. The largely virtual meeting, which is being run over Wednesday and Thursday of this week, is being chaired by Ireland's Minister of State for Overseas Development Colm Brophy (pictured). Against the backdrop of rising global poverty, due in large part to the effects of the pandemic and climate change, OECD ministers are discussing how overseas development aid can help shape effective global responses. ""I am conscious as we begin to see normality return that the pandemic will continue to impact on the lives of millions and millions of people in countries not as well off as our own, potentially for years to come. Jobs have been lost. Food is scarce. Children have had their education interrupted,"" Brophy said prior to the opening of the meeting. ""Many, particularly young girls, will never return to school. Instead, they may be forced into early marriage. Hard-won progress over the past twenty years is being reversed, just as the impact of climate change is being felt across the developing world."" ""That is why this week's meeting of ministers for international development from across the OECD is important. I look forward to encouraging an open discussion on how we can collectively respond to these challenges as donors, we can do much more working together than working separately,"" the Irish development minister said. The two-day meeting this week in Dublin is part of the Tidewater Conference initiative, an annual meeting of ministers from across OECD countries. Originally planned on being an in-person gathering, it will taking place virtually. Brophy is attending in Dublin's Mansion House together with Susanna Moorehead, chair of the OECD's Development Assistance Committee, with delegates from other countries joining virtually. The Tidewater Conference is an in-camera meeting, designed to be an open space for ministers to reflect and discuss challenges and potential solutions. The discussion on climate change will contribute to the UN COP26 summit to be held in Edinburgh this November. \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE302","UN body to begin releasing today climate report on global warming's impact","August 9, 2021 Monday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","GENEVA, 9th August, 2021 (WAM ) -- The UN's top scientific body on climate change will begin releasing on Monday its long-awaited new assessment on global warming's impact, three months before world leaders gather in Scotland to forge a new plan to limit global temperature increases. The Geneva-based Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will present the first of four reports in its latest assessment cycle, starting with an analysis of the stacks of climate studies since the last major evaluation seven years ago, German news agency dpa reported on Monday. That humans - through the burning of fossil fuels, intensive farming, deforestation, livestock breeding and pollution - are above all responsible for climate change is undisputed among scientists. Just how big that influence is will be laid out on Monday by the IPCC, which signals its level of confidence in scientific conclusions using labels such as likely, very likely, extremely likely and virtually certain. IPCC spokesman Jonathan Lynn said the assessment, which is the body's sixth since 1990, is getting into a cutting edge area of science, where we can increasingly say to what extent climate change is responsible for extreme weather events, disasters and so on happening around the world. The last comprehensive assessment was in 2013-14, and since then Earth has experienced six of the warmest years on record. Globally, the average surface temperature is about 1.2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and barrelling towards the 1.5-degree threshold, scientists say humans must stay at or below to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change. World leaders will meet at the COP26 Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, in November, in what is being described as the most important meeting on the climate crisis since the 2015 Paris summit. In the 2015 Paris climate accord, nations set a goal of staying below 2 degrees, and preferably to 1.5 degrees, by cutting greenhouse gas emissions. If not, the consensus is that extreme weather, including droughts and flooding, will become more common, sea levels will rise higher, Arctic ice will melt more swiftly, and many plants and animals will be unable to adapt. Human action was more tightly linked to climate change in each of the previous five IPCC assessments. Although the findings set off alarm bells among environmental campaigners and in some corridors of power, the world has continued to fall behind on its climate goals. But a slew of recent disasters has once again underscored the urgency of the crisis, from the wildfires and heatwaves scorching southern Europe and North America's west, to widespread flooding in China and Germany. The document is also set to offer forward-looking assessments of our possible future world given different emissions scenarios. The IPCC does not conduct its research, rather it summarises the state of scientific knowledge on climate change. The new assessment, which will be delivered in parts until 2022, involved 234 authors from 66 countries. Their findings are bundled for political decision-makers in a paper that the 195 member countries of the IPCC then approve. The second part of the IPCC\~assessment will deal with impacts, adaptation and vulnerability to climate change, while the third looks at mitigation efforts. A final document synthesising the three earlier efforts will then be released at some point next year, said the dpa report. \"

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE305","State of the union: How's Europe doing? Actually, pretty well","September 27, 2021 Monday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. \- AFP It was an upbeat yet realistic speech as European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen recently delivered the annual European State of the Union report outlining issues and achievements facing the 27-member bloc. After nearly two years of dire challenges, it appears the path ahead is more promising despite the EU's legendary reputation for disputation and discord. How is Europe doing? Quite well, actually, especially compared to much of the wider world. In her speech titled 'Strengthen the Soul of Our Union' von der Leyen quoted EU founding father Robert Schuman: ""Europe needs a soul, an ideal, and the political will to serve this ideal."" Later she quoted former Czech president V\'e1clav Havel on ""great European values"". And she ticked off some of the measures that have demonstrated those values over the past year. The first woman president of the European Commission said that after a slow start, the EU's vaccination programme has been a success overall. An unprecedented economic package to help in economic recovery from pandemic is also in the implementation phase. As well, the EU continues to demonstrate leadership on a range of issues including online regulation, ambitious initiatives to battle climate change and humane policies that attempt to assist the least advantaged. ""Today, and against all critics, Europe is among the world leaders,"" she said, noting that more than 700 million doses have been delivered to member states and that an equal number has been distributed by the bloc to more than 130 countries worldwide. ""We are the only region in the world to achieve that,"" she said. ""We did it the right way because we did it the European way. And it worked."" Yet she warned that the pandemic is far from over as less than one per cent of doses worldwide have been administered in low-income countries. ""The scale of injustice and the level of urgency are obvious,"" she said. ""This is one of the great geopolitical issues of our time."" She announced that the EU will expand its donation by a further 200 million doses by the middle of next year. The bloc has also committed to spending \€ 1 billion to boost production capacity of mRNA vaccines in Africa. Von der Leyen took a similar approach to summarising the EU's climate change efforts: praise followed by pragmatic appraisal. As global leaders prepare for the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) in Glasgow in November  seen as one of the most important summits on global warming in history  she said ""Europe is ready to do more"" as it increases its contribution by $4 billion until 2027. In past COP summits, the world committed to providing $100 billion a year until 2025. The EU has so far contributed $25 billion per year. She described the upcoming summit as ""a moment of truth"". ""Every country has a responsibility,"" she said, in particular major economies, which have a ""special duty to the least developed and most vulnerable countries"". ""We expect the United States and our partners to step up too. Closing the climate finance gap together  the US and the EU  would be a strong signal for global climate leadership."" Von der Leyen lauded climate neutrality ambitions set by Washington and Tokyo but called for those promises to ""be backed up by concrete plans in time for Glasgow"". She also called on Beijing to provide more details about its own strategy. On the digital front, she said the EU will put forward ""a new European Chips Act"" designed to make Europe less reliant on imports for its own cutting-edge computer technology. ""We depend on state-of-the-art chips manufactured in Asia,"" she said. ""This is not just a matter of our competitiveness. This is also a matter of tech sovereignty. So let's put all of our focus on it."" The leader of the EU's administrative body said the bloc continues to struggle with efforts in a united security approach backed by military might. She appeared to endorse greater EU military independence, a policy commonly known as ""strategic autonomy"". ""Europe can  and clearly should  be able and willing to do more on its own,"" von der Leyen said. She called for a European Defense Union, but her initial proposals were the promise of more talk, referencing an in-the-works ""joint declaration"" with Nato and an upcoming EU ""defense summit"" in the first half of 2022. But more talk could be exactly what's needed rather than boots on the ground and all-out warfare. It seems the US will now take an approach more similar to the EU. In a recent speech to the UN, President Joe Biden said the withdrawal from Afghanistan is a turning point in US history in which ""relentless war"" would be supplanted by ""relentless diplomacy"". That sounds a lot like what the EU has been doing already, for better or worse. Concluding her second state of the union address since taking up the president position last year, von der Leyen returned to the theme of Europe's soul.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE306","New analysis shows it's 50% cheaper to generate electricity from renewables","July 31, 2021 Saturday","TechRadar","According to new analysis from energy think tank Ember, the cost of generating electricity from power plants using fossil fuels is around double what it costs to produce it from renewable sources. Ember's findings, as reported in Yahoo! News, have arrived with the publication of their mid-year analysis of the energy sector. The data presented examined electricity production in 27 major EU nations across the first six months of the year and compared it to the same period in 2020, and in 2019 before the pandemic. The think tank believes that the reasons why electricity production from wind and solar is about 50% cheaper than fossil fuels stems from the continually rising cost of coal. In addition, the now increasing demand for electricity has also had an impact as Covid restrictions have eased around the world. Looking to switch energy provider? Find the best deals near you Fossil fuels are being outpaced by renewables Other notable findings from the research include how electricity use Europe-wide is now 'back to pre-pandemic levels', but the 'consistent growth' of renewables is significantly outpacing that of fossil fuels. When compared to the first half of 2019, coal generation was 16% lower, while clean energy use has also been shown to have increased in the first half of the year - as it now provides two-thirds of power to the 27 EU countries Ember analysed. More needs to be done to reduce reliance on fossil fuels However, despite the encouraging data that suggests a big shift towards further production of renewables, Charles Moore, Ember's Europe lead, has still called for more to be done to 'reduce reliance on fossil fuels for energy' and reduce emissions. Speaking on the matter, Charles Moore said: ""There's never been a better time to accelerate the transition to wind and solar with the costs of sticking with fossil fuels painfully clear. ""There's a clear consensus: it is no longer credible for rich nations to target net zero by 2050 without near-term plans to secure 100 per cent clean power by 2035."" Mr Moore added: ""With all eyes on the UK as it hosts the critical COP26 climate conference, the UK should make this commitment and join Biden to catalyse a new high ambition coalition on clean power."" What this might mean for consumers If this trend and preference for renewables continues with our energy creation, it may lead to a greater choice of green tariffs from energy suppliers. On top of this, these tariffs may also become more affordable as the markets become more competitive \- meaning cheaper energy bills in the long run. There will also be the wider environmental benefits from reduced emissions, plus a necessity for more supplies of renewables could mean investment in facilities and farms, creating more green job opportunities. Better still, the popularity of green tariffs has also grown in recent years and some of the best energy suppliers around are now offering these to customers. This means that by switching you could make the most of big savings on your bills and the excellent customer service provided by these suppliers.

The announcement was made during a meeting at AVEVA's London office attended by Kwasi Kwarteng, UK Secretary of State for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy. The move affirms AVEVA's commitment to set both short and long-term targets that are in line with the most ambitious aims of the Paris Climate Agreement and reflects a science-based approach to climate action. AVEVA Chairman Philip Aiken and CEO Peter Herweck with Kwasi Kwarteng, UK Secretary of State for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy. ""As outlined by the global scientific community in last week's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, the window we have to take action on climate is closing fast"", said Peter Herweck, AVEVA CEO, at the meeting. ""We have joined Business Ambition for 1.5\'b0C because we are deeply committed to being part of the solution to the climate crisis, both through the industrial software that we make to support our customers on their digital journey and in the daily actions that we take to run our own business. By working together with our customers, partners, and other key stakeholders such as the UK Government, we believe we can create an inclusive net-zero economy in line with the 1.5\'b0C pathway"". Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng commented, ""It's great to see companies like AVEVA committing to tackling climate change and joining the Race to Zero and the Business Ambition 1.5\'b0C campaign. As a country, eliminating our contribution to climate change by 2050 simply will not be possible without business playing its part and I urge other companies to follow suit and sign up without delay.\~Advanced technologies have a major role to play in cutting emissions, while at the same time boosting investment and creating new green jobs. It was fantastic to see first-hand how AVEVA is supporting its many customers across the world to transition to a clean, green way of doing business and to seize the myriad opportunities that this brings"", Secretary of State Kwarteng said. Business Ambition for 1.5\'b0C is a global alliance led by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in partnership with the UN Global Compact and the We Mean Business coalition. It aims to prevent the worst impacts of climate change and avoid irreversible damage to our societies, economies, and the natural world by limiting global temperature increases to 1.5\'b0C above pre-industrial levels. Reaching that goal requires halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and hitting net-zero emissions by 2050 worldwide. Over 600 companies representing more than $13 trillion in market capitalisation have signed up to the Business Ambition for 1.5\'b0C initiative so far. It is widely recognised as the gold standard for corporate climate action. Peter Herweck, AVEVA CEO. ""Achieving the targets will not be easy"", added Herweck. ""However, we are confident that through a smart combination of implementing energy reduction measures across our offices, procuring renewable energy, and engaging with our suppliers and customers on climate action, we can greatly reduce our overall emissions with minimal reliance on carbon removals. The majority of our UK facilities, including London, Cambridge, Chesterfield and Manchester, are running on clean power and we are actively working to increase our renewable energy sourcing globally"". In the US, AVEVA's California facilities, in Lake Forest, San Leandro and Carlsbad, have already switched to a green tariff. Beyond making changes to accelerate AVEVA's own use of renewable energy, the company's software solutions enable many customers across the world to decarbonise and speed up the transition to a net-zero emissions economy. By enabling energy savings, emissions monitoring and mitigation, materials efficiency, waste reduction and supply chain optimisation, AVEVA solutions support more sustainable industries. AVEVA already contributes to a number of corporate sustainability initiatives that bring together companies to help tackle climate challenges collectively, including BSR, the UN Global Compact, and the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance (REBA). In signing on to the Business Ambition for 1.5\'b0C commitment, AVEVA is also pleased to be joining the UNFCCC Race to Zero. This latest climate pledge is aligned to AVEVA's goal of showing that a 1.5\'b0C-compliant business model is possible ahead of COP26 in November when governments and industries will strengthen their contributions to the Paris Agreement and to tackling global warming. It also reflects AVEVA's culture of collaboration and its commitment to working with stakeholders across the value chain to help safeguard the planet for coming generations while advancing the net-zero industries of the future. \"

The agency said that countries including Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands had received up to two months' rain in two days from 14 to 15 July, on ground that was ""already near saturation."" Photos taken at the scene of some of the worst water surges and landslides show huge, gaping holes where earth and buildings had stood until mid-week, after media reports pointed to well over 100 confirmed fatalities in Germany and Belgium on Friday morning, with an unknown number still missing across vast areas. ""We've seen images of houses being swept away, it's really, really devastating,"" said WMO spokesperson Clare Nullis adding that that the disaster had overwhelmed some of the prevention measures put in place by the affected developed countries. In a statement issued by his Spokesperson, the UN Secretary-General Ant?nio Guterres, said he was saddened by the loss of life and destruction of property. ""He extends his condolences and solidarity to the families of the victims and to the Governments and people of the affected countries."" The UN chief said the UN stood ready to contribute to ongoing rescue and assistance efforts, if necessary. ""Europe on the whole is prepared, but you know, when you get extreme events, such as what we've seen - two months' worth of rainfall in two days - it's very, very difficult to cope,"" added Ms. Nullis, before describing scenes of ""utter devastation"" in Germany's southwestern Rhineland-Palatinate state, which is bordered by France, Belgium and Luxembourg. Highlighting typical preparedness measures, the WMO official noted In Switzerland's national meteorological service, MeteoSwiss, had a smartphone application which regularly issued alerts about critical high-water levels. The highest flood warning is in place at popular tourist and camping locations including lakes Biel, Thun and the Vierwaldstattersee, with alerts also in place for Lake Brienz, the Rhine near Basel, and Lake Zurich. ""Certainly, when you see the images we've seen in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands this week it's shocking, but under climate change scenarios, we are going to see more extreme events in particular extreme heat,"" the WMO official added. Concerns persist about rising sea temperatures in high northern latitudes, too, Ms. Nullis said, describing the Gulf of Finland in the Baltic Sea at a ""record"" high, ""up to 26.6C on 14 July"", making it the warmest recorded water temperature since records began some 20 years ago. Echoing a call by UN Secretary-General Ant?nio Guterres to all countries to do more to avoid a climate catastrophe linked to rising emissions and temperatures, Ms. Nullis urged action, ahead of this year's UN climate conference, known as COP26 , in Glasgow, in November. ""We need to step up climate action, we need to step up the level of ambition; we're not doing nearly enough to stay within the targets of the Paris Agreement (on Climate Change) and keep temperatures below two degrees Celsius, even 1.5C, by the end of this century."" \"

Javid, son of a former bus conductor, has previously held several roles in the government, including his last position as Chancellor of the Exchequer until February 2020, when the incumbent, Rishi Sunak, was his deputy. He added: ""We are still in a pandemic and I want to see that come to an end as soon as possible, and that will be my most immediate priority - to see that we can return to normal as soon and as quickly as possible. Now, I've got a lot of work to do. I'm sure you appreciate that. And if you can excuse me, I'd like to get on with it."" Besides Javid and Sunak, the Asian representation in Johnson's cabinet includes home secretary Priti Patel, COP26 president Alok Sharma and attorney-general Suella Braverman (nee Fernandes). Javid's new role will see him petitioning Sunak for more funds to deal with the pandemic. Earlier, Javid has dealt with several issues related to the Indian subcontinent, when he held the positions of home secretary, business secretary and culture secretary. These included interacting with the Tata Group, when it was in the process of repositioning its steel assets in the UK. In 2015, when Javid was the business secretary, he wrote the foreword for a British Council report titled 'India Matters', which was welcomed in Indian quarters that believe colonial perceptions continue to influence British attitudes and policies towards a rapidly modernising India. He wrote: ""(A) shared past is not enough to keep a relationship going. With a fast-growing India now poised to become one of the world's most influential nations and, potentially, one of the UK's most important partners, this report represents a timely call to action for us all"". He added, ""This engagement must not be tackled piecemeal This strategy needs to be founded on deep appreciation of each other's contemporary culture, not on any outdated perceptions As the balance of economic and political power shifts around the globe, we're at a key juncture in the development of relations between India and the UK."" Javid, who entered politics in 2009 after giving up a lucrative career in banking and rapidly rose in the Conservative party, announced his candidature in May 2019 in the election for the next Conservative leader and the PM, joining eight others in the race, following Theresa May's resignation amid rows over her handling of the Brexit process. Javid, however, was eliminated when he polled few votes. Johnson, eventually, won the election and succeeded May as the prime minister.

""With India's global reach and robust private sector, I believe that we will be able to accelerate our efforts and build a more sustainable future. Prince Charles also said that India's young and vibrant entrepreneurs will play a vital part in driving it forward. ""With India being a global centre for technology and innovation, combined with a deep connection to nature and harmony, you have an absolutely vital role to play in this effort, particularly, if I may say so, in view of India's wealth of young entrepreneurial talent, who will be utterly critical to finding solutions to the greatest of our challenges,"" he said. ""This work will be further developed in the lead-up to the G20 COP26 , where I know India and its private sector will perform an essential part. So, I can only hope and pray that you would join me in advancing this very important collective endeavour and also bearing in mind the enormous added value and influence of many more companies singing through the hymn sheet, that you would consider joining the Sustainable Markets Initiative India Council,"" Prince Charles added. Prince Charles also felt that with agriculture being a pivotal wheel in India's growing economy, we must look to adopt global farm metrics. ""To accelerate and transform global agriculture and food systems in a more sustainable direction, we must look to adopt a clear set of global farm metrics that will better enable investors and consumers to understand the relative sustainability of agricultural products and supply chains,"" he opined. ""With agriculture being so critical to the Indian economy, there is a real opportunity to explore how such metrics could support the lives and livelihoods of farmers in India as well as wider supply chains and markets,"" Prince Charles added. Prince Charles said that SMI was set up to transition to a zero-carbon future. ""With the lives and livelihoods of present and future generations in mind, I set up the Sustainable Markets Initiative in January 2020 to bring together CEOs in almost every sector, with the express aim of identifying obstacles to progress along with game-changing ways to accelerate the transition to a zero-carbon future. In January this year, I launched the Terra Carta as the mandate of my Sustainable Markets Initiative and the basis of a recovery plan for nature, people and planet,"" he said. As we look to transition, we must explore, as a matter of real urgency, the potential of carbon capture used in storage to address current and legacy carbon in our atmosphere, without which we will simply never buy enough time to prevent irreversible climate change,"" added Prince Charles.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE314","The case for a food systems stability board","August 31, 2021 Tuesday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","Reuters The Covid-19 pandemic, rising rates of global poverty and inequality, persistent conflict, and the escalating climate and biodiversity crises are shocks and stresses that together contribute to increasing hunger, as well as growing food and nutrition insecurity. To help tackle this urgent problem more effectively and make the global food system more stable and resilient, governments should consider establishing a new, multilateral, United Nations-led Food Systems Stability Board (FSSB). Today, between 720 million and 811 million people  about 10 per cent of the world's population  go to bed hungry every night, and at least 2.4 billion lack access to a healthy and nutritious diet. Absent major international action, these trends are likely to persist. The latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change demonstrates that global warming's effects have left no region untouched, with significant implications for the food system over the coming decades. Food systems underpin the security of the global economy, as well as national security in many countries: hunger and lack of access to food have historically driven civil unrest. These systems are also among the principal drivers of ecosystem loss and climate change, with agriculture and land-use change responsible for a quarter of global greenhouse-gas emissions. At the same time, ecosystems such as forests, mangroves, and the ocean are central to humanity's efforts to adapt to the climatic changes already underway. Ensuring the long-term resilience of the global food system will require a significant multilateral collaborative effort. This should build on existing structures and institutions such as the Committee on World Food Security, the Food and Agriculture Organisation, the World Food Programme, and the World Bank. It will also demand concerted attention from heads of state and government, ministers of finance, and the leaders of multilateral financial institutions. A quartet of international meetings  the UN Food Systems Summit in September 2021, the G20 summit in October, the UN climate conference ( COP26 ) in November, and the Nutrition for Growth Summit hosted by the Japanese government in December  offer a rare opportunity to focus international attention on the hunger and food-security crisis, and its links to the changing climate. Each of these gatherings could pave the way for the creation of an FSSB of national governments and international organisations working to address this issue. This could be part of a broader global effort to enhance food governance and achieve  in the words of the government of Indonesia, which will hold the G20 presidency in 2022  a ""just and affordable transition towards net zero"". Moreover, there is an encouraging precedent for such a body. The Financial Stability Board (FSB), established by G20 finance ministers in April 2009 with the aim of preventing a repeat of the 2008 global financial crisis, has positively contributed to global macroeconomic stability and is now an authoritative, independent, and well-respected body. Its findings directly influence the decision-making of G20 finance ministers, as well as that of the heads of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the regional development banks. In a similar fashion, an FSSB, if established, would be charged with promoting the health and resilience of the global food system, including by addressing issues such as price stability, trade, strategic reserves, and the effects of climate change on production. The board would fully respect national sovereignty, and not issue legally binding recommendations. Rather, it would give credible advice to governments on how to build a food system that is better prepared to withstand future shocks and ensure greater global access to nutritious food. While governments would decide the precise scope, structure, and composition of an FSSB, we believe the body could play a helpful role in several ways. For example, it could analyse early-warning systems and risk-modelling data on hunger, agriculture, and climate, including from the existing Agricultural Market Information System database. It could also advise the World Trade Organisation and national governments on food-related trade policies, while helping countries respond to changing market dynamics and a volatile climate. Additionally, the FSSB could support and enable countries to submit voluntary five-year food system risk assessments and resilience plans. It could also gather and share knowledge about global food-trade vulnerabilities, such as those relating to climate change, conflict, lack of crop diversity, pollinator loss, and other threats, and identify and review the regulatory, supervisory, and voluntary measures needed to address them. The FSSB could support contingency planning for cross-border crisis management, especially with regard to systemically important food crops or areas particularly affected by climate vulnerability, biodiversity loss, and/or future pandemics. Lastly, the board could collaborate with the IMF to include more consideration of risks related to climate, biodiversity, and food and land-use systems in the Fund's regular Article IV consultations with member countries. The FSSB could comprise relevant national representatives from ministries of agriculture and rural affairs, trade and commerce, health, environment, and finance, as well as international standard-setters and leading scientists in the field of global food-system risks. As with the FSB, the institution's audience would be member states, including heads of government, finance ministers, and other portfolios. The current absence of an FSSB is a notable gap in the international governance architecture required to bolster the sustainability, equity, and resilience of the global food system in the twenty-first century and beyond. At the UN General Assembly and UN Food Systems Summit  both taking place in September  governments could agree to initiate a one-year consultation process to explore the creation of such a body. By doing so, they could contribute to a better future for hundreds of millions of vulnerable people  and ensure access to food and security for all.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE315","KT edit: G7 should lead the world on a greener path","June 13, 2021 Sunday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","Our world is changing faster than we or our political class cares to admit. The changing weather across countries, warming seas, dying corals, fauna and flora are calling our attention to their dire state, yet we remain myopic in our views. Economic growth, development, older ways of life run by fossil fuels are more prized than taking a hard look at our future. Sir David Attenborough, arguably the most distinguishable voice for our planet, rightly warned humans could be ""on the verge of destabilising the entire planet"". What we need is collective action to protect life as we know it on this blue planet, and G7 is one of the strongest groups that could take the lead and influence the world in greener ways. However, the political will to tackle this most pressing issue of our times seems to be lacking. On Sunday, the concluding day for the G7 summit, the leaders of seven rich countries made a statement announcing increased funding for climate change projects. However, individual pledges on how much each nation will contribute are missing. These numbers are important. Climate financing is a sticky point and often the lack of funding, especially in developing countries, is the reason why some good projects cannot take off as envisioned. Poor countries need the support of richer nations to be able to drive growth and change without putting strain on the limited resources we have. Tackling climate change isn't only about transforming energy systems but also about adapting to our changing climatic conditions. The efforts should go beyond that. The plan should include spending on reforestation and coastal defence systems. Efforts need to be made to cut emissions at a faster pace and find ways to adapt to rising temperatures. Just as important as funding is how it is being spent. Cities and countries need transformative projects that can steer change in the way we consume energy. Installing solar plants in cities or building more hydropower facilities at a time when the world is becoming warmer and hence future flow of water could decrease drastically isn't the best option. The money should be used in diversifying energy sources. Agriculture, forest and land-related initiatives have historically struggled for funding, even when these are responsible for almost one-quarter of the past decade's emissions. The G7 has done well to announce its intentions to increase funding to tackle climate change. However, respective countries should announce their individual contributions as well and ensure that they are followed through. It is good to see that all countries, including the US, are on the same page and realise the grave challenges that we collectively face. It was the West that drove the industrial revolution, and now it is time for the bloc again to take the lead and drive change for a green revolution. The G7's 'green belt and road' plan to provide green financing to developing world is also a good step. By the time of the COP26 climate summit in November, the world's largest industrialised democracies should have a plan and structure in place to lead the world on a greener path.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE317","Local Press: Why the UAE should hold Cop28","May 25, 2021 Tuesday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","ABU DHABI, 25th May, 2021 (WAM) -- On his opening trip to Asia as the Biden administration's special presidential envoy for climate, John Kerry's first stop was Abu Dhabi, where he attended the Regional Climate Dialogue in April. ""It was not your usual diplomatic visit,"" The National said, adding that rather than being confined to reception rooms, Kerry was given a helicopter tour of the emirate's Noor facility, the largest single-site solar plant in the world, as well as trips to the first university dedicated to AI, MBZUAI, with curriculums focusing on sustainability, and even a mangrove park. ""This packed and varied itinerary made one thing clear: solving the climate crisis will require every technology and discipline that countries can harness,"" the paper wrote in its today's editorial. Kerry's trip to the climate dialogue highlighted an emergency that threatens the globe. More than 190 leaders will be discussing it again at the UN's 26th Climate Change Conference, Cop26 , which is taking place this November in Glasgow, Scotland. On Sunday, the UAE launched its own bid to host Cop28, scheduled for 2023, in Abu Dhabi. The Cop meetings are arguably the most influential of their kind, having led to the establishment of the Paris Agreement in 2015, when nearly every nation on Earth agreed to work together to stop the world's temperature increasing more than 2 C above pre-industrial levels, the daily explained. The editorial went on to say that, ""Climate change poses the same threat to all nations. But the Mena region is an early frontline. Droughts are affecting farmers from Sudan to Syria. And it is not just the natural environment under threat. Regional economies are in jeopardy, too."" The World Bank highlighted in a recent report that water scarcity related to climate change could cost the Middle East as much as a 14 percent knock to GDP by 2050. When more than 80 percent of water used in the region goes towards agriculture, dwindling supplies threaten not only those reliant on the earth for work, but the food security of everyone. ""This urgency has led to increasing concern within GCC governments, who for years have been planning for a post-carbon future that redirects the oil revenues that were the driving force behind the region's rapid development in the 20th century,"" the paper added. In the UAE, officials have been arguing for some time that a greener future is also a major opportunity for growth. Announcing the bid on Sunday, H.H. Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, who said, ""We have seen first-hand that there is now an unprecedented business case for the highest level of climate ambition \- especially when it advances gender equality and empowers youth."" A series of major environmental projects are providing the proof; the Emirates now has among the lowest solar energy costs on the planet. The Abu Dhabi-based English language newspaper concluded by saying, ""It will take more than the cold, hard facts to change longstanding polluting habits. The Gulf has been a major commercial centre of the global carbon industry for decades. Now it is committed to taking the lead on creating a greener future, and hosting Cop28 in the UAE would show that commitment on the world stage. If the Gulf can lead conversations for real, global progress on sustainability, then reluctant countries elsewhere in the world will find it harder to make excuses for inaction."" \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE318","Green Pakistan to fight climate change","August 14, 2021 Saturday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","Climate change triggered by the increased emissions of green-house gases is undoubtedly the biggest challenge facing humanity in the twenty first century. Admittedly the failure of the international community to check the continued rise in temperature caused by the emission of green-house gases, can lead to catastrophic consequences. Therefore, as repeatedly reiterated by the UN Secretary General it is absolutely essential to make peace with the nature, meaning thereby that there was no escape from keeping the rising temperatures below 1.5 centigrade as emphasised by the scientists and environmental experts. A report released by UN on August 8, 2021 called 'Code Red for Humanity' says that the earth was getting so hot that temperatures in about a decade would probably blow past a level of warming that the world leaders have sought to prevent. The climate change phenomenon has already started having devastating impact globally and Pakistan is among the top 10 countries which have been bearing the brunt of this climatic onslaught during the last twenty years. While the world is still indecisive  and some countries including the major pollutants are even showing reluctance to cut down on greenhouse emissions preferring industrial growth over it  the developing countries including Pakistan perforce have to devise their own strategies to minimise the impact of the climate change till such time a collective will and commitment of the global community crystallises into concrete actions to deal with the challenge. Pakistan, under the stewardship of Prime Minister Imran Khan, has given top priority to putting in place steps and measures that can be helpful in lessening the debilitating impact of the climate change. The central theme of the effort is to make Pakistan clean and green. It has launched a number of initiatives including the landmark 10-Billion Tree Tsunami which has won international acclaim, including from the World Economic Forum. Pakistan can also rightly boast about myriad of other initiatives including green economic stimulus, Eco-system Protection, Wild life management, Protected Areas initiative and Pakistan Clean Air Programme. Prime Minister Imran Khan has also inaugurated the world's biggest Miyawaki urban forest near Lahore on August 9 as part of monsoon drive under the 10-billion Tree Tsunami Project. All the foregoing steps in the words of Prime Minister are driven solely by his commitment to future generations of a clean and green Pakistan to mitigate the impact of climate change. It is pertinent to note that Pakistan besides the measures mentioned above has also launched the initiative to produce 60 per cent of all energy in the country through renewable resources by the year 2030. It has already scrapped two coal power projects, which were supposed to generate 2,600MW of electricity and replaced them with hydro-power units. Prime Minister Imran Khan has been a vociferous advocate of collective action by the world community on climate change. In recognition of his discourses at the Convention of Biodiversity, in the UN General Assembly and the nature based solutions devised by his government, UNEP approached Pakistan for hosting the UN Environment Day 2021. Prime Minister Imran Khan addressing the moot apprised the world community regarding future plans of this government to deal with climate change, including Recharge Pakistan designed to divert flood water to wetland to recharge water table and mangroves forestation, which absorb carbon besides green-house gases. Explaining the threat faced by Pakistan due to climate change, he also urged the need for the world to pay attention to reducing carbon emissions, which cause melting of the glaciers, hence posing threats to countries like Pakistan and Central Asia where rivers were fed by glaciers. He also called on the world community to assist the poor countries, including Pakistan, which were bearing the brunt of this phenomenon. Pakistan also co-chaired the multibillion-dollar Green Climate Fund, established to support climate actions in developing countries, last year. Pakistan as Vice President of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has also been playing a pro-active role in shaping the global discourse on fighting global warming. Perhaps a cursory glance at efforts at the international level to deal with the climate challenge would be quite relevant here. The first ever international Agreement on restricting emissions of green-house gases known as Kyoto Protocol was adopted on December 11, 1997. The Protocol operationalised the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change by committing industrialized countries and economies in transition to limit and reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions in accordance with agreed individual targets. Those targets were stipulated to be met in two phases. But regrettably the required cooperation from the participating countries did not come forth. New Zealand, and Russia did participate in Kyoto's first round but did not take on new targets in the second commitment period. Canada withdrew from the Protocol in 2012 and the USA did not ratify it at all. The second international agreement known as Paris Agreement, was signed on December 12, 2015 during the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's (UNFCCC) 21st Conference of the Parties. The Paris Agreement marked a historic turning point for global climate action, as the world leaders were able to evolve a consensus on its framework and goals. But regrettably President Donald Trump pulled out of the Agreement like he did in case of other international commitments by US. However, it is satisfying to note that the US President Joe Biden has announced to rejoin the Paris Agreement. Not only that, in view of the urgency involved he also convened leaders for the summit on Climate on April 22-23, 2021, attended by 41 countries including Pakistan. The Summit underscored the urgency and the economic benefits of stronger climate action. Its deliberations are considered to be a key milestone on the road to the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) this November in Glasgow. While Pakistan celebrates its 75th Independence Day this year on August 14, the nation apart from other moves initiated by the government to achieve the objectives of independence, can rightly take pride in the fact that it has not only set the ball rolling in the right direction in regards to saving the country from the vagaries of the climate change but has also made a sterling contribution to this global cause. The initiatives taken by Pakistan are surely worth emulating by the world community, particularly the developing countries. Click/tap here to subscribe to Khaleej Times news alerts on Telegram. \"

Moreover, the UAE is developing the region's first commercial-scale carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS) network,"" Gulf Today wrote in its editorial today. Globally, the paper added, the country has helped advance the deployment of renewables through the $350 million International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) / Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD) Project Facility, and the UAE-Pacific Partnership Fund and the UAE-Caribbean Renewable Energy Fund, valued at US$50 million each. The country's flagship renewables company Masdar has invested in clean energy projects with a total capacity of 10.7 GW in over 30 countries, it went on to say. Over the past years, the UAE has become an international centre for countries wishing to discuss climate change and environmental issues, as it continues to host a wide variety of leading international conferences, exhibitions and meetings that deal with topics related to a global issue that is expected to significantly impact our future. Dr. Abdullah Belhaif Al Nuaimi, Minister of Climate Change and Environment, said that, over the past decades, the UAE has supported and bolstered global efforts to address and resolve environmental challenges. That's not all. The UAE organises a number of relevant yearly events, including Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ADSW), the Climate Change Forum of the World Government Summit, the World Green Economy Summit, and the Water, Energy, Technology, and Environment Exhibition (WETEX), in addition to being home to the permanent headquarters of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). In 2021, ADSW welcomed over 37,000 attendees from over 175 countries, while its events received over 3.5 million views online.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE320","IRENA's World Energy Transitions Outlook re-writes energy narrative for a net zero world","June 30, 2021 Wednesday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","ABU DHABI, 30th June, 2021 (WAM) -- Accelerating energy transitions on a path to climate safety can grow the world's economy by 2.4 percent over the expected growth of current plans within the next decade, a new analysis from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) shows. The Agency's 1.5 C pathway foresees the creation of up to 122 million energy-related jobs in 2050, more than double today's 58 million. Renewable energy alone will account for more than a third of all energy jobs employing 43 million people globally, supporting the post-COVID recovery and long-term economic growth. IRENA's World Energy Transitions Outlook sees renewables-based energy systems instigating profound changes that will reverberate across economies and societies. Sharp adjustments in capital flows and a reorientation of investments are necessary to align energy with a positive economic and environmental trajectory. Forward-looking policies can accelerate transition, mitigate uncertainties, and ensure maximum benefits of energy transition. The annual investment of USD 4.4 trillion needed on average is high. But it is feasible and equals to around 5 per cent of global GDP in 2019. ""This Outlook represents a concrete, practical toolbox to total reorientation of the global energy system and writes a new and positive energy narrative as the sector undergoes a dynamic transition,"" said Francesco La Camera, IRENA's Director-General. ""There is consensus that an energy transition grounded in renewables and efficient technologies is the only way to give us a fighting chance of limiting global warming by 2050 to 1.5 C. As the only realistic option for a climate-safe world, IRENA's vision has become mainstream."" ""Energy transformation will drive economic transformation,"" continued La Camera. ""Energy transition is a daunting task but can bring unprecedented new possibilities to revitalise economies and lift people out of poverty. IRENA's Outlook brings unique value as it also outlines the policy frameworks and financing structures necessary to advance a transition that is just and inclusive. Each country will define what is the best for them, but collectively, we must ensure that all countries and regions can realise the benefits of the global energy transition for a resilient and more equitable world. We have the know-how, we have the tools, we need to act, and do so now."" The next decade will be decisive to achieve the Paris and Sustainable Developments goals. Any delay will drive us to the direction of further warming, with profound and irreversible economic and humanitarian consequences. Phasing out coal, limiting investments in oil and gas to facilitate a swift decline and a managed transition as well as embracing technology, policy and market solutions will put the global energy system on track for a 1.5 C pathway. By 2050, a total USD 33 trillion of additional investment are required into efficiency, renewables, end-use electrification, power grids, flexibility, hydrogen and innovations. The benefits, however, greatly exceed the costs of investments. When air pollution, human health and climate change externalities are factored in, the payback is even higher with every dollar spent on the energy transition adding benefits valued at between USD 2 and USD 5.5, in cumulative terms between USD 61 trillion and USD 164 trillion by the mid-century. IRENA's Outlook sees energy transition as a big business opportunity for multiple stakeholders including the private sector, shifting funding from equity to private debt capital. The latter will grow from 44 percent in 2019 to 57 percent in 2050, an increase of almost 20 percent over planned policies. Energy transition technologies will find it easier to obtain affordable long-term debt financing in the coming years, while fossil fuel assets will increasingly be avoided by private financiers and therefore forced to rely on equity financing from retained earnings and new equity issues. But public financing will remain crucial for a swift, just and inclusive energy transition and to catalyse private finance. In 2019, the public sector provided some USD 450 billion through public equity and lending by development finance institutions. In IRENA's 1.5 C Scenario, these investments will almost double to some USD 780 billion. Public debt financing will be an important facilitator for other lenders, especially in developing markets. As markets alone are not likely to move rapidly enough, policy makers must incentivise but also take action to eliminate market distortions that favour fossil fuels and facilitate the necessary changes in funding structures. This will involve phasing out fossil fuel subsidies and changing fiscal systems to reflect the negative environmental, health and social costs of fossil fuels. Monetary and fiscal policies, including carbon pricing policies, will enhance competitiveness and level the playing field. Enhanced international cooperation and comprehensive set of policies will be critical to drive the wider structural shift towards resilient economies and societies. If not well managed, the energy transition risks inequitable outcomes, dual-track development and an overall slowdown in the progress. Just and integrated policies will remain imperative to realise the full potential of the energy transition. Today's policies, finance and socio-economic analysis completes the outlined technological avenues for a 1.5 C-comptabile energy pathway, providing policymakers with a playbook to achieve optimal results from the transition.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE321","Statement by UAE before the General Debate of the 76th Session of UNGA","September 28, 2021 Tuesday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","NEW YORK, 28th September, 2021 (WAM) -- Khalifa Shaheen Al Marar, Minister of State, said that the year 2021 was a pivotal year for the UAE as it celebrates the UAE's Golden Jubilee and the announcement of the ""Principles of the 50"", a socio-economic development roadmap for the coming years. Al Marar's remarks came during his statement during the General Debate of the 76th Session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), where he highlighted that the international community is also at a critical juncture in 2021 as it strives to address the COVID-19 pandemic, secure supply chains for all, and help with recovery from the medial, economic, and security effects of the pandemic. He also emphasised the important role of the upcoming Expo 2020 Dubai that the UAE is hosting as a platform to connect minds and develop innovative solutions for the most pressing global challenges. Minister Al Marar underlined the importance of creating an environment conducive for peace and stability, especially in the Arab region, by implementing a comprehensive and durable ceasefire in Yemen, and sustaining it in Libya and Syria, with the departure of all foreign forces, combined with the full respect for the sovereignty of Arab states. He stated that supporting stability in the region requires ending the occupation of all Palestinian and Arab territories, and establishing an independent Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital. On Afghanistan, Minister Al Marar stressed the urgent need to enhance security and stability in the country to fulfill the aspirations of its people, particularly women and youth, and to end the prolonged suffering in return for peace and prosperity. Minister Al Marar repeated the UAE's demand that Iran end its occupation of the three UAE islands: Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb, and Abu Musa. He added that the UAE will continue to call on Iran to agree to resolve this dispute peacefully through direct negotiations or referral to the International Court of Justice. Additionally, in his statement, he stressed that climate change remains one of the most pressing challenges and that it requires intensified international efforts. In this regard, he said that the UAE seeks to work with partners on solutions and opportunities to reduce the effects of climate change, including by offering to host the twenty-eighth session of the Conference of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28). The following is the full text of the statement delivered by Minister Khalifa Shaheen Al Marar: Mr. President, At the outset, I would like to congratulate Abdulla Shahid on his presidency of this session. We are confident that we will collectively make further progress in addressing urgent international issues and building a safer and sustainable world. A world in which our peoples can look to the future with hope and confidence. The UAE believes that this year is a historic juncture at the national level as we celebrate the golden jubilee of the UAE and announce the ""Principles of the 50"", which set out the socio-economic development road map in preparation for the upcoming years. This year is also a critical juncture at the international level, where we are all striving to address the COVID-19 pandemic, secure supply chains for all the people, and help them recover from the medical, economic, and security impacts of the pandemic. This year, my country will also host Expo 2020, which will be inaugurated in a few days with the participation of more than 190 countries. We aspire for this international event to help in the next phase of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and support international efforts aimed at instilling hope and optimism among peoples, as it will provide a platform to connect minds, develop innovative solutions for the most pressing international challenges, and lay the groundwork to create a brighter and more prosperous future. Mr. President, Today, we need wise leadership to advance multilateralism and to develop a united international position to address our common global challenges. It is also imperative to have a genuine political will to overcome this difficult historic juncture, which requires putting differences aside and strengthening relations between states in order to focus on the future and security of our peoples while upholding the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. In this regard, we welcome the Secretary-General's vision to strengthen multilateralism in a manner that serves our shared interests, as set out in his report ""Our Common Agenda."" As a priority, we must generate international momentum to develop peaceful solutions to conflicts and avert political crises before they escalate. In this context, the UAE will continue its long-standing support for the efforts of the United Nations and the international community to achieve real progress in political processes. We believe that creating an environment conducive to peace and stability, especially in our region, requires implementing a comprehensive and durable ceasefire in Yemen, and sustaining it in Libya and Syria with the departure of all foreign forces. Nevertheless, and in order to succeed in our efforts to end the cycle of conflict in the Arab region, crude regional interference in Arab affairs, especially in Syria, Yemen, Libya, and Iraq, must be halted. The illegal interference has obstructed political processes, exacerbated humanitarian crises, and undermined regional and international stability. The UAE relies on a clear international position that rejects regional interference in Arab affairs and supports Arab countries in overcoming all obstacles to peace and stability in the region. We stress here that ensuring full respect for the sovereignty of Arab countries and reaching comprehensive political solutions under the auspices of the United Nations remain the only way to end the crises in the Arab region. In this context, we believe that there is an opportunity to achieve sustainable peace in Yemen. It will only be possible by reaching a comprehensive political solution that includes a ceasefire to ensure stability for the people of Yemen and neighbouring countries. We have seen genuine initiatives in this direction, the latest of which was presented by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to end the war in Yemen. For these efforts to be successful, all parties must demonstrate commitment and determination. However, the Houthi militias continue their provocative and aggressive actions, obstructing the political process and efforts of the United Nations. We reiterate here the importance of implementing the Riyadh Agreement and committing to it to unify the people of Yemen. Additionally, supporting stability in the region requires ending the occupation of all Palestinian and Arab territories, establishing an independent Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital, and achieving the two-state solution in accordance with the relevant UN resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative. We also reiterate the call to stop the construction of settlements, displacement of Palestinians, and all other illegal practices. One year after signing the Abraham Accords, we are encouraged by the establishment of new relations in the region, which unlocked prospects for peace and reconciliation. Through these relations, we seek to stimulate economic growth and advance prosperity and stability for the people in the region, especially for the younger generations who deserve to look to the future with optimism and hope. Mr. President, The ongoing conflicts in the region exacerbated by the pandemic threaten to contribute to a future in which extremist and terrorist groups, such as the Houthis, Da'esh, Al-Qaeda, the Muslim Brotherhood, and Hezbollah, continue their recruitment of new generations of young people to fuel violence and hatred. As such, we will not relent in our efforts to counter these scourges wherever they exist. We must continue to build on the progress achieved in our fight against Da'esh in Syria and Iraq by strengthening regional and international cooperation and constantly refining our methods while respecting international law. In this context, we stress the need to protect the security of energy supplies, freedom of navigation, and trade routes while working at the same time on de-escalation. Targeting vital infrastructure and facilities has direct repercussions on the international economy, peace, and security. Similarly, we must ensure that the Middle East is a region free of weapons of mass destruction. This should be the goal of all countries that are committed to protecting the international order. Reaching a common understanding with Iran, which addresses all regional and international concerns, remains a fundamental requirement and should start with de-escalation to achieve regional and international peace and stability. We cannot ignore Iran's development of its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, as well as its interference in the region. Therefore, any future agreement with Iran must address the shortcomings of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and must involve the countries of the region. This is a legitimate and fair request by countries that seek to protect their security and peoples. We will continue to call on Iran to respect international law, the principles of good neighbourliness, and to resolve disputes through peaceful means. We reiterate our demand that Iran ends its occupation of the three UAE islands: Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb, and Abu Musa. The UAE will never cease its demand for its legitimate sovereignty over the islands occupied by Iran since 1971, in flagrant violation of international law and the United Nations Charter. The UAE will continue to call on Iran to agree to resolve this dispute peacefully through direct negotiations or referral to the International Court of Justice. Mr. President, The UAE stresses the importance of de-escalation and overcoming the challenges facing many countries worldwide. In this regard, we stress the urgent need to strengthen security and stability in Afghanistan to fulfill the aspirations of its people, particularly women and youth, and to end the prolonged suffering in return for peace and prosperity. As we follow the rapidly changing developments in Afghanistan and assess their political, security, and humanitarian repercussions, the UAE stresses the importance of ensuring secure access of humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people to preserve their dignity and protect their rights. In light of our efforts to promote tolerance and provide humanitarian assistance to all peoples in need without discrimination, my country continues to support international humanitarian efforts in Afghanistan and to send urgent medical and food assistance while facilitating efforts to safely evacuate Afghans and people from other countries through the UAE. Moreover, we emphasise the importance of maintaining security and stability in the African continent. We stress the need for a comprehensive approach that addresses all security, humanitarian, and development issues throughout the continent. The African Union has made vigorous and exemplary efforts, which need further international support, especially in the areas of countering extremism and terrorism, and of mediation and consultation in order to resolve existing disagreements. We need to strengthen our cooperation in promoting tolerance and building peaceful coexisting communities, including through countering hate speech. As we commemorated this year, for the first time, the International Day of Human Fraternity, the UAE is encouraged by international calls to promote interfaith and intercultural dialogue. We also reiterate that achieving sustainable peace requires active participation from women and youth in light of their vital role in preventing and resolving conflicts and building prosperous societies. In the same approach, the UAE is keen to strengthen the humanitarian response in its foreign policy and contributed with the international community in alleviating the dire humanitarian situation in areas affected by conflict and disasters. As a priority, we must strengthen multilateralism to help people respond to the pandemic, starting with the equitable distribution of vaccines, sustained humanitarian assistance, and cooperation in rebuilding a sustainable economy. This will require building institutions capable of coping with the challenges and strengthening the work of regional and international organisations, foremost the United Nations, which plays a pivotal role in building resilient societies. Particular emphasis should also be placed on future preparedness and investment in areas that achieve security, peace, and prosperity for peoples. Therefore, the UAE continues its approach towards promoting development and prosperity through an ambitious vision that combines economic development with technology and innovation. The link between politics and economic growth is clear and crucial for our region as we look towards its future. We stress here the importance of enabling people to have access to advanced technology. Though it is exploited by some to cause unrest, advanced technology is a vital tool to achieve peace and address urgent challenges, including climate change. My country will continue to work with its partners in the next phase to transform challenges into opportunities and harness potentials to achieve peace. In this context, climate change remains one of the most pressing challenges. In spite of its increasingly serious repercussions, we believe that if we intensify our international efforts, we will not only be able to reduce its effects and adapt to them, but we will also be able to achieve many economic benefits for countries by investing in solutions mitigating the effects of climate change. Therefore, we stress the need for developing a suitable global response during the twenty-sixth session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP26 ) and in all relevant international meetings. At the same time, we view the Paris Agreement as an exceptional opportunity to support economic growth and create job opportunities. For our part, the UAE seeks to work with its partners to find solutions and explore opportunities that reduce the effects of climate change, including through seeking to host the twenty-eighth session of the Conference of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28). We also commend the tireless efforts of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) in Abu Dhabi in helping countries adopt renewable energy and providing solutions to address the challenges of climate change. I would like to express the UAE's sincere gratitude to member states for our election to the membership of the Security Council for the term 2022-2023. During our membership in the Security Council, my country will use its experience, expertise, and proven approach to build bridges for cooperation to address the most pressing challenges, including extremism, terrorism, regional crises, combating epidemics, climate change, as well as addressing women and youth issues and strengthening their role in achieving security and peace. Thank you, Mr. President. \"

The meeting followed the directives set out by His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, and Emmanuel Macron, President of the French Republic. UAE attendees included Sheikh Shakhbout bin Nahyan Al Nahyan, Minister of State, Ahmed Ali Al Sayegh, Minister of State and Chairman of Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) and Dr. Anwar Gargash, Diplomatic Adviser to President His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The delegations also included Ambassadors of both countries, as well as chairpersons, undersecretaries and director generals from key entities representing priority sectors from both parties. The high-level meeting involved discussions on key sectors of bilateral cooperation, such as economy, trade and investment, oil and gas, hydrogen, nuclear and renewable energy, education, culture, health, artificial intelligence, food security, fintech, intellectual property rights, anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism policies, space, and security. Reflecting on the major achievements of the past decade, such as the Louvre Abu Dhabi, Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi, and the 2009 Joint Defense Agreement, both parties shared an ambition to strengthen bilateral relations and mutual developments by setting out further goals and joint initiatives. During the session, the UAE and France discussed ways of advancing bilateral cooperation with African partners in the continent, focusing on political, security, economic, cultural, educational, and development sectors. This reflects the high level of confidence and strong convergence of views between the two countries across a range of key issues. It supplements the ambitious 10-year bilateral roadmap of the UAE-France strategic partnership (2020-2030) adopted in June 2020. The two parties also welcomed the announcement of a new co-investment partnership dedicated to Africa between Bpifrance and Mubadala Investment Company. During the meeting, both parties also discussed additional areas of cooperation such as climate change with the prospect of organizing a One Planet Sovereign Wealth Fund event in the UAE in October 2021 with a specific segment on building climate ambition towards 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) and beyond. Both parties commended the strong links established with Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), at the institutional and company level, which will be further reinforced through two initiatives: in the field of innovation, an agreement was signed with Bpifrance, and in the field of green finance, exchanges on green bonds issuance will be organised. The UAE and France praised the continued efforts to enhance bilateral exchange and cooperation in advanced sciences, space, research and development, and cultural and creative industries. The parties applauded the milestone achieved in the UAE's peaceful nuclear energy programme, with the commercial operation of the first unit of Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant. The parties expressed their satisfaction with the progress and level of cooperation in the nuclear field, specifically the recent signing of a strategic Maintenance & Engineering Support Agreement between Framatome and the Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation's JV subsidiary, Nawah Energy Company. Representatives from the UAE and France discussed ongoing efforts relating to intellectual property rights, and took note of the continued steps taken by UAE authorities to further strengthen the country's anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism policy framework. Both countries praised the joint efforts to overcome the Covid\- 19 pandemic and agreed to enhance their partnership in the health sector through an ambitious scientific and medical cooperation. They also commended the continuous success of the bilateral residency and fellowship programme, allowing Emirati doctors to obtain specialisation degrees in France. The UAE side also expressed the wish to attract French doctors to pursue a fellowship in the UAE. Both parties acknowledged the achievements of the partnership in the strategic field of artificial intelligence, following the statement of intent, ""A Vision for a Digital 21st Century"" signed in February 2019 by the French Minister of the Economy and Finance, Bruno Le Maire, and the UAE Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, Omar Al Olama. In an effort to support educational and knowledge exchange, both parties celebrated the launch of 42 Abu Dhabi in collaboration with \'e9cole 42 and the official commencement of the first assessment of the candidates in May 2021. The two parties also appreciated the ongoing discussions on the facilitation of establishing branch campuses of French educational institutions and launching new educational programmes in collaboration with French partners in the UAE in the fields of gaming, fashion, business and agriculture. In addition, both parties confirmed the ongoing efforts to mutually recognize degrees/diplomas to promote student and workforce mobility. Moreover, in the framework of Franco-Emirati university and scientific cooperation (for capability development, training programmes, job and internship placement for UAE nationals, etc.), both parties recognised efforts of French industries in achieving collaboration with UAE higher education institutions. Both parties welcomed the continuous development of francophonie in the UAE, with the extension of the bilateral agreement on the teaching of French language in the Emirati public schools. They also praised the proposed opening of a third branch of Alliance Fran\'e7aise in Sharjah. They also welcomed the upcoming signature of an agreement between Institut du Monde Arabe and the Arabic Language Centre to collaborate in the promotion of Arabic Language. In addition, the Strategic Dialogue included a productive discussion on strategic issues of regional and international significance. France reiterated its congratulations to the UAE for its election as a non-permanent member of the Security Council of the United Nations for the 2022-2023 term. This step will allow the two countries to deepen their shared commitment to peace and security by working hand-in-hand on global and regional issues including Africa and the Middle East. Both sides expressed their anticipation of the UAE's Golden Jubilee celebrations and the upcoming Expo 2020 Dubai as essential milestones that will further develop the UAE-France partnership. \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE323","How to ensure 'Green Swans' don't change the colour","June 20, 2021 Sunday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","Steam rises from the Miller Coal Power Plant in Adamsville, Alabama.  AFP The statistician Nassim Nicholas Taleb coined the term ""black swan"" to describe improbable, hard-to-predict events that can have a massive impact on the economy. The authors of a recent report have now introduced into the taxonomy of finance the phrase ""green swans"" events caused by climate change and biodiversity loss. The appearance of green swans is arguably more predictable than that of black swans, as climate change makes them unavoidable. But there are no historical comparisons to help us understand how climate and ecological risks such as cyclones, wildfires, droughts, and floods might affect the banking system, the insurance industry, or any number of other economic activities. As economic activity is reallocated from fossil fuels to clean energy sources, some activities will disappear, others will emerge, and the value of ""stranded assets"" will plummet. Although this process is necessary, it must be managed in a way that does not create instability in the financial system. Owing to their financial-stability mandate, central banks, supervisors, and macro-prudential authorities have a central role to play in the green transition. The recent Green Swan Conference organised by the Bank for International Settlements, the Banque de France, the International Monetary Fund, and the NGFS (Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System) points to a growing recognition of this fact, though the mobilisation remains too slow and too timid in some geographic areas. With an eye towards anticipating the effects of climate risk, the Banque de France was the first central bank to introduce a comprehensive climate stress test for banks and insurance companies. Analysing three 30-year climate scenarios devised by the NGFS (an orderly transition based on a low-carbon strategy; a disorderly, late transition; and a business-as-usual scenario), the test sought to assess banking and insurance portfolios' exposure to both physical and transition risks. This exercise showed that the French system's current exposure is only moderate (under the assumptions used). More important, the climate stress test demonstrated what it will take to improve our understanding of climate risk. There is much more work to do. For example, we still lack databases detailing the geographical conditions throughout global value chains. This information is essential to assess physical risks to production, and it would also be useful for monitoring social and environmental governance issues more broadly. The increased frequency and severity of weather-related disasters will gradually come to be reflected in insurance coverage and costs, affecting profitability and the default rates of loan portfolios in the banking sector. At the same time, bankers and asset managers will be adjusting their portfolios accordingly. And if the price of carbon continues to rise, as it should, they will move away from carbon-intensive sectors, increasing their exposure to other risk factors. These time-varying behaviours (and their knock-on effects) will matter for financial stability; but they are difficult to model. Still, a few essential policies would greatly help macro-prudential authorities and investors manage the change. First, those embarking on the green transition will need a compass: there should be a fully predictable increase in the carbon price across as wide an economic area as possible. The European Union could be on the right track here with its Emissions Trading System, wherein the price of carbon has risen from \€ 25 ($30) per tonne in January 2020 to \€ 50 per tonne today. But progress remains limited, because the ETS covers only about 40 per cent of EU emissions. As a recent G30 report shows, credible commitments to deliver a predictably increasing carbon price are needed to enable investors, regulators, and monetary policymakers to adjust their strategies in a forward-looking manner. In their absence, we will be unable to unleash public and private investment in the structural adjustments needed to reduce the costs of the broader transition. To achieve this, independent carbon councils can manage carbon-price inflation in a similar manner to how central banks manage inflation affecting the prices of goods. These institutions should have a mandate to map out a carbon-price-inflation path aligned with their respective governments' 2050 net-zero objectives. These policies must be accompanied by compensation of those most affected by a decline in purchasing power, owing, for example, to an increase in fuel prices. Capital requirements for financial institutions could be linked to their exposure to a rising carbon price, which would change their calculated probability of defaults and losses on their portfolio. Supervisors also will need to ensure that financial institutions establish effective governance systems to deal with climate risk. Unlike what happened with shadow banks, whose growth reflected an ability to circumvent stricter banking regulations, we should endeavour to track ""shadow emitters"" very closely. The US Environmental Protection Agency recently revealed that five of the top 10 methane emitters in the United States are little-known oil and gas producers, backed by little-known investment firms. We should expect that private equity firms will try to acquire risky oil and gas properties, develop them, and sell them at a profit. But we cannot tolerate ""below-the-radar"" investors buying up carbon-intensive assets at fire-sale prices and then operating them in lax jurisdictions. Preventing this will require a high global floor on carbon prices, carbon border adjustment taxes, or both. The cost of capital for such investments must become prohibitively high, even if it means adjusting the regulatory perimeter. A final key climate-policy component is mandatory disclosures of CO2 emissions and a framework for harmonising those disclosures globally in order to enforce universal minimum standards. This idea is already gaining momentum and may become more concrete after the United Nations climate summit ( COP26 ) in November. Transparency is crucial for all market participants. It is incumbent on the institutions in charge of financial stability to ensure that green swans do not turn black.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE324","UAE well positioned to provide low cost, low carbon energy as demand grows","May 21, 2021 Friday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","ABU DHABI, 21st May 2021 (WAM) - Dr. Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, UAE Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and Special Envoy for Climate Change said the UAE is well positioned to provide low cost, low carbon energy as global demand returns and is expected to increase in line with economic growth. Speaking during a virtual session of the Columbia Global Energy Summit, Dr. Al Jaber said that increased demand for cost-efficient, lower-carbon energy positions the UAE at a competitive advantage and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is focusing on low carbon production. ""The UAE's primary crude grade, Murban, is one of the least carbon-intensive in the world, with less than half the carbon intensity of the industry average. This creates a dual advantage for us \- low cost and low carbon. ""So, in a world that needs more energy with fewer emissions, the UAE is stepping up to expand our low carbon crude capacity,"" said Dr. Al Jaber. In a conversation with David Sandalow, Inaugural Fellow, Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia SIPA, he explained that oil and gas will continue to play a major role alongside a diversifying energy mix and that diversifying the country's energy mix is not only the responsible way forward, but can provide new economic opportunities. ""Using this approach, the UAE has grown its renewable investments from a low base fifteen years ago, to a leading position in the region. And today, thanks to the long-term commitment of our leadership, the UAE has three of the largest and lowest-cost solar projects in the world with significant renewable energy projects in thirty countries globally. ""In order to accelerate our progress on a lower carbon path, we need to leverage every clean energy source available, including wind, solar and other renewable energies. This comprehensive approach means also using nuclear energy,"" Dr. Al Jaber said. Dr Sultan went on to describe how the UAE is a partner of choice across the entire traditional and alternative energy landscape, including hydrogen, which shows great promise as a zero-carbon fuel that could be produced at scale as part of the existing hydrocarbon value chain, Dr. Al Jaber said. He added that the UAE is well-positioned to leverage its existing gas infrastructure to develop blue and green hydrogen. ""We are working with existing and new partners around the world to identify markets, map out value chains and develop a roadmap to create a hydrogen ecosystem to serve both the UAE and the global marketplace. This is just one area that demonstrates how the hydrocarbon industry can and should be at the center of the conversation on climate change and very much part of the solution."" During the session, Dr. Al Jaber touched on the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM4Climate) announced by the UAE and the United States with the support of seven other countries last month and shared insights on why the UAE is taking the lead on the initiative which is aimed at increasing research and development (R&D) investment and accelerating innovation into sustainable agricultural practices. ""The UAE has always taken a holistic view when it comes to climate solutions and Agriculture is sometimes overlooked as a significant source of emissions. Nearly a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture; that's basically the same GHG contribution as electricity generation. This is one of the reasons why the UAE joined with the US and a growing coalition of countries to launch AIM4Climate. ""As a country in an arid part of the world, we are already leveraging new technologies and innovative approaches to enable sustainable farming in desert conditions. We believe that by doubling down on investment in 4IR technologies, we can help the agricultural sector adapt to the impacts of climate change, reduce emissions, and also support growth, opportunity and jobs in the emerging agri-tech sector,"" Dr. Al Jaber said. Concluding the session, Dr. Al Jaber outlined his expectations for the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) taking place in Glasgow in November. He expressed cautious optimism and said he believes the world understands that progressive climate action is an opportunity for economic growth, particularly coming off the back of post-Covid recovery. ""What I find encouraging is that it is not only governments that get this, but the broader business community, across every industrial sector is also on board. You have basically got everyone on the same page. I expect healthy discussion and debate, but I fundamentally believe that we can accelerate progress on climate change if we avoid one-size-fits-all policies. ""Ultimately, I think the willingness is there to take a great leap forward at Glasgow, and the UAE is more than willing to play its role as a regional leader and global convener in progressive climate action,"" Dr. Al Jaber said. Organized by the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, the Global Energy Summit is gathering experts from around the world to focus on understanding trends shaping our current energy system, and what's ahead for energy policy, energy markets, geopolitics, technology, and efforts to reduce emissions and address climate change. Speakers at the event include Dr. Fatih Birol, Executive Director, International Energy Agency and Bernard Looney, CEO, BP. \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE325","Focus must be on ways to accelerate Global Britain","June 8, 2021 Tuesday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","Sceptics have long argued that the United Kingdom is past its peak and trading largely on former glories. They point to the country's middling rankings in the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment education scores, the fact that only one British firm, HSBC, is among the world's 50 largest public corporations, compared to Germany's four, and the likelihood that Brexit will ultimately erode, rather than boost, Britain's global standing. But I disagree with this judgment. After all, the UK is one of only a handful of countries to have produced an effective Covid-19 vaccine in record time. It remains at the forefront of shaping the global green-energy transition, and it was the first major economy to enact legislation requiring it to end its contribution to global warming by 2050. Moreover, the UK retains its traditional strengths of language, location and time zone, strong universities, and deep financial markets, and it remains a standard-bearer for the rule of law. When the UK hosts the upcoming G7 summit in Cornwall, political and business leaders will want to see how well aligned the country is with the three issues that, collectively, will upend global commerce and catalyse economic growth in the coming decades: engagement with China, technological innovation, and clean energy. With respect to China, Britain has considerable scope to increase bilateral trade. UK exports to China in 2019 were \£330.7 billion ($43.5 billion), little more than one-third of Germany's total of $110 billion. In fact, 2020 was the fifth successive year in which China was Germany's largest trading partner. Britain thus urgently needs to expand its trade and investment links with China, which is set to dominate the global economy. China is already the largest trading partner and foreign direct investor for many developed and developing countries, and it is now the largest lender to emerging-market economies  bigger than the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the Paris Club of sovereign creditors. Of course, human-rights concerns and ideological differences pose an ethical challenge for Britain when dealing with China. But stepping away from engagement with the Chinese political class would limit the UK's ability to influence the regime in Beijing and risk setting back the British economy. In terms of technology, Britain's role in developing the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine underscores its strengths in medical science innovation  as evidenced by a thriving biotech and life sciences sector. And yet the UK has yet to develop a technology company of global stature and renown, and recent stock-market activity has sent mixed messages to investors. The initial public offerings of food-delivery company Deliveroo and semiconductor technology firm Alphawave were challenged: both companies' share prices fell sharply on their first day of trading and remained below their launch price weeks later. But the UK is well positioned to benefit from investments and advances in emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, that will undoubtedly transform education and healthcare in the coming years. Moreover, the country has real opportunities to help allies plug technological gaps  not least in semiconductors, where America's share of global output has fallen from 37 per cent in 1990 to just 12 per cent today. To realise its potential as a science superpower, the UK needs a technology hub that can rival Silicon Valley in its dynamism. That will require aggressively and deliberately building an ecosystem of talent and collaboration across data science, technology, and public policy. For example, the Oxford-Cambridge arc already supports two million jobs and adds \£3110 billion to the UK economy each year. But to rise to the next level, this region must become a vibrant environment for innovation, and be far more visible to leading global investors. This is particularly important given that global foreign direct investment had fallen for three consecutive years (2016-18) even before plummeting 42 per cent in the annus pandemicus of 2020. On energy, the UK has been a global front-runner in mitigating climate risk through carbon sequestration and capture, and setting a net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions target. And it has an important opportunity to bolster its credentials as an environmental and green-energy leader when it hosts the United Nations COP26 climate summit this autumn. Crucially, the UK has a chance to shift the discourse so that the green transition is not only about limiting the economic downside but also about maximising the upside. In particular, government support for larger-scale investments in solar, wind, hydrogen, biofuels, hydropower, geothermal energy, Generation IV nuclear reactors, and new battery technologies would yield massive returns. If Britain is to lead in the energy transition, new technologies, and engagement with China, it must overcome several obstacles. Above all, the currently fragmented ""Global Britain"" agenda needs to reflect much closer cooperation between the public and private sectors, and become clearer about how to track execution and measure success. The UK has a strong hand to play. But playing it well will require greater political vision. British leaders should set in motion a grand scheme that creates a long-term legacy  in the spirit of the Manhattan Project during World War II to develop the first nuclear weapons, or the US government's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which enabled the subsequent development of Silicon Valley. As the world emerges from the pandemic, the UK, as host to two major international summits this year, will find itself in the global spotlight. It must capitalise on this unique opportunity and seek to reposition itself for the twenty-first century.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE326","UAE, US Climate Envoys meet to build momentum on climate action ahead of COP 26","June 14, 2021 Monday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","ABU DHABI, 14th June, 2021 (WAM) -- The UAE and US Special Envoys for Climate met for talks Sunday in Abu Dhabi focused on leveraging climate action as an opportunity for regional and global economic growth. The United States Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, John Kerry, returned to the UAE capital on his first visit following the Leaders Summit on Climate in Washington in April to rally progress ahead of COP 26 that will be held in Glasgow in November. Sec. Kerry was greeted on his arrival by Dr Sultan Al Jaber, the UAE's Special Envoy for Climate Change and Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology. The visit is John Kerry's second trip to Abu Dhabi since he attended the UAE Regional Climate Dialogue in April, underlining the close collaborative relationship between the US and UAE and their common approach placing climate progress at the heart of domestic and foreign policies. During their meeting, the envoys reaffirmed their countries' commitment to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, aimed at limiting global warming through assertive climate action. They noted that a comprehensive approach- including investments in renewable energy, carbon capture technologies, nature-based solutions, climate-smart agriculture, and other low-carbon solutions is not only essential in this critical decade for climate, but can also act as powerful drivers for sustainable economic growth and job creation. Commenting on Sec. Kerry's return to the UAE, Dr Al Jaber said, ""Our wise leadership in the UAE gives high importance to strengthening cooperation with the international community in areas that support sustainable development, economic diversification, the welfare of humanity and preserving the environment. Hence, I am delighted to receive the U.S. Special Envoy for Climate, Kerry. His return to the Emirates reaffirms the unique partnership between our two countries and our shared commitment to transform climate action into an opportunity for economic development and diversification."" ""Doubling down on investments in innovative new technologies and R&D will pay dividends both in terms of climate progress and economic growth, and as global economies fully recover from COVID-19, smart initiatives can put the world on a low carbon/high growth trajectory that meets the Paris goals."" The two envoys discussed progress on the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate Initiative (AIM for Climate) that the UAE announced alongside the US at the Leaders Summit on Climate in Washington in April. AIM for Climate is a global initiative currently supported by nine countries focused on increasing R&D investment and accelerating innovation into sustainable agricultural practices that can meet the needs of a growing global population with fewer environmental impacts. Recognising that the agricultural sector accounts for nearly a quarter of global GHG emissions, several additional country partners are expected to join the initiative in the months leading up to COP26 . During his visit, Sec. Kerry welcomed the UAE's offer to host the 28th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP28) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2023, stating, ""I think it's terrific that there's interest. I think it's great. I personally can see strong arguments for the UAE's candidacy. You know it's not my decision alone or ours alone, at all, but the UAE is obviously a very strong contender for that. I think there are many reasons for the UAE presenting a very strong case."" He went on to express appreciation for the country's leading role in the region, as well as its holistic approach to mitigate the impact of climate change. ""I think it is very important that an oil and gas producing nation is smart enough to see that investing in alternative and renewable energy does not detract from economic prosperity or from income. It actually builds additional and alternative sources. I think the leadership of the UAE is well aware that the planet has very serious problems, and the UAE is very busy looking at ways to abate and reduce and capture emissions. I think that's one of the reasons the UAE won a seat on the UN security council, because people see the leadership of the UAE as thoughtful and wanting to contribute to global solutions to global problems."" Sec Kerry's comments come after the joint statement issued by the UAE and the US after the UAE regional climate dialogue in April, in which both countries committed to working together to take on the climate challenge, by focusing joint efforts on renewable energy, hydrogen, industrial de-carbonization, carbon capture and storage, nature-based solutions, and low-carbon urban design. During his visit, Sec Kerry toured ADNOC's Panorama Digital Command Center, where he was shown the UAE's best in class tech-led approach to environmental responsibility within its hydrocarbon industry. Panorama uses AI, big data and blockchain to track all ADNOC's material data, including key environmental KPIs. ADNOC's established record as one of the least carbon intensive oil producers in the world is being enhanced by the expansion of its first in the region carbon capture utilization and storage facility. The UAE's multi-faceted approach to climate action cuts across innovation, climate finance and protection of natural ecosystems. As part of its multipronged approach to deal with climate change, the UAE has undertaken major conservation efforts that have brought indigenous endangered species, such as the Arabian Oryx and Hawksbill Turtle back from the brink of extinction. Over 140 square kilometres of mangrove forests along Abu Dhabi's coast have also been restored and 30 million more mangroves will be planted by 2030, further enhancing biodiversity while preventing coastal erosion and acting as powerful carbon sinks. These measures not only reduce the cost of climate impacts, but generate returns from improved human health, increasing quality of life and enhancing the UAE as an attractive place to live and work. \"
"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE327","WAM Report: UAE leads on global climate action through green economy plans","June 22, 2021 Tuesday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","DUBAI, 22nd June, 2021 (WAM) -- The UAE attaches great importance to protecting the environment in its development policy, an approach it has adopted since 2012 through the 'UAE Green Growth Strategy', to transform its economy into a green economy by utilising modern technologies, knowledge, and innovation. The green and digital economy will become the starting point for recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic, the UAE has announced. The leadership considers the green economy as a tool to control economic growth and direct it towards sustainable development. It also focuses on protecting the environment, climate, natural resources and improving the quality of life. The UAE has won international leadership positions in the competitiveness indicators of the energy sector in general, and clean energy in particular, after seven international references agreed to classify it among the top 10 countries in the world with 18 sector-specific indicators in 2020. Despite the major challenges and economic slowdown worldwide in 2020, renewable energy has surfaced as a real alternative that heralds a better future. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), stated that production capacity from renewable energy reached record levels surpassing past amounts and estimates. Some 260 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy were added globally, making around a 50 percent increase compared to the amount added in 2019. The renewable energy share has significantly increased for the second consecutive year, making 80 percent of the total generation capacity in the past year, with solar and wind accounting for 91 percent of new renewables. The UAE is among leading countries in adopting effective policies, such as the economic diversity policy which focuses on a green economy and diversifying energy sources. This is through capacity-building in clean and renewable energy, enhancing energy efficiency, transport, and sustainable urban planning. It is also at the forefront of regional countries in climate change policies since the Paris Agreement. In the beginning, it was committed to increasing its clean energy capacity to 24 percent by 2021. Later, this increased to 50 percent by 2050. The UAE adopts and shares an inspiring vision with the rest of the countries worldwide, working to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2030, and mitigate the effects of climate change and global warming. To achieve this, several federal and national strategies have been launched to consolidate sustainable development and shift to clean energy. Currently, Abu Dhabi and Dubai are making considerable advances in the generation and development of clean energy sources, mainly solar power. Recently, the world's biggest solar photovoltaic plant of 1,177MW at Sweihan in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi was commissioned on an Independent Power Producer (IPP) basis. Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) is currently implementing the fourth and fifth phases of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park. This will be the largest single-site solar park in the world with a planned capacity of 5,000 megawatts (MW) by 2030. Combining CSP and photovoltaic technology based on the IPP model, the fourth phase is the largest single-site CSP project in the world. The 950MW project has the world's tallest solar power tower measuring 262.44 metres in height and the largest thermal storage capacity in the world of 15 hours, generating power around the clock. ""His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, launched the World Green Economy Organisation (WGEO) in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in 2016. We are striving to achieve this transition through the UAE Energy Strategy 2050, to increase the contribution of clean energy in the total energy mix to 50 percent by 2050, and the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050 to provide 75 percent of Dubai's total power capacity from clean energy sources by 2050. DEWA's efforts have resulted in a huge reduction of carbon emissions in Dubai,'said Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, MD & CEO of DEWA. Carbon emissions in Dubai were reduced by 22 percent in 2019, two years ahead of the target set by the Carbon Abatement Strategy to reduce it by 16 percent by 2021. Clean energy capacity in Dubai has reached nine percent of the energy mix in 2020, surpassing the target of Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050 to provide seven percent of Dubai's total power capacity from clean energy sources by 2020,"" he added. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the demand for hydrogen as a power source has grown threefold in the past few decades, and its global production is estimated at 70 million metric tonnes annually. As a result, the costs of producing hydrogen are projected to fall by 64 percent by 2040. The country has already started pilot projects to position itself in the global hydrogen market. Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) set up the Green Hydrogen project, the first solar-powered green hydrogen production facility in the Middle East and North Africa. Located at the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, the plant is built to accommodate future applications and test platforms for the different uses of hydrogen, including potential mobility and industrial uses. Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company (Masdar) partnered with the Abu Dhabi Department of Energy, Etihad Airways, Lufthansa, Khalifa University for Science and Technology, Siemens, and Marubeni Corporation, in an initiative to support the development of Abu Dhabi's green hydrogen economy. They will establish a demonstration plant at Masdar City to explore the development of green hydrogen, sustainable fuels and e-kerosene production for transport, shipping, and aviation. DEWA is implementing a hydroelectric power station in Hatta, the first of its kind in the Arabian Gulf. It will generate electricity from a reservoir at Hatta Dam, delivering production capacity of around 250MW, with a storage capacity of 1,500MW and a life span of 80 years. As part of DEWA's space programme, Space-D will build DEWA's capabilities and train Emirati professionals to use space technologies to enhance its electricity and water networks. The programme will take advantage of Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain to exchange information with the help of satellite communications and earth observation technologies. The project features the launch of the main satellite equipped with the latest imaging and satellite communication technologies, which will take place in conjunction with Expo 2020 Dubai. The performance and efficiency of the photovoltaic solar panels at the solar park will be monitored using special cameras on the main satellite, which will also help study the impact of weather and climate change on energy infrastructure and supply. The Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MoCCAE) will host the MENA Climate Week 2022 from 23rd March, 2022, on the side-lines of Expo 2020 Dubai. The first-of-its-kind in the Middle East and North Africa, the event intends to increase the momentum of climate action in the region. The MENA Climate Week 2022 will convene leaders from the public and private sectors and society to discuss the serious threat of climate change, and collaborate on swift, bold actions to address this challenge.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE328","A global incentive to reduce emissions","June 7, 2021 Monday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","With President Joe Biden's administration recommitting the United States to the Paris climate agreement, and with a major United Nations climate-change conference ( COP26 ) coming later this year, there is new hope for meaningful global policies to meet the challenge. But while mounting evidence of increasing climate volatility  unprecedented wildfires in Australia, droughts in California and Sub-Saharan Africa, intensifying hurricane and cyclone seasons  suggests that we must move fast in curbing planet-warming greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions, there are serious impediments to concluding any new global accord. Economists generally agree that the way to reduce GHG emissions is to tax them. But such taxes almost certainly will cause disruptive economic changes in the short run, which is why discussions of imposing them tend to run quickly into free-rider or fairness problems. For example, industrialised countries such as the US are concerned that while they work hard to reduce emissions, developing countries will keep pumping them out with abandon. But at the same time, developing countries like Uganda point out that there is profound inequity in asking a country that emitted just 0.13 tonnes of carbon dioxide per capita in 2017 to bear the same burden as the US or Saudi Arabia, with their respective per capita emissions of 16 and 17.5 tonnes. The least costly way to reduce global emissions would be to give every country similar incentives. While India should not keep building more dirty coal plants as it grows, Europe should be closing down the plants it already has. But each country will want to reduce emissions in its own way  some through taxation, others through regulation. The question, then, is how to balance national-level priorities with global needs so that we can save the one world we have. The economic solution is simple: a global carbon incentive (GCI). Every country that emits more than the global average of around five tonnes per capita would pay annually into a global incentive fund, with the amount calculated by multiplying the excess emissions per capita by the population and the GCI. If the GCI started at $10 per tonne, the US would pay around $36 billion, and Saudi Arabia would pay $4.6 billion. Meanwhile, countries below the global per capita average would receive a commensurate payout (Uganda, for example, would receive around $2.1 billion). This way, every country would face an effective loss of $10 per capita for every additional tonne that it emits per capita, regardless of whether it started at a high, low, or average level. There would no longer be a free-rider problem, because Uganda would have the same incentives to economise on emissions as the US. The GCI also would address the fairness problem. Low emitters, which are often the poorest countries and the ones most vulnerable to climatic changes they did not cause, would receive a payment with which they could help their people adapt. If the GCI is raised over time, the collective sums paid out would approach the $100 billion per year that rich countries promised to poor countries at COP15 in 2009. That would far exceed the meager sums that have been made available thus far. Better still, the GCI would assign responsibility for payments in a feasible way, because big emitters typically are in the best position to pay. Moreover, the GCI would not snuff out domestic experimentation. It recognises that what a country does domestically is its own business. Instead of levying a politically unpopular carbon tax, one country might impose prohibitive regulations on coal, another might tax energy inputs, and a third might incentivise renewables. Each one charts its own course, while the GCI supplements whatever moral incentives are already driving action at the country level. The beauty of the GCI is its simplicity and self-financing structure. But it would require one adjustment in how per capita emissions are computed. What is consumed is as important as how it is produced, so there will need to be some accounting for the portion of emissions embedded in imported goods; these will need to be added to the importer's emissions tally and subtracted from the exporter's. Also, most experts would regard a $10 GCI as too low. But the point is to start small in order to get the scheme going and iron out the kinks. After that, the GCI can easily be raised by common agreement (or reduced, if there were some miraculous breakthrough in emissions-reduction technology). But to avoid creating uncertainty after an initial period of calibration, changes might be considered only every five years or so. What about alternative proposals that have global effects? Some industrialised countries plan to impose a domestic carbon tax alongside a border-adjustment tax, effectively applying the same tax rate to goods coming in from countries that do not have a carbon tax. The border taxes might push other countries to impose their own carbon taxes, but it certainly would not improve fairness. On the contrary, they would let large importing countries impose their tax preferences on poor exporting countries and might serve as a Trojan horse for protectionism. To be sure, the bureaucrats who dominate international meetings will want to dismiss this proposal as ""interesting but simplistic"" (or words to that effect). The most powerful countries are also the biggest emitters, and few want to pay into a global fund, especially in these times of massive budget overruns. But a GCI is by far the best option available. As rich countries cast about for remedies to domestic inequality, they should spare a thought for inequality between countries, which the pandemic and the unequal vaccine rollout will only worsen. Developing countries feel abandoned today. A fair proposal for reducing emissions would go some way toward reassuring them that they do not live on another planet. And it would give everyone a greater incentive to save this one. Raghuram G.

Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Vice Chairman of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy in Dubai, and Chairman of WGES, said, ""The UAE has a leading position to support global efforts in clean and renewable energy through its strategies and investments in this area. The UAE has played a key role in the negotiations that led to the Paris Agreement. It has presented its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The UAE's hosting of the Regional Climate Dialogue in April 2021 is a new reflection of its role in fighting climate change, the commitment to focusing on climate change as an issue, and achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2030. ""The event comes amid the extraordinary circumstances imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the urgent need to merge international efforts to accelerate recovery, find smart and sustainable solutions to mitigate climate change effects. The UAE's endeavour to host the 28th Climate Change Conference (COP28) in Abu Dhabi in 2023 reflects the UAE's efforts to find out global solutions for the challenges that face the planet,"" he added. ""The WGES supports the Emirates Green Agenda 2030, and the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050. The wise leadership directs to change challenges into opportunities. The WGES tries to change climate work into opportunities for development and economic diversity. It focuses on the economic benefits of the accelerating climate work to achieve a green economy,"" Al Tayer further stated. Suhail Al Mazrouei, Minister of Energy and Infrastructure, noted, ""The UAE is one of the leading countries in the world supporting the green economy system and international efforts in the field of clean energy. It has set its long-term goals in the field of energy, and for this, it has launched the National Energy Strategy 2050, through which it seeks to reduce energy demand by 40 percent, raise the contribution of clean energy in the total energy mix produced in the country to 50 percent, and create a mix of energy."" ""During a record period, the UAE was able to expand in the field of clean energy thanks to the legislations and laws that kept pace with the current developments and future challenges, and set ambitious goals for the future, which in turn strengthened the investment system in this vital sector that is the centrepiece of the national economy. The World Green Economy Summit is a major supporter of the UAE's efforts and endeavours to achieve a balance between energy and the environment, and to draw the features of a sustainable future capable of transforming challenges into opportunities, in line with the provisions of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Our ambition is great, and our successes are continuous, and we will not stop at the achievements we have made by entering the UAE into the top 20 countries globally in 8 indicators related to climate change and the environment for the year 2020, but we will continue to work with stakeholders and our strategic partners locally, regionally and internationally during the next fifty years, to achieve more success that will certainly lead us to global leadership,"" added Al Mazrouei. Dr Abdullah Belhaif Al Nuaimi, Minister of Climate Change and Environment, said, ""In its integrated approach to climate action, the UAE combines future-centred policies that drive the development of the green economy, the clean energy transition, and incorporating climate action across sectors with programmes and initiatives that expedite the implementation of these policies to build a better future for the current and next generations."" ""A key pillar of achieving this priority is creating international platforms that scale up and accelerate collective climate action. WGES is at the forefront of these platforms, as it underscores the UAE's global leadership in increasing the deployment of renewables and supporting decision-making for the shift to clean energy and a green economy. As the world sets its sights on a green post-COVID-19 recovery and robust climate action, the seventh edition of the Summit holds special importance,"" he added. Dr. Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and UAE Special Envoy for Climate Change, said, ""The World Green Economy Summit has made a valuable contribution in support of the UAE's efforts to advance the UN Sustainable Development Goals, with a particular focus around renewable and clean energy solutions.

His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum launched the World Green Economy Organisation (WGEO) in collaboration with the UN Development Programme (UNDP) during the WGES 2016. This aims to enhance the transition to a green economy and the dissemination of green economy projects at a global level, as well as support countries and organisations seeking to achieve their strategies and green plans. The WGEO and the UAE Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE) will host the 'MENA Climate Week 2022', in collaboration with the UNDP, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), UN Climate Change, the UNFCCC, and the World Bank Group. The UAE will be hosting this first of its kind event in the Middle East and North Africa from 2 to March 3, 2022, on the sidelines of Expo 2020 Dubai. The event enhances momentum on climate action in the region. The MENA Climate Week 2022 will convene leaders from the government, private sector, and civil society to discuss the serious threat of climate change, and collaborate on swift, bold actions to address this challenge. The event offers a wealth of opportunities for collaboration and showcases ground-breaking technologies that can help the region adapt to climate change. Stakeholders have a unique opportunity to reflect and revise their country's climate action plans to effectively address societal, environmental, and economic impacts. Participants will also be able to follow up on the discussions raised during the 26th Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in November 2021 in Glasgow, UK. The establishment of the Regional Cooperation Centre (RCC) for the Middle East and North Africa, as well as the hosting of Regional Ministerial Conferences by the WGEO to enhance cooperation between the countries of the world, is a testament of global efforts to march towards a sustainable future. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) said that the production capacity of renewable energy added in 2020 has reached record levels and surpassed all previous records. By the end of 2020, the renewable energy capacity had reached 2,799 megawatts (MW). Hydroelectric power had the largest share with 1,211 gigawatts (GW), whereas wind and solar power continue their rapid growth. These two sources controlled the installed production capacity in 2020 with 172 GWs of solar and 111 GWs of wind energy. The MENA region has recorded an increasing interest in a green economy, as Saudi Arabia has launched the Saudi Green and Middle East Green initiatives, which will lead the Kingdom and the region's direction in protecting land and nature, placing it on a roadmap with clear and ambitious milestones that will strongly contribute to achieving global targets. \"

Worsening climate change and a need to diversify away from fossil fuels has spurred global action to transform the way we produce and consume energy. Investment in new power generation is expected to be $13.3tr before 2050. Clean growth presents the most significant economic growth opportunity of the 21st century. We will make the most of the UK's COP26 presidency in November to encourage business, governments, and investors to commit to change. The UK pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 78 percent by 2035, the fastest fall in greenhouse gas emissions of any major economy, bringing the UK closer to its ambition of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Since 1990, the UK economy has grown by two thirds, while emissions have fallen by over 40 percent, demonstrating that economic growth goes hand-in-hand with protecting the environment. \"

Dr. Mohamed bin Mubarak bin Daina, Beauftragter f\'fcr Klimaangelegenheiten und Chef des Obersten Umweltrates von Bahrain, sagte: ""Wir haben uns verpflichtet, unsere Emissionen bis 2060 auf Null zu reduzieren, aber wir haben uns auch verpflichtet, unsere Emissionen bis 2025 um 10 Prozent und bis 2035 um 20 Prozent zu senken. Wir haben uns auch verpflichtet, einen m\'f6glichst effizienten und erschwinglichen Energiemix bereitzustellen. Wir m\'fcssen den Entwicklungsl\'e4ndern helfen, zu wachsen, und d\'fcrfen ihrem Wachstum keine Hindernisse in den Weg legen"". Jo\'e3o Galamba, stellvertretender Minister und Staatssekret\'e4r f\'fcr Energie, Portugal, kommentierte: ""Es gibt eine positive Beziehung zwischen erneuerbaren Energien im Allgemeinen und gr\'fcnem Wasserstoff. Wir haben jetzt die Bedingungen geschaffen, unter denen Wasserstoff kein Hype sein kann; er muss Realit\'e4t werden. Wasserstoff l\'f6st einige der Probleme der erneuerbaren Energien und die erneuerbaren Energien machen Wasserstoff m\'f6glich. L\'e4nder, die in ihrem Mix aus erneuerbaren Energien wettbewerbsf\'e4hig sind, werden auch bei der Erzeugung von Wasserstoff wettbewerbsf\'e4hig sein. Die Verbraucher mit ins Boot zu holen, ist ein entscheidender Erfolgsfaktor f\'fcr jede Dekarbonisierungsstrategie"". Dr. Aissatou Sophie Gladima, Ministerin f\'fcr Erd\'f6l und Energie, Senegal, sagte: ""Heute stammen im Senegal 2 Prozent des Stroms aus sauberer Energie, aus Windenergie, und das Ziel ist, diesen Anteil zu erh\'f6hen. Aufgrund der geografischen Gegebenheiten m\'fcssen wir jedoch unsere abgelegenen Gebiete elektrifizieren, und dazu m\'fcssen wir gr\'fcne Energie erzeugen und mehr Strom aus Energien wie Erdgas gewinnen. Die Energiewende muss auf faire, transparente und zunehmende Weise erfolgen, und alle afrikanischen L\'e4nder m\'fcssen zusammenarbeiten, um diese Grunds\'e4tze zu verteidigen"". Dr. Alparslan Bayraktar, stellvertretender Minister, Ministerium f\'fcr Energie und nat\'fcrliche Ressourcen, T\'fcrkei, sagte: ""Alles, was wir brauchen, ist politisches Engagement und Bereitschaft sowie ein pragmatischer und kreativer Ansatz, um dies zu verwirklichen. Wir glauben, dass Gas bei diesem \'dcbergang eine wichtige Rolle spielen kann, und wir m\'fcssen diesen \'dcbergang erfolgreich bew\'e4ltigen"". Anfang dieses Monats gab das Rahmen\'fcbereinkommen der Vereinten Nationen \'fcber Klima\'e4nderungen (UNFCCC) offiziell bekannt, dass die VAE im Jahr 2023 Gastgeber der 28. Die Best\'e4tigung der UNFCCC folgte auf die einstimmige Billigung durch die Asien-Pazifik-Gruppe w\'e4hrend der COP26 in Glasgow. Auf der COP26 Ein weiterer Programmpunkt der ADIPEC 2021 Strategiekonferenz war die Teilnahme von Paul Polman, ehemaliger CEO von Unilever und Ko-Vorsitzender der Global Commission for Economy & Climate, an einer Live-Sitzung, in der er seine Erkenntnisse \'fcber die Entstehung und Anpassungsf\'e4higkeit der Kreislaufwirtschaft, ihren Beitrag zur nachhaltigen globalen Entwicklung und die Bedeutung der UN-Ziele f\'fcr nachhaltige Entwicklung f\'fcr Regierungen, Unternehmen und B\'fcrger mitteilte. Es folgte eine Live-Sitzung mit Tarek El Molla, dem Minister f\'fcr Erd\'f6l und Mineralressourcen der Arabischen Republik \'c4gypten, der \'fcber \'c4gyptens Energiezukunft, die Pl\'e4ne und den weiteren Weg der Branche sprach und einen \'dcberblick \'fcber das East Mediterranean Gas Forum und das \'e4gyptische Modernisierungsprojekt gab. Die Live-Sitzungen am Nachmittag behandelten Themen wie ""Intelligente St\'e4dte und die Zukunft der Nachhaltigkeit: Wie ver\'e4ndert sich die Zukunft der Mobilit\'e4t?"", ""Aufbau einer innovativen und kreativen Welt"", ""Die Zukunft der Energie: Wie die Geopolitik die Welt ver\'e4ndert"" und ""Warum sich Gesellschaften und Arbeitspl\'e4tze ver\'e4ndern: Wie Unternehmen nach einer Pandemie widerstandsf\'e4hig werden"". Die ADIPEC-Strategiekonferenz wird bis zum 17. November unter dem Thema ""Aufbau des Energieunternehmens der Zukunft: neue Gesch\'e4ftsmodelle und Investitionsstr\'f6me"" und am 18. November unter dem Thema ""Transformationstechnologien: Entfesselung der Motoren des Wandels"" fortgesetzt. Die ADIPEC 2021 wird vom VAE-Ministerium f\'fcr Energie und Infrastruktur, dem VAE-Ministerium f\'fcr Industrie und Hochtechnologie, dem Ministerium f\'fcr Kommunen und Verkehr, der Kammer von Abu Dhabi, dem Ministerium f\'fcr Kultur und Tourismus von Abu Dhabi und dem Ministerium f\'fcr Bildung und Wissen unterst\'fctzt. \'dcbersetzt von: Magdy Elserougy.

Tenutosi con il patrocinio del presidente Sua Altezza lo sceicco Khalifa bin Zayed AlNahyan e ospitato dalla Compagnia petrolifera nazionale di Abu Dhabi (ADNOC) dal 15 al 18 novembre ad Abu Dhabi, la conferenza strategica ADIPEC 2021 ha fornito l£mbiente perfetto per raccogliere l'energia del mondo Ministri e responsabili politici per tracciare un percorso chiaro affinch\'e9 l'industria energetica si allinei con i risultati della COP26 e per modellare la politica del governo e il comportamento dell'industria nei mesi e negli anni a venire. Lo stimato gruppo di ministri dell'Energia di Bahrain, Portogallo, Senegal e Turchia ha evidenziato la crescente importanza del gas naturale e l'importanza di sostenere i paesi in via di sviluppo durante la transizione energetica come fattori critici che alimentano il futuro attraverso un nuovo ecosistema energetico sostenuto dalle preoccupazioni e dalle emissioni climatiche -obiettivi di riduzione. Il dott. Mohamed bin Mubarak bin Daina, inviato per gli affari climatici e amministratore delegato del Consiglio supremo per l£mbiente, Bahrain, ha dichiarato: ""Abbiamo assunto il nostro impegno [a zero netto] entro il 2060, ma ci siamo anche impegnati a ridurre emissioni del 10 percento nel 2025 e del 20 percento entro il 2035. Ci impegniamo inoltre a fornire il mix energetico pi\'f9 efficiente e conveniente. Dobbiamo aiutare i paesi in via di sviluppo a crescere e non porre ostacoli alla loro crescita"". Jo\'e3o Galamba, Vice Ministro e Segretario di Stato per l'Energia, Portogallo, ha commentato: ""C'\'e8 una relazione virtuosa tra le rinnovabili in generale e l'idrogeno verde. Ora abbiamo creato le condizioni in base alle quali gli idrogeni non possono essere esaltati; deve essere una realt\'e0. L'idrogeno risolve alcuni dei problemi delle rinnovabili e le rinnovabili rendono possibile l'idrogeno. I paesi che sono competitivi nel loro mix rinnovabile saranno competitivi nella produzione di idrogeno. Coinvolgere i consumatori \'e8 un fattore critico di successo per qualsiasi strategia di decarbonizzazione"". La dott.ssa Aissatou Sophie Gladima, ministro del petrolio e dell'energia, Senegal, ha dichiarato: ""Oggi, in Senegal, il 2 percento dell'elettricit\'e0 proviene da energia pulita, dall'energia eolica, quindi l'obiettivo \'e8 aumentare questo livello. Tuttavia, a causa dei vincoli geografici, dobbiamo elettrificare le nostre aree remote e per farlo dobbiamo creare energia verde e produrre pi\'f9 energia da energie come il gas naturale. La transizione energetica deve essere fatta in modo equo, trasparente e in modo crescente, tutti i paesi africani devono lavorare insieme per difendere questi principi"". Il dott. Alparslan Bayraktar, viceministro del Ministero delle risorse naturali dell'energia, Turchia, ha dichiarato: ""L'infrastruttura \'e8 l\'ec, le fonti sono l\'ec, tutto ci\'f2 di cui abbiamo bisogno \'e8 l'impegno e la volont\'e0 politici, e un approccio pragmatico e creativo per far s\'ec che ci\'f2 accada.

Intanto, proseguono le tensioni nell'Europa orientale e al confine con la Bielorussia, mentre Mosca intensifica gli sforzi militari lungo il confine ucraino ricordando gli eventi di 7 anni fa. Ecco i principali market mover di questo venerd\'ec: 1. Lavoro e aspettative di inflazione in primo piano Il mercato del lavoro statunitense - e la sua capacit\'e0 di guidare l'inflazione - saranno nuovamente al centro dell£ttenzione con il Dipartimento del Lavoro che pubblicher\'e0 il dato mensile sulle aperture di nuovi lavori. Gli analisti prevedono che il numero di posti vacanti sia leggermente diminuito a ottobre a 10,30 milioni da 10,44 milioni a settembre. Le attese non sono molto lontane dal record storico di 11,10 milioni registrato ad agosto, e sono quasi 3 milioni oltre il picco pre-pandemia nel 2019. Inoltre, l'Universit\'e0 del Michigan comunicher\'e0 il sondaggio sulla fiducia dei consumatori per novembre, in cui \'e8 probabile che l£ttenzione si concentri sul sottoindice delle aspettative di inflazione, che il mese scorso ha raggiunto il livello pi\'f9 alto dal 2008. 2. Scontro Russia/Europa S'intensificano le tensioni tra Mosca e Bruxelles, dopo che\~l Cremlino ha di nuovo concentrato diverse truppe lungo il confine ucraino, spingendo i diplomatici statunitensi ad avvertire l'UE che potrebbe esserci una nuova incursione nel paese come quella di sette anni fa. Mosca sta inoltre, portando avanti esercitazioni militari congiunti con la Bielorussia vicino alla citt\'e0 di Grodno nel nord-ovest della Bielorussia, al confine con Polonia e Lituania. Nel frattempo, continua lo scontro tra le forze di frontiera polacche e i migliaia di migranti deliberatamente al confine dal presidente bielorusso Alexander Lukashenko, il quale ha minacciato di interrompere le forniture di gas russo attraverso il principale gasdotto Yamal-Europa gioved\'ec. La mossa aumenta indirettamente la pressione sull'Europa per dare l'ok alle importazioni del gas russo attraverso il gasdotto Nord Stream 2. Il Rublo, una delle valute pi\'f9 performanti dell£nno, \'e8 sceso contro il dollaro per il terzo giorno consecutivo ai minimi di cinque settimane. 3. Borse Equity europee\~poco mosse ma impostate per segnare la sesta settimana consecutiva in positivo, con i titoli del lusso in forte rialzo sulla scia dei buoni risultati della proprietaria di Cartier, Richemont (SIX:CFR). Il DAX segna il +01,%, il\~FTSE MIB il -0,1%, il\~CAC 40 al +0,2% e lo Euro Stoxx 50 al +0,1%. 4. Si chiude la COP26 La conferenza sul clima COP26 \'e8 giunta ad una conclusione senza il successo sperato, dopo che il comunicato congiunto finale ha annacquato l'ennesimo impegno per andare oltre i combustibili fossili e contrastare i rischi dei cambiamenti climatici. Una bozza della dichiarazione finale del vertice ha ammorbidito il linguaggio sull'eliminazione graduale dell'energia a carbone e sulla rimozione dei sussidi per l'uso di combustibili fossili, in gran parte su insistenza dei paesi arabi, stando a Reuters. Nei giorni scorsi, era salito l'ottimismo dopo l£ccordo tra Cina e Stati Uniti sulla riduzione delle emissioni e dopo che il G20 di Roma si era faticosamente accordato sulle temperature da rispettare nei prossimi anni. Il Partito Comunista cinese ha eletto il presidente Xi Jinping per un altro mandato eliminando il limite dei quattro mandati, di fatto eleggendo Xi come presidente a vita. Il Comitato Centrale ha invitato il Paese a unirsi ""intorno al Partito con Xi al centro"" per una ""risoluzione storica"", e richiamando l£ttenzione su Hong Kong e sulla posizione cinese su Taiwan. Prima di lui, solo Mao e Deng Xiaping erano riusciti ad avviare la cosiddetta ""risoluzione storica"" rimanendo in carica fino alla loro morte, ma al contrario dei predecessori Xi avr\'e0 una ""posizione centrale"" nella nuova Cina, un linguaggio che lega indissolubilmente il destino di Pechino con quello del suo presidente.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE378","JOLTS, lucha en Rusia y fracaso de la COP26: 5 claves en Wall Street","12 Noviembre 2021 Viernes","Investing.com (Spanish)","Por Geoffrey Smith Investing.com - Los datos sobre las ofertas de empleo de Estados Unidos y la encuesta de la Universidad de Michigan sobre la confianza de los consumidores encabezan la agenda de un viernes tranquilo en cuanto a datos econ\'f3micos. Rusia mantiene a Europa en vilo con su agresiva postura en las fronteras de Ucrania y Polonia. Las acciones apuntan a una apertura al alza, pero todav\'eda van camino de cerrar la semana a la baja a causa de la inflaci\'f3n, y la COP26 ha terminado como empez\'f3, de forma claramente decepcionante. Aqu\'ed tenemos las cinco cuestiones principales de las que hay estar pendientes este viernes, 12 de noviembre, en los mercados financieros. 1. JOLTS, expectativas de inflaci\'f3n El mercado laboral de Estados Unidos  y su capacidad para impulsar la inflaci\'f3n volver\'e1 a estar en el centro de todas las miradas este viernes, cuando el Departamento de Trabajo publique su encuesta mensual de ofertas de empleo y rotaci\'f3n laboral. Los analistas esperan que el n\'famero de vacantes haya descendido ligeramente en octubre, hasta 10,30 millones frente a los 10,44 millones de septiembre, no muy lejos de los m\'e1ximos hist\'f3ricos registrado en agosto en 11,10 millones. Adem\'e1s, est\'e1 casi 3 millones por encima de su pico prepandemia de 2019. La Universidad de Michigan tambi\'e9n publica su encuesta sobre la confianza de los consumidores de noviembre; la atenci\'f3n se centrar\'e1 probablemente en el sub\'edndice de expectativas de inflaci\'f3n, que el mes pasado registr\'f3 su cota m\'e1s alta desde 2008. Dado el aluvi\'f3n de titulares sobre la inflaci\'f3n real que registr\'f3 m\'e1ximos de 30 a\'f1os en octubre, eso parece susceptible a una sorpresa al alza. 2. Rusia bravuconea ante Europa La bravuconer\'eda de Rusia ha alcanzado cotas de intensidad no vistas en a\'f1os, reforzando los esfuerzos de su aliado Bielorrusia para desviar las nuevas sanciones de la UE contra sus dirigentes por unas elecciones fraudulentas y la represi\'f3n pol\'edtica. El Kremlin ha vuelto a concentrar tropas en la frontera ucraniana, lo que ha llevado a los diplom\'e1ticos estadounidenses a advertir de que Rusia podr\'eda realizar una nueva incursi\'f3n en el pa\'eds que invadiera hace siete a\'f1os. Tambi\'e9n est\'e1 realizando ejercicios militares conjuntos con Bielorrusia cerca de la ciudad de Grodno, en el noroeste de Bielorrusia, que limita con Polonia y Lituania. Mientras tanto, contin\'faa el enfrentamiento entre los guardias de seguridad fronterizos polacos y los miles de inmigrantes entregados deliberadamente a la frontera por el presidente bielorruso Alexander Lukashenko. Lukashenko amenaz\'f3 el jueves con interrumpir el suministro de gas ruso a trav\'e9s del importante gasoducto Yamal-Europa. Aunque es poco probable que el Kremlin permita una politizaci\'f3n tan abierta de sus suministros de gas, la medida alimenta indirectamente la presi\'f3n que se ejerce sobre Europa para que permita el inicio de las exportaciones a trav\'e9s del gasoducto Nord Stream 2. El rublo  una de las divisas de mejor rendimiento del a\'f1o cay\'f3 frente al d\'f3lar por tercera jornada consecutiva, un 1%, hasta alcanzar m\'ednimos de cinco semanas. 3. Las acciones apuntan a una apertura al alza; los gigantes del comercio electr\'f3nico chino protagonizan de un D\'eda de los Solteros desigual Todo apunta a que los mercados de valores de Estados Unidos abrir\'e1n ligeramente al alza este viernes, pues la confianza determina la trayectoria en ausencia de noticias importantes que muevan el mercado. Entre las acciones que probablemente acaparar\'e1n la atenci\'f3n hoy se encuentran las de Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), que ha perdido casi un 20% esta semana en un contexto de perspectivas poco alentadoras (aun as\'ed cotiza a m\'e1s de 10 veces las ventas futuras). 4. La COP26 COP26 diluyeron una vez m\'e1s cualquier compromiso de dejar atr\'e1s los combustibles f\'f3siles y evitar el riesgo de un cambio clim\'e1tico catastr\'f3fico. El borrador de la declaraci\'f3n final de la cumbre suavizaba el discurso sobre la eliminaci\'f3n de la energ\'eda de carb\'f3n y la supresi\'f3n de las subvenciones al uso de combustibles f\'f3siles, en gran medida a causa de la insistencia de los pa\'edses \'e1rabes, seg\'fan Reuters. Esto se suma a los fracasos de esta semana en cuanto a la creaci\'f3n de un mercado mundial del carbono, el cumplimiento de promesas anteriores de ayudar a los pa\'edses m\'e1s pobres a financiar la transici\'f3n energ\'e9tica o el compromiso de realizar revisiones anuales del cumplimiento de las promesas de los pa\'edses. 5. Los precios del petr\'f3leo vuelven a caer lastrados por el d\'f3lar Los precios del petr\'f3leo crudo descienden, apenas por delante de la l\'ednea de ganancias de la semana, ya que el fortalecimiento del d\'f3lar sigue haciendo la vida m\'e1s dif\'edcil a los compradores no estadounidenses. A las 12:30 horas (CET), los futuros de petr\'f3leo estadounidenses bajan un 1,7% y se sit\'faan en 80,20 d\'f3lares por barril, amenazando con caer por debajo de los 80 d\'f3lares por primera vez esta semana. Los futuros del Brent se dejan un 1,5% hasta 81,67 d\'f3lares por barril. El recuento de plataformas activas de Baker Hughes ofrecer\'e1 este viernes nuevos indicios sobre si los productores estadounidenses est\'e1n acelerando los planes de producci\'f3n en respuesta a la reciente subida de los precios, o si siguen prefiriendo reparar los balances contables. La publicaci\'f3n de los datos de posicionamiento neto de la CFTC completar\'e1 la semana. Los datos de la semana pasada mostraron que los gestores de dinero no eran excesivamente optimistas en cuanto al petr\'f3leo, seg\'fan los est\'e1ndares hist\'f3ricos.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE382","JOLTS, sabre russe, \'e9chec de la COP26 - Ce qui fait bouger les march\'e9s ce vendredi","Vendredi 12 Novembre 2021","Investing.com (French)","Par Geoffrey Smith Investing.com -- Les donn\'e9es sur les emplois vacants aux \'c9tats-Unis et le sondage sur le sentiment des consommateurs de l'Universit\'e9 du Michigan sont les principales donn\'e9es \'e9conomiques d'un vendredi calme. La Russie maintient l'Europe sur le qui-vive avec des positions agressives aux fronti\'e8res de l'Ukraine et de la Pologne. Les actions sont en passe d£ugmenter mais sont toujours sur la voie d'une semaine de baisse marqu\'e9e par l'inflation, et le COP26 se termine comme il a commenc\'e9, de mani\'e8re nettement d\'e9cevante. Voici ce qu'il faut savoir sur les march\'e9s financiers ce vendredi 12 novembre. 1. JOLTS, les attentes d'inflation en ligne de mire Les analystes s£ttendent \'e0 ce que le nombre de postes vacants ait l\'e9g\'e8rement baiss\'e9 en octobre, passant de 10,44 millions en septembre \'e0 10,30 millions, mais ce chiffre n'est pas loin du record historique de 11,10 millions \'e9tabli en ao\'fbt. Il est \'e9galement sup\'e9rieur de pr\'e8s de 3 millions \'e0 son pic pr\'e9-pand\'e9mique de 2019. L'Universit\'e9 du Michigan publie \'e9galement son enqu\'eate sentiment du consommateur pour le mois de novembre, o\'f9 l£ccent sera probablement mis sur le sous-indice attentes d'inflation, qui a atteint son plus haut niveau depuis 2008 le mois dernier. Compte tenu de l£valanche de titres sur l'inflation r\'e9elle qui a atteint son plus haut niveau depuis 30 ans en octobre, cet indice semble vuln\'e9rable \'e0 une surprise \'e0 la hausse. 2. La Russie agite son sabre contre l'Europe Le bruit du sabre russe a atteint son niveau le plus \'e9lev\'e9 depuis des ann\'e9es, soutenant les efforts de son alli\'e9, le Belarus, pour d\'e9tourner les nouvelles sanctions de l'UE contre ses dirigeants, suite \'e0 des \'e9lections frauduleuses et \'e0 la r\'e9pression politique. Le Kremlin a de nouveau mass\'e9 des troupes \'e0 la fronti\'e8re ukrainienne, ce qui a incit\'e9 les diplomates am\'e9ricains \'e0 mettre en garde la Russie contre une nouvelle incursion dans le pays qu'elle a envahi il y a sept ans. Elle m\'e8ne \'e9galement des exercices militaires conjoints avec le Belarus pr\'e8s de la ville de Grodno, dans le nord-ouest du Belarus, qui a des fronti\'e8res avec la Pologne et la Lituanie. Pendant ce temps, l'impasse entre les gardes-fronti\'e8res polonais et les milliers de migrants d\'e9lib\'e9r\'e9ment livr\'e9s \'e0 la fronti\'e8re par le pr\'e9sident bi\'e9lorusse Alexandre Loukachenko se poursuit. Ce dernier a menac\'e9 jeudi d'interrompre les livraisons de gaz russe par le gazoduc Yamal-Europe. Bien qu'il soit peu probable que le Kremlin autorise une politisation aussi flagrante de ses approvisionnements en gaz, cette d\'e9cision accro\'eet indirectement la pression exerc\'e9e sur l'Europe pour qu'elle autorise le d\'e9but des exportations par le gazoduc Nord Stream 2. Le rouble - l'une des devises les plus performantes de l£nn\'e9e - a chut\'e9 face au dollar pour la troisi\'e8me journ\'e9e cons\'e9cutive, de 1 %, pour atteindre son plus bas niveau en cinq semaines. 3. Les actions devraient ouvrir en hausse ; les g\'e9ants chinois du commerce \'e9lectronique ont connu une journ\'e9e des c\'e9libataires mitig\'e9e Les march\'e9s boursiers am\'e9ricains devraient ouvrir en l\'e9g\'e8re hausse vendredi, le sentiment \'e9tant le moteur de la direction en l£bsence de nouvelles importantes pour le march\'e9. Vers 13h15, les Dow Jones futures \'e9taient en hausse de 78 points, soit 0,2%, et \'e9taient en passe de subir une perte hebdomadaire en raison des craintes croissantes d'inflation et de hausse des taux d'int\'e9r\'eat. Le contrat S&P 500 futures a augment\'e9 de 0,1% et le contrat Nasdaq 100 a \'e9galement progress\'e9 de 0,2%. Parmi les actions susceptibles de faire l'objet d'une attention particuli\'e8re, citons Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), qui a perdu pr\'e8s de 20 % cette semaine dans un contexte de perspectives plus faibles (elle se n\'e9gocie toujours \'e0 plus de 10 fois les ventes \'e0 terme). Les g\'e9ants chinois du commerce \'e9lectronique Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) et JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) seront \'e9galement au centre de l£ttention apr\'e8s avoir connu des fortunes diverses lors de leur \'e9v\'e9nement de vente ""singles day"". La valeur brute des marchandises trait\'e9es par la place de march\'e9 Taobao d'Alibaba a augment\'e9 de moins de 10% pour la premi\'e8re fois. 4. La COP26 La plus grande f\'eate de l£ir chaud du monde s'est achev\'e9e, comme \'e0 l£ccoutum\'e9e, par une conclusion d\'e9cevante \'e0 Glasgow, en \'c9cosse. Les n\'e9gociateurs de la conf\'e9rence COP26 ont en effet \'e9dulcor\'e9 une nouvelle promesse de d\'e9passer les combustibles fossiles et d'\'e9carter le risque d'un changement climatique catastrophique. Selon l£gence Reuters, le projet de d\'e9claration finale du sommet a adouci le langage relatif \'e0 l£bandon progressif de l'\'e9nergie au charbon et \'e0 la suppression des subventions \'e0 l'utilisation des combustibles fossiles, en grande partie sur l'insistance des pays arabes. Cela s£joute \'e0 l'incapacit\'e9, plus t\'f4t dans la semaine, de faire des progr\'e8s substantiels sur la cr\'e9ation d'un march\'e9 mondial du carbone, sur la mise en  uvre des promesses ant\'e9rieures d£ider les pays les plus pauvres \'e0 financer la transition \'e9nerg\'e9tique, ou sur l'engagement d'examiner chaque ann\'e9e la mani\'e8re dont les pays mettent en  uvre leurs promesses. Un accord sur les id\'e9aux \'e9nerg\'e9tiques \'e0 long terme n£ sans doute jamais \'e9t\'e9 r\'e9aliste, \'e9tant donn\'e9 la crise \'e9nerg\'e9tique \'e0 court terme qui touche actuellement de nombreuses r\'e9gions du monde, et l£bsence de Xi Jinping, qui a choisi de rester chez lui pour s£ssurer un mandat du Parti communiste lui permettant de gouverner aussi longtemps qu'il le souhaite. 5. Les prix du p\'e9trole chutent \'e0 nouveau en raison de la hausse du dollar Les prix du p\'e9trole brut ont chut\'e9 au cours de la nuit, les laissant \'e0 peine devant la ligne de gain pour la semaine, alors que la force du dollar continue de rendre la vie plus difficile aux acheteurs non am\'e9ricains. \'c0 13h30, les contrats \'e0 terme am\'e9ricains \'e9taient en baisse de 1,7 % \'e0 80,20 $ le baril, mena\'e7ant de passer sous la barre des 80 $ pour la premi\'e8re fois de la semaine. Les contrats \'e0 terme sur le Brent \'e9taient en baisse de 1,5 % \'e0 81,67 $ le baril. Le comptage de Baker Hughes donnera plus tard de nouvelles indications pour savoir si les producteurs am\'e9ricains acc\'e9l\'e8rent leurs plans de production en r\'e9ponse \'e0 la r\'e9cente flamb\'e9e des prix, ou s'ils continuent \'e0 pr\'e9f\'e9rer r\'e9parer leurs bilans. Les donn\'e9es de positionnement net de la CFTC cl\'f4tureront la semaine. Les donn\'e9es de la semaine derni\'e8re ont montr\'e9 que les gestionnaires de fonds n'\'e9taient pas excessivement longs sur le p\'e9trole, selon les normes historiques.

Dr. Al Jaber rief die Partner im \'f6ffentlichen und privaten Sektor dazu auf, sich den VAE und Masdar anzuschlie\'dfen, um diese ehrgeizigen Ziele zu erreichen, die zu neuen Industrien, neuen F\'e4higkeiten, neuen Arbeitspl\'e4tzen und neuen M\'f6glichkeiten f\'fchren werden. Auf eine Frage zu den Ergebnissen der COP26 (der 26. Klimakonferenz der Vereinten Nationen) antwortete Dr. Al Jaber, dass die Konferenz ein Erfolg war, da Glasgow 90 % der Weltwirtschaft auf dem Weg zum Netto-Nullverbrauch vereinte. ""Auf der COP 26 wurden auch viele Koalitionen zwischen Regierungen und Unternehmen ins Leben gerufen, um Innovationen zu beschleunigen. AIM for Climate, das die VAE zusammen mit den USA und 34 anderen L\'e4ndern ins Leben gerufen haben, ist ein gutes Beispiel daf\'fcr. Dabei handelt es sich um eine wachsende Koalition, die Investitionen in die Agrartechnologie lenkt, um die landwirtschaftlichen Emissionen zu reduzieren, die immerhin ein Drittel der weltweiten Emissionen ausmachen. Und auf der COP26 wurde endlich eine Einigung \'fcber Artikel 6 des Pariser Abkommens erzielt, der die Grundlage f\'fcr wirksame Kohlenstoffm\'e4rkte schafft. All dies schafft eine gro\'dfe Dynamik und eine gro\'dfartige Plattform, auf der \'c4gypten und die VAE aufbauen k\'f6nnen und werden."" In Bezug auf die COP28, die 2023 in Abu Dhabi stattfinden wird, betonte Dr. Al Jaber, dass dies die erste globale Bestandsaufnahme sein wird, die uns zeigen wird, wie wir die Ziele von Paris erreichen, und die vor allem den Fahrplan f\'fcr 2030 und dar\'fcber hinaus festlegen wird. Er f\'fcgte hinzu, dass die VAE bereits eng mit dem Vereinigten K\'f6nigreich und \'c4gypten zusammenarbeiten, um den Schwung der COP26 fortzusetzen, und erl\'e4uterte den Ansatz der VAE f\'fcr die COP28. ""Wir wollen, dass Abu Dhabi der Ort ist, an dem die Welt ihre Zusagen in konkrete Ergebnisse umwandelt und dazu beitr\'e4gt, dass wirtschaftlich tragf\'e4hige L\'f6sungen f\'fcr den Klimaschutz in der ganzen Welt zum Einsatz kommen. Deshalb wollen wir, dass die COP 28 so inklusiv wie m\'f6glich ist und die Ansichten von Industrie- und Entwicklungsl\'e4ndern, des \'f6ffentlichen und privaten Sektors sowie von Wissenschaftlern und der Zivilgesellschaft widerspiegelt. ""Denn wenn wir den \'dcbergang zum Energiesystem von morgen erfolgreich gestalten wollen, k\'f6nnen wir uns nicht einfach vom heutigen Energiesystem trennen. Wir m\'fcssen daf\'fcr sorgen, dass das derzeitige System effizienter und kohlenstoff\'e4rmer funktioniert. Wir sollten das Fachwissen aus dem gesamten Energiesektor nutzen, um die notwendigen L\'f6sungen f\'fcr den Klimaschutz zu finden"", sagte Dr. Al Jaber und betonte, dass das Ziel immer die Eind\'e4mmung der Emissionen und nicht der Fortschritt sein m\'fcsse. Der Abgeordnete Alok Sharma \'e4u\'dferte sich optimistisch, dass sowohl die COP27, die von \'c4gypten ausgerichtet wird, als auch die COP28 erfolgreich verlaufen werden, w\'e4hrend Sameh Shoukry betonte, dass die COP27 die erste COP in einem ""Umsetzungsjahrzehnt"" sein wird, in dem die Welt ihre gemeinsamen Anstrengungen zur Umsetzung der national festgelegten Beitr\'e4ge (NDCs) im Rahmen des Pariser Abkommens verst\'e4rkt. \'dcbersetzt von: Magdy Elserougy HYPERLINK https://wam.ae/en/details/1395303012471 https://wam.ae/en/details/1395303012471 \"

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE391","Emirados \'c1rabes Unidos endossam a Promessa dos L\'edderes pela Natureza na COP26","8 Novembro 2021 Segunda-feira","Emirates News Agency (WAM) (Portuguese)","WAM/Portuguese GLASGOW, 7 de novembro de 2021 (WAM) -- Os Emirados \'c1rabes Unidos endossaram o Compromisso dos L\'edderes pela Natureza que compromete os pa\'edses a tomar as medidas necess\'e1rias para alcan\'e7ar o desenvolvimento sustent\'e1vel e colocar a natureza e a biodiversidade em um caminho de recupera\'e7\'e3o at\'e9 2030 como parte da D\'e9cada de A\'e7\'e3o da ONU. Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, Ministro da Mudan\'e7a Clim\'e1tica e Meio Ambiente, anunciou o endosso do compromisso em um evento de alto n\'edvel intitulado ""O Caminho para o Futuro"": Colmatar a lacuna sobre a natureza da COP26 \'e0 COP15"" - um evento conjunto da Promessa dos L\'edderes pela Natureza, da High Ambition Coalition (HAC) para a Natureza e as Pessoas, e da Global Ocean Alliance. O encontro foi organizado pelos governos da Costa Rica, Fran\'e7a e Reino Unido na presen\'e7a do Presidente Carlos Alvarado Quesada da Costa Rica. Endossado pela Comiss\'e3o Europ\'e9ia e 92 pa\'edses de todas as regi\'f5es, o Compromisso dos L\'edderes pela Natureza \'e9 um compromisso com a\'e7\'f5es urgentes e transformadoras destinadas a enfrentar a perda da biodiversidade, salvaguardar o planeta e trabalhar em colabora\'e7\'e3o para alcan\'e7ar resultados positivos para a natureza, o clima e o desenvolvimento sustent\'e1vel. Ele destaca o aumento da prote\'e7\'e3o da terra e dos oceanos do planeta atrav\'e9s de \'e1reas protegidas efetivamente administradas como uma das a\'e7\'f5es para alcan\'e7ar estes objetivos. Almheiri disse: ""Os Emirados \'c1rabes Unidos est\'e3o orgulhosos de apoiar o Compromisso dos L\'edderes pela Natureza, comprometendo-se a trabalhar com outras na\'e7\'f5es para reverter a perda da biodiversidade at\'e9 2030, e enviando uma poderosa mensagem de que n\'e3o h\'e1 conflito entre a conserva\'e7\'e3o da natureza e a economia. O movimento se alinha com nossa dedica\'e7\'e3o inabal\'e1vel para proteger nosso meio ambiente e preserv\'e1-lo para as gera\'e7\'f5es futuras, incutido em nossa na\'e7\'e3o pelo fundador dos EAU, o falecido Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan"". Enfatizando a import\'e2ncia de enfrentar os duplos desafios da perda da biodiversidade e da mudan\'e7a clim\'e1tica, ela acrescentou: ""A alarmante magnitude da perda da biodiversidade pode \'e0s vezes se apresentar como um pensamento posterior no processo clim\'e1tico, e \'e9 fundamental que n\'f3s, como governos e partes interessadas, nos unamos em torno de produtos de dupla finalidade. Alinhar nossas agendas para enfrentar a perda da biodiversidade e a mudan\'e7a clim\'e1tica \'e9 a \'fanica maneira de resolv\'ea-las e tomar medidas coletivas decisivas para preservar nosso planeta e a vida nele para as gera\'e7\'f5es futuras"". O Ministro observou que as \'e1reas protegidas desempenham um papel fundamental na salvaguarda dos ecossistemas que fornecem habitats para a biodiversidade e contribuem para a mitiga\'e7\'e3o da mudan\'e7a clim\'e1tica e para a adapta\'e7\'e3o a ela. Os EAU possuem 49 \'e1reas protegidas que representam 15,5% de seu territ\'f3rio. O pa\'eds atingiu a Meta 11 de Aichi para \'e1reas protegidas terrestres que abrangem 18,4% de seu territ\'f3rio terrestre, e \'e1reas marinhas protegidas que representam 12% de seu territ\'f3rio marinho e costeiro. O Compromisso dos L\'edderes com a Natureza implica em desviar o uso da terra e as pol\'edticas agr\'edcolas das pr\'e1ticas prejudiciais ao meio ambiente para os ecossistemas terrestres e marinhos, e reduzir significativamente a polui\'e7\'e3o do ar, da terra e marinha, particularmente eliminando vazamentos de pl\'e1stico para o oceano at\'e9 2050. Ele exige uma transi\'e7\'e3o para sistemas de produ\'e7\'e3o, consumo e alimentos sustent\'e1veis que atendam \'e0s necessidades das pessoas, permanecendo dentro dos limites planet\'e1rios, e assegurando que as pol\'edticas e decis\'f5es governamentais futuras sejam fator de prote\'e7\'e3o da natureza e do meio ambiente de forma a promover a conserva\'e7\'e3o, restaura\'e7\'e3o e uso sustent\'e1vel da biodiversidade. Ao aderir ao Pledge, os pa\'edses reconhecem o papel crucial da ci\'eancia e da pesquisa na luta contra a degrada\'e7\'e3o dos ecossistemas, a perda da biodiversidade e a mudan\'e7a clim\'e1tica, e se comprometem a envolver toda a sociedade, incluindo governos, academia, empresas, finan\'e7as e comunidades locais, com foco nas mulheres e na juventude.

Falando durante uma sess\'e3o de painel virtual intitulada ""Projetando Ambi\'e7\'f5es COP atrav\'e9s da COP27 e COP28 e Prioridades de Diversifica\'e7\'e3o Econ\'f4mica P\'f3s-pand\'eamica"" na Semana de Sustentabilidade de Abu Dhabi (ADSW), Dr. Al Jaber explicou como os EAU e a regi\'e3o do Oriente M\'e9dio e do Norte da \'c1frica (MENA) podem tirar proveito do impulso \'e0 a\'e7\'e3o clim\'e1tica. O Dr. Al Jaber falou ao lado do Deputado Rt. Hon. Alok Sharma, Presidente da COP26 , e Sameh Shoukry, Ministro das Rela\'e7\'f5es Exteriores do Egito e Presidente Designado da COP27, durante a sess\'e3o moderada por Fred Kempe, Presidente e CEO do Conselho do Atl\'e2ntico. Dr. Al Jaber disse: ""Esta regi\'e3o tem vantagens espec\'edficas que podem acelerar a transi\'e7\'e3o energ\'e9tica de nossa posi\'e7\'e3o como l\'edderes energ\'e9ticos"". Em primeiro lugar, enquanto o mundo continuar a depender do petr\'f3leo e do g\'e1s, podemos assegurar o fornecimento confi\'e1vel do petr\'f3leo e do g\'e1s menos intensivos em carbono dispon\'edveis"". Estamos alavancando esta posi\'e7\'e3o para reduzir ainda mais a intensidade de carbono atrav\'e9s da expans\'e3o da primeira instala\'e7\'e3o de captura de carbono da regi\'e3o. ""Estamos tamb\'e9m construindo sobre nossas capacidades \'fanicas em hidrog\'eanio para lan\'e7ar as bases para um mercado de hidrog\'eanio de carbono zero"". E, como voc\'ea sabe, os EAU t\'eam investido no espa\'e7o solar e no espa\'e7o renov\'e1vel mais amplo durante os \'faltimos 15 anos, e estamos dobrando este investimento"". O Dr. Al Jaber apontou que globalmente, pelo menos US$ 3 trilh\'f5es ser\'e3o investidos em energia renov\'e1vel durante os pr\'f3ximos dez anos. Ele disse que isto representa uma oportunidade multi-trilh\'e3o de d\'f3lares que os EAU, a regi\'e3o e seus parceiros internacionais podem capitalizar"". ""Na verdade, este \'e9 o pensamento por tr\'e1s de nossa Iniciativa Estrat\'e9gica Net Zero. A Rede Zero, para n\'f3s, \'e9 sobre novas ind\'fastrias, novas habilidades e novos empregos. Para n\'f3s, o neg\'f3cio de enfrentar a mudan\'e7a clim\'e1tica \'e9 simplesmente um bom neg\'f3cio"". Dr. Al Jaber citou a recente parceria estrat\'e9gica entre a Abu Dhabi National Energy Company PJSC (TAQA), Mubadala Investment Company (Mubadala) e Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), que transformou a Masdar em uma central el\'e9trica global de energia limpa. Ele disse que a nova Masdar quase dobrou sua capacidade de energia renov\'e1vel e a ambi\'e7\'e3o \'e9 construir sobre esta base s\'f3lida para atingir 100 gigawatts (GW). Dr. Al Jaber pediu que os parceiros, nos setores p\'fablico e privado, se unissem aos Emirados \'c1rabes Unidos e \'e0 Masdar para atingir estes ambiciosos objetivos que levar\'e3o a novas ind\'fastrias, novas habilidades, novos empregos e novas oportunidades. Respondendo a uma pergunta sobre o resultado da COP26 (26\£a Confer\'eancia das Na\'e7\'f5es Unidas sobre Mudan\'e7a Clim\'e1tica), o Dr. Al Jaber observou que foi um sucesso, pois Glasgow uniu 90% da economia mundial no caminho para o zero l\'edquido. ""A COP 26 tamb\'e9m conseguiu lan\'e7ar muitas coaliz\'f5es entre governos e empresas para acelerar a inova\'e7\'e3o. AIM para o Clima, que os EAU lan\'e7aram com os EUA e 34 outros pa\'edses \'e9 um bom exemplo. Trata-se de uma coaliz\'e3o crescente que direciona os investimentos para a agrotecnologia a fim de reduzir as emiss\'f5es agr\'edcolas, que respondem por um ter\'e7o das emiss\'f5es globais. E criticamente a COP26 finalmente chegou a um acordo sobre o Artigo 6 do Acordo de Paris, que estabelece as bases para mercados de carbono eficazes. Tudo isso cria um grande impulso e uma grande plataforma que o Egito e os Emirados \'c1rabes Unidos podem, e v\'e3o, construir"". Na COP28, que ser\'e1 realizada em Abu Dhabi em 2023, o Dr. Al Jaber destacou que ela marcar\'e1 o primeiro balan\'e7o global que nos mostrar\'e1 como estamos caminhando em dire\'e7\'e3o aos objetivos de Paris e, criticamente, estabelecer\'e1 o roteiro para 2030 e mais al\'e9m. Ele acrescentou que os EAU j\'e1 est\'e3o trabalhando em estreita colabora\'e7\'e3o com o Reino Unido e o Egito para continuar o impulso da COP26 e prosseguiu detalhando a abordagem dos EAU \'e0 COP28. ""Queremos que Abu Dhabi esteja onde o mundo torne os compromissos em resultados concretos e ajude a levar solu\'e7\'f5es clim\'e1ticas comercialmente vi\'e1veis \'e0 escala mundial"". \'c9 por isso que queremos que a COP 28 seja o mais inclusiva poss\'edvel, refletindo as opini\'f5es dos pa\'edses desenvolvidos ao lado dos pa\'edses em desenvolvimento, dos setores p\'fablico e privado e dos cientistas e da sociedade civil"". ""Inclusivo tamb\'e9m significa incluir a expertise que existe em todo o espectro energ\'e9tico, e especificamente na ind\'fastria de hidrocarbonetos, porque se quisermos fazer uma transi\'e7\'e3o bem sucedida para o sistema energ\'e9tico de amanh\'e3, n\'e3o podemos simplesmente desconectar-nos do sistema energ\'e9tico de hoje. Precisamos fazer com que o sistema atual funcione mais eficientemente com menos carbono. Devemos aproveitar a experi\'eancia de todo o setor energ\'e9tico para encontrar as solu\'e7\'f5es clim\'e1ticas de que precisamos"", disse o Dr. Al Jaber ao enfatizar a necessidade de sempre lembrar que o objetivo \'e9 conter as emiss\'f5es, n\'e3o progredir. O deputado Alok Sharma expressou seu otimismo de que tanto a COP27, que ser\'e1 sediada pelo Egito, quanto a COP28 ser\'e3o bem sucedidas, enquanto Sameh Shoukry destacou que a COP27 ser\'e1 a primeira COP no que deveria ser uma ""d\'e9cada de implementa\'e7\'e3o"", onde o mundo intensifica seus esfor\'e7os coletivos para implementar as Contribui\'e7\'f5es Nacionalmente Determinadas (NDCs) sob o acordo de Paris.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE393","D\'f3lar firme, encuesta ISM, datos mixtos de China y COP26: 5 claves en Wall Street","1 Noviembre 2021 Lunes","Investing.com (Spanish)","Por Geoffrey Smith Investing.com - La preocupaci\'f3n por la pol\'edtica monetaria mantiene al d\'f3lar firme y a los bonos a corto plazo d\'e9biles en el inicio de una semana ajetreada de reuniones de los bancos centrales. Se publicar\'e1 la encuesta empresarial ISM, que podr\'eda reforzar las expectativas de que la Reserva Federal tenga que subir las tasas de inter\'e9s antes de lo previsto (Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) ve ahora la primera subida en julio del a\'f1o que viene). La econom\'eda china emite se\'f1ales contradictorias, pero la crisis inmobiliaria, en el mejor de los casos, se est\'e1 agravando. La conferencia sobre el clima COP26 parece destinada a ser un anticl\'edmax despu\'e9s de que los l\'edderes del G20 no se pusieran de acuerdo sobre c\'f3mo acelerar la eliminaci\'f3n del carb\'f3n, y los precios del petr\'f3leo est\'e1n subiendo antes de la reuni\'f3n de la OPEP+ de esta semana. Esto es lo que hay que saber en los mercados financieros este lunes 1 de noviembre. 1. El d\'f3lar se mantiene firme mientras Goldman advierte de una subida de tasas m\'e1s r\'e1pida Las expectativas de una pol\'edtica monetaria m\'e1s estricta est\'e1n en el centro de la mente de los inversionistas al comienzo de una semana en la que probablemente se tomen decisiones importantes para reducir el est\'edmulo que sostuvo la econom\'eda durante la pandemia. La cesta del PCE mostr\'f3 que el aumento de los precios, que se hab\'eda limitado a unos pocos sectores a principios de a\'f1o, se hab\'eda ampliado significativamente. Estos datos pueden ser corroborados o no por la encuesta manufacturera ISM, que se publicar\'e1 a las 10 AM ET (1500 GMT). La reuni\'f3n de pol\'edtica monetaria de la Fed, de dos d\'edas de duraci\'f3n, comienza el martes, y se espera que termine con un anuncio sobre la retirada progresiva de las compras de bonos del banco central, que actualmente ascienden a 120,000 millones de d\'f3lares al mes. 2. Los PMI chinos env\'edan se\'f1ales contradictorias; la crisis inmobiliaria se agrava Dos encuestas empresariales chinas muy seguidas enviaron se\'f1ales contradictorias: el \'edndice oficial de gesti\'f3n de compras(o PMI) sugiri\'f3 que la actividad manufacturera se hab\'eda contra\'eddo en octubre bajo el peso de la escasez de combustible, las medidas anticontaminaci\'f3n y las continuas interrupciones de la producci\'f3n relacionadas con el Covid-19. Sin embargo, el PMI del sector privado subi\'f3 de 50.0 a 50.6 desde septiembre, lo que ofrece cierta tranquilidad. Aun as\'ed, los rendimientos de los bonos basura subieron a su nivel m\'e1s alto desde 2009 y los Futuros del mineral de hierro cayeron hasta un 4% en medio de los continuos temores por las perspectivas del sector inmobiliario. Otro de los 20 mayores promotores por tama\'f1o, Yango Group, dijo el lunes que estaba |buscando extender el pago de tres de sus bonos en d\'f3lares, haciendo que sus acciones cayeran un 9% en Shenzhen. 3. Las acciones abrir\'e1n al alza; Coca Cola y American en el punto de mira Las acciones estadounidenses se preparan para abrir en nuevos m\'e1ximos hist\'f3ricos m\'e1s tarde, en el optimismo generalizado sobre la recuperaci\'f3n econ\'f3mica - aunque el volumen puede ser menor de lo habitual debido a la sombra proyectada por la reuni\'f3n de la Fed que se aproxima. 4. La COP26 Es probable que esa falta de unidad frustre los esfuerzos de los negociadores en la COP26 Los esfuerzos por intensificar la lucha contra el cambio clim\'e1tico se han visto desbaratados en los \'faltimos dos a\'f1os por la pandemia y por el posterior aumento de los precios mundiales de la energ\'eda, ya que la industria mundial se recuper\'f3 de ella m\'e1s r\'e1pido de lo previsto. Esto ha provocado que las emisiones de di\'f3xido de carbono vuelvan r\'e1pidamente a su tendencia anterior a la pandemia. 5. El petr\'f3leo sube antes de la reuni\'f3n de la OPEP Los precios del petr\'f3leo subieron durante la noche, apoyados por un tono ampliamente positivo en los activos de riesgo que tambi\'e9n elev\'f3 las acciones europeas a nuevos m\'e1ximos para el a\'f1o. A las 6:25 AM ET, los futuros del crudo estadounidense sub\'edan un 0.6% hasta los 84.03 d\'f3lares el barril, mientras que los futuros del Brent sub\'edan un 0.9% a 84.50 d\'f3lares el barril. El diferencial entre ambos se redujo fuertemente a finales de la semana pasada, despu\'e9s de que los datos de la Administraci\'f3n de Informaci\'f3n Energ\'e9tica mostraran un descenso de la producci\'f3n estadounidense, lo que endureci\'f3 a\'fan m\'e1s el equilibrio local entre oferta y demanda.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE396","La transizione energetica offre l'opportunit\'e0 di trasformare e diversificare l'economia, guidando al contempo la crescita globale: Sultan Al Jaber","20 Gennaio 2022 Gioved\'ec","Emirates News Agency (WAM) (Italian)","ABU DHABI, 18 gennaio 2022 (WAM) - Gli Emirati Arabi Uniti vedono la transizione energetica come un'opportunit\'e0 per trasformare e diversificare il modello di crescita economica del paese, secondo il dottor Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, ministro dell'Industria e della tecnologia avanzata e Inviato speciale per i cambiamenti climatici. Parlando durante una sessione del pannello virtuale intitolata ""Proiezione delle ambizioni della COP attraverso la COP27 e la COP28 e le priorit\'e0 della diversificazione economica post-pandemia"" alla Settimana della sostenibilit\'e0 di Abu Dhabi (ADSW), il dott. Al Jaber ha spiegato come gli Emirati Arabi Uniti, il Medio Oriente e il Nord Africa (MENA) ) la regione pu\'f2 trarre vantaggio dalla spinta all£zione per il clima. Il dottor Al Jaber stava parlando insieme al Rt. On. Alok Sharma MP, Presidente della COP26 , e Sameh Shoukry, Ministro degli Affari Esteri dell'Egitto e Presidente designato della COP27, durante la sessione moderata da Fred Kempe, Presidente e Amministratore delegato del Consiglio Atlantico. Il dott. Al Jaber ha affermato: ""Questa regione presenta vantaggi specifici che possono accelerare la transizione energetica dalla nostra posizione di leader energetici. In primo luogo, finch\'e9 il mondo continuer\'e0 a fare affidamento sul petrolio e sul gas, possiamo garantire forniture affidabili del petrolio a minore intensit\'e0 di carbonio e gas disponibile Stiamo sfruttando questa posizione per ridurre ulteriormente l'intensit\'e0 del carbonio attraverso l'espansione del primo impianto di cattura del carbonio nella regione. ""Stiamo anche costruendo sulle nostre capacit\'e0 uniche nell'idrogeno per gettare le basi per un mercato dell'idrogeno a zero emissioni di carbonio. E, come sapete, negli ultimi 15 anni gli Emirati Arabi Uniti hanno investito nel solare e nello spazio rinnovabile pi\'f9 ampio e stiamo raddoppiando su questo investimento"". Il dott. Al Jaber ha sottolineato che a livello globale, nei prossimi dieci anni saranno investiti almeno 3 trilioni di dollari in energie rinnovabili. Ha affermato che questa rappresenta un'opportunit\'e0 multimiliardaria che gli Emirati Arabi Uniti, la regione e i suoi partner internazionali possono sfruttare. ""In effetti, questo \'e8 il pensiero alla base della nostra iniziativa strategica Net Zero. Net Zero, per noi, riguarda nuove industrie, nuove competenze e nuovi posti di lavoro. Per noi, l£ttivit\'e0 di affrontare il cambiamento climatico \'e8 semplicemente un buon affare"". Il dott. Al Jaber ha citato la recente partnership strategica tra la Abu Dhabi National Energy Company PJSC (TAQA), la societ\'e0 di investimento di Mubadala (Mubadala) e la Compagnia petrolifera nazionale di Abu Dhabi (ADNOC) che ha trasformato Masdar in una centrale elettrica globale di energia pulita. Ha affermato che il nuovo Masdar ha quasi raddoppiato la sua capacit\'e0 di energia rinnovabile e l£mbizione \'e8 quella di costruire su questa solida base per raggiungere i 100 gigawatt (GW). Il dottor Al Jaber ha chiesto ai partner, nei settori pubblico e privato, di unirsi agli Emirati Arabi Uniti e a Masdar per raggiungere questi obiettivi ambiziosi che porteranno a nuove industrie, nuove competenze, nuovi posti di lavoro e nuove opportunit\'e0. Rispondendo a una domanda sull'esito della COP26 (la 26a Conferenza delle Nazioni Unite sui cambiamenti climatici), il dottor Al Jaber ha notato che \'e8 stato un successo poich\'e9 Glasgow ha unito il 90 percento dell'economia mondiale sulla strada per lo zero netto. ""La COP 26 \'e8 anche riuscita a lanciare molte coalizioni tra governi e imprese per accelerare l'innovazione. AIM for Climate, lanciato dagli Emirati Arabi Uniti con gli Stati Uniti e altri 34 paesi, \'e8 un buon esempio. Questa \'e8 una coalizione in crescita che dirige gli investimenti nell£gro-tecnologia verso ridurre le emissioni agricole, che rappresentano ben un terzo delle emissioni globali. E, in modo critico, la COP26 ha finalmente raggiunto un accordo sull£rticolo 6 dell£ccordo di Parigi, che pone le basi per mercati del carbonio efficaci. Tutto ci\'f2 crea un grande slancio e una grande piattaforma che L'Egitto e gli Emirati Arabi Uniti possono e continueranno a costruire"". Alla COP28 che si terr\'e0 ad Abu Dhabi nel 2023, Il dott. Al Jaber ha sottolineato che segner\'e0 il primo bilancio globale in assoluto che ci mostrer\'e0 come stiamo procedendo verso gli obiettivi di Parigi e, in modo critico, definir\'e0 la tabella di marcia verso 2030 e oltre. Ha aggiunto che gli Emirati Arabi Uniti stanno gi\'e0 lavorando a stretto contatto con il Regno Unito e l'Egitto per continuare lo slancio della COP26 e ha continuato descrivendo in dettaglio l£pproccio degli Emirati Arabi Uniti alla COP28. ""Vogliamo che Abu Dhabi sia il luogo in cui il mondo trasforma gli impegni in risultati concreti e aiuta a prendere soluzioni climatiche commercialmente valide per scalare in tutto il mondo. Questo \'e8 il motivo per cui vogliamo che la COP 28 sia il pi\'f9 inclusiva possibile, riflettendo le opinioni dei paesi sviluppati insieme ai paesi in via di sviluppo , il settore pubblico e privato, gli scienziati e la societ\'e0 civile"". ""Inclusivo significa anche includere l'esperienza che esiste in tutto lo spettro energetico, e in particolare l'industria degli idrocarburi, perch\'e9 se vogliamo passare con successo al sistema energetico di domani, non possiamo semplicemente staccare la spina dal sistema energetico di oggi. Dobbiamo fare in modo che il sistema attuale funziona in modo pi\'f9 efficiente con meno emissioni di carbonio. Dovremmo sfruttare le competenze di tutto il settore energetico per trovare le soluzioni climatiche di cui abbiamo bisogno"", ha affermato il dott. Al Jaber sottolineando la necessit\'e0 di ricordare sempre che l'obiettivo \'e8 limitare le emissioni, non progresso. rt. On. Alok Sharma MP ha espresso il suo ottimismo sul fatto che sia la COP27, che sar\'e0 ospitata dall'Egitto, sia la COP28 avranno successo, mentre Sameh Shoukry ha sottolineato che la COP27 sar\'e0 la prima COP in quello che dovrebbe essere un ""decennio di attuazione"", in cui il mondo intensifica il suo collettivo sforzi per attuare i contributi determinati a livello nazionale (NDC) nell£mbito dell£ccordo di Parigi.

November 2021 (WAM) -- Die Vereinigten Arabischen Emirate haben die ""Leaders' Pledge for Nature"" (Zusage der Staats- und Regierungschefs f\'fcr die Natur) unterst\'fctzt, mit der sich die L\'e4nder verpflichten, die notwendigen Schritte zu unternehmen, um eine nachhaltige Entwicklung zu erreichen und die Natur und die biologische Vielfalt bis 2030 im Rahmen der UN-Aktionsdekade auf einen Pfad der Erholung zu bringen. Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, Ministerin f\'fcr Klimawandel und Umwelt, verk\'fcndete die Unterzeichnung des Versprechens auf einer hochrangigen Veranstaltung mit dem Titel ""The Way Forward: The Way Forward: Bridging the gap on nature from COP26 to COP15"" - einer gemeinsamen Veranstaltung des Leaders' Pledge for Nature, der High Ambition Coalition (HAC) for Nature and People und der Global Ocean Alliance. Gastgeber waren die Regierungen von Costa Rica, Frankreich und dem Vereinigten K\'f6nigreich in Anwesenheit des costaricanischen Pr\'e4sidenten Carlos Alvarado Quesada. Das von der Europ\'e4ischen Kommission und 92 L\'e4ndern aus allen Regionen unterst\'fctzte Leaders' Pledge for Nature ist eine Verpflichtung zu dringenden und umw\'e4lzenden Ma\'dfnahmen, die darauf abzielen, den Verlust der biologischen Vielfalt zu bek\'e4mpfen, den Planeten zu sch\'fctzen und zusammenzuarbeiten, um positive Ergebnisse f\'fcr die Natur, das Klima und die nachhaltige Entwicklung zu erzielen. Als eine der Ma\'dfnahmen zur Erreichung dieser Ziele wird die Verbesserung des Schutzes von Land und Ozeanen durch effektiv verwaltete Schutzgebiete hervorgehoben. Almheiri sagte: ""Die VAE sind stolz darauf, den Leaders' Pledge for Nature zu unterst\'fctzen und sich zu verpflichten, mit anderen Nationen zusammenzuarbeiten, um den Verlust der biologischen Vielfalt bis 2030 umzukehren, und ein deutliches Signal zu senden, dass es keinen Konflikt zwischen Naturschutz und Wirtschaft gibt. Dieser Schritt steht im Einklang mit unserem unersch\'fctterlichen Engagement f\'fcr den Schutz unserer Umwelt und deren Erhaltung f\'fcr k\'fcnftige Generationen, das der Gr\'fcndervater der VAE, der verstorbene Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, unserer Nation eingeimpft hat."" Sie betonte, wie wichtig es ist, die doppelte Herausforderung des Verlusts der biologischen Vielfalt und des Klimawandels anzugehen, und f\'fcgte hinzu: ""Das alarmierende Ausma\'df des Verlusts der biologischen Vielfalt kann im Klimaprozess manchmal wie ein nachtr\'e4glicher Gedanke erscheinen, und es ist entscheidend, dass wir als Regierungen und Interessengruppen uns um die doppelte Zielsetzung bem\'fchen. Nur wenn wir unsere Agenden zur Bek\'e4mpfung des Verlusts der biologischen Vielfalt und des Klimawandels aufeinander abstimmen, k\'f6nnen wir beide Probleme l\'f6sen und gemeinsam entschlossen handeln, um unseren Planeten und das Leben auf ihm f\'fcr k\'fcnftige Generationen zu bewahren."" Der Minister wies darauf hin, dass Schutzgebiete eine Schl\'fcsselrolle bei der Sicherung von \'d6kosystemen spielen, die Lebensr\'e4ume f\'fcr die biologische Vielfalt bieten und zur Eind\'e4mmung des Klimawandels und zur Anpassung an diesen beitragen. In den VAE gibt es 49 Schutzgebiete, die 15,5 Prozent der Landesfl\'e4che ausmachen. Das Land hat das Aichi-Ziel 11 f\'fcr terrestrische Schutzgebiete erreicht, die 18,4 Prozent der Landfl\'e4che ausmachen, und f\'fcr Meeresschutzgebiete, die 12 Prozent der Meeres- und K\'fcstenfl\'e4che ausmachen. Das Versprechen der Staats- und Regierungschefs f\'fcr die Natur beinhaltet die Abkehr von umweltsch\'e4dlichen Praktiken bei der Fl\'e4chennutzung und in der Landwirtschaft f\'fcr Land- und Meeres\'f6kosysteme sowie eine deutliche Verringerung der Luft-, Land- und Meeresverschmutzung, insbesondere durch die Beseitigung von Plastik, das bis 2050 ins Meer gelangt. Sie fordert einen \'dcbergang zu nachhaltigen Produktions-, Konsum- und Lebensmittelsystemen, die die Bed\'fcrfnisse der Menschen befriedigen und gleichzeitig innerhalb der planetarischen Grenzen bleiben, und stellt sicher, dass k\'fcnftige Regierungspolitiken und -entscheidungen den Natur- und Umweltschutz in einer Weise ber\'fccksichtigen, die die Erhaltung, Wiederherstellung und nachhaltige Nutzung der biologischen Vielfalt f\'f6rdert. Mit dem Beitritt zu dem Versprechen erkennen die L\'e4nder die entscheidende Rolle von Wissenschaft und Forschung im Kampf gegen die Zerst\'f6rung von \'d6kosystemen, den Verlust der biologischen Vielfalt und den Klimawandel an und verpflichten sich, die gesamte Gesellschaft einzubeziehen, einschlie\'dflich der Regierungen, der Wissenschaft, der Wirtschaft, der Finanzwelt und der lokalen Gemeinschaften, wobei der Schwerpunkt auf Frauen und Jugendlichen liegt. \'dcbersetzt von: Adel Abdel Zaher.

L'enqu\'eate ISM sur les entreprises est attendue et pourrait renforcer les attentes de la R\'e9serve f\'e9d\'e9rale, qui devrait relever ses taux plus t\'f4t que pr\'e9vu (Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) pr\'e9voit d\'e9sormais une premi\'e8re hausse d\'e8s juillet de l£nn\'e9e prochaine). L'\'e9conomie chinoise envoie des signaux mitig\'e9s, mais la crise de l'immobilier se poursuit - au mieux -. La conf\'e9rence sur le climat COP26 semble devoir \'eatre un \'e9chec, les dirigeants du G20 n£yant pas r\'e9ussi \'e0 se mettre d£ccord sur la mani\'e8re d£cc\'e9l\'e9rer l'\'e9limination progressive du charbon, et les prix du p\'e9trole sont en hausse avant la r\'e9union de l'OPEP+ de cette semaine. Voici ce qu'il faut savoir sur les march\'e9s financiers ce lundi 1er novembre. 1. Le dollar se maintient, Goldman pr\'e9voyant des hausses de taux plus rapides Les attentes d'un resserrement de la politique mon\'e9taire sont au c ur des pr\'e9occupations des investisseurs \'e0 l£ube d'une semaine qui devrait \'eatre marqu\'e9e par des d\'e9cisions importantes visant \'e0 r\'e9duire les mesures de relance qui ont soutenu l'\'e9conomie pendant la pand\'e9mie. Le Dollar am\'e9ricain consolide pr\'e8s des sommets qu'il a atteints vendredi apr\'e8s que des donn\'e9es aient montr\'e9 que les prix des d\'e9penses personnelles des consommateurs - la mesure de l'inflation privil\'e9gi\'e9e par la R\'e9serve f\'e9d\'e9rale - a augment\'e9 de 4,4 % par an, le taux le plus \'e9lev\'e9 depuis des ann\'e9es. En r\'e9action, les rendements obligataires am\'e9ricains \'e0 deux ans ont d\'e9pass\'e9 0,5 % pour la premi\'e8re fois en 19 mois, tandis que les analystes de Goldman Sachs ont revu \'e0 la hausse leur pr\'e9vision de la premi\'e8re hausse des taux de la Fed d'un an, \'e0 juillet 2022. Le panier PCE a montr\'e9 que les augmentations de prix, qui avaient \'e9t\'e9 confin\'e9es \'e0 quelques secteurs plus t\'f4t dans l£nn\'e9e, s'\'e9taient consid\'e9rablement \'e9largies. Ces donn\'e9es peuvent ou non \'eatre corrobor\'e9es par l'enqu\'eate sur l'industrie manufacturi\'e8re de l'ISM, attendue \'e0 15h00. La r\'e9union de politique g\'e9n\'e9rale de deux jours de la Fed commence mardi et devrait se terminer par une annonce sur la r\'e9duction progressive des achats d'obligations de la banque centrale, qui s'\'e9l\'e8vent actuellement \'e0 120 milliards de dollars par mois. 2. Les indices PMI de la Chine envoient des signaux mitig\'e9s ; la crise de l'immobilier se poursuit Deux enqu\'eates de conjoncture chinoises tr\'e8s surveill\'e9es ont envoy\'e9 des signaux mitig\'e9s, l'indice officiel des directeurs d£chat sugg\'e9rant que l£ctivit\'e9 manufacturi\'e8re s'est contract\'e9e en octobre sous le poids des p\'e9nuries de carburant, des mesures anti-pollution et des perturbations de la production li\'e9es \'e0 Covid-19. Toutefois, l'indice PMI du secteur priv\'e9 Caixin est pass\'e9 de 50,0 \'e0 50,6 en septembre, ce qui est rassurant. Malgr\'e9 cela, les rendements des obligations de pacotille ont atteint leur plus haut niveau depuis 2009 et les futures sur le minerai de fer ont chut\'e9 jusqu'\'e0 4 % en raison des craintes persistantes concernant les perspectives du secteur immobilier. Un autre promoteur immobilier parmi les 20 premiers par la taille, Yango Group, a d\'e9clar\'e9 lundi qu'il cherchait \'e0 prolonger le paiement de trois de ses obligations en dollars, ce qui a fait chuter ses actions de 9 % \'e0 Shenzhen. Ailleurs en Asie, le Nikkei a progress\'e9 de plus de 2% en r\'e9action \'e0 l'emphatique victoire \'e9lectorale du nouveau Premier ministre japonais Fumio Kishida, qui a rapidement promis un programme de relance \'e0 grande \'e9chelle. Les chiffres du commerce ext\'e9rieur de la Cor\'e9e du Sud ont montr\'e9 que les exportations ont augment\'e9 de 24% sur l£nn\'e9e, un peu moins que pr\'e9vu. 3. Les actions US devraient ouvrir en hausse ; Coke, American en ligne de mire Les actions am\'e9ricaines devraient ouvrir \'e0 de nouveaux sommets plus tard, gr\'e2ce \'e0 un optimisme g\'e9n\'e9ralis\'e9 concernant la reprise \'e9conomique - m\'eame si le volume pourrait \'eatre plus faible que d'habitude en raison de l'ombre port\'e9e de la r\'e9union de la Fed qui approche. Vers 12h05, les Dow Jones futures \'e9taient en hausse de 154 points, soit 0,4%, tandis que les S&P 500 futures \'e9taient \'e9galement en hausse de 0,4% et les Nasdaq 100 futures de 0,3%. Parmi les valeurs susceptibles de faire l'objet d'une attention particuli\'e8re, citons Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) et PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), apr\'e8s que le Wall Street Journal a rapport\'e9 que Coke allait acheter le reste du fabricant de boissons sportives BodyArmor, intensifiant ainsi ses efforts pour contester la domination de Gatorade de Pepsi. L£ttention se portera \'e9galement sur American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), dont le programme de vols du week-end a \'e9t\'e9 perturb\'e9 par les conditions m\'e9t\'e9orologiques et le manque de personnel, et sur la plateforme de jeux Roblox (NYSE:RBLX), qui a \'e9t\'e9 touch\'e9e par une longue panne au cours du week-end. 4. La COP26 Le charbon vit pour combattre un autre jour, apr\'e8s que le groupe des leaders du G20 des pays industrialis\'e9s et \'e9mergents n£ pas r\'e9ussi \'e0 se mettre d£ccord sur de nouvelles propositions visant \'e0 l'\'e9liminer progressivement du mix \'e9nerg\'e9tique mondial lors de leur r\'e9union de samedi. Ce manque d'unit\'e9 risque de contrarier les efforts des n\'e9gociateurs de la conf\'e9rence COP26 Les efforts visant \'e0 intensifier la lutte contre le changement climatique ont \'e9t\'e9 d\'e9sorganis\'e9s au cours des deux derni\'e8res ann\'e9es par la pand\'e9mie et par la flamb\'e9e subs\'e9quente des prix mondiaux de l'\'e9nergie, l'industrie manufacturi\'e8re mondiale s'en \'e9tant remise plus rapidement que pr\'e9vu. Les \'e9missions de dioxyde de carbone ont ainsi rapidement retrouv\'e9 leur niveau d£vant la pand\'e9mie. 5. Le p\'e9trole pousse \'e0 la hausse avant la r\'e9union de l'OPEP+ Les prix du p\'e9trole brut ont augment\'e9 dans les \'e9changes de la nuit, soutenus par un ton largement positif dans les actifs \'e0 risque qui a \'e9galement port\'e9 les actions europ\'e9ennes \'e0 de nouveaux sommets pour l£nn\'e9e. \'c0 12h25, les contrats \'e0 terme sur le brut am\'e9ricain \'e9taient en hausse de 0,6 % \'e0 84,03 $ le baril, tandis que les contrats \'e0 terme sur le brent \'e9taient en hausse de 0,9 % \'e0 84,50 $ le baril. L'\'e9cart entre les deux s'est fortement r\'e9duit \'e0 la fin de la semaine derni\'e8re, apr\'e8s que les donn\'e9es de l'Energy Information Administration ont montr\'e9 une baisse de la production am\'e9ricaine, resserrant encore l'\'e9quilibre local entre l'offre et la demande. Des rapports continuent de circuler sur la r\'e9union de l'OPEP+ de jeudi, mais une augmentation de la production au-del\'e0 des 400 000 barils par jour d\'e9j\'e0 pr\'e9vus semble peu probable : Le Joint Technical Committee de l'OPEP a r\'e9duit ses pr\'e9visions pour la demande de 2021 la semaine derni\'e8re, tout en laissant inchang\'e9es ses pr\'e9visions pour 2022.

Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, ministro dei cambiamenti climatici e dell£mbiente, ha annunciato l£pprovazione dell'impegno in un evento di alto livello intitolato ""La via da seguire: colmare il divario sulla natura dalla COP26 alla COP15"" - un evento congiunto dell'impegno dei leader per Nature, la Coalizione Alta Ambizione (HAC) per la Natura e le Persone e l'Alleanza oceanica globale. L'incontro \'e8 stato ospitato dai governi di Costa Rica, Francia e Regno Unito alla presenza del presidente del Costa Rica Carlos Alvarado Quesada. Approvato dalla Commissione europea e da 92 paesi di tutte le regioni, l'Impegno dei leader per la natura \'e8 un impegno per azioni urgenti e di trasformazione volte ad affrontare la perdita di biodiversit\'e0, salvaguardare il pianeta e lavorare in modo collaborativo per ottenere risultati positivi per la natura, il clima e la sostenibilit\'e0 sviluppo. Evidenzia l£umento della protezione della terra e degli oceani del pianeta attraverso aree protette efficacemente gestite come una delle azioni per raggiungere questi obiettivi. Almheiri ha dichiarato: ""Gli Emirati Arabi Uniti sono orgogliosi di sostenere l'Impegno dei leader per la natura, impegnandosi a lavorare con altre nazioni per invertire la perdita di biodiversit\'e0 entro il 2030 e inviando un messaggio potente che non vi \'e8 alcun conflitto tra la conservazione della natura e l'economia. La mossa \'e8 in linea con la nostra incrollabile dedizione alla protezione del nostro ambiente e alla preservazione per le generazioni future, instillata nella nostra nazione dal padre fondatore degli Emirati Arabi Uniti, il defunto sceicco Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan"". Sottolineando l'importanza di affrontare le duplici sfide della perdita di biodiversit\'e0 e del cambiamento climatico, ha aggiunto: ""L'entit\'e0 allarmante della perdita di biodiversit\'e0 pu\'f2 talvolta essere considerata un ripensamento nel processo climatico, ed \'e8 fondamentale che noi, come governi e parti interessate, ci uniamo alla duplice - obiettivi finali.

Il paese ha raggiunto l'obiettivo 11 di Aichi per le aree protette terrestri che coprono il 18,4 percento del suo territorio terrestre e le aree marine protette che rappresentano il 12 percento del suo territorio marino e costiero. L'Impegno dei leader per la natura comporta lo spostamento dell'uso del suolo e delle politiche agricole dalle pratiche dannose per l£mbiente per gli ecosistemi terrestri e marini e la riduzione significativa dell'inquinamento atmosferico, terrestre e marino, in particolare eliminando le perdite di plastica nell'oceano entro il 2050.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE402","VAE stellen Klimasicherheit in den Mittelpunkt der globalen Sicherheitsagenda","Mittwoch 9 M\'e4rz 2022","Emirates News Agency (WAM) (German)","NEW YORK, USA, 9. M\'e4rz 2022 (WAM) -- Die Vereinigten Arabischen Emirate (VAE) haben im Einklang mit der weitsichtigen Vision ihrer F\'fchrung einen partnerschaftlichen Ansatz gew\'e4hlt, der sich auf die Finanzierung von Projekten in L\'e4ndern konzentriert, die am st\'e4rksten von Klimarisiken betroffen sind, da die Klimafinanzierung ein nachhaltiges Wirtschaftswachstum erm\'f6glichen und gleichzeitig Frieden und Stabilit\'e4t f\'f6rdern kann, so Dr. Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister f\'fcr Industrie und Hochtechnologie und Sonderbeauftragter f\'fcr Klimawandel. In seiner Er\'f6ffnungsrede auf einer Sitzung des Sicherheitsrats der Vereinten Nationen zum Thema Klimafinanzierung zur Erhaltung von Frieden und Sicherheit erkl\'e4rte Dr. Al Jaber, dass die VAE \'fcber 1 Milliarde Dollar an Klimahilfe f\'fcr mehr als 40 L\'e4nder bereitgestellt haben, wobei der Schwerpunkt auf Inselstaaten und am wenigsten entwickelten L\'e4ndern liegt. Er f\'fcgte hinzu, dass die VAE in den letzten Jahren auch mehrere Milliarden Dollar f\'fcr Katastrophen- und Konflikthilfe zur Verf\'fcgung gestellt haben, bei denen die Klimaauswirkungen eine Rolle spielen. Die Arria-Sitzung, ein informelles Treffen der Mitglieder des Sicherheitsrates, wurde von Dr. Al Jaber geleitet. Botschafterin Lana Nusseibeh, St\'e4ndige Vertreterin der VAE bei den Vereinten Nationen, hielt die Er\'f6ffnungsrede des Treffens, an dem auch Botschafter Mohamed Abushahab, stellvertretender St\'e4ndiger Vertreter der VAE bei den Vereinten Nationen, teilnahm. In seiner Rede stellte Dr. Al Jaber fest, dass geopolitische Spannungen den internationalen Frieden und die Stabilit\'e4t gef\'e4hrden. W\'e4hrend sich die Welt mit diesen Herausforderungen auseinandersetze, d\'fcrfe man andere bestehende und neue Bedrohungen, die unsere kollektive Sicherheit untergraben, nicht aus den Augen verlieren. Die Erfahrungen der VAE im Bereich der Klimafinanzierung zeigen, dass die Betrachtung von Klimama\'dfnahmen durch die Linse des internationalen Friedens und der Sicherheit die Finanzierung auf vorrangige Sektoren wie die Nahrungsmittel- und Wassersicherheit ausrichten kann, so Dr. Al Jaber. Er erl\'e4uterte, dass dies eines der Ziele der Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for Climate) sei, einer Initiative, die die VAE im vergangenen Jahr zusammen mit 38 L\'e4ndern ins Leben gerufen haben, um die Investitionen in landwirtschaftliche Innovationen - von d\'fcrreresistentem Saatgut bis hin zu wassersparender vertikaler Landwirtschaft - zu erh\'f6hen. In seiner Rede vor W\'fcrdentr\'e4gern wie John Kerry, dem Sondergesandten des US-Pr\'e4sidenten f\'fcr Klimafragen, und Alok Sharma, dem Pr\'e4sidenten der COP26 , forderte Dr. Al Jaber einen integrativen Ansatz, der Frauen st\'e4rkt und sicherstellt, dass die Klimafinanzierung bei der Finanzierung von Projekten zu einer gerechten nachhaltigen Entwicklung beitr\'e4gt. ""Eine faire und ausgewogene Klimafinanzierung wird alle Gemeinschaften kurzfristig widerstandsf\'e4higer machen und eine Friedensdividende bis weit in die Zukunft hinein bringen"". Dr. Al Jaber bekr\'e4ftigte die Bedeutung der Klimafinanzierung im Kampf gegen den Klimawandel und forderte die internationale Gemeinschaft auf, mehr f\'fcr die Unterst\'fctzung der Entwicklungsl\'e4nder zu tun. ""Die Klimafinanzierung ist eines der wichtigsten Instrumente zur Bew\'e4ltigung der Klimarisiken"". ""Dennoch"", so Dr. Al Jaber, ""bleibt die internationale Gemeinschaft weiterhin hinter den 100 Milliarden Dollar zur\'fcck, die den Entwicklungsl\'e4ndern vor \'fcber einem Jahrzehnt zugesagt wurden. Viele L\'e4nder, die auf der Tagesordnung des Rates stehen, sowie L\'e4nder, die vom Anstieg des Meeresspiegels betroffen sind, betonen, dass dieser Betrag allein nicht ausreichen wird"". Dr. Al Jaber betonte: ""Eine solide, nachhaltige und ehrgeizige Klimafinanzierung ist ein entscheidender Faktor f\'fcr weitere Fortschritte beim Klimaschutz und bei der Risikominderung."" Er f\'fcgte hinzu, dass ""ein besserer Zugang zu garantierten Finanzmitteln entscheidend ist"". Als verantwortungsbewusster globaler Partner haben sich die VAE verpflichtet, die L\'e4nder zu unterst\'fctzen, die dem Klimarisiko am st\'e4rksten ausgesetzt sind, sagte Dr. Al Jaber und wies auf das Ausma\'df der klimatischen Herausforderung hin. ""Der j\'fcngste Bericht des IPCC (Intergovenmental Panel on Climate Change) unterstreicht das Ausma\'df der Herausforderung und stellt fest, dass bis zu 3,6 Milliarden Menschen durch die Auswirkungen des Klimawandels gef\'e4hrdet sind, insbesondere in fragilen Staaten. Die Klimaauswirkungen sind eine Frage von Frieden und Sicherheit. Diese Auswirkungen werden wahrscheinlich zu erheblichen Vertreibungen und zum Wettbewerb um Ressourcen f\'fchren und k\'f6nnten, wenn sie nicht angegangen werden, die Ursache f\'fcr viele k\'fcnftige Konflikte sein. Dr. Al Jaber erkannte an, dass der Bericht einige ermutigende Zeichen des Fortschritts enth\'e4lt, auf denen wir in den kommenden Monaten und Jahren aufbauen k\'f6nnen, sowie einen Plan, wie wir unsere am meisten gef\'e4hrdeten Gemeinschaften sch\'fctzen und st\'e4rken k\'f6nnen. Er wies auch darauf hin, dass auf der COP26 (26. Klimakonferenz der Vereinten Nationen) 90 % der Weltwirtschaft auf einen Netto-Null-Entwicklungspfad ausgerichtet wurden, und forderte einen \'e4hnlichen Schritt bei der Anpassung, insbesondere f\'fcr die am meisten gef\'e4hrdeten Gemeinschaften. Zum Abschluss seiner Ausf\'fchrungen rief Dr. Al Jaber dazu auf, Sicherheits- und Klimastrategien in fragilen L\'e4ndern besser aufeinander abzustimmen. ""Wir wissen, dass das Klima nicht immer ein Faktor f\'fcr die Sicherheit ist. Aber wir wissen auch, dass wir in fragilen L\'e4ndern, die mit Klimarisiken konfrontiert sind, die Sicherheits- und Klimastrategien umso besser aufeinander abstimmen k\'f6nnen, je mehr wir diese Risiken mindern, die Widerstandsf\'e4higkeit st\'e4rken und das nachhaltige Wirtschaftswachstum beschleunigen k\'f6nnen."" Weitere W\'fcrdentr\'e4ger, die an dem Treffen teilnahmen, waren Osama Mahmoud, St\'e4ndiger Vertreter &Auml;gyptens bei der UNO; Dr. Mohamed Mubarak bin Dana, Sonderbeauftragter f\'fcr Klimaangelegenheiten f\'fcr Bahrain; Jennifer Morgan, Sonderbeauftragte f\'fcr internationale Klimaschutzma\'dfnahmen f\'fcr Deutschland; Barbara Pompili, Ministerin f\'fcr \'f6kologische Umstellung f\'fcr Frankreich; Chet Greene, Minister f\'fcr ausw\'e4rtige Angelegenheiten, Einwanderung und Handel f\'fcr Antigua und Barbuda; Ahmed Khaleel, Staatsminister f\'fcr Ausw\'e4rtige Angelegenheiten der Malediven; Nafisah Abubakar, Leiterin des Sekretariats f\'fcr die Energiesicherheit von Frauen im l\'e4ndlichen Raum (RUWES); Yannick Glemarec, Exekutivdirektor des Green Climate Fund, sowie Minister und Botschafter aus aller Welt.

"COP26","UAE","COP26_UAE406","Os EAU colocam a seguran\'e7a clim\'e1tica no centro da agenda de seguran\'e7a global","10 Mar\'e7o 2022 Quinta-feira","Emirates News Agency (WAM) (Portuguese)","NOVA YORK, EUA, 9 de mar\'e7o de 2022 (WAM) -- Os Emirados \'c1rabes Unidos (EAU), em linha com a vis\'e3o de longo prazo de sua lideran\'e7a, adotaram uma abordagem de parceria que se concentra no financiamento de projetos em pa\'edses mais expostos a riscos clim\'e1ticos, uma vez que o financiamento clim\'e1tico pode permitir o crescimento econ\'f4mico sustent\'e1vel enquanto promove a paz e a estabilidade, de acordo com o Dr. Sult\'e3o Ahmed Al Jaber, Ministro da Ind\'fastria e Tecnologia Avan\'e7ada e Enviado Especial para a Mudan\'e7a Clim\'e1tica. Fazendo os coment\'e1rios de abertura em uma reuni\'e3o do Conselho de Seguran\'e7a das Na\'e7\'f5es Unidas sobre Financiamento Clim\'e1tico para Sustentar a Paz e a Seguran\'e7a, Dr. Al Jaber explicou que os EAU forneceram mais de US$ 1 bilh\'e3o em ajuda clim\'e1tica a mais de 40 pa\'edses, com um foco especial em na\'e7\'f5es insulares e menos desenvolvidas. Ele acrescentou que os Emirados \'c1rabes Unidos tamb\'e9m forneceram v\'e1rios bilh\'f5es de d\'f3lares nos \'faltimos anos em ajuda em desastres e conflitos, onde os impactos clim\'e1ticos s\'e3o um fator que contribui para isso. A reuni\'e3o Arria-F\'f3rmula, uma reuni\'e3o informal dos membros do Conselho de Seguran\'e7a, foi presidida pelo Dr. Al Jaber. A Embaixadora Lana Nusseibeh, Representante Permanente dos EAU junto \'e0 ONU, proferiu os coment\'e1rios de abertura na reuni\'e3o que contou com a presen\'e7a do Embaixador Mohamed Abushahab, Representante Permanente Adjunto dos EAU junto \'e0 ONU. Durante seu discurso, o Dr. Al Jaber observou que as tens\'f5es geopol\'edticas est\'e3o desafiando a paz e a estabilidade internacionais. Ele disse que enquanto o mundo lida com estes desafios, n\'e3o devemos perder de vista outras amea\'e7as existentes e emergentes que minam nossa seguran\'e7a coletiva. A experi\'eancia dos EAU no financiamento do clima ressalta que, quando apropriado, ver a a\'e7\'e3o clim\'e1tica atrav\'e9s da lente da paz e seguran\'e7a internacional pode visar o financiamento em setores priorit\'e1rios como a seguran\'e7a alimentar e da \'e1gua, de acordo com o Dr. Al Jaber. Ele explicou que este \'e9 um dos objetivos da Miss\'e3o de Inova\'e7\'e3o Agr\'edcola para o Clima (AIM for Climate), uma iniciativa que os EAU lan\'e7aram no ano passado junto com 38 pa\'edses para aumentar os investimentos em inova\'e7\'e3o agr\'edcola, desde sementes resistentes \'e0 seca at\'e9 uma agricultura vertical eficiente em termos de \'e1gua. Dirigindo-se a dignit\'e1rios, incluindo John Kerry, Enviado Presidencial Especial dos EUA para o Clima, e The Rt. Hon. Alok Sharma, Presidente da COP26 , Dr. Al Jaber apelou para uma abordagem inclusiva que empodere as mulheres e assegura que o financiamento do clima contribua para o desenvolvimento sustent\'e1vel eq\'fcitativo ao financiar projetos. ""O financiamento justo e equilibrado do clima tornar\'e1 todas as comunidades mais resilientes a curto prazo e trar\'e1 um dividendo de paz para o futuro"". Reiterando a import\'e2ncia do financiamento clim\'e1tico na luta contra a mudan\'e7a clim\'e1tica, o Dr. Al Jaber exortou a comunidade internacional a fazer mais para apoiar as na\'e7\'f5es em desenvolvimento. ""O financiamento clim\'e1tico \'e9 uma das ferramentas mais importantes para gerenciar os riscos clim\'e1ticos"". No entanto"", observou o Dr. Al Jaber, ""a comunidade internacional continua a ficar aqu\'e9m da promessa de financiamento clim\'e1tico de US$ 100 bilh\'f5es feita \'e0s na\'e7\'f5es em desenvolvimento h\'e1 mais de uma d\'e9cada"". Muitos pa\'edses na agenda do Conselho, bem como pa\'edses afetados pela eleva\'e7\'e3o do n\'edvel do mar, enfatizam que este montante, por si s\'f3, ser\'e1 insuficiente"". O Dr. Al Jaber enfatizou ""o financiamento clim\'e1tico robusto, sustentado e ambicioso \'e9 um capacitador cr\'edtico do progresso cont\'ednuo do clima e da redu\'e7\'e3o de riscos"". Ele acrescentou que ""um maior acesso ao financiamento garantido \'e9 fundamental"". Como um parceiro global respons\'e1vel, os EAU est\'e3o empenhados em apoiar os pa\'edses mais expostos ao risco clim\'e1tico, disse o Dr. Al Jaber, ao apontar a escala do desafio clim\'e1tico. ""O \'faltimo relat\'f3rio do IPCC (Painel Intergovernamental sobre Mudan\'e7as Clim\'e1ticas) destaca a escala do desafio, afirmando que at\'e9 3,6 bilh\'f5es de pessoas s\'e3o agora altamente vulner\'e1veis aos efeitos das mudan\'e7as clim\'e1ticas, particularmente em estados fr\'e1geis. Os impactos clim\'e1ticos s\'e3o uma quest\'e3o de paz e seguran\'e7a"". Esses impactos provavelmente provocar\'e3o deslocamentos e competi\'e7\'e3o significativos sobre os recursos e, se n\'e3o forem tratados, poder\'e3o ser a fonte de muitos conflitos futuros"". O Dr. Al Jaber reconheceu que o relat\'f3rio fornece alguns sinais encorajadores de progresso a serem seguidos nos pr\'f3ximos meses e anos e um plano de como podemos proteger e fortalecer nossas comunidades mais vulner\'e1veis. Ele tamb\'e9m observou que a COP26 (26\£a Confer\'eancia das Na\'e7\'f5es Unidas sobre Mudan\'e7a Clim\'e1tica) alinhou 90% da economia global em um caminho de desenvolvimento l\'edquido zero e apelou para uma mudan\'e7a semelhante na adapta\'e7\'e3o, particularmente para as comunidades mais em risco. Concluindo suas observa\'e7\'f5es, o Dr. Al Jaber apelou para um maior alinhamento entre as estrat\'e9gias de seguran\'e7a e clim\'e1ticas em pa\'edses fr\'e1geis. ""Sabemos que o clima nem sempre \'e9 um fator de seguran\'e7a. Mas tamb\'e9m sabemos que quanto mais pudermos alinhar as estrat\'e9gias de seguran\'e7a e clim\'e1ticas em pa\'edses fr\'e1geis que enfrentam riscos clim\'e1ticos, mais poderemos mitigar esses riscos, refor\'e7ar a resili\'eancia e acelerar o crescimento econ\'f4mico sustent\'e1vel"". Outros dignit\'e1rios presentes na reuni\'e3o incluem Osama Mahmoud, Representante Permanente do Egito junto \'e0 ONU; Dr. Mohamed Mubarak bin Dana, Enviado Especial para Assuntos Clim\'e1ticos do Bahrein; Jennifer Morgan, Enviada Especial para a A\'e7\'e3o Clim\'e1tica Internacional da Alemanha; Barbara Pompili, Ministra da Transi\'e7\'e3o Ecol\'f3gica da Fran\'e7a; Chet Greene, Ministro das Rela\'e7\'f5es Exteriores, Imigra\'e7\'e3o e Com\'e9rcio de Ant\'edgua e Barbuda; Ahmed Khaleel, Ministro de Estado das Rela\'e7\'f5es Exteriores das Maldivas; Nafisah Abubakar, Chefe da Secretaria de Seguran\'e7a Energ\'e9tica das Mulheres Rurais (RUWES); Yannick Glemarec, Diretor Executivo do Fundo Verde do Clima, bem como ministros e embaixadores de todo o mundo.

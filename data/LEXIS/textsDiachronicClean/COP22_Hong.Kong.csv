"COP22","Hong.Kong","COP22_Hong.Kong1","Clouds in the desert: A letter from the climate talks in Marrakesh","November 19, 2016 Saturday","Hong Kong Free Press","The World Meteorological Organization announced last Monday that 2016 will very likely be the hottest year on record. We certainly felt that in Hong Kong. Summer 2016 had more hot weather days than any previous year, and there were periods this year when the burning red arrow \' very hot\' icon on the Hong Kong Observatory website became the norm rather than the exception. Appropriately, as the news of record temperatures emerges, thousands of government climate negotiators are meeting this week in Marrakesh, Morocco, just north of the Sahara desert,\~ for the UN climate negotiations known as COP22 . COP22 is billed as the action meeting, attempting to turn the intentions of the Paris Agreement into practical plans as fast as possible. The head of the UN climate talks declared the meeting was to create a  new era of international climate action. One minister went as far as saying that this will be the first time an international meeting  sets out to build a new civilization. While the Paris climate talks focused on a single culminating deal, in Marrakesh they diverge into multiple strands of parallel talks on different aspects of making the Paris Agreement real.\~ These include setting out a rulebook for all countries to use in making their national climate plans, how we can\~ finance the green transition, how we will develop and coordinate valuable scientific research, how we will build capacity and skills to enable progress everywhere, and what we will do to help countries already suffering loss and damage. Finally, there are meetings on how we will measure, verify and report all the other stuff in order to make sure no one is cheating. Photo: Flickr via UNclimatechange. Given the complexity of the process, there is a danger that the talks may instead go down in memory as the  petty procedural talks, at which every step to realise the Paris Agreement got bogged down in a swamp of minor issues and vested interests. Some of the core Paris Agreement working groups are not getting as far as setting their own terms of reference, instead announcing that these or other essential groundwork discussions  will continue at the next meeting. \~ There are reports of slow progress in discussions on how to plan an effective  facilitative dialogue to ensure the 2018 COP achieves the intentions of the Paris Agreement \- a clear case of  talks about talks. There are bright spots. Capacity building work to help countries make decent climate plans is progressing. There was agreement on the terms of reference for the committee to push this work forward and so work can begin next year.

Other good news includes the launch of the  2050 Pathway Platform that allows countries and non-state groups (which can include cities like Hong Kong) to share their climate plans and swap more detailed ideas about effective policies and practices. Hanging over the climate talks is the Trump cloud, a dark shadow bearing down on us with a rumbling sound. Everyone is speculating over the severity of the storm it will bring, and to what degree it could wash away vital climate progress. Believers say that the Paris Agreement is built to withstand periods of bad weather. Optimists say that Trump will realise the pragmatic path to making America great again will be investment in greener infrastructure. Political analysts say that a US withdrawal will enable China to take greater leadership of global climate change processes. Pessimists are muttering in the corridors about Armageddon.

These were put forward by most countries before the Paris talks last year. Everyone accepts that these initial pledges are not enough; adding up to a level of warming dangerously above two degrees. Yet a year later, none of the representatives at COP22 are offering improvement, except for dear Argentina, which began a review process to upgrade its commitment right after Paris. In UN language, what we need is  enhanced ambition for reducing emissions, for adapting to the effects of climate change, and for providing funding to help the less-developed countries do both of these things. A key part of increasing ambition on climate action is the switch to renewable energy. The subject crops up in the majority of the official and side meetings where governments, regions and cities announce their targets for renewables. Scientists and economists are here explaining why the switch to renewables is not only vital, but can bring the benefit of growth and jobs. Global Climate March in Hong Kong. Photo: Apple Daily. One group of cities has announced that they will achieve 80% renewable energy by the year 2020. When those of us from Hong Kong are asked what our city target is on renewables, we can only sigh with embarrassment and confess that our shiny modern city with its massive financial sector has a renewables target of one percent. We need to ratchet up ambition on emissions and efficiencies, and we do need to redesign the way the world designs, finances, builds, manufactures, travels and trades. Many experienced commentators, such as Lord Nicholas Stern, author of the landmark Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, say that we have a limited window of opportunity in the next few years,\~ while interest rates remain low, to take bold action on investment in new infrastructure to tackle climate change. The scientists and the economists are hammering the point that if we don\' t do more now, we will pay a huge cost of catching up later in terms of not only economic costs, but also social and humanitarian costs.

"COP22","Hong.Kong","COP22_Hong.Kong2","Scorching summers set to become the norm, warns expert","August 5, 2016 Friday","EJ Insight","It is getting common nowadays to see news reports warning us that temperatures in Hong Kong will keep hitting new highs during the summer months and also more frequently than ever before. For instance, the city recently experienced its hottest July day in 48 years, with several districts recording temperatures of 37 degrees Celsius and higher. Gabriel Lau Ngar-cheung, AXA Professor of Geography and Resource Management and director of the Institute of Environment, Energy and Sustainability at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, says that despite the record temperatures most Hong Kong people still seem unconcerned about climate change and appear to have\~low environmental awareness. With worsening global warming, Hong Kong could see summer temperatures of 40\'b0C in future, while also facing the prospect of more fierce rainstorms and stronger typhoons, Lau warned. ""Though it is highly related to people's livelihood, the public doesn't seem to grasp the impact of climate change when they are told that global temperature has increased by two or three degrees Celsius,"" he says. ""However, it will be much easier to conceptualize\~if we warn that the number of hot nights in the city will surge in the near future."" Hot nights, by definition, refer to days with a minimum temperature of 28\'b0C or above. ""Forty or fifty years ago, there were only three or four hot nights in summer on average, but now such nights are up more than 10-fold, with 30 to 40 such nights annually in recent years,"" the professor says. When the Hong Kong Observatory was first established in 1883, the set record of a severe rainstorm yielded only a few dozen millimeters in an hour. But now, we often hear something like 150 millimeters within an hour, Lau added. It is necessary to reduce emissions to alleviate climate change, he said, arguing that such initiative works like insurance. The 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference was regarded as a historic turning point, as the participating 195 countries agreed by consensus to reduce their carbon output ""as soon as possible"". Lau says it can serve as a good start, but warned that even if every participant delivers on their promise, it is unlikely to keep global warming ""to well below 2 degrees Centigrade"". What also worries him is that Hong Kong is rather unprepared for coping with climate change. Outlining a series of potential problems associated with global warming, Lau warned that senior citizens and those with respiratory illnesses will suffer most amid rising temperatures. Also, there is the prospect of electricity black-outs as households and offices use air-conditioning for long hours, putting a huge strain on energy resources. In terms of public health, the city's healthcare system could come under stress due to epidemics caused by tropically active insects as they thrive in Hong Kong due to increased temperatures. Among other potential problems, Hong Kong may also need to brace for potential floods in the city's underground railway system and places in low-lying coastal areas. Lau says there is a lot that Hong Kong can do to safeguard its environment, an aspect that hasn't received enough care over the years. Citing an example, he pointed out that waste-sorting efforts have been too slow in the city and that many items that can be recycled are instead ending up at landfills. The society as a whole must develop greater environmental awareness, with each citizen making a conscious effort to go green in their daily lives, Lau said. Only through a concerted drive can we ensure a more sustainable future for our city, he said. This article appeared in the Hong Kong Economic Journal on Aug. 2.
